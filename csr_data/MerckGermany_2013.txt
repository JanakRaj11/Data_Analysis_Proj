 letter from karlludwig kley




letter from karlludwig kley
ladies and gentlemen dearest friends of merck
the term responsibility originates from the latin word respondere which means
to respond or reply today companies are required more than ever to respond to
certain questions how are they contributing to society and the environment how
do they treat the people who work for and with them

taking responsibility means responding to questions

we at merck are deeply engaged in these questions to us they have always been
part of our entrepreneurial approach responsibility is one of the six merck values
that guide our actions each and every day we have thus been supporting the
united nations global compact and its principles since 2005 which cover human
rights labor standards the environment and anticorruption

in 2011 we refined our corporate responsibility strategy which comprises three
spheres of activity people products and the environment here are some select
examples of our engagement

 1     with our innovative products we are helping to resolve global challenges such as climate change and a energy
        scarcity for instance the innovative liquid crystals from merck enable computer displays and televisions to
        consume significantly less electricity in addition to this we are bolstering the health care systems in developing
        countries and emerging markets through a multitude of activities as an example we have developed a mini
        laboratory to detect counterfeit medicines thus facilitating access to health
 2     our engagement in climate protection represents one expression of our responsibility for the environment we aim
        to reduce our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by 20 by 2020 measured against the 2006 baseline
        in order to reach this goal we are instituting groupwide measures through our edison program such as the
        construction of a biomass power plant at our goa india site through the edison projects we aim to prevent 64000
        metric tons of co2 emissions per year

 3     one way in which we take on responsibility for people is as an employer one of our primary focuses over the last
        several years has been to continually improve occupational safety through targeted programs we promote
        workforce diversity and are aiming for a 2530 increase in the percentage of management positions held by
        women by 2016 we also demonstrate our social engagement through our fight against the neglected tropical
        disease schistosomiasis in africa which we are combating in collaboration with the world health organization
        who since starting the merck praziquantel donation program in 2007 we have donated over 100 million
        praziquantel tablets to treat more than 28 million children in 2012 we decided to increase the number of tablets
        donated tenfold in the medium term

merck has been listed in the ftse4good sustainability index since 2008 in the 2012 access to medicine index we went up
nine places to eighth place as in the previous years we have received various awards for both our innovative products as
well as for our performance as an employer

corporate responsibility is part of our daily conduct and thus a fundamental prerequisite for our business success only a
healthy company that operates sustainably can contribute as an employer taxpayer and corporate citizen to a functioning
society through our fit for 2018 efficiency and growth program which we announced at the end of 2011 we are
ensuring that we can continue to do so also in the future

in 2018 we want to be a company that is synonymous with innovation quality and sustainability a company that
continues to be recognized for performance efficiency and the career opportunities that it offers around the world a
company that is respected for its values its culture and for its constantly responsible conduct

 company values and external initiatives


since the company was founded nearly 350 years ago merck has had a solid tradition of taking responsibility in the long
term and supporting sustainability we will carry this tradition on and continue to respond to questions of responsibility in
the future as well

sincerely




karlludwig kley
chairman of the merck executive board




company values and external initiatives
mercks corporate culture has always been characterized by responsible behavior 
whether with respect to our products our employees the environment or society
our approach and our conduct have evolved from a history dating back nearly 350
years they are derived from our mission statement and our values and shaped by
the external initiatives that we support

our aim is to operate as a global company that creates added value for consumers
our market partners and the community and that helps them lead better lives we
strive to achieve positive recognition for merck in the community and are
committed to operating safely and respecting the environment

our conduct is founded on our values  courage achievement responsibility
respect integrity and transparency they underpin our daily work and our
interactions with our customers and business partners we view open honest
communication internally and externally as an essential trustbuilding element

furthermore merck supports relevant initiatives by other organizations concerning for responsible corporate governance

      merck has been participating in the united nations global compact since 2005 and has expressed its commitment to
      comply with the compacts ten principles regarding human rights labor standards environmental protection and
      anticorruption in our annual global compact communication on progress we explain how we incorporate the ten
      principles into our business processes
      in 2006 merck signed the responsible care global charter adopted by the international council of chemical
      associations icca within the scope of this voluntary initiative and of the resulting guidelines of the german
      responsible care program  we have committed ourselves to defining standards in the areas of product
      responsibility environmental protection health plant safety and security that go beyond legal obligations in
      particular merck is currently focusing on product safety environmental protection and occupational safety
      merck signed the code of responsible conduct for business in 2010 this code is the result of an initiative of
      german companies with the aim of firmly establishing measurable standards with respect to fair competition social
      partnership merit and sustainability at the involved companies

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                        10
 human rights


in 2012 we contributed to the policy paper das nachhaltigkeitsverst√§ndnis der deutschen chemiebranche the
understanding of sustainability within the german chemical industry in which three partners formulated their common
understanding of sustainability the german chemical industry association vci the german employers federation of the
chemical industry bavc and the german mining chemical and energy industrial union ibbce the aim of this special
sustainability initiative is to

 1     expand the position of the chemical industry as a key industry of the german economy for sustainable development
 2     continue to create attractive working conditions in the chemical industry
 3     create a climate of transparency and trust through active open dialogue with government business and society

our corporate mission statement our values and these external initiatives result in requirements for responsible corporate
governance that we incorporate into both our corporate responsibility strategy and our groupwide guidelines these
guidelines include the merck social charter and the code of conduct as well as other topicspecific corporate
principles policies and standards in this way we provide our employees with the support they need to implement the above
stated requirements in their daily work and thus put them to practice within the company




human rights
mercks corporate culture has always been characterized by responsible behavior  whether with respect to products
employees the environment or society consequently merck is committed to upholding human rights within its sphere of
influence and welcomes the guiding principles for business and human rights adopted by the un human rights council
in 2011 this set of principles created a global framework for countries to protect human rights and for companies to respect
these rights by setting forth key principles in their business practices

countries are obliged to establish a regulatory framework for protecting human rights for global companies it is important
that this be implemented in the various countries in order to create uniform competitive conditions for all companies

the duty of companies is to uphold and respect human rights they must not violate any human rights in the course of their
activities furthermore companies must fulfill their responsibility by acting with the necessary due diligence which includes
identifying and managing risks


human rights risk assessment
in exercising this due diligence we conducted a human rights risk assessment in 2012 with the support of external
specialists the goal was to identify the risks to human rights resulting from our activities as a global pharmaceutical
chemical and life science company in the process we identified a number of areas where merck has made significant
progress with regard to respecting and complying with human rights for example in the prevention of product misuse as
well as the associated health hazards on the other hand we also determined areas where we can further improve the
existing regulations and processes with regard to human rights as a result we defined three highpriority action areas

 1     merck places high demands on its suppliers with regard to compliance with social and ecological standards we
        refine and enhance our supplier management process in order to adhere more closely to environmental compliance
        and social standards in our supply chain worldwide and to prevent violations this is particularly a challenge beyond
        the first supplier
 2     merck always abides by the highest legal ethical and scientific standards in all clinical trials whether in
        industrialized or developing countries whether multinational or multicentric however we held a discussion with
        independent experts on our merck bioethics advisory board concerning the topic of clinical trials in resourcepoor
        countries this revealed that regardless of our high standards additional aspects must be addressed in developing
        countries for example one aspect is an effective risk analysis conducted with due diligence of the contract parties
        participating in the trials
 3     merck would like to make further progress in the area of access to health for example we are expanding our
        research program within the scope of the merck praziquantel donation program a partnership with the world health
        organization who to combat the worm disease schistosomiasis we are now working to develop a pediatric tablet
        formulation for preschool children a previously untreated age group furthermore we plan to establish an overall
        management process for access to health

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                         11
 responsible care


the corporate responsibility committee has decided to develop a comprehensive human rights policy the aim is to increase
awareness of the topic within merck and to identify companyspecific risks more accurately

merck is a member of the human rights peer learning group within the german global compact network the purpose of
this working group is the mutual exchange of experiences and best practices related to the topic of business and human
rights




responsible care
the responsible care principles of the chemical industry constitute an important
external guideline for our sector of industry the responsible care global charter
was adopted by the international council of chemical associations icca in 2006
and was used as a basis for the principles of the german responsible care program
the charter and the responsible care program both aim to continually improve
performance by the chemical industry with regard to product safety environmental
protection health plant safety and security responsible care focuses on
voluntary cooperation with government bodies and other stakeholders that goes far
beyond complying with statutory regulations

all of mercks responsible care activities are founded on internal guidelines such
as the corporate ehs policy and the merck group ehs security and quality manual in implementing the responsible care
global charter we are currently focusing in particular on the topics of product safety environmental protection and
occupational safety

our activities in the area of product safety cover a range of measures including the implementation of regulatory
requirements such as reach and ghs voluntary initiatives such as our global product strategy  and sustainable product
development one example of this is the green 3 concept for liquid crystal products

within the scope of our broadbased company environmental protection activities we are currently focusing on climate
protection we want to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20 by 2020 measured against the 2006 baseline other
core topics are water and wastewater material consumption and recycling as well as biodiversity process safety has
traditionally had high priority at merck  both in economic and ecological terms as well as to protect our employees it
comprises the planning construction normal operation modification and shutdown of production facilities and warehouses

integrated occupational safety encompasses the prevention of workplace accidents workplacerelated illnesses and
workplacerelated health hazards our goal redefined in 2010 is to reduce the lost time injury rate ltir  the number of
workplace accidents resulting in lost time per one million working hours to 25 by 2015

corporate security is an integral element of our daily work that serves to protect intellectual and material assets as well as
mercks reputation with respect to external threats in addition to handling securityrelated incidents corporate security also
works to establish preventive mechanisms in relevant units the merck corporate security policy defines the
responsibilities and objectives of corporate security for the company corporate security audits the merck legal entities
regularly in order to identify optimization potential corporate security focuses on areas such as productrelated crime cyber
crime and intellectual property protection

          business success                           essential to this goal               example for ethical conduct


mankind is confronted with major global issues such as climate change the increasing demand for affordable renewable
energy and a growing need for access to health  especially in emerging and developing countries  and the prevention of
greenhouse gas emissions we are aware that our business operations impact our environment and the people around us
however we also believe that responsible company management makes a contribution toward resolving global challenges
helps ensure viability and increases mercks acceptance in society

but what does responsible company management mean for merck what topics are especially relevant to merck locally and
globally what impact do our business operations have on people and the environment what solutions to social challenges
do our stakeholders expect what risks do these solutions entail  and what opportunities what goals should we achieve in
the coming months and years

to answer these questions in 2011 we revised the merck corporate responsibility cr strategy based on our corporate
strategy our cr strategy covers the three action areas products the environment and people important main topics are
innovations and global trends energy and climate ethics eg human rights and animal welfare and our social engagement
the diagram above provides an overview of the strategic approaches and relevant topics which are explained in detail in
other sections of this report


cr organization
implementation and review of the cr strategy are steered by the groupwide cr committee which consists of
representatives from mercks divisions as well as from relevant group functions such as environment health safety security

committee which was established in 2011 prior to that the executive board regularly handled topics related to corporate
responsibility kley became chairman of the cr committee in march 2013

 legend          achieved     in progress       not achieved    new goal




compliance
first and foremost responsible entrepreneurial conduct means legally compliant
conduct all activities of merck must comply with statutory rules and regulations
worldwide violations might not only entail legal prosecution but could also
seriously harm mercks corporate reputation meaning its standing as a business
partner or employer therefore compliance with statutory rules and regulations has
top priority for merck compliance for merck also means acting in accordance with
the ethical principles defined in the merck values merck wants to do good
business that is operate profitably but at the same time also meet high ethical
standards


globally binding rules of conduct
the merck code of conduct is a compulsory set of rules for all merck employees it explains the principles for interacting
with business associates general partners colleagues and employees as well as with the communities in which we operate
thus it supports all employees in acting ethically  not only in their interactions with one another but also outside the
company

the merck social charter supplements the code of conduct with globally valid principles regarding human rights as well as
the core labor standards of the international labour organization ilo the managing directors of our legal entities are
responsible for ensuring that these principles are adhered to we also expect our business partners worldwide to follow these
principles


compliance organization
we support compliance with statutory and companyinternal rules and regulations through our compliance organization the
central group function compliance with the group compliance officer gco and other specialists is responsible for
maintaining and further developing the compliance program

in the legal entities abroad local compliance officers are responsible for implementing the compliance measures they are
advised by the merck group function and provided with training documentation among other forms of support the
approximately 80 local compliance officers at this time report to the gco at regular intervals the gco in turn reports at least
once a year to the executive board with a focus on the status of compliance activities compliance risks and serious
compliance violations the executive board informs the supervisory bodies at least once a year about the key compliance
issues

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                      14
 compliance



central speakup line
all employees are called upon to report compliance violations to their supervisor legal hr or other relevant departments
employees can report violations by telephone or via a webbased application in their respective national language free of
charge and anonymously via the speakup line a central reporting system

the received reports are reviewed by the gco and submitted to the compliance committee for coordinating the necessary
investigation of the facts the compliance committee consists of senior representatives of the internal auditing compliance
group security and human resources departments it monitors the processing of reported incidents and initiates if
necessary corresponding corrective measures disciplinary actions are also taken where needed against the employee who
has violated a compliance rule these actions may range from a simple warning up to dismissal of the employee depending
on the severity of the violation

altogether 29 compliancerelated reports were received via the speakup line in 2011 and 20 in 2012 in five cases each in
2011 and 2012 the alleged violation of our rules of conduct was confirmed most cases were undisclosed conflicts of
interest between employees and third parties this led to disciplinary actions in two cases the behavior of our business
partners did not meet our expectations with respect to compliant and responsible business conduct for this reason we
terminated the business relationship in both cases


compliance audits
the group compliance function conducts audits in cooperation with internal auditing the audits focus on the existence and
quality of compliance guidelines processes and structures in addition our sites are reviewed for violations of our code of
conduct and social charter the topic of corruption and the requirements of the social charter are an integral part of our
standard audit program and are audited within the scope of general audits at our sites altogether 28 audits were conducted
to check for corruption in 2011 and 40 in 2012 in addition a total of 26 sites in 26 countries were audited on social
charter topics in 2011 and 40 sites in 35 countries were audited in 2012 during the audits violations of working hour
regulations were found in one case management at the site took measures to prevent such violations in the future


compliance training courses
our regular compliance training provided as classroom and online courses has a high priority employees at all levels of the
hierarchy are trained in topics related to the code of conduct such as corruption competition law and handling conflicts of
interest employees are sensitized to the consequences of compliance violations and are shown ways to avoid them the
training plan is regularly updated and adapted in response to new developments for example a corresponding course was
added in 2011 as a result of the uk bribery act depending on the course content some courses on specific topics are
offered only to employees above a certain global grade

altogether 29597 employees participated in 82597 online courses on various compliance topics in 2012 and 19263
employees participated in 34433 courses in 2011 in addition numerous classroom courses on compliance topics were held
worldwide in order to provide employees with effective training on local topics in particular

many of the online courses dealt with anticorruption we trained 22890 employees on anticorruption in 2012 and
13399 employees in 2011 this included 10164 employees with management responsibility in 2012 and 7540 employees
with management responsibility in 2011

 guidelines and management systems



guidelines and management systems
we use a structured guideline system to translate our values and mission statements into concrete terms the purpose is to
ensure that all employees know the relevant rules and can apply them in the workplace proven management systems
ensure that the processes relevant to our cr strategy are steered and monitored systematically


groupwide guideline system
the groupwide guideline system contains all company guidelines and explains which guidelines apply to which parts of the
company they range from the charters and principles valid for the entire company to specific standards and procedures for
divisions and legal entities of the merck group or for individual sites

the charters and principles include for example the merck code of conduct      the merck social charter    and the access
to health charter 

examples of policies in the company are the corporate ehs policy  valid throughout the group which establishes the
framework for principles strategies and organizational structures for environment health and safety at merck our animal
welfare policy  which describes the treatment of laboratory animals throughout the company and our guidelines for stem
cell and fertility research which define the ethical framework for our research and development departments

in addition we have numerous other divisionspecific policies such as the safety policy for chemical products with which
we have established global processes for defining steering and implementing product safety as well as the corresponding
management structures

our standards specify in concrete terms the provisions from charters principles and policies for the persons responsible for
the operational processes in the area of company environmental protection for example we have standards for protecting
water managing waste and ensuring warehouse and transport safety for pharmaceutical marketing for instance a
standard exists that defines the groupwide specifications for product advertising and sponsoring

the rules are kept uptodate by the relevant departments and are available on the intranet managers are responsible for
implementation in their respective areas of responsibility our employees receive information and training regarding rules
that apply to them in this way we ensure that they are familiar with both the overarching rules from the charters and
principles as well as the concrete specifications that affect their individual range of activities

 stakeholder dialogue



cr management systems
the guideline system that we use to implement corporate responsibility in the merck group is integrated into our
management systems with the help of these systems we set and steer goals actions and responsibilities in key action
areas our management systems are based on standards such as the internationally recognized iso 9001 and 13458
standards for quality management the latter specifically for medical devices gxp guidelines for good working practices in
the pharmaceutical industry and iso 14001 environmental management the iso 14001 environmental management
system and the iso 9001 quality management systems are certified at regular intervals by an independent auditing firm
merck holds group certificates for the quality and environmental management systems

other management systems also exist such as the groupwide occupational health and safety management system as well
as local systems at the sites examples of local management systems include wastewater waste and energy management


program for continuous process improvement
operational excellence is the groupwide program merck introduced in 2006 to continuously improve entrepreneurial
processes the purpose of operational excellence is to achieve the most economic and efficient level of operation in all our
production facilities operational excellence calls for a working culture that enables continuous improvement and
performance enhancement for this purpose we leverage the expertise and knowledge of our employees

operational excellence is a continuous process a program that consists of an annual cycle of four stages selfassessment
and analysis goalsetting best practice sharing and implementation of improvement measures

the program is divided into six management fields goals change management production logistics innovationtechnology
and employees these fields in turn contain different bricks including the merck values employee development safety
culture and ehs that can be supplemented as needed each year top management defines groupwide priorities for
implementing the bricks in recent years the program has focused primarily on the globalization of structures and processes
and efficiency improvements for instance during the 20112012 period the topic of utility management with emphasis
on energy management became mandatory to support achievement of our climate protection target our individual sites
can additionally define their own priorities




stakeholder dialogue
our business operations intersect the interests of many people the dialogue with
relevant stakeholder groups is therefore of fundamental importance to us these
stakeholders include our employees our business partners the merck family
investors regulatory agencies associations neighbors in the vicinity of our sites
and nongovernmental organizations ngos this continuous exchange enables us
to demonstrate how we live the merck values and to show the cr strategy we have
chosen to pursue this dialogue should also convey our esteem for our stakeholders
we strive to sustain and build trust and  wherever possible  harmonize divergent
interests our primary goal is for merck to ensure public acceptance

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                       17
 stakeholder dialogue



merck stakeholder




topicspecific dialogues
we have contact with many groups in society through our daily work the dialogues are mostly organized and held directly
by the specialist departments at merck merck also becomes involved by collaborating in industryspecific networks and
participating in relevant specialist conventions

during the 20112012 period dialogues were held especially on the topics of access to health in developing health care
systems and bioethics the latter subject was primarily discussed by the new merck bioethics advisory panel mbap which
was founded in 2011 moreover we also initiated exchange with the relevant players in the public and private sectors for
example in 2011 and 2012 merck invited internationally renowned experts from science and ngos to debate on the global
challenges facing access to health the dialogues focused on initiatives of the legal entities of the merck group that aim to
improve access to health in developing health care systems the dialogues also addressed the role of pricing in access to
health in developing health care systems the increasingly stricter requirements of government and society on
pharmaceutical companies and possible alliances and partnerships


discussion and information forums
we have set up discussion and information forums for local residents at our large sites for example with the public planning
forum that we have held annually at our company headquarters in darmstadt since 1994 we aim to provide residents with
the opportunity to obtain information and discuss our development at the site the fit for 2018 efficiency program was the
focus of the discussions in 2011 and 2012 in addition we discussed the dismantling construction and renovation of
buildings participation in a city anniversary sponsoring in the neighborhood and vocational training at merck

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                        18
 stakeholder dialogue


in the context of expanding our biotech production facilities in corsiersurvevey switzerland discussions were started with
ngos and the local authorities to ensure the greatest possible transparency during the entire planning construction and
completion stages for construction merck committed to implementing high environmental and safety standards going
beyond the statutory requirements the annual forum was also continued after the construction project was completed it
provides an opportunity for regular discussions and reviews of the implementation of agreed measures and is scheduled to be
held again in 2013 because merck presents the plans transparently and implements the agreed measures on schedule trust
was established and the discussions were therefore positive in 2012 we completed the agreed landscape design which an
independent expert rated as positive


stakeholder surveys
we survey our employees customers and other relevant stakeholder groups regularly on how they view mercks
performance with regard to corporate responsibility and what expectations they have for systematic dialogue on the cr
topics in focus in total 85 stakeholders participated in our online survey in summer 2012 in addition 14 select experts
were surveyed by phone besides mercks performance in terms of cr the current relevance of cr topics and our last cr
report were evaluated the feedback was highly positive the respondents gave merck a rating of good or very good for cr
performance in the area of product responsibility the main areas of focus for this cr report were also derived from the
survey results

at merck millipore questions on the strategic direction of the division with regard to sustainability are also discussed with
customers and representatives from ngos and from science in the sustainability stakeholder advisory group ssag 


lobbying and working with associations
part of our stakeholder dialogue is also to participate actively in the political process where we become involved and present
our positions and viewpoints  either in direct dialogue with politicians or via our work with associations examples of
important national and international industry associations in which we hold positions include

      the german chemical industry association verband der chemischen industrie  vci
      the european chemical industry council conseil europ√©en des f√©d√©rations de lindustrie chimique  cefic           
      the german association of researchbased pharmaceutical manufacturers verband forschender
      arzneimittelhersteller  vfa 
      the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations efpia        
      the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers  associations ifpma          

examples of positions    accepted by members of our executive board

      in october 2012 karlludwig kley chairman of the executive board was elected as president of the vci he is also
      the vice president of the federation of german industry bundesverband der deutschen industrie ev  bdi 
      stefan oschmann executive board member responsible for the merck serono and consumer health divisions is vice
      president of the ifpma and a board member of the vfa
      bernd reckmann executive board member responsible for the performance materials and merck millipore divisions is
      chairman of the hessian chapter of the vci

furthermore merck is active in numerous charitable organizations such as the goethe institute the remembrance
responsibility and future foundation and the world environment center wec in addition we participate in initiatives and
projects whose other participants share our standards of entrepreneurial conduct for instance we support the code of
responsible conduct for business during the 20112012 period intensely discussed topics in the scope of our work with
associations included in particular the responsible care initiative the new chemicals legislation reach  and counterfeit
medicines

products




                 our success and our future are founded on innovative products that benefit people and help improve qua
                 lity of life merck products are highly trusted worldwide  whether our innovative medicines of chemical
                 or biological origin our overthecounter products our liquid crystals for lc displays merck pigments for
                 the coatings plastics and printing industries products for the cosmetics industry or customeroriented lab
                 solutions for the life science industry

                 responsibility for our products will always be at the core of our corporate responsibility here we are
                 driven by our ethical standards as well as our high expectations for our products in terms of safety and
                 environmental compatibility

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                         20
 sustainable products




sustainable products
responsibility for our products is at the core of our corporate responsibility we
therefore strive to minimize the impact our products have on people and the
environment during their development manufacture and distribution as well as
during and after their use this includes providing comprehensive information on
responsible safe and proper use of those products it is however also crucial to
conserve resources and minimize the generation of emissions and waste

through our products we are helping to overcome global challenges such as
climate change and energy scarcity our specialty chemicals help our customers
save energy liquid crystals lcs provide computer monitors and televisions with
high picture quality while also consuming little energy our materials for psva polymerstabilized vertical alignment
technology help significantly reduce the amount of background lighting needed which is the largest power consumer in
these devices new potential applications for lcs are smart windows they let more solar heat inside in winter less in
summer organic lightemitting diodes oleds make it possible to produce energyefficient displays with brilliant colors and
sharp picture quality in october 2012 merck strengthened its partnership with epson a japanese printer manufacturer our
common goal is the mass production of largesurface oled displays modern light sources such as lightemitting diodes
leds and organic lightemitting diodes oleds are key technologies that will make it possible to decrease the energy
consumption of lighting our printable structuring materials are enabling the photovoltaics industry to manufacture solar
cells in a more environmentally sound way while improving their efficiency

we strive to continuously enhance the sustainability footprint of our products
developing suitable product and process innovations in order to do so and we are       20
working to offer our customers products that enable them to reduce the impact of
                                                                                        displays use 20 less energy thanks
their own activities as well as achieve their own sustainability goals one example is
                                                                                        to innovative liquid crystals from
the green 3 program of the performance materials division with which we help           merck for psva technology in
customers develop energyefficient lcds oleds and leds the concept has been           comparison to va technology
extended to include our portfolio of cosmetic pigments and cosmetic actives it
covers various areas such as the sustainable procurement and production of
cosmetic ingredients as well as the optimization of the related production processes in dialogue with our customers from the
cosmetics industry we also develop proposals for cosmetic formulations that meet strict sustainability criteria and are in line
with the current trend toward more natural cosmetics several of our products have recently been certified by ecocert an
independent organization that represents high international standards for environmentally sustainable products


analysis as a prerequisite for improvement
in order to reduce the unwanted effects of our products we must understand our products across their life cycle which is
why we perform corresponding analyses

in some cases we investigate the complete life cycle cradle to grave in other cases we focus on parts of the cycle
through the cradletogate approach meaning that we analyze the rd phase of a product up to the point of delivery to
the customer sometimes we concentrate on particular aspects such as greenhouse gas emissions water consumption or
packaging the results of the analyses show us where we have potential for improvement our experts from rd product
management quality procurement and other units can use these data as a basis to develop specific measures and
initiatives across the entire product life cycle they furthermore engage in an exchange of relevant best practices and ideas
we share the results of our analyses with our customers as well

we have calculated the product carbon footprint for pearlluster pigments and liquid crystal mixtures as well as the product
water footprint for liquid crystal mixtures using the cradetogate approach our customers utilize these data to calculate
footprints for their products since our performance materials are only present in the end product in minute amounts our
contribution to the end products footprint is generally very minor

in the 20112012 period merck millipore conducted a life cycle assessment that was reviewed by experts it also developed
a methodology for evaluating various waste disposal solutions and calculated more than 20 carbon footprints for individual
products

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                      21
 access to health our approach



sustainability even at the product development stage
we lay the cornerstone for our products sustainability during the product development phase we have implemented various
guidelines in order to reduce potentially negative effects such as our groupwide product safety chemicals policy in our
performance materials division we adhere to the halogenfree policy of our customers and have implemented the green
product policy among other things this forbids the use of acutely toxic mutagenic or otherwise severely hazardous
substances that remain present in the end product we furthermore ensure that our products adhere to national and
international regulations such as reach and rohs as well as fulfill other industry and customerspecific requirements

in addition to this we have developed systems within the merck group that incorporate sustainability criteria into the
product development process in our performance materials division we have introduced a structured analysis of the
ecological impact of the products from the business unit advanced materials called the innosessment this analysis is
conducted during the development stage in 2011 and 2012 we analyzed more than 100 products with regard to toxicity
the substitution of critical reagents and other aspects

as part of the design for sustainability program the merck millipore division has developed a number of tools to drive
sustainability across the product development process one example is a scorecard which identifies key health and
environmental impacts in certain life cycle stages as well as opportunities for improvement this program is especially aimed
at reducing our customers own environmental impact including their carbon footprint and water use

in order to improve resource efficiency we examine different materials for our product packaging to determine which ones
are best suited to the task

we help our customers avoid generating waste and offer takeback and recycling programs


conscientious production processes
efficient processes make economic sense and are good for the environment in our operational processes mandatory
standards apply groupwide to ensure resource conservation and avoid negative environmental impact in order to reduce
greenhouse emissions during the manufacture of our products we have set a groupwide climate protection goal and are
making good progress toward achieving this goal




access to health our approach
we want to improve the access to health care for underserved populations as a
pharmaceutical chemical and life science company we provide innovative
products and services to improve the quality of human life we are committed to
the safe and appropriate use of and access to merck medicines and health solutions

we acknowledge that not only medicines are lacking in the poorest countries of the
world there is also a great need for doctors and medical personnel to administer
them there is often no refrigerated storage or suitable infrastructure for the
transport and distribution of medicines furthermore clean drinking water and basic
sanitation are often unavailable or difficult to access

improving access to health care therefore poses a complex challenge it involves factors such as development and health
policy health system infrastructure and distribution systems trained health workers pricing and appropriate use of
medicines as well as adequate sustainable funding

in order to achieve universal access to highquality safe medicines and sustainable solutions for patients in developing
health care systems all the relevant stakeholders  both governmental and nongovernmental  must pool their efforts
share their knowledge and expertise and work together to develop creative ideas

since we consider it important to have a wideranging holistic perspective our programs refer to access to health not
merely access to medicines working at the interface of medicines diagnostics nutritional supplements and chemicals we
utilize our expertise and core competencies in order to promote access to health

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                     22
 access to health our approach


in doing so we set ourselves high ethical standards in accordance with the charters guidelines and principles of our
company all legal entities and employees of the merck group are part of our groupwide commitment to increasing access
to health through our programs and charter on access to medicines in developing countries  we strive to lead and form
partnerships to improve global access to medicine thereby improving the lives of patients

the charter covers the following topics pharmaceutical donations and philanthropy research and development for neglected
tropical diseases ntds product pricing intellectual property and anticounterfeiting measures


governance
merck is working on a longterm strategy for access to health solutions including medicines devices eg rebismart
easypod nutritional supplements eg probiotics diagnostics minilab guava muse as well as capacity building in
doing so we are working in partnership with key stakeholders from both public and private sectors to improve access to
health care

the strategy is defined by a multidisciplinary steering committee that is chaired by stefan oschmann the executive board
member responsible for the merck serono and consumer health divisions decisions made by the committee are
implemented by an adhoc access to health task force that was founded in 2011 this task force also defines objectives and
develops indicators in order to gauge and assess the progress of the strategy the executive board at merck maintains the
overall responsibility for our access to health charters and initiatives


access to medicine index
every two years the access to medicine index rates pharmaceutical companies           2012
in terms of their contributions to improving access to medicines in developing
health care systems this index aims to increase transparency as well as to
sustainably improve access to health merck ranked eighth in 2012 nine places
                                                                                       8th place

stakeholder dialogue
in order to make informed decisions merck interacts with stakeholders such as patient groups government representatives
employees nongovernmental organizations ngos practicing doctors private donors and experts on topics that are
relevant to access to health we believe that all those involved must work together in order to achieve sustainable
improvements in this area

furthermore the continuous dialogue provides us with valuable feedback on our activities and programs

the following events represent prime examples of constructive discussions and engagement in 2012

 1     at the united to combat neglected tropical diseases event hosted in london by the bill  melinda gates foundation
        in january 2012 merck jointly signed the london declaration along with twelve other leading pharmaceutical
        companies the world health organization who and key global health stakeholders on this occasion merck
        announced a tenfold increase in the amount of praziquantel donated annually and to continue the donation
        program until schistosomiasis has been eliminated
 2     at the end of september 2012 experts from who the bill  melinda gates foundation and the british parliament
        as well as representatives from the pharmaceutical industry convened in berlin to discuss the progress and

 access to health philanthropy and product donations


        donation programs to eliminate neglected tropical diseases
 6     at the geneva health forum in april 2012 merck organized a panel session on schistosomiasis  new perspectives
        for elimination and control of a chronic disease
 7     in september 2012 merck sponsored a symposium on the diagnosis of schistosomiasis at the international
        conference on schistosomiasis in belo horizonte brazil
 8     merck contributed to the global conference on neglected tropical diseases held jointly by the world bank and the bill
         melinda gates foundation in november 2012 in washington dc the event aimed following the london
        declaration to strengthen collaboration among all key players and stakeholders in the global health sector in the
        fight against neglected tropical diseases
 9     in partnership with efpia merck is actively engaged in the preparation of the strategic research agenda for edctpii
        european and developing countries clinical trials partnership in order to include ntds in addition to tb malaria
        and hivaids
10     in 2011 a merck representative was the key note speaker at the global health progress meeting that took place in
        geneva on the eve of the 65th world health assembly this meeting between african health authorities and the
        private sector aimed to discuss innovative publicprivate partnerships to improve childrens health in africa
11     our regional head for north and west africa discusses access to health with local stakeholders such as
        pharmacovigilance organizations local who representatives health authorities and education representatives




access to health philanthropy and product donations
product donations and philanthropic activities are not standalone initiatives to us they are part of a broader holistic
approach we support awareness and education programs as well as capacity and infrastructure building in developing
countries in order to ensure sustainable access to medicines as well as improved distribution and use of them


medicine donations by merck
the merck praziquantel donation program mpdp is mercks largest such philanthropic initiative in 2007 in collaboration
with who merck launched this program to combat the parasitic worm disease schistosomiasis the second most common
tropical disease in africa after malaria our program was originally limited to 2017 however at the end of 2011 merck
decided to continue its engagement indefinitely the goal formulated jointly with who is to eliminate the worm disease in
africa for this purpose merck will increase the number of tablets donated in the medium term raising the total to
250 million tablets annually around 100 million children can thus be treated each year

medicine donations are not intended to undermine the operational health care systems in the recipient countries and often
are not a longterm solution to providing access to medicines we therefore only donate medicines in response to specific
requests if these are endorsed by host governments we consult with our partners regarding decisions on our medicine
donations these are based on an assessment of the need for the product as well as its potential benefit for patients and its
potential to improve health outcomes

in general we conduct our medicine donation activities within developing health care systems however in response to
emergencies or specific onetime requests medicines may also be donated to industrialized countries such as during the
earthquake in japan

we collaborate with both private and public sector partners on donation campaigns that provide access to health solutions in
developing countries we direct the majority of our medicine donations through global institutions such as who and non
governmental organizations ngos only a small portion of our donations are handled locally by merck legal entities in
response to emergencies or specific requests from ministries of health and charitable organizations

medicines in many countries

merck regularly bids in government tender processes in developing countries in order to provide medicines at affordable
prices we offer products to governments at reduced rates in africa latin america and southeast asia such products
include metformin active ingredient to treat diabetes via statefunded pharmacies farm√°cia popular in brazil as well as
the social health insurancee system in mexico and in guatemala euthyrox to treat thyroid diseases via the social health
insurance fund in costa rica and the national health system in cuba cefixime an antibiotic via the health authorities in
south africa concor concor cor glucophage glucophage xr glucovance for diabetes thyrosol and levothyrox
for thyroid diseases in government hospital tenders through the official local distributor in vietnam and concor euthyrox
and glucovance via the ministry of health in malaysia

mercks portfolio has more than 80 products that are on the who essential medicines list  they are currently distributed
in 65 developing countries including 34 countries in africa 19 in asia and 8 in latin america these products are available in
around half of the least developed countries ldcs such as afghanistan benin burkina faso ethiopia haiti mali senegal
and sudan the prices are determined by our legal entities taking local purchasing power into consideration

in order to improve access to highquality affordable diabetes treatment for lowincome segments of the population merck
is developing a dual pricing strategy for glucophage active ingredient metformin in west africa


local manufacturing
merck believes that local manufacturing in developing health care systems is appropriate for particular products local
manufacturing and the transfer of technology skills and intellectual property are contingent on compliance with our quality
and safety standards all our products whether for developed or developing markets are produced in manufacturing plants
that meet good manufacturing practices gmps 

a number of treatments for chronic diseases are manufactured at production plants located in countries such as india
pakistan and indonesia the medicines are marketed in the country of manufacture and exported to developing countries
such as afghanistan maldives sri lanka nepal and kenya we export products manufactured in pakistan and india to a
number of african countries through our legal entities in south africa and tunisia our production plant in indonesia supplies
developing health care systems across southeast asia

through our qualification program for our contract manufacturers we support them in developing their own quality system
by offering coaching or consultation services as needed we are currently working with a partner in algeria that handles the
packaging of glucophage for local distribution merck intends to further develop this local partner so that they can perform
other steps along the value chain on our behalf


product approval and distribution

consideration

merck continuously works to guarantee product availability for its customers our requirements for the quality and
effectiveness of the distribution process are uniform worldwide we are committed to performing rigorous and frequent
checks on our distribution network to ensure that partners are adhering to our quality and safety requirements and to ensure
full compliance with global good distribution practices gdps

global drug safety is responsible for continuously systematically monitoring the safety of our drugs pharmacovigilance
pharmacovigilance information is compiled from doctors and patients in all countries in which our products are marketed
medical specialists and pharmacovigilance teams ensure that information on adverse affects is correctly compiled tracked
and communicated the data for all of our drugs are evaluated centrally by global drug safety and riskbenefit evaluations
are adapted where necessary in line with regulatory requirements changes to the riskbenefit evaluation and potential
safety risks are reported to the responsible authorities as well as to doctors and patients

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                             26

in 2011 and 2012 merck worked with local key players to develop and implement good pharmacovigilance practices in
northwestern africa we collaborated with pharmaceutical regulatory authorities the national centre of pharmacovigilance
in tunis to align their national regulations with the eu pharmacovigilance directives


product safety and anticounterfeit measures
to protect patients merck supports initiatives to fight counterfeit products in this regard we are involved in organizations
vfa efpia and ifpma support industrywide initiatives and collaborate closely with the responsible authorities at a
national regional and international level a special focus is on our collaboration with the pharmaceutical security institute
    psi an organization dedicated to protecting public health improving the exchange of information on counterfeit
medicines and initiating enforcement actions against product counterfeiters

the merck anticounterfeiting operational network macon consists of experts from various parts of the company such
legaltrademarks product security export control supply chain and quality assurance managed by corporate security
this network is responsible for monitoring and implementing anticounterfeiting measures for all products worldwide

we utilize innovative solutions to help our customers and patients determine the identity and authenticity of a
pharmaceutical product themselves one example is the mobile anticounterfeiting system mas in nigeria an
identification system operated via mobile phone after texting the scratched bar code encrypted on the package patients
receive a text message regarding the authenticity of the drug in addition to this we support the nonprofit global pharma
health fund which offers the gphf minilab this is a portable compact quality analysis kit enabling the detection of
substandard and counterfeit medicines




access to health research and development
more than 14 billion people are exposed to the dangers of neglected tropical diseases ntds this group of diseases is classed
as neglected because despite the significant number of people impacted by them they have historically received less
attention and research funding than other diseases neglected tropical diseases occur particularly in developing countries
we are committed to pursuing our rd efforts in order to improve the lives of the millions of people who suffer from ntds in
developing countries currently we are conducting ntd research and development for schistosomiasis and malaria

we believe that the most effective way to achieve progress and develop new approaches to fighting ntds is to work through
robust publicprivate partnerships innovative alliances and interdisciplinary approaches in health and development besides
our existing partnerships we are open to engaging in new multilateral partnerships

within the framework of the merck praziquantel donation program mpdp we are working to optimize the formulation of
the drug in particular this involves a tablet coating that will make it easier for schoolage children to swallow the tablets
and will better protect the drug against external influences furthermore a hint of fruit flavor has been added to make the
tablets more palatable for children within the scope of a publicprivate partnership ppp we are also researching a new
formulation of praziquantel for preschool children praziquantel tablets in their current form are suitable for adults and
children over the age of six for children younger than six it is currently not possible to properly treat the disease a pediatric
formulation of praziquantel will significantly contribute to achieving the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis in africa the
partners of this ppp which was founded in july 2012 include merck ti pharma astellas pharma inc and the swiss tropical
and public health institute swiss tph in basel

in a partnership with the tropical disease research tdr program of the world health organization who we are involved
in the discovery and development of new treatments for malaria a lead compound to treat malaria was identified in 2010
we are currently running a lead optimization program internally that has resulted in the preclinical testing of several
candidate compounds

in 2012 merck sponsored a position for a postdoctoral scientist in geneva to conduct research on malaria compounds
merck furthermore provided supervision all drug discovery infrastructure including labs lab supply access to assays at all
research sites and access to compound collections and access to advanced testing capabilities

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                        27
 access to health intellectual property


in addition merck is involved in other rd collaborations on neglected tropical diseases these include a research project on
schistosomiasis and malaria with the swiss tph and a collaboration with the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine
lshtm  via the who parasite testing network merck has entered into a collaboration with the theodor bilharz research
institute in egypt merck is also participating in stakeholder dialogues and discussions with the african network for drugs and
diagnostics innovation andi  using andi as the interface we are actively exploring new research activities and
knowledge transfer to develop new treatments for diseases in developing countries

furthermore we are currently conducting adaptive rd for our guava system for hiv diagnostics in the dialogue with
national research institutes and universities in africa we are discussing potential types of collaboration in order to better
address local needs as well as build scientific expertise




access to health intellectual property
merck invests in innovation to provide patients with new medicines and to improve current therapies a prudent approach is
needed when evaluating intellectual property

in the context of this approach merck supports the principles of the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual
property rights trips including the doha declaration and article 31f and refrains from filing any patent applications
relating to pharmaceuticals in least developed countries

we believe that patent pools can be a suitable method to develop and market products for ntds therefore merck has no
general objections to joining patent pools in appropriate circumstances in particular for the development of drugs for
neglected diseases

also we believe that voluntary licensing can be an appropriate tool for improving access to medicines merck will consider
opportunities for nonexclusive voluntary licensing providing fair and reasonable compensation for all interested parties
particularly to increase access and affordability of products in least developed countries




access to health diagnostics
more than 30 million people are infected with hiv worldwide in the course of an hiv infection cd4 cells indicate the state
of the immune system and act as markers for t cell lymphocytes patients with a low count of these cells in their blood are at
increased risk of opportunistic infections mercks guava auto cd4cd4 flow cytometry system is being used to identify
and quantify both absolute cd4 t cell counts as well as cd4 values in blood samples

in zambia more than one in every seven adults is infected with hiv and life expectancy at birth has therefore already fallen
to under 39 years organizations such as the catholic relief services and the elizabeth glaser pediatric aids foundation have
been purchasing the guava instruments over the past five years for use by the centre for infectious diseases research in
zambia cidrz by deploying these devices in provincial cdirz labs the status of patients immune systems can be
monitored using the cd4 test as soon as hiv is diagnosed based on the experiences of these agencies zambias ministry of
health has adopted the guava cd4cd4 system as one of their approved cd4 testing platforms

guava systems are ideal for small clinics because the involved costs as well as the needed materials and manpower are low
the system is easy to use and produces results in 45 minutes

currently there are more than 300 guava systems in use in subsaharan africa 35 of which are in zambia

product safety
our products have to be safe  as long as used properly they should not pose a
danger to patients customers or the environment we therefore examine product
safety across the entire life cycle and continuously take steps to make
improvements we make our products safer to use by providing patients and
customers with extensive informational material that partly goes beyond the
statutory requirements

product safety safety of our drugs
in everything we do our number one priority is our patients safety before an active pharmaceutical ingredient api is used
in humans we conduct extensive preclinical trials that test for aspects such as efficacy and toxicity after this the api is
tested in humans within the scope of clinical trials that extensively investigate the apis efficacy and adverse effects the
trial results are then used to assess the drugs riskbenefit ratio weighing the benefits of the treatment against its risks in
the case of severe or even lifethreatening diseases that have no other treatment option a higher risk of adverse effects can
be more acceptable than for less severe conditions

information from clinical trials provides the basis for a drug to be approved by the regulatory authorities even after receiving
marketing approval however we continue to conduct further riskbenefit evaluations on the drug since the number of
patients using it increases exponentially  to thousands or millions worldwide we thus gain a deeper understanding of the
safety profile of our drugs and continue performing riskbenefit evaluations

at merck serono global drug safety is responsible for continuously systematically monitoring the safety of our drugs
pharmacovigilance global drug safety processes safety information from various sources such as clinical trials adverse
reaction reports and scientific literature in order to provide patients with immediate safety information during the entire life
cycle of our drugs

pharmacovigilance information is compiled from doctors and patients in all countries in which our products are marketed
medical specialists and pharmacovigilance teams ensure that information on adverse affects is correctly compiled tracked
and communicated the data for all of our drugs are evaluated centrally by global drug safety and riskbenefit evaluations
are modified accordingly as necessary in line with regulatory requirements changes to the riskbenefit evaluation and
potential safety risks are reported to the responsible authorities as well as to doctors and patients

global drug safety and the drug safety units within mercks legal entities in all countries where our products are used
continuously review changes in the pharmacovigilance regulations worldwide  for products in both the development and
the marketing phase new regulations are continuously integrated into mercks groupwide processes thus allowing us to
ensure that regulatory requirements and statutory regulations are adhered to

health authorities regularly conduct inspections to review adherence to regulatory requirements as well as to mercks own
internal drug safety standards

the medical safety and ethics board mseb chaired by the head of drug development and medical as well as by the chief
medical officer bears ultimate responsibility for drug safety at merck serono it convenes once a month or as required in
addition to the chairpersons the mseb consists of experienced drug safety and product experts from merck serono and its
tasks include assessing riskbenefit evaluations during drug development and marketing reviewing risk management and
dealing with safetyrelated communication furthermore it reviews proposals for firstinman fim dosages as well as for
updates to the safety warnings on package inserts

in collaboration with other companies as well as organizations from the public sector merck is engaged in the global
research project protect of the innovative medicines initiative imi which was launched during the 20112012
periodthis project aims to further develop and optimize instruments and methods for the riskbenefit evaluation of drugs

our quality training management standard applies to all employees whose work impacts the quality and safety of a drug or
clinical trial data this standard describes how to conduct training workshops and seminars at both the group level as well as
locally within the legal entities compliance with these requirements is regularly reviewed during the audits of the safety
quality system


gmp production
in producing pharmaceuticals quality assurance is a key topic because deviations can impact patients health in order to
ensure that pharmaceuticals meet the standards set for identity purity potency and safety they must be manufactured
according to cgmp current good manufacturing practice  consequently as a manufacturer we must have appropriately
trained employees as well as suitable facilities processes and procedures compliance with cgmp guidelines is required and
monitored by the health authorities

on december 15 2011 merck received a warning letter from the us food and drug administration related to inspections of
production facilities in tiburtina in italy and aubonne and vevey in switzerland rebif and other products for distribution in
the united states are manufactured at these sites the letter primarily addressed several processes related to the
manufacture of rebif which the fda concluded were not in full compliance with good manufacturing practice standards
merck is working closely with the fda to address its observations the agency has completed its initial evaluation of mercks
responses in its own response the fda agreed that the proposed corrective actions if properly implemented would
adequately address the violations in question since this initial evaluation all actions stipulated by the plan submitted to the
fda have been implemented in a timely fashion in september 2012 merck sent a final report to the fda and the fda has
already conducted another round of inspections


labeling of packaging
all our pharmaceutical packaging comes with the required package insert that informs patients how to correctly use the
product the package inserts furthermore inform patients of the risks and adverse effects associated with taking the drug
they are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that they are stateoftheart particularly in terms of safetyrelevant
information the labeling oversight group coordinates this process and regularly reports these updates to the medical safety
and ethics board mseb




product safety safety of our chemical products
compliance with regulatory requirements
when it comes to chemicals some of which are also classed as hazardous substances proper use is a prerequisite for the
safety of people and the environment this is why we provide our customers with extensive information about the safe use of
our products

numerous regulations are intended to ensure that chemicals pose no danger to humans or the environment compliance
with these regulatory requirements is an important part of our work they pertain to the production handling import
marketing recycling and disposal of chemicals

with our groupwide product safety chemicals policy we have established global processes for defining steering and
implementing product safety as well as the corresponding management structures this policy covers all relevant national
and international chemical regulations including the globally harmonised system of classification and labeling of
chemicals ghs  and its implementation in regional legislation such as the clp regulation in the eu and hazcom in the
united states the eu chemicals regulation reach  the us toxic substances control act tsca  and the german
federal law on protection from hazardous substances chemg the policy also incorporates legal standards that relate to the
transport of hazardous substances biocides cosmetics chemicals used in food and animal feed etc it is regularly updated
with regard to new regulatory requirements  the last update was made in september 2012 the group product safety

the relevant regulatory requirements for product safety


safety analysis during product development
in the merck group we have developed various instruments in order to ensure that the development process yields products
that are as safe to use as possible this includes conducting analyses that show us how we can enhance product safety at
merck millipore we subject all product innovations to a formal ehs analysis that covers aspects such as environmental
impact and the identification of harmful chemical substances during the 20112012 period a procedure called
innosessment was developed in the advanced materials business unit of the performance materials division this process
aims to help examine product innovations in terms of healthrelated and environmental effects such as toxicity as a result
of these analyses for instance critical constituents such as certain solvents are being replaced


transparent information for safer use
in order to increase user safety we only deliver our chemicals to our customers with safety data sheets these correspond to
current relevant national regulatory requirements such as reach and are available in more than 35 languages we also
provide our customers with declarations and analytical reports with which they can in turn fulfill their obligation to
implement the eu directive rohs

we are committed to advanced product safety and especially transparency going beyond the legal requirements we support
the goals of the global product strategy an international initiative of the chemical industry in this context we provide our
customers with product safety summaries that are available on the website of the international council of chemical
associations icca 

all information on using our products is also accessible on our website there we furthermore provide a program called
scideex that enables users to check whether based on the information in our safety data sheet a chemical can be
safely used even for a slightly modified use this program helps significantly in making our chemicals safe for users it is
based on ecetoc tra2 a program that is recognized by the european chemicals agency echa in 2012 we produced a film
    on the safe use of merck millipore products in the lab which is accessible on our website

nanotechnology
nanotechnology is a highly innovative field of development that researches and
uses structures that are 50000 times thinner than a human hair nanotechnology
makes it possible to produce materials with completely new properties benefits and
functions for a wide variety of applications

nanotechnology offers many opportunities for merck in our chemicals business
we can use nanoscale materials to develop products with new functions and
properties  thus increasing for example efficiency in terms of resource and
energy use in our pharmaceuticals business we work with external partners to
explore the use of nanomaterials to improve therapeutic options within the scope
of joint european research projects we are currently also investigating the suitability of nanoparticles as vehicles for active
pharmaceutical ingredients

however the special structure of nanoparticles can also involve risks we utilize the new technology only with the greatest
care we take into account groupwide requirements for safety as well as environmental and health protection employing
our existing processes and systems for product safety we abide by the precautionary principle and take nanomaterial safety
issues seriously

at the end of 2008 we instituted our groupwide use and handling of nanomaterials  policy this document governs the
handling of nanomaterials whether used in pharmaceutical and chemical laboratories production plants filling plants or
warehouses

we also provide our customers with information on the proper handling of nanomaterials for example during transport
processing storage and disposal

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                         33
 use of genetic engineering


in manufacturing and processing products we pay strict attention to compliance with all statutory regulations and other
applicable standards such as the guidelines of the german federal institute for occupational safety and health
bundesanstalt f√ºr arbeitsschutz und arbeitsmedizin  baua as well as the german chemical industry association verband
der chemischen industrie  vci

both internally and externally we are constantly engaged in an exchange regarding the opportunities and risks of
nanotechnology in the 20112012 period merck established an internal nanocoordination group consisting of analysts
researchers toxicologists safety experts and experts from other relevant areas of the company we also maintain a
continuous dialogue with other companies associations and regulatory agencies such as in the nanocoordination group of
the technology and environment technik und umwelt committee of the vci and in the responsible production and use of
nanomaterials group a technology working group of dechema society for chemical engineering and biotechnology and
the vci




use of genetic engineering
merck utilizes genetically modified organisms in research and development since
the 1980s merck has been manufacturing biotech products that are produced
using genetically modified organisms gmos without this technology the major
medical advances of the last several years would not have been possible

mercks major research centers for medical biotechnology are located in darmstadt
germany boston united states beijing china and tokyo japan important
production sites for this are aubonne and corsiersurvevey in switzerland in
2012 we completed the expansion of our site in corsiersurvevey now one of the
most stateoftheart biotech production facilities in europe it has enabled merck
to bolster its marketleading position in this field

all biotechnological activities at merck are subject to strict legal regulations worldwide compliance with these regulations is
monitored by biological safety officers merck continually tracks regulatory changes pertaining to biotech products and
adapts its processes accordingly thus ensuring compliance with all statutory requirements




productrelated crime
across the globe the pharmaceutical and chemical industry is confronted with
productrelated crime

counterfeit medicines in particular pose a major challenge while also representing
a serious threat to public health according to the world health organization a
considerable proportion of the medicines for sale in developing health care systems
is counterfeit or substandard interpol estimates this at up to 30 this issue is
aggravated by the lack of adequate protection security and drug approval systems
due to the sale of products through unlicensed internet pharmacies and online
underground business2business platforms the percentage of substandard andor
counterfeit medicines is growing rapidly in industrialized nations as well

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                          34

    info box productrelated crime

 key aspects of productrelated crime

 counterfeiting including illegal production

        counterfeit products andor packaging andor active pharmaceutical ingredients apis andor excipients
        product with an incorrect concentration of the active ingredient with unsuitable and potentially hazardous active
        ingredients
        products without active ingredients with counterfeit or incorrect labeling andor packaging andor brand names

 diversion into illegal distribution channels

        illegal export of pharmaceutical products or misuse of chemical products and substances to produce weapons
        explosives or narcotics

 black market crime

        selling counterfeit andor diverted products through illegal channels or for misuse
        theftrobbery warehouse theft freight theft vehicle theft theft from production plants



because criminal organizations are becoming increasingly professionalized pharmaceutical manufacturers are facing ever
growing requirements to track and monitor their products effective protection systems are becoming more and more
important for both the products themselves as well as the distribution channels

merck develops and manufactures products of the utmost quality we take action against productrelated crime to prevent
harm from coming to customers and patients as well as to protect our reputation as a company to this end we focus on
various areas in the company and support global initiatives


groupwide network
the group function corporate security is the internal and external point of contact for all anticounterfeiting activities of the
merck group and is also in charge of steering and coordinating these activities as well here corporate security follows the
crime relating to products of the merck group guideline which describes the goals and strategy for handling product
related crime at all merck serono sites we have deployed local anticounterfeiting correspondents who act as the interface
between local regulatory authorities associations merck group functions and mercks divisions

the merck anticounterfeiting operational network macon consists of experts from various fields such legaltrademarks
product security export control supply chain and quality assurance this network is responsible for monitoring and
implementing anticounterfeiting measures for all products worldwide this includes coordinating preventive measures
sharing information securing evidence conducting investigations and developing and implementing security systems the
network collaborates in appropriate cases with the relevant regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies annually
macon reviews and handles more than 100 cases of productrelated crime


authenticity and tracking
besides implementing internal quality control systems and also strictly adhering to all export and trade guidelines we also
combat counterfeit products through innovative solutions that are tailored to specific markets and target groups with these
measures we aim to help our customers and patients determine for themselves the authenticity of a pharmaceutical
product here we are applying multiple approaches in parallel

on merck product packaging and labels we use security markings with protected color travel pigments of our own
manufacture which enables users to easily verify the authenticity of our products these security features are considerably
harder to counterfeit than the holograms that are frequently used

we employ identification and shipment tracking programs such as track and trace which has been instituted for certain
products in certain markets in the mobile anticounterfeiting system project in nigeria merck is partnering with a supplier to

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                             35
 bioethics


detect counterfeit medicines in addition to this we have also created a mobile phonetext message based identification
system after scratching off a barcode affixed to the product packaging and sending it via text message patients immediately
receive a text message back telling them whether the product is authentic or not

we are systematically implementing the requirements of the eu falsified medicines directive  such as the application of a
unique serial number to our pharmaceutical packaging furthermore we are participating in corresponding pilot initiatives of
the pharmaceutical industry

we are collaborating closely with regulatory authorities to monitor and track chemicals that can be misused to make illegal
weaponry explosives and narcotics in doing so we are abiding by a commitment of the german chemical industry
association vci as well as implementing requirements that pertain to the use of chemicals for weapons of a chemical
biological radioactive or atomic nature

in addition to this a comprehensive auditing system for distributors and contract manufacturers ensures that gmp and gsp
good manufacturing practicegood distribution practices are adhered to this system is based on the ema ich q10
pharmaceutical quality assurance standard

for our customers in the pharmaceutical industry we offer candurin  pearl effect pigments which feature unique color
properties that make tablets and capsules more difficult to counterfeit


multifaceted engagement
in our fight against product piracy we are involved in organizations such as efpia ifpma and vfa we also support industry
wide initiatives and collaborate closely with regulatory authorities at a national regional and international level a particular
area of emphasis is our work with the pharmaceutical security institute psi an organization dedicated to protecting
public health by sharing information on counterfeit pharmaceuticals and initiating enforcement actions through the
appropriate authorities when product crimes are committed we collaborate closely with the law enforcement agencies and
customs authorities in the respective countries with interpol with the world customs organization with health authorities
 and with our competitors as well furthermore merck is a member of rx360  a consortium of global pharmaceutical
manufacturers and suppliers that aims to prevent counterfeit products through the introduction of global quality control
systems


minilab for onsite testing
merck supports the nonprofit global pharma health fund which supplies a portable analysis kit the gphf minilab to check
the quality of medicines with the minilab counterfeit medicines can be detected quickly easily and cheaply also in
developing health care systems to date the gphf has supplied more than 570 minilabs at cost to over 80 countries


sensitizing our employees
the fight against productrelated crime and counterfeit products is an integral part of our risk management system in order
to minimize risks we provide training to employees of our legal entities as well as to business partners in the countries in
which we lack our own legal entity in 2011 and 2012 we held multiday workshops and training seminars in africa china
north america and latin america we furthermore conduct audits of our business partners we are currently drafting a
product crime manual and plan to sensitize employees to the topic




bioethics
bioethics is concerned with fundamental questions that arise from how humans treat other creatures both human and
animal these issues are the subject of often heated debate in part because peoples ethical positions are the reflection of
their differing cultural social and religious backgrounds

for merck bioethical issues arise in the course of multiple activities these include the use of stem cells the use of
genetically modified microorganisms the research and application of infertility drugs and the wide array of clinical research
that we conduct

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                            36
 bioethics



clinical trials
we want to alleviate human suffering by researching and developing innovative
medicines in doing so we orient ourselves to corresponding statutory and
regulatory requirements as well as industry standards for clinical studies these
standards include the declaration of helsinki  the clinical trial principles of the
pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma  and the
casebook on ethical issues in international health research of the world health
organization who these guidelines are rendered into internal standard operating
procedures and detailed instructions that are communicated to all those involved
compliance with the guidelines is monitored in order to give the public a clearer picture of our position we publish our
guidelines on conducting clinical trials


stem cell research
when clear statutory and regulatory requirements are lacking merck collaborates closely with experts to develop appropriate
guidelines the requirements described in stem cells and human cloning principle  enable merck to conduct stem cell
research within a strictly defined framework they thus prevent us from violating applicable laws and regulations while
enabling us to work within the framework of established ethical principles merck is not involved in programs utilizing stem
cells or human cloning for therapeutic purposes and does not pursue such approaches


infertility treatment research
in developing infertility treatments merck avoids all invasive types of prenatal diagnostics within the framework of our
fertility research policy  however we are highly interested in improving the survival rate of fertilized embryos thus
improving the success rate for invitro fertilization


merck bioethics advisory panel
bioethical issues are debated in a diverse social environment many of these questions are viewed very differently from
country to country and are furthermore subject to general shifts in society being a global company merck must therefore
address these developments at an international level we must detect the changes and incorporate them into our position on
bioethical issues in order to do so merck instituted the merck bioethics advisory panel mbap in 2011 which convenes at
least once a year and consists of renowned bioethics experts its members represent a range of pertinent disciplines such as
law theology and medical ethics

in 2011 the panel addressed topics such as stem cell and fertility research clinical trials and animal welfare as a result of
the discussions mercks research guidelines for stem cell and fertility research as well as animal welfare have been revised
and approved by the executive board of merck kgaa in addition to this the stem cell research oversight committee was
instituted at the suggestion of the merck bioethics advisory panel

furthermore the mbap also discusses topics that prepare merck to engage in new highly challenging projects in accordance
with modern ethical standards in 2012 clinical research in developing health care systems was therefore the focus of the
panels discussion with the praziquantel project having received particular attention

within the scope of the merck praziquantel donation program merck is partnering with the world health organization
who to combat the worm disease schistosomiasis in african school children praziquantel tablets in their current form are
suitable for adults and children over the age of six for children younger than six it is currently not possible to properly treat
the disease within the scope of a publicprivate partnership ppp  merck is researching a formulation of praziquantel for
small children this project makes it necessary to conduct clinical trials involving children in africa the childrens parents
and guardians must be informed of the risks of trial participation in an ethically responsible manner and give their consent
the merck bioethics advisory panel discussed how to specifically accomplish this

in 2013 the merck bioethics advisory panel will discuss additional aspects of clinical research in developing health care
systems and will furthermore address bioethical issues arising from developments in personalized medicine

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                            37
 clinical trials



clinical trials
in our quest to thoroughly understand our pharmaceutical products throughout
their entire life cycle we ensure that patient needs are foremost at all times

we conduct topquality clinical research in compliance with the applicable laws
and regulations when conducting multinational multisite trials in both the
industrialized as well as developing world we follow the highest legal ethical and
scientific standards

merck only conducts clinical trials if a sound proven scientific methodology is used
to investigate a scientific or medical question of relevance to patients medical
professionals and society as a whole we only enroll the number of participants required to answer the scientific questions
being investigated


adhering to the highest standards
in all its research and development activities merck adheres to the most stringent legal ethical scientific and quality
standards these include

 1      the good clinical practice gcp guidelines     of the international conference on harmonisation ich
 2      the declaration of helsinki of the world medical association
 3      good laboratorymanufacturingclinicaldistribution practice glpgmpgcpgdp
 4      international ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects          of the council for
         international organizations of medical sciences cioms
 5      the joint position on the disclosure of clinical trial information via clinical trial registries and databases  and
         the joint position on the publication of clinical trial results in the scientific literature  issued by the
         international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers  associations ifpma the european federation of
         pharmaceutical industries and associations efpia the japanese pharmaceutical manufacturers association
         jpma and the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma

the principles of these and similar reference standards have been translated into legal requirements through laws and
regulations that are enforced by national health authorities

merck frequently works in partnership with third parties to provide a broad indepth basis for our pharmaceutical
development we expect and check that all our partners  especially contract research organizations cros licensing
partners and suppliers  abide by the same set of standards for conducting clinical trials


clinical trial governance
the head of global discovery and early development and the head of global drug development and medical supported by
the corresponding operating committees have overall responsibility for product development and the related governance
process our medical safety and ethics board mseb makes decisions on product safety issues in order to ensure that
patients interests are being optimally served this board chaired by the head of global drug development and medical as
well as by the chief medical officer consists of senior physician and scientists


conducting clinical trials responsibly
every clinical trial participant is important to us  both as a person and as a source of scientific findings for the treatments of
tomorrow in conducting our clinical trials we bear in mind the great importance of trial participant safety prior to enrolling
a single subject in an interventional clinical trial a qualified independent ethics committeeinstitutional review board
ecirb must therefore review and approve each and every trial all local regulatory or governmental authorizations required
in the respective country must furthermore be obtained before accepting participants into a clinical trial we first ensure
that they have been properly informed about the potential risks and benefits about alternative processes or treatments and
about the nature and duration of the clinical trial they can ask questions about the trial and get answers from a qualified
healthcare professional associated with the study

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                         38
 animal testing


once a trial starts procedures are followed to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with good clinical practice
and that the data are accurately generated documented and reported in compliance with all applicable requirements we
continuously collect characterize and communicate the safety data for our products promptly sharing new findings in order
to appropriately manage the use of our pharmaceutical products in addition to this we safeguard the confidentiality of each
trial participants medical information in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations merck transparently
communicates information on its clinical trials in accordance with international transparency agreements


conducting clinical trials in developing health care systems
regardless of location merck conducts all its clinical trials in compliance with internationally agreed scientific and ethical
standards in addition to the locally applicable laws and regulations historically the pharmaceutical industry has focused its
development activities in the united states and europe however the vast majority of the worlds population resides outside
these regions merck is actively shifting its development activities to more diverse markets in order to address the health care
needs in these regions as well as to support the development of their health care systems in performing clinical trials in
these developing health care systems we apply the same principles there sound methodology importance of issue under
investigation quality and monitoring that we would apply when conducting such trials in a developed health care system
when we conduct clinical trials in a developing health care system

 1      we only do so in an environment that can follow good clinical practice gcp meaning one that has appropriately
         setup ethics committees and welltrained clinical investigators
 2      we only address diseases and test innovative medicines that are relevant for the local population
 3      we conduct clinical trials in countries where there is a reasonable expectation that the drug tested will be submitted
         for marketing authorization and be made available to patientssubjects after proof of efficacy and safety
 4      we also assure that enrollment into a clinical trial does not discriminate against participants on the basis of ethnic
         origin gender or socio economic status




animal testing
chemical and pharmaceutical companies are legally required to perform animal
tests when developing new drugs this is also required for the product safety of
biological preparations as well as for chemicals in connection with the reach
regulation animal testing provides crucial information on product efficacy and
safety therefore international law requires it to be performed prior to testing the
effect of new drugs in humans or prior to marketing chemicals on a large scale

animal testing may only be conducted if there are no recognized alternative
methods available otherwise the alternative methods must be utilized animal
testing is however still unavoidable in many fields and frequently cannot be
replaced by alternative testing all aspects of animal testing are stipulated by law and regulations and are approved and
monitored by regulatory authorities these laws govern the treatment of laboratory animals such as cage size temperature
ventilation and relative humidity the conduct and approval of animal tests and the reliability and expertise of all involved
individuals


animal welfare at merck
for merck animal welfare is an important issue not only for ethical reasons but also because of its influence on the quality
of clinical trial results in order to get reliable accurate data from our studies we need animals that are comfortable and
subjected to as little stress as possible in addition to this we are committed to applying high stateoftheart quality and
animal welfare standards in the housing care and feeding of our lab animals and we strive to continuously improve these
conditions

we promote the 3r principles of animal welfare reduction refinement and replacement we therefore develop and use
methods and techniques to further replace animal testing to reduce the required number of animals and to minimize the
stress placed on them before during and after testing

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                        39
 animal testing



animal testing in pharmaceuticals and chemicals
as a pharmaceutical manufacturer we are legally required per government and industry regulations to perform animal tests
to prove the quality efficacy and safety of our products prior to clinical testing international and national laws govern the
type and scope of the data to be submitted to the authorities animal tests are justified by the obligation to save and protect
human lives and to alleviate human suffering

for our chemicals the eu chemicals regulation reach registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals
that took effect in 2007 specifies that all substances manufactured in or imported to the eu must be registered and
evaluated in accordance with certain requirements in order to assess their potential hazards depending on the amount of
chemicals in question this also includes animal testing we minimize the number of animal tests by working with other
manufacturers importers and users in the substance information exchange forum sief  in order to share data this
allows us to avoid animal testing that is not absolutely necessary for consumer protection or to avoid repeating animal tests
that have already been conducted


groupwide regulations and organizational structures
merck keeps animals in its own facilities at various sites worldwide at all merck sites where animals are kept or animal tests
are performed we have appointed responsible individuals and groups eg animal care and welfare officers institutional
animal care and use committees both on a voluntary basis as well as in response to national requirements these units
assess and assure the quality of the respective animal husbandry practices

our use care and welfare of laboratory animals  corporate guideline which was approved by the executive board in
november 2011 describes our principles for the housing care and feeding of lab animals it also sets down the requirements
we place on third parties who conduct animal testing on our behalf in this guideline we commit ourselves to high quality
and to continually improving the housing care and feeding of our lab animals

animal welfare at merck falls under the group function animal science and welfare which has existed since january 1
2013 the corporate animal welfare officer will create uniform animal welfare standards conduct andor initiate audits and
institute additional improvements to animal welfare at merck and its partners by increasing transparency throughout the
merck group

as a member of interpharma an association of pharmaceutical companies in switzerland merck serono has signed the
interpharma charter on animal welfare


site accreditation
to demonstrate that we adhere to the strictest animal welfare standards we have our laboratory animal facilities at merck
serono accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac
int in addition to taking into account the high international quality standards of the guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals from the institute for laboratory animal research ilar the aaalac accreditation also factors in
national laws and guidelines as well in the 20112012 period we received full aaalac accreditation for our animal
husbandry practices at our nonclinical safety and experimental pharmacology units in darmstadt germany and billerica
massachusetts usa other merck group laboratory animal facilities are currently preparing to undergo the accreditation
process


employee training
in order to ensure that animals are tested housed fed and cared for according to the latest standards all employees working
with laboratory animals at merck are specially trained and receive continual advanced training the nature and scope of this
training is governed by national and international legislation as well as local requirements and the training is monitored by
the responsible regulatory authorities in addition to this our employees participate in external continuing education
programs such as the accredited laboratory animal science courses offered by felasa the federation of european
laboratory animal science association at the site in darmstadt germany merck also offers veterinarians the opportunity to
complete a threeyear continuing education program to specialize in laboratory animal medicine in addition to this we
provide online training programs and classroom courses on animal welfare 3r and the aaalac accreditation standard


using and developing alternative methods
whenever practical and legally feasible merck uses alternative testing methods instead of animal testing including invitro

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                       40
 animal testing


tests and computerbased methods over the last several years merck researchers have received multiple awards for
developing alternative test methods

      2005 the eurotox gerhard zbinden young scientists award
      2006 the german animal welfare research prize awarded by the federal ministry of food agriculture and consumer
      protection bmelv for alternative methods to replace or reduce animal tests
      2007 the hessian animal welfare research prize for alternative methods to replace or reduce animal tests
      2008 the eurotox bo holmstedt young scientists award for alternative test strategies according to the 3r principles
      2009 the eurotox gerhard zbinden young scientists award
      2010 the iutox bo holmstedt scientists award for alternative test strategies according to the 3r principles

within the scope of our collaboration in associations such as efpia vfa interpharma and the 3r iq consortium we are
striving to obtain regulatory recognition for alternative testing methods that transcends national boundaries there is a
serious need for action here because animal testing can only be truly reduced if a new methodology gains widespread
recognition at an international level without international recognition both animal testing and alternative testing have to
be conducted when developing pharmaceuticals intended for global distribution

through our work with the german chemical industry association vci and the german association of researchbased
pharmaceutical companies vfa we actively support the set foundation and we support the 3r foundation through our
work with interpharma both foundations are dedicated to finding alternative and complementary animal testing methods
we are furthermore collaborating with the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations efpia to
devise performance indicators that can be used to evaluate the methods for 3r improvements that companies develop


species
mice and rats constitute 99 of the laboratory animals used within the merck group other animal species are only used if
mandated by statutory regulations andor if preliminary scientific testing and experience shows the results from experiments
on rats and mice to be insufficiently robust other animal species may also be used if preliminary scientific testing and
experience indicates that the results must be backed up by testing on nonrodent species as well statutory regulations
require pharmaceuticals in development to be safety tested both on a rodent species rat or mouse as well as on a non
rodent species dog pig or monkey in this way potential side effects can be identified and included in the risk assessment
of a substance prior to firstinman use in all experiments the safety of human beings is our top priority


animal welfare at external partners
we procure our lab animals from special animal breeders and furthermore hire special contract research organizations to
conduct animal testing on our behalf we also collaborate or partner with industry institutes and universities our animal
welfare policy stipulates that the same high standards that apply within merck also apply to these external partners as well
within the scope of our work with interpharma during the 20112012 period merck helped develop an audit concept for
such contract institutes an interpharma audit has already been conducted on an animal breeder at two different sites in
germany and found the animal husbandry practices there to be of good quality

 responsible marketing




responsible marketing
a crucial component of our business activities is the responsible marketing of our
products in accordance with regulations

in our pharmaceuticals business the requirements for marketing are very stringent
as they are for all interactions in the health care industry mercks numberone goal
is for patients to receive effective treatment for this to happen all health care
industry players must have continuous access to the relevant information patients
must have access to the medicines they need and the medicines must be correctly
prescribed and utilized in order to achieve this we adhere to strict ethical standards
for the marketing of our products these standards sometimes exceed the statutory
requirements and are intended to prevent key players from being improperly influenced

to ensure professional transparent conduct in our pharmaceutical marketing operations we comply not only with numerous
statutory regulations but have also defined our own code of conduct furthermore we also adhere to the industry
regulations of the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers  associations an international umbrella
organization and the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations a european umbrella
organization as well as the regulations of local industry associations


groupwide regulations for pharmaceutical marketing
the merck pharmaceutical marketing best practices define internationally mandatory standards

these best practices govern interactions with doctors pharmacists and patient organizations defining requirements for
holding events and for advertising this international standard is supplemented by countryspecific regulations whereupon
the more stringent respective requirement takes precedence

pharmaceutical operations of merck kgaa and merck serono sa in the united states is a groupwide guideline that
specifically applies to mercks pharmaceutical activities in the us market

for employees of mercks german legal entities there is also an internal guideline on interacting with physicians hospitals
pharmacies and other members of professional circles as well as with patient organizations merck is furthermore a member
of the association for the voluntary selfcontrol of the pharmaceutical industry fsa which has defined rules of conduct
for collaboration between physicians and industry when violations of the fsa code are suspected members and third parties
can file complaints with an arbitration board at the beginning of 2013 merck received a warning letter from the fsa
because merck had not abided by new rules in its communication regarding a sponsoring activity

promotional materials is a groupwide guideline that additionally applies to all businesses of the merck serono division this
guideline requires advertising materials to be examined by the merck group functions medical regulatory andor legal to
ensure that they conform to global pharmaceutical regulations

in general merck does not use its prescription drug marketing activities to advertise directly to patients when merck does
conduct such directtoconsumer campaigns the provisions of the merck pharmaceutical marketing best practices apply as
do local requirements which are often even more stringent

all guidelines pertaining to marketing and advertising are part of the groupwide compliance program they are regularly
adapted to reflect current developments and apply for all employees who work in the corresponding fields

within the scope of the compliance training plan all relevant employees receive online training and participate in classroom
seminars participation is monitored and the results of the online training are evaluated for instance in 2011 and 2012
4345 employees participated in seminars on the merck pharmaceutical marketing best practices in addition to the regular
code of conduct training

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                         42
 interactions in the health care industry



marketing chemicals
responsible marketing is also important in our chemicals business in order to ensure careful handling we supply our
chemicals only to commercial customers who have the proven expertise in addition we provide customers with information
on the safe handling and use of our products to prevent the misuse of dualuse products merck has established an
extensive safety net standardized export control guidelines are monitored by our central export control  customs
regulations unit as well as by trade and export control officers at the local merck legal entities if we suspect misuse we
refrain from doing business with that customer for safety reasons




interactions in the health care industry
we believe that worldwide access to medicinal product information is one of the
keys to improving health care and treatment for patients for this reason we
support scientific research as well as patient organizations and other key players in
the health care industry by donating money and supplies or through sponsoring
activities with this type of support it is important for key players to remain neutral
in order to protect the patients and ensure them the best treatment all donations
and sponsoring activities must comply with the internal and external standards that
apply to mercks marketing operations within the scope of commitments we have
made as members of various associations we furthermore transparently report on
the support we provide


support for patient organizations in europe
patient organizations play an important role in providing patients their family members and their caregivers with support for
and information on dealing with diseases with these institutions we share a common goal of improving quality of life for
patients which is why we support this important work merck explicitly endeavors to exert no influence or control over the
information that the organizations communicate to their members for comprehensive transparency we publish our
donations to european patient organizations on our website and update the information annually  this enables us to fulfill
a commitment we have made through our membership in the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and
associations efpia 


promoting research
to support the health care system merck makes monetary contributions and donates supplies to institutions organizations
and associations consisting of members of professional circles these include medical science professional associations
hospitals and university clinics this support reflects the merck values and allows research institutes and related institutions
to more easily do their work which ultimately serves the common good the contributions are not intended to influence
decisions regarding treatment prescriptions or purchasing in compliance with the code of conduct of the german
association for the voluntary selfcontrol of the pharmaceutical industry fsa merck kgaa publishes its contributions
made in germany in excess of  10000 per recipient and year the information is updated on an annual basis

in order to promote advances in the field of medicine merck sponsors research and advanced medical training in other
countries as well here merck serono supports efforts such as outstanding research projects through its grant for fertility
innovation and its grant for multiple sclerosis innovation  through contributions to the charitable serono symposia
international foundation  merck serono supports the foundations work in providing advanced medical training for
scientists physicians nurses pharmacists and other health care professionals


increasing transparency requirements
the transparency requirements for interactions in and contributions to the health care industry are going to become more
stringent in the future global transparency initiatives such as the sunshine laws in the united states and the initiatives of
the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations efpia require the disclosure of collaborations
between the pharmaceutical industry and physicians medical organizations and patient organizations they are also
requiring companies to disclose individual partnerships specifically naming the physicians in question as well as to disclose

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                         43
 packaging


the purpose of the interaction and the amount contributed ensuring this sort of transparency demands a great deal from a
companys internal processes for example the data protection law implications have to be legally reviewed and the
subsequent results of the review must be incorporated into the contract management process despite the high degree of
time and effort merck supports these transparency initiatives as an expression of our deep sense of responsibility we
continually adapt our systems in response to current developments such as these




packaging
packaging plays an important role for our products in two ways for one it protects
our products from external influences and ensures that they reach the customer
undamaged secondly packaging guarantees that the environment will not be
negatively impacted by substances leaking out the packaging has to remain safe
throughout the products entire life cycle  during transport storage usage and
disposal

the development of suitable packaging therefore constitutes part of our product
development process and contributes to product safety one example is our
safebreak bottles which are coated in plastic to prevent chemicals from leaking out
if the glass breaks

in addition to safety efficient resource use also plays a crucial role we identify potential areas of optimization in order to
reduce material usage during packaging manufacture without compromising the quality and safety this also aims to
increase the percentage of materials that minimally impact the environment


packaging for merck millipore products
merck millipore is currently using this approach to refine its packaging strategy another important aspect of the strategy is
that we want to deliver our products in packaging that is easy for our customers to dispose of and that helps them reduce the
impact of their own activities on the environment we are therefore working to develop reusable packaging systems and to
reduce the use of foam components here are a few examples

       for shipping glass reagent bottles are secured separately in the packages to prevent them from bumping into each
       other and breaking a task we used to accomplish with eps expanded polystyrene molded foam components at the
       sites in germany the united states and india we have launched an initiative to replace eps packaging with molded
       fiber components consisting of cellulose and recycled paper in darmstadt germany we will have replaced nearly all
       eps molded foam packaging by the end of 2013 which means more than 600000 molded foam components for the
       switch to cellulose and recycled paper materials in india we are conducting additional investigations because of the
       climate conditions found there in the united states we are furthermore looking into an alternative using corrugated
       cardboard
       the majority of the cardboard boxes used to package products at us merck millipore sites are certified to the standards
       of the sustainable forestry initiative sfi 
       the lab water business field of merck millipore has developed new packaging for the smart and integral ranges of the
       milliq lab water purification systems here the molded pe polyethylene foam components are being replaced by
       corrugated cardboard less material is utilized thus reducing the packaging costs in addition the polystyrene
       packaging used to ship the qpod and epod accessories has also been replaced by molded corrugated cardboard
       thanks to the improved packaging design we are saving 18 metric tons of corrugated cardboard per year
       in 2012 merck millipore conducted a life cycle assessment to investigate the material usage of reusable plastic
       containers versus corrugated cardboard packaging for its millistakpod products which are used in the production
       of vaccines it showed that a reusable container reduces the amount of material used by up to 95 per individual
       product delivery it furthermore revealed other possible ways to reduce the impact of distribution on the environment
       in the 20112012 period we developed a scorecard as a tool to evaluate packaging for biomonitoring products in
       order to compare the environmental impact costs and quality of various packaging designs with one another for
       instance when we developed the packaging for the ezstreamtm vacuum pump a product that is used for quality
       testing in the beverage industry we compared three different packaging options we ultimately selected the

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                        44
 storage and transport


      packaging with the least environmental impact that met the required quality criteria and was of a comparable cost
      the design was then further refined improving the initial design with a 28 reduction in packaging weight and an
      18 reduction in volume this has enabled 30 more products per pallet for two other biomonitoring products the
      ezfit manifold and the ezpak dispenser curve which are also used in beverage quality testing we have replaced
      the eps foam that was formerly utilized making the packaging now entirely recyclable
      we have improved upon multiple aspects of the packaging for the milliflexquantum sets which are used for quality
      testing in pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical production we have cut down the packaging size thus reducing
      the cardboard used by 15 meaning that 26 more sets can fit per pallet we have furthermore increased the
      percentage of recycled packaging material from 45 to 90 these changes have also resulted in saving space for
      customers in tight lab settings


closed system for liquid crystals packaging
in south korea the performance materials division utilizes a patented system of stainless steel canisters that are filled with
liquid crystal mixtures at the poseung site and delivered to south korean display manufacturers the merck standard
canisters mscs can be utilized directly on the production lines without decanting the empty canisters are then sent back
to merck where they are cleaned under validated conditions the mscs are reused within a closed system over multiple
years a reusable polypropylene box serves as outer packaging similar systems are in use at other liquid crystal mixture
production sites in asia




storage and transport
for the storage and transport of our goods we adhere to strict safety guidelines in
order to prevent risks to people and the environment

in order to safely store substances we have implemented global safety concepts for
all our warehouses worldwide we have based these concepts on the
recommendations of the german chemical industry association vci which
include the minimization of storage risks through segregated storage the protection
of the environment through retention capacity in the event of leaks and for
extinguishing water automatic extinguishing units adapted to the products and
materials being stored occupational safety measures as well as optimized material
and work flows in the warehouse

at the end of 2012 we made significant revisions to our groupwide standards for warehouse safety in doing so we created
the framework for selecting service providers the warehouse requirements standard defines the structural and
organizational requirements for a facility the warehouse safety standard defines the operational measures needed to
prevent substance leakage as well as fires and explosions

according to this standard risk evaluations must be conducted on all stored substances including finished chemical and
pharmaceutical products raw materials intermediates waste packaging material and technical materials in addition to
this the standard lays down mandatory rules of workplace conduct for all warehouse employees all warehouses are to be
audited thoroughly and regularly to check for compliance with safety requirements

for shipments transported by merck or on behalf of merck safety is our top priority we want to ensure that shipments reach
our sites and customers undamaged with the correct labeling and documentation

several substances that we ship are classified as hazardous materials hazardous goods transport  whether by road rail air
or water  is heavily regulated across the globe by conventions such as the european agreement concerning the
international carriage of dangerous goods by road adr

we have refined our audit concept in order to monitor compliance with the transport safety regulations at merck sites as well
as the compliance of those partners involved in the transport of goods

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                          45

reuse and recycling
we consider takeback concepts as well as environmentally sustainable utilization
and disposal of chemicals and packaging to be an integral part of our corporate
responsibility by taking back used products and packaging merck and its
customers are jointly contributing to reducing the environmental impact of our
products and services this plays an important role for merck at the international
level as well we are promoting this concept particularly in emerging markets


retrologistik
more than 20 years ago merck set up its own system in germany and several other
countries in order to dispose of used packaging and chemicals in a safe and environmentally sustainable manner called
retrologistik this is a wellestablished service that customers appreciate highly

in 2010 we entered into a strategic alliance with the german association for international cooperation giz  called
environmentally sound management of chemical waste in south east asia this alliance aims to establish the retrologistics
concept in indonesia the philippines and thailand in order to boost environmental awareness there as well as change how
hazardous materials are handled the transfer of merck technology and knowledge plays a crucial role here with this project
we want to build knowledge and competencies for the environmentally sustainable storage of chemicals we also want to
help our project partners to properly classify and transport the resulting waste as well as recycle or dispose of it originally
scheduled to continue until 2012 the joint merck and giz project in southeast asia has been extended until summer 2013

after three years the strategic alliance has improved training auditing and implementation capacity in the respective
countries it has increased the number of users who handle and dispose of their chemicals in an environmentally sustainable
manner and has boosted the number of qualified waste disposal firms

within the project informational and training materials were developed and made available in the respective national
languages of each country merck and the giz have jointly trained more than 1000 people as trainers including employees
of universities thailand and of governmental organizations such as the department of science and technology of the

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                          46
 reuse and recycling


philippines as well as the indonesia state ministry of environment the trainers then act as multipliers passing on the
knowledge acquired to their institutions and countries to date the trained universities in thailand have now properly
disposed of eight tons of lab waste and government labs in the philippines have properly disposed of two tons of chemicals
via a project partner

furthermore lab chemicals users were trained on how to properly handle chemicals such as when storing or disposing of
them several stateowned labs were also equipped as model labs to demonstrate responsible environmentally sustainable
chemical management

this strategic alliance furthermore supports select companies in the disposal industry for example a washing plant for
empty chemicals bottles that operates according to european standards was built in the industrial park in kota jababeka this
plant can be used by at least 150 companies great progress has also been made in implementing the retrologisitics concept
in the philippines especially for photometric cuvette tests in the region of luzon for instance 25 companies are already
participating in the system to date 3000 test sets have been safely disposed of

the project is being expanded to include india in order to establish a marketoriented takeback and disposal system founded
on industrywide selfregulation on handling hazardous waste and certified by the relevant regulatory agencies this system
is intended to be available to the entire market after being successfully established in two pilot regions the system is to be
rolled out nationwide


ech2o recycling program for water purification cartridges

the lab water business field of merck millipore has developed the ech2o program for water purification cartridges the
program enables our customers to send back their cartridges to be recycled and thus to avoid the need for traditional disposal
methods such as land fill dumping or incineration a life cycle assessment has revealed that this can reduce the
environmental impact of the cartridges by 1015 more than 300 customers are already taking advantage of the
program


biopharma takeback and recycling program
singleuse products are increasingly playing a role in the biopharmaceutical industry improvements in disposing of these
products are a challenging task owing to a lack of recycling infrastructure the material mix of the products and the specific
requirements for handling biologically hazardous residues as one of the leading suppliers of products for the life science
industry merck millipore and five customers jointly launched a takeback program in the united states in 2012

the pilot project showed that recycling can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 14 in comparison to traditional
disposal methods as confirmed by an endoflife life cycle assessment during the product development phase merck
millipore takes into account obstacles to recycling identified in the course of the pilot project this allows them to constantly
improve the recycling potential of new products through measures such as simplified disassembly or by increasing the
percentage of recyclable materials

for ech2o and the biopharma program merck millipore was recognized in may 2012 with the boston business journal green
business award and in november 2012 with the massrecycle business innovation award

suppliers
our basic expectations for suppliers and service partners include their compliance
with fundamental environmental and social standards therefore we have further
developed our procurement strategies in order for our supply chain worldwide to
adhere more closely to environmental compliance and social standards and to
prevent violations


supplier management
for our business activities we need raw materials packaging materials technical
products components and services in 2012 we purchased all these commodities
from more than 50000 suppliers in over 100 countries worldwide of the goods and services including rd services
procured in 2012 totaling approximately  4 billion we purchased 55 from suppliers based in eu countries and 33 from
suppliers in oecd countries outside the eu around 12 came from suppliers in nonoecd countries outside the eu

procurement volume 2012 in 




our basic expectations for suppliers and service partners include their compliance with fundamental environmental and
social standards derived primarily from the ilo core labor standards and the un global compact therefore since 2009 we
have been supporting the compliance initiative of the german federal association for materials management purchasing
and logistics bme and have additionally signed the bme code of conduct  this contains basic rules for combating
corruption violations of antitrust law child labor and minimum requirements for environmental protection in the supply
chain


   info box bme code of conduct

 the bme code of conduct contains international crossindustry minimum standards for combating corruption collusion in
 violation of antitrust law child labor and forced labor as well as for promoting ethical principles toward suppliers it also
 encompasses principles for upholding human rights for protecting health and the environment and for fair working
 conditions



in the last two years we have refined our procurement strategies in order for our supply chain worldwide to adhere more
closely to environmental compliance and social standards and to prevent violations we have put into effect a new
procurement guideline and published new standard operating procedures for the supplier management and purchasing
process of the merck group the aim is to anchor cr aspects more firmly in procurement activities in order to take them
better into account in the selection assessment and management of suppliers

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                           49
 suppliers


we have developed merck responsible sourcing principles  which include not only environmental social and compliance
aspects but also the requirements that we expect for example when commissioning animal studies our merck responsible
sourcing principles consolidate the requirements we place on our suppliers concerning responsible conduct in addition with
these principles we also clearly highlight the responsibility of suppliers to apply our corporate responsibility standards also to
their upstream value chain

in the course of 2013 we intend to integrate our merck responsible sourcing principles into the respective general terms
and conditions throughout the merck group worldwide in this way we are underscoring the principles we have already
defined in our code of conduct and social charter by providing our suppliers with a uniform document

core features of our sustainable cr supplier management approach are

      general terms and conditions in our general terms and conditions we are globally integrating the commitment to
      comply with the principles of our code of conduct and social charter by the end of the first quarter of 2013 almost
      all legal entities had adapted their respective general terms and conditions in the course of 2013 a reference to our
      merck responsible sourcing principles will be added successively to the general terms and conditions
      supplier selfdisclosure with their selfdisclosure our suppliers provide information on their compliance with our
      code of conduct and social charter as well as available iso certificates in the 20112012 period we expanded the
      selfdisclosure process started in 2010 that our suppliers have to undergo it has now been established in germany
      brazil mexico switzerland japan and india by the end of 2013 this will also be the case in france the united
      states china italy the united kingdom and ireland in these countries we request higherrisk suppliers from whom
      we procure more than a defined purchasing volume to provide a selfdisclosure the global implementation process for
      selfdisclosures has been initiated and is being successively executed with the introduction of our new computerized
      supplier management system
      sustainability audits in order to monitor compliance with our code of conduct and social charter depending on the
      risk potential we conduct sustainability audits at selected suppliers a groupwide operating procedure was created in
      2012 for executing and following up audits we select suppliers for an audit by dividing our supplier portfolio into risk
      groups based on the criteria country risk product category and the sales that the supplier generates from its business
      with us suppliers in an oecd member state for example are classified into a lower risk group in addition suppliers
      are also audited if there are indications of a lack of compliance with our requirements audit observations may be
      classified as critical defects major defects or minor defects the audit results and any necessary corrective
      actions are communicated to the supplier if observations are classified as critical or major we monitor the
      implementation of the defined corrective actions and also initiate supplier requalification or disqualification where
      necessary the audit team additionally determines the interval at which followup audits are to be conducted

      we conducted 36 audits in 2011 and 2012 according to the newly developed system none of them resulted in
      critical defects however 18 audits revealed major defects which we are tracking and monitoring therefore we
      demanded a corrective action plan capa from the suppliers concerned which describes the measures to address the
      defects this will be monitored by auditors in addition we will reaudit these suppliers as from 2014 based on our risk
      potential analysis we plan around 30 audits per year at suppliers with a high risk potential these take place mainly in
      nonoecd countries


    info box evaluation of audit results and followup

 critical any observation rated as critical must be rectified or mitigated as soon as possible proposal for corrective actions
 shall be submitted by the supplier to merck within one week after receiving the audit report

 major any observation rated as major is believed to be significant enough to require a formal corrective action response by
 the supplier within one month of the receipt of the audit report

 minor any observation rated as minor does not require a formal corrective action plan and the implementation of
 associated corrective actions will also not

responsibility in the mica supply chain
mica is a raw material we use for one of our pigment product groups when examining the mica supply chain we discovered
in 2008 that at the start of the supply chain mica is partly also collected by children generally together with their parents
this is not compatible with our corporate values and the principles of our social charter consequently we have realigned
the mica supply chain in order to prevent child labor and to ensure that the principles of our social charter are complied
with

it was important to us to maintain our business relationships with suppliers in the regions where mica comes from and thus
safeguard jobs in jharkhand a region in northeast india plagued by poverty and political uncertainty today we procure mica
exclusively from mining and not from collecting based on information provided by our suppliers we have introduced a
system for tracking the origin of the raw material it is regularly checked by staff from the office we recently set up in the

structure as well as the recruitment and retention of talented people in the long term for this purpose merck has
introduced global programs for example the performance management process and global rewards policy as well as the
talent and succession management process in the 20112012 period we focused these programs even more on the needs
of a global corporate group

since 2011 we have additionally increased our strategic focus on workforce diversity and fostering a culture of inclusion to
benefit from that diversity which we want to promote by means of targeted measures these include for example our
intention to increase the percentage of management positions held by women to between 25 and 30 by 2016

we record in various systems this enables global reporting of demographic employee data and reporting lines as well as
protection of sensitive data such as salary information we are currently introducing an integrated system called hr suite
for our global performance management as well as for talent identification and assessment recruitment learning
management and compensation review hr suite will make our processes even more efficient and will further improve data

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                       54
 fit for 2018 transformation program


transformation program faces the challenge of driving cultural change while continuing to implement personnel
restructuring measures within the scope of the efficiency programs




fit for 2018 transformation program
at the end of 2011 we announced the extensive fit for 2018 transformation
program with which we are addressing significant market shifts increasing
competition in key product areas and efficiency deficits in our organization the aim
is to increase the competitiveness of merck fit for 2018 covers all business
sectors and regions of merck and consists of two phases in 2012 and 2013 the
focus is on establishing a global organization implementing efficiency measures
and developing a longterm growth strategy in the second phase as of 2014 the
focus will be on capturing future growth opportunities

in order to strengthen the leadership to drive the global organization we made
altogether 51 new appointments to key positions in 2011 these included 32
positions that were filled by nongerman employees and eight by female
employees in addition we have redefined the relationships between our divisions
group functions and legal entities in this way we want to streamline our
organizational structure and accelerate decisionmaking processes

in early 2012 we presented our plans for an efficiency program to our employees and the public these plans include
restructuring as well as reductions of the workforce across all business sectors and regions without first announcing
detailed plans on cost and workforce reductions we held consultations with the employee representatives in the countries
concerned a key success factor here was the unbiased approach to these talks this enabled us to jointly reach an optimal
solution for our goals in each respective case the aim was to find socially acceptable solutions as far as possible and to
justify them openly and fairly to our employees


key developments in 2012

switzerland
in april 2012 we announced the efficiency measures for the operational business which include the closure of the sites in
geneva and coinsins switzerland in accordance with the regulations relevant to such planning measures in switzerland
merck called upon the employees there to submit alternative proposals by june 2012 for avoiding or reducing the planned
workforce reduction in the meantime merck held talks with the employee representatives called together at short notice at
the sites in geneva and the canton of vaud as well as the unia trade union in geneva and vaud

in midjune merck informed the responsible cantonal authorities and its employees of the final decision a variety of
proposals concerning for example the social plan had been submitted to merck serono nevertheless none of the proposals
about retaining the geneva site could be incorporated into the plans they were not reconcilable with the goal of eliminating
duplicate functions in order to secure mercks viability over the long term

within the scope of restructuring measures merck is consolidating all group functions at corporate headquarters in
darmstadt pharmaceutical research and development is to be concentrated at the sites in darmstadt germany boston
united states beijing china and tokyo japan for this purpose around 750 of the jobs at the geneva site are being
transferred to other locations approximately 500 jobs have been eliminated in order to avoid duplicate structures around 80
jobs will be cut at the sites in the canton of vaud aubonne coinsins and corsiersurvevey production in coinsins is being
transferred to aubonne the closure of the geneva site is scheduled for mid2013 and coinsins for 2014

in order to cushion the impact of the changes merck worked with the unia trade union and employee representatives to
reach an agreement on a comprehensive social plan for the affected employees this includes for example severance
payments early retirement arrangements and benefits to support employees transferring abroad or starting up their own
businesses in addition merck made chf 2 million available to mitigate the effects of closing the geneva site on the local
labor market the sum is administered by a board consisting of the employee representatives and a lawyer appointed by the

 attracting and developing employees


state council of geneva another measure is the entrepreneur partnership program epp which supports employees who
have good ideas for starting up their own businesses we have made  30 million available for the epp


germany
in september 2012 the company management and employee representatives reached an agreement on an efficiency
program for our sites in germany the preceding consultation phase with employee representatives had begun in february
the aim is to reduce the workforce by around 1100 positions in a socially acceptable manner by the end of 2015  mainly
through voluntary leaver and partial retirement programs forced layoffs are largely excluded until the end of 2017

the program comprises around 100 individual initiatives aimed at increasing efficiency and focusing production on value
adding core activities in order to strengthen the darmstadt site at least  250 million in total will be invested there and at
the other german sites in 2013 and 2014 darmstadt is to be further expanded as mercks global corporate headquarters
meeting the most stringent competitive requirements as a modern production and rd site industrial salt production in
lehrte will be discontinued




attracting and developing employees
as an innovative company we need talented and welltrained employees at all
sites we face the challenge of attracting talented people to our company and
retaining qualified employees particularly in europe and the united states but also
in china and other asian countries we must adapt to stronger competition for
specialists we are constantly seeking chemists pharmacologists medical
scientists biostatisticians biochemists business administration experts engineers
and it specialists as well as people who are able and willing to take on managerial
responsibility in emerging countries we face the particular challenge of attracting
qualified executives to our company the corporate hr unit within group human
resources is responsible for developing and steering strategic measures for
attracting talent and retaining employees employees of corporate hr at the legal entities are implementing the measures
locally


attracting young professionals
in 2010 we launched the make great things happen campaign to position ourselves globally as an attractive employer the
campaign highlights our strengths diverse career opportunities for contributing to the development and marketing of
innovative products in an international motivating and mutually respectful work environment in addition make great
things happen is also intended to reflect our strong social responsibility and our commitment to reconciling the demands of
a career and a family as well as work and leisure the positive impact of the campaign is confirmed by mercks ranking
among the best employers for experienced scientists in germany which was completed between june and november 2012
by the company universum following a survey of over 5000 participants merck reached sixth place out of 100 companies
which was an improvement of three places over 2011 by 2014 we want to revise the campaign in view of the repositioning
of our company within the fit for 2018 program furthermore in 2012 we adapted make great things happen in europe
and the united states in order to especially attract potential new employees for rd

we also regularly present ourselves as an employer at recruitment fairs in the 20112012 period we focused our presence
at fairs more strongly on potential young professionals for rd in addition we make targeted use of new media for example
the business networks linkedin and xing in order to recruit experienced professionals and executives we engage in a
dialogue with students via our facebook page for this target group we offer internships and mentoring programs within our
company in 2012 around 500 students completed an internship at merck in germany moreover in 2012 merck
participated as a founding partner in the careerloft initiative  an online and offline exchange platform for students
graduates and companies

in 2008 we launched a global electronic recruitment management platform in 2011 and 2012 we introduced it across all
business sectors and legal entities in europe except for austria as well as in singapore and thailand at the end of 2013 it
will be incorporated into the hr suite integrated data management system and thus be available groupwide

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                       56
 attracting and developing employees



identifying talent within the company
to ensure the longterm success of our company it is important to not only attract new talented employees to our company
but also to retain existing staff and enable them to participate in continuing education here our focus is on the personal
and professional development of employees as well as career opportunities within the company

regular feedback discussions and employee performance evaluations are essential to a systematic development process for
this purpose we introduced the performance management process at merck in 2008 which provides for annual feedback
discussions and performance evaluations for employees rated global grade 10 and higher in our position assessment system
apart from evaluating employee performance it helps us to identify individual development opportunities in addition we
assess whether our employees performance conforms to the merck values the legal entities are responsible for applying the
process also to employees in positions rated global grade 9 and lower in many cases these are subject to the regulations of
the collective agreement and specific local statutory requirements in 2011 and 2012 a total of 23800 employees took part
in the performance management process

in 2012 we refined the performance management process in order to better              2012
identify new talent within the company by means of performance evaluations the
new performance and talent process is also meant to strengthen the performance
culture at merck and to ensure that internal positions are filled in an even more       88
efficient manner it will be introduced incrementally starting in 2013 and is to be    of leadership positions filled with
completed for the entire merck group by the end of 2014 the process will thus         internal candidates
replace all previous tools in the areas of talent recruitment performance evaluation
skill development and compensation and will likewise become an integral element
of the new hr suite in 2012 we were already able to fill 88 of leadership positions with internal candidates


vocational and advanced training
advanced training for our employees is an investment in our future additionally we want to support our employees in
optimally developing their personal and professional strengths in 2012 we continued with our advanced training approach
and harmonized it globally the objective was to ensure that employees and managers around the world develop the skills
that we need in order to implement our business strategy and strengthen the merck culture

this also includes offering a catalog of advanced training courses that can also be adapted to specific regional needs if
required at the same time we also redefined good management practices based on five criteria and adapted our seminars for
all management levels accordingly this approach will be introduced globally in 2013

the us magazine training named emd serono in the united states as one of 125 companies that excel in employer
sponsored training and development programs

apart from our advanced training options we also offer three programs designed to develop and strengthen the leadership
skills of future executives the future leaders program supports employees in acquiring business and leadership skills in the
early phases of their career the participants take on strategic and crossfunctional projects and they work abroad for two
years within the scope of the ninemonth international management program managers are to strengthen their ability to
think globally in cooperation with top international universities the merck university offers a multiregional modular one
year program in 2011 and 2012 a total of 118 employees classified as talent took part in these programs additionally
merck cooperates globally with universities in order to support employees who wish to study for an executive mba in 2011
and 2012 five employees in europe graduated from the executive mba program at ashridge business school in the united
kingdom and the whuotto beisheim school of management in germany

we view company vocational training of young people as one of the most important ways to prevent a potential shortage of
trained staff due to demographic change in germany alone more than 500 young people completed an apprenticeship in
one of 23 vocations at merck in both 2011 and 2012 moreover in darmstadt we offer our oneyear inhouse work
preparation program called start in den beruf preparing to join the workforce in the 20112012 period ten secondary
school students who were previously unable to find an apprenticeship qualified themselves for the job market

in order to ensure the quality of vocational training in technical production occupations in darmstadt during the 20112012
period merck modernized the vocational training school pilot plant at the peter behrens school in darmstadt for more than
 1 million at the vocational training facility which spans around 200 square meters future chemical technicians and
chemical production specialists use computer simulations and technical apparatuses to familiarize themselves with large
scale production processes

merck zeitservice  supporting the restructuring process
with the personnel restructuring currently underway as part of fit for 2018 it is particularly important to be able to find
new placements for employees in other positions and units functioning as a hub merck zeitservice  mercks own internal
temp agency  helps to find new jobs within the group for employees whose positions have been eliminated in addition we
support employees who need specific advanced training in order to meet the requirements of a new position a team of hr
staff and works council members are overseeing the entire process


performancebased pay
competitive salaries and additional social benefits increase not only our attractiveness as an employer they also serve to
motivate and retain employees at merck compensation is based exclusively on market analyses in the relevant field and the
degree of responsibility as well as the competence and performance of the relevant employee initial analyses of the salaries
paid to men and to women do not reveal significant differences at the same hierarchical level

the global rewards policy introduced throughout the merck group in 2011 defines the framework for compensation and
additional benefits additional social benefits orient toward local legal and market conditions these may include for
instance sick pay or a retirement pension

strategies for health safety and the environment which is implemented through
numerous other guidelines at our individual sites we furthermore have company agreements on occupational health and
safety that have been entered into by employer and employee representatives


central ehs management with local managers

attendees about new ehs topics as well as updated guidelines and laws and furthermore encourage best practice sharing at
an expert level


reducing behaviorrelated workplace accidents
preventing behaviorrelated workplace accidents is an important aspect of operational occupational health and safety at
merck we aim to accomplish this by sensitizing our employees worldwide to potential hazards in the workplace in 2009 and
2010 we launched the selbst sicher program at our darmstadt and gernsheim sites and in 2011 we instituted this
program groupwide under the name besafe it features numerous activities and awareness campaigns that are intended
to reinforce our safety culture this includes workshops for managers at the individual sites and an information exchange
among ehs managers at a regional level who then instruct employees at the sites in addition individual legal entities in
latin america such as in brazil and mexico hold safety competitions at specific sites that also help bolster our safety
culture

since 2010 eq has been presenting the safety excellence award to all sites with no workplace accidents altogether 29 sites
from all regions received this award in 2011 and 42 in 2012 we are particularly pleased that many sites were awarded this
recognition for the third time

 occupational health and safety



promoting employee health
people are facing longer work lives as well as increasing demands from their careers in view of this we would like to bolster
our employees health as well as their capacity to perform their jobs through a wide array of healthpromoting measures
ergonomic evaluation of the workplace is one of the tasks our global ehs management organization at our darmstadt site
our company medical center offers checkups and medical services such as the early detection of diabetes and cancer travel
health advice as well as sociomedical and psychosocial advice the medical center also provides training seminars and
lectures on healthrelated topics

we rely on our employees personal responsibility and support their health awareness through local programs at the
darmstadt site for instance we work with the merck company health insurance fund called merck bkk to offer programs
and courses on healthy nutrition exercise and relaxation these range from back training to yoga to courses on how to quit
smoking we also offer courses on occupational health promotion activities such as movement and back exercises

another important component of mercks health promotion activities is our fitmerck program which enables employees
to participate in select health courses some of these are offered freeofcharge and others cost a nominal fee the courses
focus on prevention through movement and back health since a large percentage of missed work is attributable to back pain
take for example the fitback program in which employees can consult a physical therapist freeofcharge and have their
backs examined

furthermore employees in darmstadt can participate in our company sports program as of the end of 2012 it featured 23
different types of activities including badminton fitness training pingpong golf diving and tennis

 diversity and inclusion



diversity and inclusion
we believe that workforce diversity promotes innovation and better team
performance a good balance between different cultures nationalities and age
groups as well as between male and female employees is conducive to our
entrepreneurial success we have therefore set ourselves the goal of furthering
workforce diversity and including all employees in company operations in the best
possible way workforce inclusion increasing the proportion of women in
management positions is important to us internationality and demography are two
further areas of focus of our diversity activities during the 20112012 period we
launched a wide variety of measures to achieve our goals


new responsibilities  chief diversity officer
ultimate responsibility for diversity lies with kai beckmann executive board member and chief administration officer the
chief diversity officer cdo within group human resources is responsible for strategically managing diversity we
established this new position during the 20112012 period the cdo reports directly to the chief administration officer

in order to promote diversity to an even greater extent in 2013 we plan to set up a diversity council comprising executives
from all divisions and multiple group functions its tasks will mainly include refining the diversity and inclusion strategy


systematically promoting women
we want to increase the percentage of female employees wherever they are underrepresented in 2012 the 42 of the
positions in our company were held by women the ratio of female to male employees varied among the individual
businesses functions and regions in 2012 women made up 46 of the workforce in pharmaceuticals 37 in chemicals
and 42 in group functions in north america 46 percent of the workforce is female europe 45 the emerging markets
37 and rest of world 37 at 51 the percentage of research and development positions held by women is highest
followed by administrative positions with 50 the lowest percentages of women are in production 34 and infrastructure
30

in 2011 we decided to increase percentage of management positions held by             goal 2016
women to 2530 by 2016 in the same year merck joined with all 29 other
dax 30 companies in signing a voluntary commitment to increase the proportion of
management positions held by women the participating companies report on their        2530
progress every year                                                                   management positions held by women


at local level we have implemented numerous measures designed to increase the percentage of women in the entire
workforce and to specifically increase the number holding management positions for one we facilitate the worklife
balance for our employees in many countries for instance by offering flexible working hours and childcare options
furthermore women benefit from special advanced training measures seminars mentoring programs and networks during
the 20112012 period we conducted the women in mentoring program altogether 15 women took part with each being
mentored by a female executive since 2000 merck has been supporting local mentoring programs such as the cross
company mentoring  industry initiative or the hessisches mentorinnen netzwerk f√ºr frauen in naturwissenschaft und
technik a local german initiative in order to promote exchanges among women in management positions within the
merck group we initiated an internal women in leadership program at corporate headquarters in darmstadt in addition
we set up the groupwide merck international womens network in 2012 our chief diversity officer and the executive
board member with responsibility for human resources engage in regular exchanges with these groups

the overall percentage of management positions held by women was 24 in 2012 the percentage was higher at the legal
entities than at corporate headquarters in darmstadt it is also higher in pharmaceuticals than in chemicals in certain group
functions such as it women account for a lower proportion of management positions the results in the 20112012 period
show that we are not far from achieving our strategic goal of 2530 women in management positions by 2016 in 2013
we will launch further local and global measures to promote women in management with a special focus on women with
little or no management experience

promoting internationality
as a global company we promote the international and intercultural diversity of our workforce people from a total of 121
different nations work at merck only 26 of our workforce is from germany altogether our executive staff includes
representatives of 57 nationalities and 61 of our management positions were held by nongerman citizens

in order to promote the internationality of our workforce we pursue two goals when making appointments to new positions
firstly we aim to increase the number of local employees at all sites across all hierarchical levels and secondly we want to
offer our employees international development opportunities furthermore we help our employees to acquire intercultural
competencies for this purpose we promote intercultural training courses and international teamwork throughout the entire
merck group we offer special cultural immersion courses to executives working outside of their home countries this
includes for example language courses and international networks


demographic change
in germany several other eu countries and the united states we must prepare ourselves for demographic change in these
countries the average age of our employees exceeds 40  and we assume that this average will continue to increase in
europe we are using various programs to address these demographic challenges we seek young professionals for our
company in order to meet our longterm human resources needs we also promote the employability of our workforce and
are active in the area of employee retention this includes adapting workplaces to the needs of older people and establishing
a health management program to maintain their ability to do their job one example is the health management program in
cooperation with the company health insurance fund at the darmstadt site in germany employees older than 40 receive
special support in the form of the leben nach herzenslust living life to the full program when starting or resuming sports
activities


monitoring and controlling
each quarter we collect data on gender distribution nationality and demographics for internal evaluation purposes we
analyze these data at divisional and group function level as well as for key countries and groups of young professionals and
executives we present selected data in our annual report and corporate responsibility report as well as jointly with the
other 29 dax 30listed companies


training and sensitizing employees
the topics of diversity and inclusion are integral components of all training courses for human resources staff for instance
in 2012 we informed our international recruiting team on the relevance of these topics to merck and trained them
accordingly the aim of the workshop was to develop a common understanding of diversity and to discuss measures to adapt
our recruiting activities in addition we have added the topics of diversity and inclusion to the curricula of our management
courses offered to all employees with leadership responsibility

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                      62

preventing discrimination
our commitment to diversity also means that we do not tolerate discrimination anywhere in the world within our company 
whether based on age ethnic origin skin color nationality religion sexual orientation or disability

this rule is defined in our code of conduct cases of discrimination can be reported to supervisors or to group human
resources legal or compliance employees can also report discrimination cases anonymously via the speakup line a global
tollfree telephone hotline our compliance organization is responsible for processing the cases confirmed cases can lead to
disciplinary measures or consequences stipulated by labor law in 2011 and 2012 two cases of suspected discrimination
were reported via the speakup line however a review of the cases revealed that our regulations were not breached in
either of them

worklife balance
as a familyfriendly company we want to help our employees to achieve a good
balance between their professional and personal objectives for instance we help
them to maintain and strengthen their motivation and performance potential in
addition we further their trust in our company therefore our employees can make
use of flexible working models and childcare options making it easier for them to
achieve their personal goals we also offer our employees ways to better reconcile
the demands of a career while caring for family members as well as health
management support


flexible working models
in germany and other countries we offer numerous working model options these include individualized working hours and
locations

in 2011 and 2012 our employees made use of more than 20 different parttime models for instance varying weekly
working hours and individually agreed working days globally approximately 6 of our employees worked parttime

at the massachusetts sites of emd millipore in the united states we introduced a new work concept called flexworks
participation is voluntary and enables both fulltime and parttime workers to decide for themselves when and where they
work while meeting their contractually agreed working hours in our view this not only promotes the work effectiveness of
our people it also enables us to lower power consumption for unused offices and helps our employees avoid the stress of
commuting as of the end of 2012 147 employees were taking part in the program only one month after the project
started the commuting savings amounted to an average of 72 km or 70 minutes per participating employee

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                          63
 worklife balance


in 2012 merck introduced a new working model at the darmstadt gernsheim and grafing sites in germany based on a
working time honor system initially we piloted the myworkmerck model in 14 areas of the company altogether 350
nonexempt and exempt employees took part in the program enabling them to flexibly shape their working hours and
location as of mid2013 all exempts in germany with qualifying positions can make use of myworkmerck


entitlement to parental leave
at numerous sites our employees are able to take parental leave this possibility is also provided for by law in some countries
such as germany and the united states often we offer our employees better conditions than those required by law

in the united states employees are legally entitled to a 12week unpaid leave of absence per year in the event of the birth of
a child or illness of a family member in these cases emd millipore offers its employees financial support overall emd
millipore offers eight weeks of paid maternity leave two weeks of paid paternity leave and five weeks of paid leave when
adopting a child moreover emd millipore will reimburse up to us 5000 in adoption fees

the number of employees working for german merck companies in darmstadt gernsheim and grafing representing around
24 of merck group employees in 2012 who were on parental leave totaled 401 as of december 31 2011 and 434 as of
december 31 2012 fathers represented 30 of these totals parents returning to work after parental leave can find
information on possible childcare options on the intranet in addition presentations and meetings with parents are held by
merck in germany contacts are available at the darmstadt site for individual consultations


childcare options
at various sites our employees benefit from childcare options that we subsidize a daycare center for children from the ages
of one to twelve years has been operating at the darmstadt site in germany for more than 40 years it is supported by the
family of owners merckscher kindertagesst√§ttenverein e v the center is open yearround from 630 am to 515 pm
and offers 100 daycare slots at the end of 2013 a further 50 slots are going to be made available in addition the operating
hours will be extended at our headquarters in darmstadt employees can also make use of our emergency childcare service
if their regular childcare provider happens to be unavailable for employees at the gernsheim site in germany five slots are
available at a public daycare center

we have been offering vacation camps for the children of employees at the darmstadt site since 2008 and considerably
expanded the offer in 2011 and 2012 in 2012 a total of 275 vacation camp slots were available to parents who could book
them either on a daily or weekly basis the vacation camp program consists of sports activities art and research projects

in the united states emd millipore offers its employees assistance in finding the best childcare solution


reconciling demands of career and family
in an aging society more and more employees will be required to care for family members with special needs in darmstadt
merck has therefore been offering special information and consultation possibilities since 2009 this includes the services of
the local merck company health insurance fund which provides information such as contacts to nursing staff and offers
seminars on the challenges and costs of nursing care in the united states emd millipore supports its employees financially
by enabling nursing care to be paid out of gross income


award for familyfriendliness
in 2012 the charitable hertie foundation recognized the merck sites in darmstadt and gernsheim germany for the third
consecutive time as being familyfriendly the distinction is based on an audit on familyfriendliness which was
conducted using predefined criteria and is valid for three years

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                       64
 dialogue and codetermination



dialogue and codetermination
we believe that we can strengthen our employees trust in the company through
open and honest communication we therefore inform them regularly about the
latest developments


information and communication channels
we provide employees groupwide with a broad range of information on the latest
topics which we publish in different languages on the intranet in 2012 we
introduced the possibility for our employees to comment on the news items directly
online we set up an additional intranet platform for the fit for 2018
transformation program the platform provides information as well as a discussion
forum in addition numerous additional information media and dialogue forums are
in place examples include the international employee newspaper pro as well as
newsletters issued by the divisions and group functions our chemforum a
dialoguepromoting event for all employees working in the chemicals divisions was held 13 times in the 20112012 period


employee representatives and codetermination
we foster employee participation codetermination and dialogue in our company the merck euroforum is our employee
representative body at the european level and also serves as an information and advisory platform for a direct dialogue
between employees and senior management up to the executive board level topics that are addressed regularly include the
economic and financial situation of the merck group in europe the employment situation and also significant changes
within our company

moreover the individual sites have other forms of employee representation such as local works councils and unions local
works councils as well as a central group works council represent our employees in germany for instance senior executives
are represented by the senior executives committee

during the 20112012 period the fit for 2018 transformation program was a topic debated extensively by all employee
representative bodies in may 2012 around 30 euroforum participants from 14 countries spoke with the executive board
about the impact of the program on the workforce in 2013 our employees at the aubonne coinsins eysins and corsiersur
vevey sites in switzerland elected employee representative bodies for the first time in order to utilize this communication
channel with a view to the further implementation of fit for 2018


employee surveys
we introduced the pulse survey in 2009 initially conducting it every year and as of 2011 every two years through this
survey our employees have the opportunity to rate merck as an employer and to express their concerns anonymously the
results are used to devise and implement concrete measures in 2011 the results of the survey were slightly inferior to those
of previous years we ascribe this sentiment to fit for 2018 at the time of the survey the first measures from the program
had already been instituted at merck serono the next groupwide survey will take place in 2014 we are monitoring
employee sentiment during the current reorganization process by conducting smaller shortterm surveys for example
merck serono conducted this type of survey in 2012 we are planning to conduct employee surveys in additional units in
2013

 dialogue and codetermination



further possibilities for dialogue and exchange
our employees have other options for dialogue and feedback for instance the annual employee appraisal

at the darmstadt site in germany we want to use the company suggestion scheme to hone mercks competitive edge we
reward employees for the suggestions that are implemented by paying them bonuses based on the cost savings or the
contribution to occupational safety environmental protection and quality improvement merck employees submitted 4111
suggestions in 2011 and 3128 in 2012 for improvement these led to savings amounting to  19 million in 2011 and
 20 million in 2012 for this they received bonuses totaling  11 million in 2011 and  08 million in 2012 around 70
of the suggestions for improvement related to production areas the remaining 30 comprised suggestions pertaining to
analysis technology and logistics the suggestions helped significantly in many instances to optimize production processes
and occupational safety or to lower waste quantities and emission levels

our responsibility to protect the environment is derived from our values and our corporate strategy we aim to continually
improve our performance and reduce our impact on the environment by applying the precautionary principle this especially
includes utilizing resources such as energy water and raw materials both efficiently and economically furthermore we
strive to lower our emissions and waste so that we can reduce our costs as well as our impact on the environment as part of
our contribution to climate protection we have set a goal of reducing our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by
20 by 2020 measured against the 2006 baseline

our corporate ehs policy provides the framework for principles strategies and organizational structures for environment
health and safety at merck the policy is implemented through internal guidelines and instruction manuals such as the
merck group ehs security and quality manual which tells our employees how to apply the ehs principles in their dayto
day work our guidelines are based on the responsible care charter which the chemical industry drafted in 2005

overall responsibility for environment health and safety is born by executive board member bernd reckmann the merck
group function environment health safety security quality eq is responsible for globally steering all environmental
measures at the individual sites the local ehs managers are in charge of operational environmental protection measures

through internal and external audits eq monitors adherence to local environmental protection laws regulatory
requirements standards and business requirements during the 20112012 period the millipore sites acquired in summer
2010 were integrated into eqs structural organization and processes reporting was harmonized as well environmentally
relevant data are regularly collected at the individual sites via the lion electronic data management system the data are
then reported to eq mostly on a yearly basis but sometimes several times a year or even monthly

we manage our groupwide environmental protection activities through an environmental management system that
complies with iso 14001 all production sites are required to implement this environmental management system which is
annually certified by an accredited organization since 2009 merck has held an iso 140012004 group certificate for its
environmental management system which covered 49 sites at the end of 2012 new production sites must subsequently
set up and implement a certifiable environmental management system that conforms to group standards this has been

accomplished for the majority of the millipore sites acquired in 2010 at the remaining four millipore production sites
enough progress has been made in setting up the corresponding management systems that they are scheduled to be
externally certified and added to the group certificate in 2013

in both 2011 and 2012 we successfully passed the audit that is conducted every year in november as part of the
certification process during the audits the certifier identified only a few areas with potential for improvement at select sites
after which appropriate action plans were defined to address them

all employees with environmental protection responsibilities are trained on a continuous basis and obtain additional
qualifications besides local programs this training also includes the annual international ehs congress in darmstadt as well
as the regional ehs forum both events inform attendees about new ehs issues as well as updates to guidelines and laws
they furthermore encourage best practice sharing at an expert level

spending on environment health and safety totaled  141 million in 2011 and  146 million in 2012 these totals also
include investments made during the respective years

climate protection
climate change and its consequences one of the key challenges facing society in
the 21st century are already impacting life on earth today

being a responsible company we are resolute in our quest to help reduce
greenhouse gas emissions which we are accomplishing by lowering our
greenhouse gas emissions and by offering products that help our customers reduce
their own emissions in turn within the scope of the carbon disclosure project we
have been reporting for several years now in detail to our stakeholders  in
particular customers ngos and shareholders  regarding our activities measures
and achievements in addition our engagement in climate protection activities is
also of financial benefit since improved energyefficiency means that we save on energy costs pressure from a growing
number of statutory regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions  such as those found in emissions trading systems 
has also encouraged us to take action furthermore our customers are likewise increasingly expecting us to engage in
climate protection activities


steering activities centrally
the merck group function environment health safety security quality eq is responsible for globally steering all climate
protection measures at the individual merck sites operational units are responsible for implementing climate protection
measures

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                       69
 climate protection



strategic goal and edison program
in 2009 we set the goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 20            goal 2020
measured against the 2006 baseline in order to achieve this goal we initiated the
edison energy efficiency and climate protection program which consolidates the
climate protection activities of the merck group 20 sites worldwide are responsible    20
for around 80 of the greenhouse gas emissions at merck which is why edison is greenhouse gas emissions
focusing on these sites the reduction of our energyrelated emissions is one of our
primary measures to this end we are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
from our own energy generation as well as to enhance the energy efficiency of research and production processes
furthermore we wish to lower processrelated emissions through measures such as a quality control process at merck
millipore improving our building management in terms of energyrelated aspects is another measure that will contribute

eq collaborates with a crossdivisional working group founded in 2011 to create and implement climate protection projects
this working group develops measures itself and evaluates siterelated project proposals using a method it created to
systematically evaluate projects in 2012 the executive board of merck kgaa earmarked  10 million for projects of the
more than 130 approved projects we have initiated or successfully implemented around half this includes the construction
of a biomass power plant at our site in goa india and the cogeneration plant in gernsheim germany that will go on line in
mid2013

the executive board has also earmarked  10 million for 2013 as well some of this will be used to continue projects that
were launched in 2012 and some of it will go to support the 73 new projects that were submitted by the edison working
group in september 2012 and were approved through approximately 200 individual projects we are aiming to reduce
emissions by around 64000 metric tons of co2 per year in the medium term

energy management is another component of edison in 2012 the merck production sites in darmstadt and gernsheim
responsible for around 40 of mercks global energy consumption were certified to iso 50001 energy management
systems

the economical use and energy efficiency of company cars also constitutes part of our climate protection measures the
groupwide company car guidelines are being revised this year and will establish solid upper limits for vehicle co2 emissions


climate protection figures for 2011 and 2012
the merck group produced 521000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 and 516000 metric tons in 2012 in
2012 the sites that produced the most emissions included the darmstadt and gernsheim sites in germany the jaffrey new
hampshire and savannah georgia sites in the united states the cork site in ireland and the molsheim site in france
greenhouse gas emissions are reported in line with the greenhouse gas ghg protocol an international standard for
greenhouse gas emissions reporting merck currently reports scopes 1 and 2 of the ghg protocol scope 1 covers direct
emissions that the company produces itself through fossil fuel combustion or through its own processes scope 2 pertains to
emissions from consumption of purchased electricity heat or steam scope 3 includes emissions such as those from the
manufacture and transportation of raw materials products and waste or from employee business travel due to the
complexity of scope 3 emissions reporting merck is currently only reporting on scope 3 emissions from business travel
plane and train travel rental cars

the darmstadt and gernsheim sites in germany were also the merck groups largest co2 producers in 2011 and 2012 with
the cogeneration plant in darmstadt and the heating plant in gernsheim these two sites are subject to the eu emissions
trading system the final carbon credit allowances have not yet been defined for the third trading period 20132020
however based on the current status merck will have to purchase additional allowances


increasing employee awareness
we want climate protection to be lived throughout the whole company at several sites merck calls on employees to
contribute their own ideas for saving energy and conserving resources in the united states merck millipore also supports
employees personal climate protection activities such as incentives for installing solar panels in their homes with global
campaigns such as the energy month campaign merck millipore is increasing employees environmental awareness

in order to keep our employees informed we publish a selection of climate protection facts and figures on our intranet
furthermore various tools such as energy checklists or best practice examples are also available to help employees share

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                      70

information and learn from one another we also continuously provide information on climate protection at merck in our
employee newspaper and in an employee newsletter in addition to this we give our employees tips such as how to reduce
fuel consumption by modifying their driving habits as an incentive to use public transportation the darmstadt merck site
offers a job ticket for which the company covers part of the cost more than 3000 employees take advantage of this offer

resource consumption
for our business activities we require resources such as energy water and raw
materials as well as numerous other materials which we mostly utilize for
production purposes given that resources are becoming ever scarcer and more
costly efficient energy and material use is a crucial factor in staying competitive

through our groupwide program to continually improve business processes called
operational excellence oe we are aiming to achieve the most economic efficient
level of operation in all our production facilities all merck production sites were
included in the program in 2011 and 2012 in previous years the program focused
primarily on globalizing structures and processes as well as enhancing efficiency
for example utility management with an emphasis on energy management became mandatory for chemical production in
2012 after having already been applied to pharmaceutical production in 2011


energy consumption
in 2012 merck consumed 1438 gwh of energy which represents a slight decrease compared to 2011 1446 gwh

merck also operates its own plants to generate power and steam such as the gas turbine power plant in darmstadt and the
heating plant in gernsheim the power plant in darmstadt is a cogeneration plant which means that the heat created from
generating power is then utilized for other purposes using a generator a gas turbine transforms natural gas into power the
waste heat from the turbine and the hot exhaust resulting from combustion are then utilized to create steam and warm
water for production

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                            71
 water protection


in mid2013 a cogeneration plant is also scheduled to go on line in gernsheim which will save around 6000 metric tons of
carbon dioxide per year


water consumption
we utilized 176 million cubic meters of fresh water in 2011 and 162 million cubic meters in 2012 consisting of 33
groundwater 43 surface water and 24 water from the public water supply no sensitive water sources were impacted by
mercks water intake

the largest percentage of water 86 was utilized in europe 8 was used in asia australia and africa 5 in north
america and 1 in latin america


material consumption
merck especially utilizes production materials such as chemical and pharmaceutical raw materials in addition we also
employ operating supplies and packaging materials such as folding boxes glass bottles and ampules

we generally quantify the weight of purchased materials used directly in our chemicals and pharmaceuticalswe utilized
389 metric kilotons of these materials in 2011 and 360 metric kilotons in 2012 the portfolio of our merck millipore division
includes numerous devices and work instruments for whose production we need semifinished and finished materials such as
readyassembled electronic components or casing for devices we record these in unit numbers

the figures do not include packaging materials and operating supplies such as energy or lubricants




water protection
at merck water is used in production primarily for cooling as process water or for
exhaust air purification after being used the water may contain eutrophicating
substances heavy metals or active pharmaceutical ingredients apis the
treatment of this wastewater and thus the prevention of environmental pollution
is a fundamental part of our corporate environmental protection measures
worldwide

the merck group function environment health safety security quality eq which
is in charge of environmental protection bears overall responsibility for water
protection at the individual merck sites worldwide the local ehs managers are in
charge of this our employees regularly receive training and obtain additional
qualifications

in 20112012 merck made significant revisions to its groupwide water
protection standard based on our responsible care obligations this standard defines the processes and responsibilities
required for clean wastewater in the merck group and also covers the hiring of third parties to handle it

the standard also requires all sites to estimate the specific risks and effects of wastewater as well as to assess these risks and
effects using ecotoxicological data the individual sites must develop and implement a water pollution response plan that
features specific measures to prevent wastewater or reduce its volume this plan takes into account api emissions among
others and also defines the documentation process for wastewater volume point of origin and local limits

the standard also provides strict guidelines for wastewater handling via external service providers the wastewater quality to
be attained is if not already specified in law contractually defined as are the responsibilities involved furthermore service
providers are regularly audited

 waste management



waste management
for merck waste management is a key aspect of its corporate environmental
protection activities this includes measures to prevent and reduce waste as well as
recycling when possible and disposing of waste properly proper waste handling with
regard to occupational safety and storage on site is also of key importance

during the process development phase we pay particular attention to making the
processes efficient to minimizing the resulting waste and to ensuring that the
materials utilized pose as little danger to people and the environment as possible
we also work to optimize existing production processes efficient resource use is an
important goal here for costrelated reasons as well

the merck group function environment health safety security quality eq which is in charge of environmental protection
bears overall responsibility for waste management local ehs managers are in charge of this at the individual sites worldwide
ehs managers receive regular training from eq the type and quantity of waste is logged and documented at all sites

with our groupwide waste management standard we have introduced a uniform waste management framework for all
merck sites this standard defines organizational structures and processes and is regularly updated  the last update was in
august 2011

the majority of waste is recycled or disposed of externally as the generator of the waste merck is ultimately responsible for
the final disposal of the waste and selects its service providers with extreme care the terms and conditions for disposal are
contractually defined service providers are also required to properly document the disposal process they are regularly
audited by merck especially if they handle hazardous waste when possible waste such as solvents is also processed and
recycled inhouse

waste by disposal method




the merck group produced less waste in 2012 than in 2011 2012 189000 metric tons 2011 199000 metric tons as in
the past several years waste from construction and renovation projects had a strong influence on waste volume also in
2012 with 34 of the total waste volume consisting of construction excavation and demolition waste 2011 36 due to
a major demolition and renovation project at the darmstadt site large quantities of hazardous waste had to be disposed of in
2012 at the same time the volume of recyclable nonhazardous waste declined a large portion of this waste was generated
in 2011 during a major construction project in darmstadt that was completed in 2012 this impacted the recycling rate
which dropped from 60 in 2011 to 47 in 2012

 process and plant safety



process and plant safety
plant and process safety has high priority at merck safety system failures can lead
to the release of chemicals which can in turn impact people and the environment
as well as result in financial damage such as from production stoppages

the merck group function environment health safety security quality eq in
charge of environmental protection are the experts in plant and process safety
guidelines as well as all related topics at the individual merck group sites
worldwide local ehs managers have been appointed to handle issues pertaining to
plant and process safety

we apply the same uniform standard to plant and process safety across the globe
our groupwide plant and process safety standard mandates safetyrelated
requirements to be applied to the entire life cycle of a plant  including
construction normal operation modifications maintenance repair and shutdown
this standard applies to production plants and warehouses before a plant goes on line a safety concept is always developed
for each plant which is then continuously updated it contains an overview of potential risks and the corresponding
protective measures

the groupwide standard spillage control defines the organizational measures for preventing spillage during storage and
transport and also details how to handle hazardous materials the groupwide standard operating procedure risk
management process defines how to identify and assess risks as well as how to develop and implement measures to
minimize them

in order to continuously identify potential for improvement we assess the plant and process safety for each site using the
ehs performance indicators this gives us a comprehensive overview of safety at our sites here we use lagging indicators to
analyze incidents retrospectively and leading indicators to make a perspective analysis of nearincidents

data on spillage at our plants are evaluated using process safety indicators and are also incorporated into the overarching
ehs indicators in 2011 we registered 41 substance spills in total due to incidents at 108 production research and storage
sites in 2012 36 incidents were registered at 107 sites each individual incident was investigated at the respective site
appropriate countermeasures were taken in order to prevent the same scenario  or a similar one  from recurring
information on the incidents is regularly communicated so that all production sites can learn from the situation and
implement preventive measures

since plant and process safety involves the interaction of man and machine we consider it highly important for our
employees to be welltrained and to receive further training on a regular basis in 2012 a new internal continuing education
program was set up for site managers  as well as for production engineering and ehs managers at the individual sites  and
rolled out within the chemicals divisions the primary topics here included systematic risk identification in processing plants
explosion protection and static electricity




biodiversity
since the signing of the convention on biological diversity  the concept of
biodiversity has included diversity within species between species and of
ecosystems this convention signed in 1992 at the united nations conference on
environment and development unced  in rio de janeiro has the following
three main goals conservation of biological diversity sustainable use of its
components and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization
of genetic resources

the loss of biodiversity is one of the greatest challenges of our time ecosystems
provide us with services and resources such as sufficient quantities of goodquality
water that are absolutely essential to our business operations worldwide we therefore consider it extremely important to
protect biodiversity

merck corporate responsibility report 2012                                                                                        74
 process and plant safety


our production sites are located in established industrial and commercial zones and the corresponding operating permits are
reviewed via audits in order to prevent substances that could negatively impact biodiversity from being released into the
environment we plan and operate our facilities according to strict groupwide safety requirements in our groupwide
standards we have defined measures for processing waste and production wastewater we have furthermore implemented a
groupwide program called edison to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

we improve the habitats for animals and plants at our sites for instance by increasing the amount of unsealed surface area
this is however not always possible since we seal certain surfaces to protect them from any leakage that may occur

in 1995 we developed a green open space concept for our darmstadt site in germany around 30 of the premises have
now been greened the green areas are designed to improve the functionality of the production areas as well as enhance the
ecological value of the open areas in 2008 we signed an agreement with the city of darmstadt that established the
framework for increasingly taking nature conservation into account this agreement applies to the industrial use of the site
and its better integration into the urban surroundings the stipulated planning guidelines require for example an increase in
the percentage of native plants

when planning new sites and facilities we consider environmental aspects such as aeration land use structures that
contribute to a favorable microclimate and energyefficient building concepts for example when planning the expansion of
our site in corsiersurvevey switzerland we conducted a biodiversity study to protect the bordering alpine meadows we
developed a landscape plan in which the meadows are tended to by a local farmer

when we acquire new sites and investigate their environmental situation we also take into consideration information from
public sources such as neighbors or ngos we assume responsibility for the pollution we have caused and investigate our
sites before selling them

global projects fighting schistosomiasis with
praziquantel
over 200 million people in africa suffer from the widespread tropical worm disease
schistosomiasis it is estimated that more than 200000 die each year as a result of
this chronic parasitic condition which makes it the most common tropical disease
in africa after malaria schistosomiasis is widespread primarily in the tropical and
subtropical areas of subsaharan africa in these regions a vast majority of the
population has no access to clean water and sanitary installations

the disease is caused by flatworms and is spread through stagnant water people
become infected by the worm larvae in the water while bathing fishing playing
washing their clothes or working agricultural land these larvae penetrate human
skin and enter the blood vessels where they grow into adult worms the females eggs infest inner organs such as the
intestines bladder spleen or liver and often cause severe inflammation symptoms include severe abdominal pain diarrhea
and bloody urine or stool the infection rate is especially high among children and the chronic symptoms that result are
particularly serious schistosomiasis stunts growth causes learning disabilities and leads to anemia

merck has been supporting the world health organization who  since 2007 in
the fight against schistosomiasis in africa our efforts are thus in line with the       28 million
united nations millennium development goals in addition they are part of the
                                                                                       28 million children have been treated

melinda gates foundation in early 2012 merck donates tablets containing the
                                                                                       praziquantel donation program to
active ingredient praziquantel to who which then distributes these mainly to
                                                                                       combat schistosomiasis
african school children since the start of the merck praziquantel donation program
over 100 million tablets have been donated a total of more than 28 million children
have been treated in 2012 alone merck supplied who with over 27 million
praziquantel tablets in 2012 an estimated seven million children were treated for schistosomiasis final figures will be
available mid2013

praziquantel is the only active ingredient with which all forms of schistosomiasis can be treated in addition praziquantel is
welltolerated who has therefore included it on its model list of essential medicines merck developed praziquantel in the
1970s as part of a research collaboration our plant in mexico produces the tablets under the brand name cesol 600 we
organize and finance the transport to africa and who coordinates local distribution


program expansion
originally our program was scheduled to end in 2017 however merck decided at the end of 2011 to continue its efforts
indefinitely the goal agreed upon in conjunction with who is to eliminate the worm disease in africa to this end merck
intends to increase the number of tablets donated in the medium term raising the total to 250 million annually this will
allow around 100 million children to be treated each year

this planned donation has a value of approximately us 23 million per year in 2012 merck invested us 285 million
2011 us 23 million in the donation program these figures include the logistics costs to ship the tablets from the
production site in mexico to africa but not the costs for the awareness program or the research into a pediatric formulation


educating people
in addition to the tablet donation merck is also supporting an awareness program at schools in africa it uses comic booklets
    and posters to explain the causes of schistosomiasis teaching pupils how to prevent the disease in 2011 a pilot
project was launched at schools in senegal and malawi through 1100 brochures and 130 posters the project reached
around 1100 school children who is currently adapting the materials based on the experience gained from the pilot
regions in 2013 the program is being launched in senegal with 750000 brochures and in malawi with 250000 brochures

optimizing the formulation
as part of the donation program expansion merck is also working to optimize the formulation of the drug for instance
pharmaceutical experts are currently developing a fruity coating intended to make it easier for children to take the tablets


research
within the scope of a publicprivate partnership ppp merck is researching a formulation of praziquantel for small
children praziquantel tablets in their current form are suitable for adults and children over the age of six for children
younger than six it is currently not possible to properly treat the disease we believe that a pediatric formulation of
praziquantel will be a significant step toward eliminating schistosomiasis in africa the partners of this publicprivate
partnership which was founded in july 2012 include merck ti pharma  astellas pharma inc and the swiss tropical and
public health institute swiss tph  in basel


managing and monitoring
the merck praziquantel donation program mpdp is being conducted in partnership with who with merck and who each
contributing their particular expertise merck produces the tablets and handles the costs for transporting the tablets to africa
who manages monitors and documents the local distribution of the praziquantel tablets and works with local authorities to
implement the treatment at schools who supplies the local data on morbidity rates and treatment frequency in the
countries in which the merck praziquantel donation program has been rolled out the data for each country can be found in
the who pct databank  a steering committee consisting of representatives from who and merck convenes several times
a year in order to review the programs progress and decide on its future course the last meeting was held in kenya in
november 2012

global projects combating counterfeit medicines with
the minilab
substandard and counterfeit medicines pose a deadly hazard interpol estimates that
up to 30 of all medicines in developing health care systems fall into this category
the global pharma health fund gphf  a nonprofit initiative funded by merck
is dedicated to fighting counterfeit medicines the minilab developed by the gphf is
able to detect counterfeit medicines quickly easily and cheaply two test kits each
weighing around 30 kilograms contain a large number of test methods that state
health care workers in developing countries can use to inspect pharmaceuticals
reference samples are used to test the identity and concentration of altogether 63
active ingredients in total ranging from antimalarial drugs to antibiotics up to
analgesics and antipyretics

 global projects deutsche philharmonie merck


the gphf developed the minilab specifically for use in regions with a simple infrastructure the rapid analyses do not rely on
external power sources and normal drinking water suffices for the tests there is currently no other product like it to date
the gphf has supplied 578 minilabs at cost to 86 countries more than half of these countries are in africa and one third of
them are in asia the minilabs are primarily utilized by local health authorities often in collaboration with labs for
governmental drug inspection centers

merck participates in external research with the aim of increasing the number of medicines that can be tested in 2011 and
2012 the gphf developed testing methods for seven other pharmaceuticals each and updated the user manuals
accordingly the gphf also offers training courses in order to familiarize users with the test procedures in 2012 training
courses were held in russia myanmar angola germany and indonesia

a total of 77 minilabs were supplied in 2011 and 100 in 2012 in addition to selling them at cost which is handled via a
distribution partner both the gphf and merck donate minilabs in individual cases in 2012 merck donated ten minilabs to
the angolan ministry of health and the gphf donated five labs to the ministry of health of zambia five to the ministry of
health and welfare of tanzania and one to the ghanaian ministry of health

 local responsibility




local responsibility
it is also imperative to show responsibility at the local level in accordance with the
merck values we call upon all of our legal entities to assume responsibility for their
local communities after all they foster an open dialogue with their neighbors and
therefore know where merck can make the most valuable contributions the
individual companies can orient their activities toward our groupwide framework
which defines the following areas of focus for local engagement health education
environment culture and sports in the vicinity of our sites in 2011 and 2012 the
legal entities participated in more than 120 projects these are often longterm
projects that are sponsored by merck for multiple years numerous initiatives are
either supported or even started up by employees in 2011 3675 employees
strengthened corporate engagement at merck by making donations or doing volunteer work for charitable purposes and in
2012 6987 employees did so

examples include constructing and running a hospital on the island of baba bhit in pakistan as well as sponsoring projects to
help integrate disadvantaged youth in brazil the legal entities in india and china award scholarships that enable young
people to receive a good education which they could otherwise not afford without support employees at our legal entity in
guatemala are building houses for underprivileged people in collaboration with a charitable organization in addition to this
we provide disaster relief in 2011 this went to the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in japan as well as the victims of
the flooding in thailand

merck employees have been included in the calculation of the indicators but supervised employees of external companies
and independent contractors have not been taken into account

using the ltir we record workrelated accidents of merck employees that involve at least one day of missed work a work
related accident is an injury that results from the type of work in the course of doing said work and that has no internal
cause cumulative trauma workrelated accidents are considered relevant if they occur on the premises on business trips
during a transport accident in the course of external influences eg natural disasters or due to criminal acts involving
personal injury commuting accidents and accidents during company sporting activities are not included firstaid incidents
are generally not included in the ltir since these usually do not result in more than one day of missed work

through systematic accident prevention measures such as training and campaigns to strengthen our corporate safety
culture we attained an ltir of 20 in 2011 and an ltir of 23 in 2012 we are working to lastingly stabilize the ltir

for merck kgaa 24 of the employees of the merck group we report workrelated illnesses if these have been diagnosed
and certified by a physician in the 20112012 period one case of workinduced illness was reported we do not keep track
of the number of workrelated illnesses throughout the entire merck group

for all other employees that do not participate online in this globally uniform process other methods of performance
assessment are available thus in 2012 98 of employees took part in a performance and development evaluation

    w ho took parental leave during the calendar year but w ho had returned by dec 31
 since parental leave can be taken for a period ranging from one month to three years it is possible for employees to be
    recorded across a period of up to four calendar years this explains w hy the number of employees on parental leave exceeds

  indicated here is the primary means of transport


in shipping finished goods from production sites to local warehouses of the legal entities we are working to reduce the use of
air shipping in favor of sea shipping in doing so we cut costs and reduce the co2 emissions incurred by transporting goods
in 2012 this switch led to savings of 2000 metric tons of co2

for spending on social engagement we calculate product donations at their fair value except for the praziquantel donated
within the merck praziquantel donation program whose value is calculated according to the who guidelines for medicine
donations

the increase in spending from 2011 to 2012 is largely attributable to the erbitux china patients aid program ecpap in
which we work with the beijing red cross foundation to provide this drug freeofcharge to lowincome patients with
colorectal cancer the program has reached 510 patients in 97 hospitals across 35 cities in china

we assign the motivations for our engagement to categories based on the model of the london benchmarking group and the
guidelines of the bertelsmann foundation for corporate social engagement projects that primarily aim to make
improvements within the community are classified as community investment projects that are predominantly aimed at
companyrelevant factors such as image or personnel recruitment are classified as commercial initiatives in the
community charitable activities comprises any other projects that benefit a charitable organization but cannot be
assigned to either of the other two motivation categories due to missing data or their narrow scope
