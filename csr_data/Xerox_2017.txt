preserving the planet

responsible operations
reducing our companywide environmental footprint
with goals to reduce environmental impacts across our value chain we invest in innovative solutions
that can conserve natural resources and lower the energy intensity of our operations a few examples of
our most recent successes include


     water recycling project which uses reverse osmosis reject water for secondary use this project
     was implemented in mid2016 and has recycled more than 265000 gallons 1003 million liters of
     reject water which would have otherwise been discharged to the sewer
     energyefﬁcient technologies such as emulsion aggregation ea toner which is estimated to
     generate 28 percent fewer greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the manufacturing process than
     conventional toner
     energy management and equipment upgrades such as utilizing outdoor heat exchange systems to
     cool process water in winter months rather than powered industrial chillers and replacing
     outdated heating and cooling systems with energyefﬁcient and digitallycontrolled models
     renewable energy used to power our netherlands facilities and renewable energy certiﬁcates to
     offset energy use at our wilsonville oregon facility
     efﬁciencypromoting initiatives including purchasing energyefﬁcient lighting and vehicles reducing
     packaging sizes mileage tracking and route improvements

generally accepted international units


the data presented is based on actual measurements to the extent possible where direct
measurements are not available we employ engineering calculations or estimates we continue to strive
to increase the accuracy of the data we report


all of our major manufacturing and distribution operations employ an environmental management
system that conforms to iso 14001 the system


     establishes a framework to ensure compliance with regulations and xerox standards
     identiﬁes environmental impacts and sets objectives and performance targets
     pursues continual improvement in conserving natural resources eliminating the use of toxic and
     hazardous materials preventing pollution and recovering reusing and recycling materials
     ensures integration between daytoday business activities and environmental planning and
     program management
     encourages innovative solutions creative partnerships and employee involvement

our major manufacturing operations have been certiﬁed to iso 14001 since 1997 our major worldwide
technology equipment distribution centers achieved certiﬁcation in 2010 quarterly status meetings and
use of a newly deployed scorecard provide visibility best practice sharing and innovation across our
operations


energy goal 2020
in 2003 we made a public commitment to reduce ghg emissions  our carbon footprint  by joining
the us environmental protection agency epa climate leaders program and launching our own

internal energy challenge 2012


this 10year initiative set a goal to reduce ghg emissions across all company operations by 10 percent
by 2012 we met this target six years ahead of schedule so we set a new target of 25 percent
reduction by 2012 from a 2002 baseline at the conclusion of the program we successfully cut
emissions by 42 percent  thats 210000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents co2e  and reduced
energy consumption by 31 percent


our new corporatewide goal is to reduce energy consumption and ghg emissions by 20 percent by
2020 from a 2012 baseline in 2016 we met our new goal by reducing energy consumption by 20
percent and cut ghg emissions by 28 percent  thats 92000 tons of co2e


excludes data centers numbers energy challenge 2012 included ﬂeet and facilities for the technology business and
services where colocated energy goal 2020 encompasses all parts of our business



energy consumption




energy and ghg emissions totals are associated with fuel consumption by companyowned ﬂeet and natural
gaselectricity consumption in facilities vendor invoices from utility and fuel providers are the preferred source of data
when unavailable estimates have been used


in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol and to make annual data comparable we adjust the energy and
emissions data each year as a result of the opening and closing of facilities and more appropriate emission factors that
are available

greenhouse gas inventory
in accordance with the international guidelines of the greenhouse gas protocol developed by the world
resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development we track the six major
ghgs carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydroﬂuorocarbons hfcs
perﬂuorocarbons pfcs and sulfur hexaﬂuoride sf6 as noted we express our carbon footprint in
terms of carbon dioxide equivalents co2e


energy sources account for more than 99 percent of our ghg emissions our ghg inventory includes
direct emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels primarily natural gas and indirect emissions from
purchased electricity and steam at our manufacturing sites ofﬁces and warehouses the inventory also
includes the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels in our service and sales vehicle ﬂeet


as a result of the opening and closing of facilities and changes to the ﬂeet inventory baseline
adjustments are made each year which are reﬂected in the energy consumption and ghg emission
charts in 2016 we expanded our ghg tracking of indirect or scope 3 emissions to include endoflife
treatment of sold products we also continue to track scope 3 emissions from employee business travel
product transport employee commute and waste generated in operations


in 2016 xerox ghg emissions totaled 233305 metric tons of co2e which is a 28 percent reduction
from a 2012 baseline and surpasses our 2020 reduction target of 20 percent about 56 percent of the
ghg emissions total were indirect emissions from purchased electricity and steam the remaining 44
percent were direct emissions from the combustion of natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel xeroxowned
or leased facilities such as manufacturing sites ofﬁces and warehouses are associated with 54 percent
of our direct ghg emissions the remaining 46 percent are direct emissions from our service and sales
vehicle ﬂeet and other mobile sources


greenhouse gas emissions




scope 3 emissions
scope 3 emissions result from activities commissioned by xerox but take place at a third party andor
arise from sources not owned or controlled by xerox therefore the collection of indirect or scope 3
ghg emissions is challenging the probability of data inaccuracy with scope 3 emissions is higher than
for scope 1 or 2 emissions for several reasons these include the limited availability of data from the

supply chain and the more tiers of suppliers there are in the system the more onerous the data
collection process is in order to overcome some of these challenges we calculate scope 3 emissions
according to the greenhouse gas protocol corporate value chain scope 3 accounting and reporting
standard this standard provides requirements and guidance to collect prepare and publicly report a
ghg inventory that includes indirect emissions the scope 3 emissions information is also used to
prioritize our ghg emission reduction efforts and to integrate consideration of carbon impact into our
sourcing and internal decisionmaking


third party ghg veriﬁcation
our 2016 scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 ghg emissions have been veriﬁed by a third party
veriﬁcationassurance company in accordance with iso 1406432006 against our internally deﬁned
methodology described in xerox corporation greenhouse gas emissions inventory management plan
version 2 december 2016 and the principles of transparency accuracy consistency completeness and
relevance


climate change risks and opportunities
xerox has examined the regulatory physical and commercial risks and opportunities associated with
climate change across our value chain


we assess and manage our carbon risk by maintaining both a comprehensive ghg emissions inventory
and a mature regulatory tracking function that provides the necessary information to stay abreast of
developing regulation we do not consider our company to be subject to unique risks due to changing
weather patterns rising temperatures and sea level rise but we recognize that our business and our
customers could be affected by more frequent disruptions as a result of severe weather in locations
where we operate we may need to invoke our business continuity and resumption plans to aid
customers and employees who are impacted by business disruptions on account of severe weather we
have experience working to ensure continuity of critical applications by prioritizing business needs and
developing customerspeciﬁc preparedness plans where appropriate these plans include communication
with employees and customers management of employee health and safety issues business continuity
and resumption processes as well as interaction with government organizations


we recognize that the increasing costs of energy and concerns around energy security are issues that
affect both our operations and our customers to meet our commitment for reducing energy use and
protecting the climate our longterm strategy is to continue to invest in technologies that reduce the
carbon footprint of our operations and develop technology solutions that help our customers to reduce
the energy and environmental impacts of their business


preserving clean air and water


air emissions
xerox has signiﬁcantly reduced manufacturing air emissions over the past 20 years but we continue to
pursue efforts to do even more


most of our air emissions originate from the production of imaging supplies such as toner
photoreceptor drums and belts as well as fuser rolls approximately 25 metric tons of volatile organic
compound voc process air emissions voc and nonvoc were released to the atmosphere from these
activities in 2016 emission reductions over time primarily have come from process modiﬁcation lower
production volumes of legacy products and production declines attributable to longerlife components

volatile organic process air emissions




emissions for years 2013 through 2015 are based on actual usage records since usage records were not available for
2016 quantities were estimated based on a survey assuming worst case scenarios actual air emissions for 2016 may be
lower than shown


a subset of these voc emissions is deﬁned by the us environmental protection agency epa as
hazardous air pollutants hap in 2016 xerox reported worldwide air emissions of approximately 53
metric tons of hap under national toxic chemical release regulations including the us toxic release
inventory tri program methylene chloride methyl isobutyl ketone mibk 13butadiene and styrene
represent virtually all of these hap emissions

2016 hap air emissions
as reported under national toxic release regulations




ozonedepleting substances
xerox policy prohibits the use of ozonedepleting substances ods as ingredients in the manufacturing
processes for products and ﬁnished products including spare parts accessories consumables and
packaging ods used as refrigerants in facility and vehicle air conditioning systems and various
foodequipmentcooling systems are in compliance with applicable global regulations elimination of
ods as refrigerants is managed consistent with government phaseout dates


toxic chemical releases
the release of materials used in our worldwide operations is evaluated annually and reported to
government agencies under national toxic chemical release reporting regulations such as the us tri
the canadian national pollution release inventory and the european pollutant release and transfer
register releases for reporting year 2016 remained unchanged compared to 2015 levels and were 75
percent lower than 2007 levels note 2015 values are updated in this report to include approximately 5
metric tons of releases and transfers that were inadvertently excluded at that time

reportable toxic chemical releases and transfers




in 2011 operations with reportable toxic chemical releases to the air land or water  in amounts of
greater than one metric ton  established goals targets and objectives related to chemical releases
progress against these goals as of yearend 2016 is summarized below


     an initiative to reclaim spent methyl isobutyl ketone mibk continued to exceed expectations in
     the ﬁfth full year of implementation recovered solvent was qualiﬁed for use as a cleaning solvent
     for the ﬂuid delivery systems used in us fuser roll coating operations as a result the amount of
     virgin mibk purchased in 2016 for use in the manufacturing operation has been reduced by 43
     percent from the 2010 baseline on a normalized perpart basis
     methylene chloride used in the manufacture of xerox photoreceptor belts was reduced by 70
     percent from the 2010 baseline greatly exceeding target this dramatic decrease was primarily
     due to volume declines of legacy products and process modiﬁcations that cut the amount of
     methylene chloride used for batch cleaning of production equipment
     perbatch emissions of 13butadiene from us toner resin manufacturing operations decreased
     slightly exceeding target in 2016 lowemission hose connectors and incidentfree material
     handling operations contributed to this result

spills and accidental releases
our goal is to proactively prevent any release of regulated materials to air soil and water in 2016 ten
reportable spills or releases occurred at xerox operations most of these spillsreleases were minor in
nature contained and had little to no impact on the environment while only two releases were
relatively signiﬁcant the ﬁrst signiﬁcant release occurred at our webster new york facility where 045
metric tons of methylene chloride was released to the air over the course of several hours as a result of
equipment failure the second signiﬁcant release occurred in ontario canada where 32000 liters of
wastewater was prematurely discharged to the sanitary sewer from toner manufacturing operations due
to a programming error while the reporting of these spills is not a gri requirement they are included
in this report for the purpose of transparency xerox received no ﬁnes or nonmonetary sanctions for any
spills in 2016 and corrective measures were implemented to minimize the potential for these incidents
to occur in the future

water consumption and treatment
as part of our commitment to conserve resources we monitor water consumption across our
manufacturing distribution and rd facilities worldwide water consumed by xerox operations is
sourced from local municipal suppliers that withdraw water from the ground lakes rivers or other
surface waters


in 2016 we exceeded our goal to reduce water consumption by 35 percent against a 2010 baseline
years ahead of our targeted date of 2020 our annual water consumption was down 43 percent due to
a combination of conservation initiatives and production declines


a pilot program was initiated at our plant in wilsonville oregon to evaluate the use of reverse osmosis
reject water for secondary use this project was implemented in mid2016 during the year more than
265000 gallons 1003 million liters of reject water  which would have otherwise have been sewered 
were reused onsite in cooling towers


the water discharges at manufacturing sites are monitored to validate compliance with local sanitary
sewer discharge limits wastewater from manufacturing processes is treated as necessary before being
discharged into local sanitary sewers we utilize best practices to prevent unwanted pollutants from
entering waterways via surface contamination and runoff extensive sampling of wastewater
discharged to both sanitary and storm sewers ensures that discharged water meets our strict
requirements although xerox has not established a goal for reduction of wastewater discharges it is
worth noting that water discharged from our facilities in 2016 was approximately 32 percent lower 731
million liters than in 2010 these results also can be attributed to water conservation initiatives and
production declines

preventing and managing waste


hazardous waste
in 2016 the amount of hazardous waste generated was 11 percent higher than in 2015 as a direct
result of decommissioning activities at a european manufacturing site production increases and a raw
material contamination incident xerox beneﬁcially managed 75 percent of the hazardous waste
generated in 2016 through recycling andor fuels blending technologies


xerox does not export hazardous waste to developing nations a thirdparty supplier recovers spent
mibk which is returned to the generating manufacturing operation for reuse solid and liquid hazardous
waste streams that have an adequate btu value are managed via a fuels blending program an offsite
waste disposal vendor blends these waste streams to meet the speciﬁcations provided by cement kilns

2016 hazardous waste management methods




nonhazardous solid waste
xerox has had waste reduction efforts in place for many years we reuse boxes pallets and containers
for parts delivery we capture toner that is outside the acceptable size range during manufacturing
recycle returned equipment and reuse totes for recycling scrap metal and paper

globally operations generated 39000 metric tons of nonhazardous solid waste in 2016 down from
47100 metric tons in 2015 process waste consists primarily of paper wood pallets waste toner
plastics and packaging waste such as corrugated cardboard equipment manufacturing waste includes
scrap metal waste batteries and lamps miscellaneous trash and nonusable endoflife equipment and
parts that our customers return to xerox for processing and remanufacturing this waste made up about
73 percent of the nonhazardous solid waste managed by xerox operations in 2016 xerox is able to
reuse or recycle nearly 100 percent of the waste generated from our customer returns


our goal is to attain a reuserecycle rate of 100 percent by 2020 at facilities globally compared to a
baseline year of 2009 in 2015 and 2016 we managed 94 percent of nonhazardous solid waste
beneﬁcially up from 93 percent in 2014 the increased reuserecycle rate is attributed to an increase in
our manufacturing operations using energyfromwaste technology as a means of dispositioning waste
that is not recyclable additionally in 2016 our equipment resellers were able to return a greater
number of products to the marketplace for resale that resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of all non
hazardous waste please note that the reuserecycle rate has been revised from previous years to more
accurately represent nonhazardous waste management methods

environmental remediation and compliance
in 1985 we voluntarily assessed our real estate portfolio globally and identiﬁed 68 facilities with
environmental contamination we worked closely with the appropriate federal state and local agencies
to initiate prompt and appropriate measures to ensure the protection of employees neighbors and the
environment

today only two of the original 68 sites require active remedial or control measures we have effectively
removed or greatly reduced the source areas of contamination and have remediated these properties for
reuse or redevelopment we are now completing postremediation compliance monitoring at sites that
are no longer subject to active remediation which will enable the regulatory process for managing these
sites to be terminated ofﬁcially


in addition to using conventional techniques for groundwater recovery and treatment and soil
excavation we have a history of developing innovative technologies to enhance our remedial efforts
these included techniques that improve and accelerate the recovery of contaminants such as high
vacuum 2phase extraction and enhanced bedrock fracturing we also employ technologies where
contaminants are converted to lessharmful substances through enhanced natural biodegradation and
chemical oxidation


compliance reporting
we require our operations and subsidiaries worldwide to report allegations of regulatory non
compliances to our environmental health safety and sustainable ehss group for evaluation and
corrective action where appropriate in 2016 two instances resulted in a notice of violation one notice
was due to water discharges exceeding wastewater discharge limits the second notice involved the lack
of registration on a petroleum bulk storage tank no ﬁnes or nonmonetary sanctions were issued for
either notice of violation corrective actions have been completed and appropriate controls implemented
to ensure ongoing compliance

preserving the planet

sustainable services and products
we consider environmental priorities in the design of our products and services its better for our
customers our business and the environment we solicit feedback from clients and other stakeholders
and take a forwardlooking view of global trends in technology regulations and ecolabels weve
developed a comprehensive sustainability program based on global standards and quantitative analysis


samples of our work


     charter partner of the us environmental protection agency epa energy star program 100
     percent of all new eligible xerox product introductions meet energy star 20 requirements for
     imaging equipment
     since the inception of ieee 16802 imaging equipment standard epeat in 2013 xerox has
     registered all newly launched ofﬁce products to this set of performance criteria we have a 100
     percent compliance rate for epeat audits
     through a partnership since 2006 with the nature conservancy the xerox foundation grants of
     more than 2 million have helped preserve and protect globally important forests

reducing environmental impact through our services and solutions
our expanding managed print services business in combination with our extensive print ﬂeet offers
solutions that reduce energy consumption and improve environmental performance


our equipment and software is designed to help customers operate efﬁciently the earth smart
feature integrated into the xerox global print driver brings several resourcesaving settings together at
the single click of a button these features such as duplex twosided printing nup multiple pages per
sheet proof print and toner saving modes make it easier for customers to make responsible print
choices our xerox enterprise print services customers have access to sophisticated print management
and reporting tools such as xerox print agent which provides additional methods of encouraging and
tracking responsible print behaviour software products such as docushare and freeflow digital
workﬂow collection help xerox customers reduce paper consumption by facilitating electronic data
management scan to email printondemand and distributethenprint workﬂows


xerox has also been exploring creative ways to engage employees in the sustainability effort the
xerox print awareness tool is a unique managed print service approach to sustainability management
and reducing print volumes by using this tool users can see their print usage using an easy interactive
desk interface and take steps to improve print behaviour through each users contribution to
improvement customers get one step closer to decreasing overall print costs and achieving corporate
social responsibility and sustainability goals in 2014 xerox launched completeview pro another tool
in the managed print assessment process that in part provides customers with a sustainability analysis
documenting the environmental impact of print output such as power consumption and co2 emissions
by device and site learn more at managed print services


using the full suite of managed print service tools we work with customers to improve the efﬁciency of
ofﬁce document management by assessing printing needs and developing solutions using this
approach customers can better achieve these goals


       energy and greenhouse gas reduction print asset optimization and updates improve energy
       consumption reduce greenhouse gas impact and reduce waste materials
       reduced paper usage using both print authentication and authorization along with gamiﬁcation
       techniques print behaviors can be changed to reduce unnecessary prints
       reduce waste newer more sustainability print technologies and consumables drastically reduce
       the amount of waste generated from printing practices

       digital transformation other paper reductions comes from adoption of digital workﬂows
       integrated with enterprise content management ecm digital alternatives

in addition we use a comprehensive design for the environment approach when designing and
developing our products so that environmental impacts are minimized throughout the supply chain


standards
our product standards encompass the following energy efﬁciency chemical management packaging
parts reuse and recycling electrical and mechanical safety ergonomics electromagnetic emissions
noise ﬁre resistance and materials safety xerox business teams and our environmental health safety 
sustainability ehss organization review our products at each stage of the development process for
conformance with environmental health and safety standards which is a requirement for the
introduction of any product all xerox standards ensure our products have the appropriate labels and
information needed to meet all safety and environmental label requirements to keep our customers
appropriately informed all products meet required industry labeling standards for each market


lifecycle assessment
xerox integrates lifecycle thinking into all of our product and service development activities as well as
our innovation activities lifecycle assessments lcas are a means of technically evaluating the
environmental impact of a products materials manufacturing distribution use and endoflife we
conduct full lcas  in accordance with the appropriate iso standards  to determine where in the
product lifecycle the largest environmental impacts arise and to compare products with a signiﬁcant
difference in technology full peerreviewed lcas have been performed on our solid ink products 8860
8870 8700 and colorqube 9200 series and many of our laser technology devices workcentre
53253035 workcentre 594555 and phaser 7100 many of these lcas directly contributed to our
achieving the electronic products environmental assessment tool epeat gold certiﬁcation for these
conﬁgurations and provided valuable input to our design teams to determine future opportunities for
reductions in environmental impacts we encourage our customers to learn more about how their
printing behavior affects the overall carbon footprint of their organization from a lifecycle perspective


product design
xerox has long incorporated environmental considerations into product design internal processes ensure
that product design teams are informed about regulatory and market driven changes affected by
product design these processes ensure that product design teams are able to incorporate timely
environmental and product safety considerations scientists in our materials research group evaluate
aspects of safety energy materials and sustainability sems using a tool we developed that enables
researchers to quickly compare the current design with a future proposed design the tool challenges
designers to think about the whole lifecycle of the product and recognize any positive or negative
impacts to the environment by using sems we can quantify energy reductions reduce risk of regulated
materials and track progress over time sems was designed to be used in early research and
development stages to understand tradeoffs and help make decisions


epeat
for ofﬁce products xerox uses epeat as the foundation of our design for environment program a
comprehensive environmental rating system epeat identiﬁes electronic equipment that meets speciﬁc
criteria the diagram below shows the rigor of the system epeat is composed of criteria spanning
corporate and product requirements 50 requirements for imaging equipment when a company and
product meets these criteria it must pass a third party desk review only after a satisfactory review the
product can be registered and veriﬁed annually to ensure compliance

epeat combines comprehensive criteria for design production energy use and recycling with ongoing
independent veriﬁcation of manufacturer claims epeat criteria reﬂect several categories of
environmental attributes that span the lifecycle of electronic products material selection design for
endoflife product longevitylife extension energy conservation endoflife management corporate
performance packaging consumables and indoor air quality xerox continues to support epeat
initiatives and has a representative on the epeat advisory council to promote collaboration among
stakeholders and aid in the success of the program moving forward since 2014 xerox has committed to
launching all new ofﬁce products with epeat silver or gold certiﬁcation for example all new versalink
and altalink products are epeat silver or gold as we continue to design our products with the
environment in mind xerox is the only company to claim all eight epeat corporate optional criteria

reducing energy use through our products technology and initiatives


     energy star
     more than 10 years before the inception of the us epa energy star ofﬁce equipment
     program xerox introduced the ﬁrst imaging product with an automatic powerdown mode since
     joining with the epa as a charter partner in 1993 we continue to introduce copier printer fax and
     multifunction products that have earned energy star status even as the certiﬁcation criteria
     have grown more stringent

     in 2016 100 percent of all our new eligible product introductions achieved energy star this
     continued success in cutting the power consumption of our laserbased printing products has been
     achieved by adjustments in the fuser design changes to the properties of the toner more efﬁcient
     electronic controls and the workings of the xerographic system as a whole

     the energy star program as noted introduces progressively more stringent requirements over
     time the most recent revision went into effect on january 1 2014 while the standard was
     challenging to meet our goal remains to have 100 percent of our new products achieve this label
     xerox and other industry members are working with the epa to establish the next set of
     requirements which will be energy star imaging equipment 30 xerox will keep on meeting
     these new targets in the coming years these energy requirements serve as the foundation for
     other ecolabels such as epeat and blue angel and show our ongoing commitment to reduce
     product energy consumption

     multifunction devices
     our multifunction systems further reduce the amount of energy required to copy print fax and
     scan by combining the functions of multiple products into one machine the annual energy savings
     of replacing several individual energy starqualiﬁed copiers fax machines and printers with one

     xerox energy starqualiﬁed workcentre multifunction system is up to 50 percent energy
     savings would be substantially higher if a multifunction system replaces individual products that
     have not earned the energy star rating

     xerox connectkey
     xerox connectkey is a software solution that enables information to be moved to and from the
     cloud without the security risks that commonly exist cloud computing is an alternative to large
     data centers and is being recognized worldwide as less energy intensive than data centers while
     generating fewer ghg emissions in addition xerox connectkey and cisco energywise enable
     energy management by allowing for the control management and reporting of a devices power
     consumption and the setting of power states and timeout intervals

deinkability
in recent years deinkability has become an area of increasing concern particularly among our graphic
communications customers ensuring that prints produced with our equipment and materials can be
responsibly managed at the end of their useful life is an important consideration in our product
development process when appropriate independent testing conﬁrms that these prints pose no unique
challenges to the recycling stream while the deinkability of xerographic prints has long been
demonstrated a key milestone for a new technology came in 2010 when our cipress printer achieved a
good deinkability rating from ingede the international association of the deinking industry


packaging and distribution
packaging and distribution are integral parts of our product commercialization process we strive to
eliminate reduce reuse and recycle packaging and eliminate the use we also require packaging
suppliers to comply with bans and restrictions for a variety of chemicals we document our expectations
in our environment health and safety requirements for packaging standard  ehs710 and our
general packaging standard  88p311 our commercial equipment is designed and tested extensively
to be shipped without any required packaging eliminating or reducing packaging wherever feasible
conserves natural resources and decreases fuel use for distribution doing so represents a sustainability
win for business and the environment


we also offer the xerox automated packaging solution this system uses the latest in document
technology to print ﬁnish and cut customized folding cartons in short runs by creating packaging
quickly and cost effectively this tool enhances material efﬁciencies as well as decreases obsolescence
through customized boxes and containers automated packaging reduces ﬁnancial and environmental
costs associated with warehousing storage and disposal it also proves an advantage for focused
marketing campaigns and rapidly changing competitive markets


a few examples that illustrate our commitment to sustainability in this area


developer housing assembly  converting to use of molded pulp
for many years our principal supplier shipped housing assemblies to us packed in foam we moved
production to the us and redesigned the packaging to take advantage of readily recyclable molded
pulp solutions


expanded polystyrene end caps weighing 68 grams each and measuring 5 inches in length 65 inches
in width and 6 inches in height per side were replaced with molded pulp end caps the result was a
decrease in our material footprint large enough to increase the amount of product load from 77 units
per pallet to 144 a gain of 87 percent this eliminated 4800 kilograms 10575 lbs and 8559 cubic
feet of foam annually it also reduced costs and conserved natural resources


workcentre 7120 customer replaceable units crus  reducing our footprint
as with our developer housing assemblies we redesigned packaging provided to us by a large supplier of
color workcentre 7120 crus by removing polystyrene end caps and decreasing the size of the package

the result reduction of 4725 kilograms 10417 lbs or 27756 cubic feet of polystyrene waste
annually and 27 percent increase of product per unit load


xerox replacement cartridges xrc  reducing solid waste
for xrc products xerox packaging engineers replaced hot wire expanded polystyrene end caps with
inﬂatable air bags upon receipt of the package the air bags are easily deﬂated producing far less solid
waste by mass and cubic volume compared to polystyrene and this change is an environmentally
preferable alternative


thirdparty supplies sold by xerox
xerox sells imaging supplies through its distribution network that are manufactured by other companies
for use in other oem printers manufacturing processes combine patented and patent pending
technology environmental management principles and proven waste prevention manufacturing and
recycling processes we thoroughly review these supplies to ensure compliance with appropriate
regulatory requirements in addition we assess them against our own stringent standards the results of
these reviews ultimately determine which products carry the xerox brand information is provided on
safety data sheets sds which meet the requirements of the globally harmonized system of
classiﬁcation and labeling of chemicals ghs as implemented through regulations in our various
markets


striving for a circular economy
in the 1980s xerox introduced the concept of a circular economy for electronics remanufacturing long
before the term was coined our vision was to transform xerox manufacturing operations ofﬁces and
facilities into wastefree workplaces we had the same vision for our customers workplaces a world
where our electronics and supplies currently in use would be the raw materials of tomorrow at the end
of their useful life hence the meaning of the term circular economy where quality is not compromised
precious natural resources are conserved and waste becomes an obsolete term more than three decades
later we are still living the dream and demonstrating that a circular economy approach delivers
economic environmental and societal beneﬁts


our aim is to design products packaging and supplies that make efﬁcient use of resources minimize
waste reuse material where feasible and recycle what cannot be reused to meet this commitment we
developed several programs xerox green world alliance provides a collection and reuserecycling
program for spent imaging supplies xerox product takeback and recycling program manages equipment
at endoflife and we invest in technologies that reduce the creation of waste for laserbased products
materials innovation has extended the life of critical replaceable components by up to 50 percent


our approach to managing products at endoflife translates into signiﬁcant environmental and ﬁnancial
beneﬁts globally our combined returns programs equipment resale or remanufacture in conjunction
with parts and consumables reuse and recycling prevented nearly 37000 metric tons of waste from
entering landﬁlls in 2016


consumables takeback and recycling
our gwa initiative as noted is a collection and reuserecycling program for customers for their used
imaging supplies gwa is central to our commitment to wastefree products


currently more than 35 countries participate in the xerox gwa each has its own gwa country website
that describes the processes available to the customer or the appropriate points of contact for more
information worldwide our customers returned more than 42 million cartridges toner containers and
other used supply items in 2016 equating to 4800 metric tons


returned products are sorted and items suitable for remanufacturing are cleaned inspected and then
remanufactured remanufactured consumables containing an average of 90 percent reusedrecycled
parts are built and tested to the same performance speciﬁcations as new products items that are not

suitable for remanufacturing are recycled or recovered through energy from waste recycled waste toner
and toner reclaimed from manufacturing that qualiﬁes for reuse may account for 25 percent of the
weight of new toner without compromising toner functionality reusing wastereclaimed toner saves
several million dollars in raw material costs each year of the toner that cannot be reclaimed 75
percent is recycled by our consumables recycling partner while the remaining volume is utilized at
energy from waste facilities to generate steam and electricity

total waste diverted from landﬁlls from returned cartridges bottles
and waste toner




equipment and parts takeback and recycling
in the early 1990s we pioneered the practice of converting endoflife electronic equipment into
products and parts that contain reused parts while meeting newproduct speciﬁcations for quality and
performance we have developed a comprehensive system for taking back endoflife products which
processes assets through remanufacture refurbish parts reuse recycling or broker sales each of which
fully supports our wastefree initiatives


we design our machines with high durability and reuse capability in order to facilitate multiple product
lifecycles during the active phase of a product all returned equipment and spare parts are evaluated
for reuse opportunities throughout the supply chain finally all parts and equipment that are not
destined for reuse have speciﬁc guidelines which facilitate easy and consistent recycling


xerox enables reuse according to the following principles


     reuse of complete end item  this approach requires the least reprocessing transportation and
     energy usage
     remanufacturing or conversion into a newergeneration product or part  product families are
     designed with a high level of commonality to enable maximum reuse in this manner this allows us
     to remanufacture to as new performance speciﬁcations while reusing 70 to 90 percent of the
     machine components by weight without degradation of quality or performance
     used equipment  equipment returns are evaluated for potential reuse based on the condition
     and market demands equipment may be put through an extended maintenanceveriﬁcation
     process to return it to a high standard and then be redeployed approximately 56 percent of
     machines returned in the us are given new life by being sold as used or sent for remanufacturing
     of some sort
     reuse of major modules subcomponents and parts for spares or manufacturing  many of our
     machines that have outlived their useful life are stripped of usable parts and components prior to
     the scrapreclaim process used spare parts returned from the ﬁeld also are included in this reuse

     stream xerox continually has been increasing the number of components that are reused in
     upstream and downstream processes after the original machine has been designated for recycling
     material recycling  after the processes noted above have been followed any remaining portion of
     a machine is stripped of any recyclable material eg plastics copper wire and material requiring
     special disposal services such as printed wire boards batteries and lamps the remainder of the
     machine is then sent to an industrial reclaim facility
     postconsumer recycled plastic content  all xerox products contain between 05 postconsumer
     recycled plastic content

changes in volumes of waste diverted from landﬁlls are due in part to increases in product and part re
use opportunities modiﬁcations in product mix a move to lighterweight machines as well as growth of
regulatorydriven local recycling schemes for example the transition to digital equipment and lighter
weight parts has reduced the weight of both ofﬁce and production equipment by as much as 50 percent
over the last 10 years the decline also includes a decrease in the number of ofﬁce machines returned
for remanufacturing in europe due to participation in european union member state waste electrical
and electronic equipment weee programs in geographies where xerox exercises direct control over the
endoflife management of equipment return rates are high for example approximately 57 percent of
all us equipment installs are ultimately returned to xerox for endoflife disposition a ﬁgure that rises
to 100 percent for leased equipment


in 2016 11000 metric tons of equipment and parts related waste were diverted from landﬁlls to
recycling at our us reverse logistics center globally that volume rises to 37000 metric tons

total waste diverted from landﬁlls from returned equipment and
parts




ewaste
while xerox has long been committed to responsible endoflife management of equipment the
proliferation of ewaste regulations has created a need for multiple programs in different countries and
even states the subtle differences in requirements among these regulations pose challenges from a
process consistency and efﬁciency standpoint for example with the implementation of the european
unions weee directive we continue to operate our european takeback program to enable equipment
remanufacturing and parts reuse we also participate as needed in european member states individual
collection and recycling programs


in the us xerox recently partnered with a large electronics recycler to ensure that our customers have
a means for their old imaging devices to be processed in a responsible manner the program is
consistent with the requirements deﬁned in the various manufacturer takeback initiatives


we carefully manage suppliers that provide recycling and waste disposal services a waste vendor
approval process assesses the safety and environmental practices as well as compliance history of each
vendor where appropriate we require these companies to document the ﬁnal disposition of materials
sent to their facilities including electronic scrap xerox does not allow its vendors to send electronic
scrap to developing nations for processing we strive to work with only those recyclers that have
implemented voluntary programs certiﬁed by accredited organizations the programs are us epas
responsible recyclers r2 or the basal action networks estewards standards in addition in 2014
xeroxs two us equipment processing facilities achieved r2 certiﬁcation


paper
we recognize our obligation to responsibly source paper and enable efﬁcient paper use our strategy
begins upstream with the ﬁber source and continues to processing and manufacturing through use and
endoflife we utilize a multipronged approach through partnerships with our customers and suppliers
the nature conservancy and other stakeholders including nongovernment organizations ngos
government agencies and academia our longterm goal is to support a sustainable paper cycle and
minimize environmental impacts while meeting our customers exacting business needs

in 2013 domtar signed an agreement with xerox for the acquisition of the xerox paper and media
products business in the us and canada this deal gives domtar exclusive rights for the marketing and
distribution of xerox brand paper and print media read more about domtar and sustainability the
same year xeroxs paper business in western europe was sold to antalis read more about antaliss
sustainability charter


xerox maintains the paper business in its developing market operations we apply stringent paper
sourcing guidelines for companies that provide paper to xerox for resale the requirements cover all
aspects of papermaking from forest management to production of ﬁnished goods we supply papers
that comply with sustainable forest management standards including forest stewardship council fsc
and program for the endorsement of forest certiﬁcation pefc fsccertiﬁed papers use raw materials
from an fsccertiﬁed source controlled wood sources or postconsumer reclaimed sources


our partnership with the nature conservancy tnc
since 2006 xerox and tnc have partnered to preserve and protect globally important forests this work
is funded through the xerox foundation grants of more than 2 million


during the third term of the partnership in 2016 xerox supported the conservancys efforts to


     develop and test a broadly applicable carbon methodology for improved forest management that
     would allow landowners to achieve forest certiﬁcation and serve as a platform for potential carbon
     beneﬁts
     strengthen a key tool for identifying priority habitats  the high conservation value hcv
     approach  for building consistency across projects disseminating standards and training
     assessors through global and regional hcv networks 
     promote responsible forestry through the implementation of forest management standards by
     working with xerox suppliers and other land managers at two sites in north america central
     western new york and across the canadian boreal forest including a focused project in northwest
     ontario

these initiatives have improved forest conservation helping to develop a sustainable paper cycle and
advance sound forest management practices through market incentives landowner investment and
resource networks most importantly our work has and will continue to stem the tide of forest loss and
degradation a contributor to global ghg emissions

caring for communities

the xerox foundation
we invest in the communities where we live and work for reasons beyond fulﬁlling our obligation as a
corporate citizen we do it because it makes our company stronger and more competitive


a foundation for good




xerox executes a deliberate philanthropic investment strategy to deliver the greatest impact possible for
every dollar spent in 2016 we invested 135 million in the nonproﬁt sector more than 2500 non
proﬁt organizations colleges and universities received direct ﬁnancial support in the form of grants
matching gifts or community involvement activities of xerox people


at its core xerox philanthropy efforts focuses on a few strategic areas
      employee volunteerism  direct handson support for communities where our people and our
      customers live and work
      education and workforce preparation investments in education programs that target underserved
      areas and deliver results
      science and technology  partnerships to promote innovation with institutions of higher learning

caring for communities

employee volunteerism
at xerox we believe a combination of ﬁnancial and human resources can bring about greater change
than either on its own this philosophy is perhaps best represented by the xerox community
involvement program xcip this longrunning grassroots initiative backs the voluntary spirit of our
employees with funding support from xerox in this way were making the biggest difference in the
communities where we live and work


since the program began in 1974 thousands of xerox people have rolled up their sleeves and
participated in projects that make their hometown a better place in 2016 the xerox foundation
invested more than 10 million in xcip enabling 10000 xerox people to participate in more than 900
projects


it doesnt stop there outside of the xerox community involvement program many xerox people also
give their time and talent to a wide variety of causes here are a few examples


     xerox researchers and scientists participate in the xerox science consultant program which sends
     our people into elementary schools to teach science to inquiring young minds and to ignite interest
     in science as a career
     xerox lawyers provide pro bono work to a wide range of nonproﬁt organizations
     people across xerox  from the csuite to the factory ﬂoor  volunteer to help make our world a
     better place whether by giving their time to a corporate board or by rolling up their sleeves and
     packing boxes for a holiday food and gift drive

caring for communities

education and workforce preparedness
as part of a larger effort to support education in the us xerox provides matching gifts to colleges and
universities in 2016 327 institutions received 857 matching gifts from the xerox foundation


investing in education




our support of education involves programs with a common theme providing educational access to
underrepresented minorities in turn this advances the strategic interest of the company by enabling us
to recruit from a highly motivated technically educated talent pool in addition our own people beneﬁt
by being involved on college campuses the three programs are


     the black college liaison program disbursed 21 grants during 2016 to schools such as howard
     university spelman college morgan state university hampton university and tuskegee
     university
     the hispanic college liaison program disbursed 20 grants during 2016 to schools such as
     university of puerto rico city college of new york university of california university of central
     florida university of texas and rochester institute of technology
     the xerox technical minority scholarship program provided 110 scholarships to help deserving
     minority students to complete degrees in engineering

we also continue to partner with the people and programs making a difference and delivering results
our investment in the national academy foundations academies of engineering create schools within
schools that provide incentives for minority and female high school students to pursue college degrees
and ultimately careers in science technology engineering and mathematics  the stem principles
were also investing in organizations that teach and deliver the skill sets needed for todays economy
programs like first for inspiration and recognition of science and technology catalyst and mits
sandbox initiative for entrepreneurs

caring for communities

science and technology
at xerox innovation is our foundation for success academic organizations play an important role in the
longterm strategic interests of the company by furthering scientiﬁc research and training the next
generation of scientists this is why the xerox foundation supports many such organizations including
the university of rochester new york hall of science and cornell tech


in 2016 xerox invested 900000 in the university affairs committee an effort aligned with the long
term strategic interests of xerox and is championed by a xerox employee it is governed by a committee

zero workplace injuries continually decreasing the frequency and severity of injuries every year in 2016
within our global technology operations the total recordable injury tri rate decreased by 13 and
day away from work case dafw rate decreased by 9 from 2015 levels in addition across all of our
us operations the dafw frequency rate decreased by 6 which is reﬂective of success in preventing
the more serious injuries overall these improvements have continued since 2012 and are a result of the
increased safety awareness and communications to our employees and focused safety management
processes within our management teams

total recordable incident tri rate




day away from work dafw rate




1   data in this section includes xerox technology operations but excludes global imaging services operations


we have in place a robust worldwide incident reporting process this in combination with workplace
safety inspections and hazard analysis focusses our safety improvement efforts where we can make the
most impact on preventing incidents and where populations are most at risk employee safety
communications take a variety of forms given the great diversity in our operations and workplaces a

number of methods are used to keep employee safety awareness high including site speciﬁc hazard
management off the job safety information and unique safety concerns that may be endemic to the
geography


safe facilities
in order to ensure that all xerox owned and leased facilities meet our stringent ﬁre and life safety
requirements all real estate transactions are reviewed by the environment health safety and
sustainability ehss organization prior to occupying xerox ﬁre safety and life safety requirements
have been established and are implemented worldwide regardless of location size of the facility or
occupancy classiﬁcation the focus of the safety review is life safety requirements including safe egress
in an emergency ﬁre and incident prevention early detection suppression occupant notiﬁcation and
prompt emergency response these reviews also ensure that building speciﬁc emergency plans are
implemented and updated and that emergency drills are completed at least on an annual basis


audit program
a wellestablished internal audit program measures our success in implementing corporate standards
allows us to share best practices and helps us validate regulatory compliance audits at major
operations are conducted once every three to ﬁve years or sooner based on performance the
frequency and the focus of the audits are based on the type of operations and the inherent risks
associated with the operations


xerox audit teams evaluate operations against our internal standards external regulations and industry
guidelines the teams also evaluate management system performance with the assistance of the local
managers and support staff action plans are developed and deﬁciencies corrected senior management
pays particular attention to situations with the potential to pose a signiﬁcant risk of environmental
damage serious injury to employees or regulatory noncompliance xeroxs audit program is an
important mechanism for identifying and correcting performance gaps


emergency preparedness
because emergencies and disasters often strike without warning xerox has implemented an emergency
preparedness and response program to help protect the safety of our employees the surrounding
communities and the environment


to prepare for emergencies xerox facilities worldwide have implemented sitespeciﬁc emergency
preparedness plans to assist with the development and execution of appropriate actions in response to
local emergencies our plans account for common emergencies such as responding to ﬁres for weather
related emergencies such as tornadoes and hurricanes and for more locationspeciﬁc emergencies such
as responding to earthquakes and radiological emergencies we also include resources and procedures
for ﬁrst aid medical response in the event of an injury or illness to an employee in our facilities in our
more complex and higher hazard operations we have medical emergency response teams merts
these mert employees are provided with the training and equipment necessary to render quick
response to stabilize the medical emergency until more advanced medical support arrives


shelterinplace procedures have also been implemented to protect our employees from emergency
situations that occur outside of our facilities


in addition to emergency action plans that are established at the local operation level there are
preparedness plans at the corporate level including major incident response crisis management and
pandemic preparedness these plans have been designed with a central corporate strategy that utilizes
an incident command structure incident response managers are responsible for localregional tactical
and emergency response coordinating efforts at their respective locations with the corporate crisis
management team and addressing local business operations issues response coordination and
integration are part of the planning process

all preparedness plans are regularly tested for effectiveness through management reviews corporate
audits and annual drills any discrepancies are noted and corrective actions are implemented following
an emergency business resumption plans are put into action to ensure the business operations are
quickly restored after the incident


motor vehicle safety
motor vehicle safety is a key component of our safety initiatives we have a company car program that
speciﬁes motor vehicle safety requirements for our drivers and accident prevention and reporting
processes employee driving records are reviewed on a regular basis and we provide remedial motor
vehicle safety training to improve awareness and competency motor vehicle accidents are tracked by
frequency and type and are reported to the management team


we also participate on ﬂeet safety benchmark forums to keep up to date on the latest motor vehicle
safety practices and technologies and to share xeroxs best practices with our peers


the use of cell phones in any company vehicle is restricted texting is forbidden while the vehicle is
moving employees who need to use their phones in the car are instructed to ﬁnd a safe place to stop


a comprehensive safety review is conducted on any vehicle model prior to it being accepted as part of
the xerox ﬂeet we review the safety ratings and crash test results of candidate vehicles and require
safety features such as daytime running lights and safety barriers between the drivers seat and storage
areas


ergonomics
because musculoskeletal disorders represent a signiﬁcant portion of our workrelated injuries we work to
minimize the risk factors as a job is designed we study exposure to ergonomic hazards and raise
awareness with employees so they can make improvements to their workstations


from manufacturing operations to ofﬁce work we continue to study the causes and potential remedies
for workplace injuries the following provides some brief highlights


     manufacturing operations workstation evaluations are conducted in xerox facilities worldwide for
     ergonomic hazards based upon risk proﬁle and injury experience ergonomic enhancements such as
     tilt tables lifts and hoists make it easier for employees to maneuver parts and equipment during
     assembly
     machine service xerox customer service engineers cses exposure to ergonomic hazards has
     been studied the ﬁndings have helped us select tools and develop procedures to mitigate risk of
     musculoskeletal disorders throughout the equipment design process evaluations are done to
     assess risks for our cses the best time to make a modiﬁcation is when a product is still in the
     design or early test phases
     ofﬁce ergonomics our largest employee population is ofﬁcebased raising awareness and helping
     employees make effective workstation changes is critical to minimizing risk for this population we
     created computerbased training on ergonomics principles and practices this method of delivery
     enables employees to go through needed training programs at a time that minimizes business
     interruptions

asset protection and fire safety
the xerox asset protection and fire safety program provides ﬁresafe workplaces and limits the
potential for losses to xerox equipment and property from ﬁre explosion and natural hazards such as
windstorms snowloading collapse and ﬂoods the program includes periodic inspections management
reviews of ﬁndings and mitigation planning our philosophy is to maintain our highervalued locations
to a highly protected risk standard in addition locations are reviewed for conformance to xerox
standards and recognized ﬁre property and life safety standards we continue to demonstrate excellent
loss control performance and beneﬁt from favorable insurance rates and premiums

contractor safety process
the goal of the contractor safety program is to ensure contracted work conforms to all applicable
regulations and xerox environment health and safety requirements contractors are qualiﬁed to the
safety and health requirements prior to beginning work at a xerox location contractors are required to
submit a job safety plan and workers on us xerox sites must attend an orientation session incidents
and injuries are tracked both as feedback and to measure program effectiveness although ﬁrst
established in our webster new york operations this model has been applied successfully in many of
our larger locations


xerox also functions as a contractor for many xerox client accounts we have in place and follow our
internal safety standards and we establish safety plans deliver speciﬁc employee training and maintain
management oversight to ensure our operations meet both xerox and client requirements


workplace health management
our workplace health programs include processes for emergency medical response the characterization
of employee ﬁtness for duty and preemployment drug testing in addition programs are in place for
conducting medical exams in connection with safetysensitive work and drug testing and immunizations
based upon speciﬁc work operations and client accounts


preventing and monitoring workplace exposures
to protect employees from unsafe exposures to chemicals noise and radiation xerox applies exposure
limits to worldwide manufacturing research and technology service operations based upon the
threshold limit values tlv recommended by the american conference of governmental industrial
hygienists these reﬂect the best advice of a widely respected committee of international experts
however in jurisdictions where government regulations are more stringent xerox meets those regulatory
requirements for some materials  including toners and certain solvents and metals  xerox has
established exposure limits that are more stringent than the tlv or existing regulations and standards


using the xerox exposure assessment process industrial hygienist and safety professionals monitor
assess and report workplace exposures effective process design engineering controls safe job
procedures and personal protective equipment are utilized to control exposures and protect employee
health medical surveillance programs are in place to monitor the health of employees working in
operations with speciﬁc jobs and hazards eg high noise organic solvents results of those medical
exams are reviewed by health care professionals to ensure employee wellness


of the workplace exposures monitored in 2016 all were within regulatory limits when necessary
inhalation exposures were controlled through the proper use of personal protective equipment where
additional engineering controls were not feasible


environment health and safety project reviews
we continually make modiﬁcations to facilities work processes and operations to improve efﬁciency and
effectiveness to ensure these changes meet applicable xerox safety standards consensus standards and
regulatory requirements projects are reviewed by occupational safety and health professionals the
scope of the project is deﬁned potential safety and environmental impacts are characterized and
control requirements are established and communicated before the project is initiated the process
serves to inform the engineering and management teams on safety requirements and ensures all project
designs have controls integrated into work plans the process ensures environmental health and safety
requirements are understood and implemented at the beginning of the project

innovative solutions
innovation is more than a buzzword at xerox its in our dna we are constantly thinking about how we
can simplify work deliver more personalized experiences and improve productivity through new
technologies that connect the physical and digital worlds our mission and heritage to help our
customers be more successful has led us on a fascinating journey in innovating how the world
communicates connects and works


workplace assistants and apps
xeroxs line of multifunction devices composed of the versalink and altalink product families contain so
much more intelligence that we call them workplace assistants not only are they secure and reliable
but they also come with apps that enable a high degree of personalization and automated workﬂows
similar to how we use apps on our smartphones xeroxs connectkey app ecosystem automates
frequent actions such as scan to dropbox or translating a document into another language through the
ez translator app other apps are targeted at speciﬁc industries such as a secure document transfer app
for the healthcare industry to send patient information with a much higher degree of security than
faxing we have also given our partners the ability to create their own custom apps for their customers


users easily access these apps from the multitouch displays on the versalink and altalink products in a
consistent way across the full range we invested signiﬁcant time in user research and iterative design to
make sure that the user interface was easy to use as part of our innovation process we use
ethnography or the observation of people in their natural work environments to gain deeper insights
into user needs and pain points than what can be normally obtained through traditional market
research techniques


customerled innovation
at xerox we view our customers as partners in innovation going beyond user studies we engage our
customers in innovation workshops to explore the future of the customers business and identify new
opportunities to apply our technologies to solve problems or create new products and services for
example we have a deep competency in printed and hybrid electronics that enable us to create new
types of lowcost sensors and smart tags that enable interactive and smart packaging we engage
customers and partners across a range of industries to explore applications ranging from personalized
packages to supply chain monitoring followed by validating the value proposition before moving to
commercialization we are using this collaborative agile innovation approach to explore new adjacent
markets in digital printing from digital packaging to industrial printing


another focus area of innovation is in digital transformation to enable the agile workplace of the future
along with our customers we are seeing rapid changes in consumer and employee expectations due to
digital technologies that have transformed every industry given the high degree of uncertainty in our
world the most valuable trait of any company going forward will be agility  not only to respond
quickly to changes but also to create new markets and business models


building upon our deep domain expertise and analytical insights from working with our customers in
managed print services and workﬂow automation we are investing in innovation to help our customers
become more agile by going beyond the automation of predictable workﬂows in backofﬁce processes to
delivering automation and intelligent assistance to knowledge workers in their more variable work
similar to our innovation efforts around digital printing we are using a highly collaborative co
innovation process with our customers to ensure that our new offerings in this space are both useful
and easy to use

safe services and products
safety always has been a cornerstone of our work in product development our comprehensive product
safety plan details our health and safety requirements and all xerox imaging equipment is assessed for
conformance to these standards we evaluate all potential health and safety hazards including the
ways different hazards may interact furthermore we take a conservative position on the potential
health risks to our employees and customers always meeting or exceeding government safety
regulations we have robust processes for tracking regulatory violations and noncompliance with
voluntary codes and labels


customers are encouraged to review product safety information and understand the environmental
proﬁle of our devices user guides contain information regarding safe use as well as any applicable
hazard warnings our product safety data sheets psds offer environmental health and safety
information for each xerox device safety data sheets sds identify hazards associated with speciﬁc
materials and describe how they can be safely handled used and stored both our sds and product
labeling have been updated to meet the requirements of the globally harmonized system of
classiﬁcation and labeling of chemicals ghs as implemented through regulations in our various
markets customers can access psds and sds in multiple languages at wwwxeroxcomenvironment


materials
we have made a longterm commitment to eliminate the use of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic
materials throughout our supply chain by applying strict internal standards and tightly managing
chemicals in our supply chain our supplier requirements periodically are updated as regulations change
and new information becomes available all new product designs refer to these requirements and
suppliers are expected to verify their compliance with them learn more at wwwxeroxcomenvironment


toxicologists conduct a comprehensive assessment of new materials in our products to ensure
conformance with applicable global registration hazard communication and waste handling and
disposal requirements as a result of our stringent requirements xerox toners and printing products are
noncarcinogenic and nonmutagenic in addition these products do not cause adverse developmental
or reproductive effects pose a toxicity hazard to humans or aquatic species cause a permanent adverse
impact to the skin eyes or respiratory system or have the potential to generate federally regulated
hazardous waste we were the ﬁrst in our industry to evaluate the health effects of toner and have done
so for over 30 years


our requirements for minimizing toxic materials govern our product design and materials selection we
have reengineered or eliminated processes to dramatically reduce the use of toxics and heavy metals
and have made substantial progress in eliminating the use of mercury mercurycontaining lamps that
scan images and backlight user displays are being phased out as alternatives become available


our safety and supplier processes enable us to meet global regulations governing chemical use since
2007 xeroxs newly launched products have been designed to meet the european restriction of
hazardous substances rohs requirements in all markets however where regulations allow some
products may contain parts with small amounts of rohs substances in order to avoid premature
disposal of existing parts that have usable life similar types of legislation continue to be implemented
in many other market regions through our proactive regulatory tracking process we expect to be fully
compliant with all aspects of these regulations as the provisions become effective and applicable in
2016 we reported no issues with noncompliance to rohs


ergonomic design
we consider the ergonomic aspects of our products from both a user and service standpoint to ensure
inclusion and operability our design teams take into account all points of human interface including a

products height curves and placement of touch screens and paper trays customers work directly with
the designers in our labs to test and continually improve the usability of new products


machine emissions
consistent with the worlds most stringent ecolabels we design products to control emissions of
chemicals and noise as a result current products have achieved chemical emission levels that are well
below global regulatory requirements  often at or near the detection limit of our measurement
equipment  and are considered to have a negligible impact on customers work environments we
publish emissions data for all of our products on our psds


toner study
xerox concluded two comprehensive investigations that lasted more than three decades on the health
risks of inhaling xerographic toner these studies included assessments of the health of current
employees and the causes of death for people who worked for the company between 1960 and 1982
the analyses demonstrated that the health and mortality patterns of xerox employees were consistent
with a healthy working population and in fact our employees had a lower rate of disease ie were
healthier than the general population in october 2010 the mortality study was published in the peer
reviewed journal of occupational and environmental medicine

cybersecurity
cyber attacks pose a threat to our customers our employees and our partners  in short our very
business thats why were always on the alert working to stop hackers who would deface our website
or gain access to sensitive information we have comprehensive plans to deal with sophisticated threats
such as organized cyber criminals cyberespionage groups and even statesponsored intrusion


our cybersecurity strategy has ﬁve major components


datacentric protection
we use data segregation encryption and datalossprevention technologies to ensure safe and secure
processing and sharing of critical information in addition all data is classiﬁed according to its
sensitivity this data classiﬁcation process enables us to understand the relative importance of securing
each dataset and to make an informed business decision about the level and allocation of resources
required


standardsbased management
by following industrystandard cybersecurity guidelines we ensure our processes are repeatable
predictable and easily understandable


of the numerous cybersecurity control frameworks we chose to implement both iso 27000 and the
national institute of standards  technology cybersecurity framework


     iso 27000 information security management system  this international standard deﬁnes
     requirements for establishing implementing maintaining and continually improving an
     information security management system we incorporate iso 27000 as a normal part of our
     business processes independent auditors have certiﬁed many of our systems and data centers as
     iso 27000compliant
     national institute of standards  technology cybersecurity framework  created through
     collaboration between industry and government this framework protects networks and
     infrastructure the prioritized ﬂexible and scalable approach helps us manage cybersecurityrelated
     risk in a costeffective manner this framework already has proven useful to predict detect disrupt
     or deter respond and recover valuable data

capability maturity assessments performed by independent parties and benchmarking with other
companies ﬁnd our implementation to be sound relevant and aligned with industry standards


continuous assessment
we utilize a combination of evidencebased assessments vulnerability scanning and penetration tests to
validate that our data protection is effective and to ensure controls are operating properly on an
ongoing basis


cybersecurity incident response
we have emergency response procedures in place throughout our business if we were to encounter an
attempted cybersecurity attack we would take the following actions


     identify whom to notify internally
     establish a multidiscipline virtual response team
     implement monitoring protocols and egress prevention
     estimate the extent of the compromise
     coordinate with legal counsel and insurance carriers

     if necessary notify legal authorities

these steps provide a general framework business units have detailed plans tailored to their needs we
perform tests to assess our operational and managerial readiness on a regular basis


cyber risk management
recent highproﬁle breaches in the media demonstrate that any organization can suffer a cyber attack
when this occurs there may be costly consequences  such as regulatory ﬁnes or purchasing identity
theft monitoring for affected parties many companies invest in errors  omissions or cyber liability
insurance to mitigate this risk


many insurance carriers and underwriters assess the level of risk when determining insurance rates
xerox as well as other companies has received reduced premiums andor more favorable policy limits by
implementing effective cybersecurity management


cybersecurity is not solely the responsibility of the it department by collaborating across our company
we effectively manage risk reduce the likelihood limit the impact of exposure and enable quick recovery
from any attack on our infrastructure networks and systems

accessibility and mobility
in the print industry xerox was the ﬁrst in many ways such as designing products that were accessible
as well as easy to operate by all users including people with disabilities our dedicated team of design
professionals upholds that commitment for the products and services we provide


for example to make our systems accessible for people with disabilities xerox has developed a number
of accessories such as angled consoles braille console labels magnifying lenses for visually impaired
users and start print foot switches we design software for embedded web servers and print drivers to
be compatible with screen readers to enable people with visual impairments to operate them on an
ongoing basis we strive to improve our performance in the area of accessibility and adapt products so
that ease of use is not compromised


xerox stepped forward in 1998 when congress amended section 508 of the us rehabilitation act of
1973 we developed solutions to adapt our technology for use by government workers who are disabled
we also established a rigorous process to evaluate our products compliance to meet section 508
accessibility requirements in the near future section 508 rules will change and new input is expected
to come from the european union and the far east learn more about our efforts pertaining to section
508 accessibility requirements


our focus on increased mobility has expanded with the anywhere alwayson enterprise were enabling
enterprises to manage a complex infrastructure as employees are bringing their own devices to work
and demanding the same seamless secure ability to ﬁnd use and print business documents xerox
technology  such as mobile print solutions is enhancing easy access to information

anticorruption
xerox operates an active and comprehensive antibribery and anticorruption program that complies
with all related laws and regulations we have developed a global compliance program supported by
policy and training to ensure zero tolerance for the giving or offering of a bribe of any amount or value
including socalled facilitation payments the program also includes risk assessment of thirdparty
intermediaries followed by the application of appropriate due diligence training and certiﬁcation prior
to engagement we are committed to enhancing the program continually


banknote anticounterfeiting
the risk of banknote counterfeiting has increased with the quality of digital imaging tools and color
printing technology in response we have joined other companies the us secret service and the
central bank counterfeit deterrence group a consortium of 32 central banks and note printing
authorities to assess threats to currency and support the use of anticounterfeiting technologies
technology to deter the use of digital equipment for counterfeiting banknotes is being standardized
xerox sales and service employees are trained to respond to inquiries about our anticounterfeiting
efforts


black market supplies
every year the global imaging industry  and the customers who use its products and services  suffer
the loss of millions of dollars due to counterfeiting or theft of supplies we continually remind our
customers that counterfeit supplies can result in poor equipment performance low supply yields inferior
print quality toner leakage increased failure rates and equipment downtime  all of which can cost
time and money to avoid this risk we advise our customers to purchase solely from xerox authorized
resellers we work closely with our procurement department to call attention to blending of supplies
 the mixing of counterfeit with original materials to achieve lower pricing and make detection of
counterfeit items more difﬁcult


theft of customer supplies represents an increasingly costly problem for xerox and its customers it is
difﬁcult to prevent because webbased sales channels make it easy to purchase stolen products and
then to sell them we continue to invest in technology and resources to bring the problem to the
attention of customers and to identify their obligation to maintain the security of supplies contracted
and purchases through engagement and support of our customers and local law enforcement
agencies we also provide tracing of stolen goods to identify and close the sources of theft


xerox is leading the charge against counterfeiting and other blackmarket activities independently and
in collaboration with other original equipment manufacturers oems to combat acts of piracy and
fraud our security team routinely works with the us federal bureau of investigation attorneys general

ofﬁces the postal inspectors ofﬁce and other global law enforcement agencies in addition we are a
member of the imaging supplies coalition isc a trade association that serves to heighten customer
awareness of blackmarket activities wholesalers dealers and consumers may submit questionable
goods to the isc for authentication by the manufacturer for more information visit wwwiscincorg

doing good business

supplier relations
social responsibility is ingrained in our business model starting at the very beginning  with our supply
chain as a major organization spending approximately 7 billion per year to support our operations we
feel an obligation to actively manage our global supplier base and ensure these critical partners meet
our high ethical standards


as a part of the purchasing process we assess the quality cost delivery and sustainability of all
products and services across north america europe and asia xerox employees source contract and
purchase everything from transportation to technology our local presence in these regions encourages
direct interaction with our suppliers


our approach is to source from suppliers that are geographically located near our purchasing
manufacturing and distribution operations that we regard as local suppliers in the us and canada
approximately 86 percent of spend is from local suppliers in europe it is 84 percent and 51 percent in
asia

supplier code of conduct
our supplier code of conduct and compliance program are the primary tools we use to ensure ethical
management in our supply chain


in 2006 we began working with the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc whose code of
conduct sets industry standards on social environmental and ethical issues in the electronics industry
supply chain in 2008 we became an ofﬁcial member of the eicc we have adopted the eicc code of
conduct as our supplier code of conduct and xerox serves on the eicc senior executive advisory
council


we continually reinforce the importance of the supplier code of conduct to our supplier base we
incorporate standards from the supplier code of conduct in purchase agreements we run a risk
assessment and require suppliers to participate in the xerox compliance program finally we send an
annual communication to our entire supplier base


the xerox compliance program upholds our supplier code of conduct and our supply chain
transparency statement the following are components of the compliance program


     all suppliers are subject to an initial risk assessment which is based on objective criteria
     suppliers ﬂagged in the risk assessment  in addition to suppliers deemed critical to our supply
     chain  are required to complete detailed questionnaires in addition to highlighting areas of
     potential concern these questionnaires clarify our expectations and reinforce the importance of
     these topics
     based on the assessments and questionnaires we annually select suppliers for compliance review
     or audit
     trained xerox personnel conduct audits onsite audits and compliance reviews both follow the
     eicc audit format which addresses labor practices freedom of association child labor and forced
     labor human rights environmental concerns and more
     during the audit we classify areas of nonconformance as priority major minor or for
     review we provide each supplier with a written performance assessment

business performance and reviews
we regularly review suppliers performance against expectations and contractual requirements
prioritizing based on business risk and revenue impact suppliers with the highest business risk and
potential revenue impact are considered critical and are required to maintain an acceptable business
resumption plan we inspect these plans on a regular basis

reducing greenhouse gas emissions
since 2012 scope 1 direct and 2 indirect greenhouse gas emissions are down 28
percent the reductions are the result of improved energy efﬁciency new technologies
and improved energy management practices

 note the 2012 baseline has been restated in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol
inventory adjustments are completed each year as a result of the opening and closing of
facilities and the use of more appropriate emission factors to make data and performance trends
between years more comparable
