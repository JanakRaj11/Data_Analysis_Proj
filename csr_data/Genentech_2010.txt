                                               data management so that we may focus on improving our performance we are rolling out the solution across
                                               genentech during 2010 and anticipate that this will assist each site and genentech overall to better track

since 2005 between 2005 and 2009 our diversion rate increased                     trend of reduced paper use                      is now providing patients
from 32 to 47 just under half of the 2009 diverted waste was                     at genentech thanks to                             who use the nutropin

we recognize that diverting waste from landfill disposal is only part of            employee compared with 2008              to be safely repurposed into
the story reducing the amount of waste we produce in the first place is                                                                   building materials
an important priority as genentech has grown our data indicate that so
too has the total amount of waste produced by our facilities this is in
part due to a trend towards more comprehensive reporting over time so
that more waste streams are captured in our 2009 data than in data for             waste projects planned for 2010 include
earlier years however it is also reflective of an absolute increase in the          collection of styrofoam from around the south san francisco site
total waste we produce albeit mainly in the form of diverted waste                   for recycling
during 2010 we are establishing a program to reduce the amount of                    reduction in the amount of disposable items used in our employee

wastes that are regulated due to their hazardous properties comprise                   expired andor excess raw materials requiring disposal
only 20 of our total waste and only a small fraction of our total
regulated waste is considered hazardous under us federal legisla
tion reflecting the relatively low use of harmful chemical compounds
in biotherapeutics manufacturing when compared with other forms of
pharmaceutical manufacturing however any reductions made should
be considered in the context of the more hazardous properties of regu
lated waste when compared with nonregulated wastes

by far the majority of our regulated waste over 80 is comprised
of a waste stream produced from our use of tetramethylammonium
chloride tmac as a buffer in our purification process the waste
stream is considered hazardous in the state of california and is shipped
offsite for specialized wastewater treatment during 2009 we reduced
the amount of tmac waste generated when compared with previous
years we continue to work towards further reducing and in the longer
term potentially eliminating the bulk production of this waste stream
altogether
