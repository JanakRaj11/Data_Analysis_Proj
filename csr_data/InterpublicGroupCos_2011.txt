real estate

as a service company     sharing facilities helps reduce our carbon footprint and ipg policies
                           require all agencies to look within the portfolio for real estate solutions
people are one of our      before committing to leasing new office space this drastically controls
most critical assets       waste by sharing facilities and sharing services rather than taking
                           additional office space and leaving existing space underutilized
and real estate is        we encourage agencies to employ green designs in their offices
among our largest          this includes open space planning 80 workstations20 offices
cost items we have        and conference rooms and efficient energy use planning ie lighting
                           hvac etc
focused significant       our real estate group has a square foot per person metric of 250 occupied
efforts on reducing        rentable square feet per employee built at 225 rsfee this number has
                           been reduced by nearly 50 square feet per employee since 2004
our carbon footprint
                          controlling capex costs is another important way to reduce our carbon
and environmental          footprint and one of the most effective ways is by redeploying furniture
impact here are some      within the portfolio before any new furniture is purchased we look
                           within the network to see what can be reutilized this has resulted in
of the efforts we have     savings of 24 million since 2007
undertaken in this
area
