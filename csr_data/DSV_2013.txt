corporate social
responsibility is the
right track for dsv
dsv has taken major steps in 2012 to improve the corporate social
responsibility csr performance of the group we have focused
on several initiatives during the year which have boosted the group and
strengthened the platform for our csr work across our global organisation



our work in relation to climateenvironment and employ
ees also continues at full speed it is therefore a pleasure
to note that we have achieved by far most of the targets
established a year ago and that we are ready to set the bar
higher and increase our efforts in the coming years

csr  part of everyday life
our csr strategy has formed the basis of the groups csr
activities in 2012 which have resulted in a number of local
and global initiatives the dsv group is characterised by a
flat decentralised organisational structure which accom
modates local market conditions cultures and languages
this also applies in relation to csr enabling the local dsv
companies to work with measures and solutions that arise                                             jens bjørn andersen ceo of dsv as
from local initiatives but also observe the overall targets
and expectations communicated by group management
   dsv has opted to focus the csr efforts on a few rele
vant issues with a view to promoting concrete action aimed                 new targets for the future
at our business activities it is important to dsv that all                group management can conclude that almost all targets
employees regard csr as a natural part of their daily work                have been achieved in 2012 and that we are on the right
at times csr may have an air of philanthropy to it when                   track as concerns the remaining targets management has
the good cause is right in front of us but we can create far              therefore adopted a number of new targets intended to
more value to society when we let csr go hand in hand                      drive the continued improvement of our csr performance
with our operations and thereby strengthen our position in                 these targets include the objective to cover more distant

management adopted a number of targets in relation to
business ethis in 2011 with the aim to promote the im
plementation of the corporate code of conduct the work
towards achieving these targets continued in 2012
   first of all efforts have been made to ensure that the
code of conduct is made available to all employees of the
group this objective has been met as the information
has been distributed to all employees and the rules have
been published on the corporate intranet management
has therefore revised the target to maintain a high level of
awareness as a means to achieve this new employees are
informed about the code of conduct and where they can
view and download the code

training and tests of managers
another target established by management was that all
senior executives of the divisions and companies of the
dsv group must have completed a training programme and
related tests on the code of conduct by the end of 2012
   the training was conducted as a mandatory elearning
programme including a final test among more than 200
employees with a satisfactory outcome the dsv man
agement has therefore decided that managers at all levels
must have completed a similar training programme before                     more than 200 managers of all companies
the end of 2014 the training and tests specifically aimed                  and divisions completed training and tests in

number of occupational accidents must be reduced by 25

accidents furthermore companies across the group have
been engaged in various local initiatives from risk mapping
and management to registration of near accidents and
