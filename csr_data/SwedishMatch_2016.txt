materials used in relation to total weight of smokefree products amounted to 09 metric tons in 2015 the snus factories in
sweden have had to manage an increasing complexity in terms of production due to new product initiatives that have resulted
in an increasing number of small batches and scrapped finished goods for the production of cigars 72 metric tons of materials
were used per million cigars a decrease of 14 percent for match production total materials used were 451 metric tons plus
4325 m3 of wood per billion matches for lighters 114 metric tons of materials were used per million lighters

swedish matchs primary direct energy sources are wood chips a renewable energy source and natural gas wood chips
accounted for 53 percent of all direct energy consumed in 2015 while natural gas accounted for 46 percent fuel distilled from
crude oil accounted for 1 percent the use of wood chips declined by 7 percent to 49294 mwh in 2015 with lower production
volumes for matches in brazil the total amount of natural gas decreased by 8 percent compared to 2014 largely due to less
usage in the moist snuff factory in owensboro the us as a result of an overall decrease in production volumes as well as mild
weather conditions during the year the use of fuel distilled from crude oil was virtually flat

pared to 2014 consumption in 2014 was unusually low reflecting low usage in the assen factory in the netherlands due to

district heating decreased by 9 percent purchased steam decreased by 5 percent
  in 2015 31 percent of swedish matchs indirect energy consumed was composed of renewable energy sources up from 18
percent in 2014 this renewable energy refers to electricity purchases in sweden where the companys suppliers undertake
to produce and supply the amount of electricity that swedish match consumes without the use of fossil fuels in 2015 the
match factories in sweden started to consume electricity from renewable energy sources which explains the change in the
overall share of indirect energy from renewable energy sources

energy saved due to conservation and efficiency improvements
in 2015 several energy efficiency improvement projects were registered for the production of smokefree products a project
was completed to optimize reusable heating which enabled savings in terms of district heating for the production of cigars air
conditioning units were replaced to increase energy efficiency examples from the companys lighter facilities include intro
ducing energy efficient and more environmentally friendly air conditioning modifications to molding machinery installing of
led lamps and fluorescent lamps with lower wattages and replacing an old compressor unit
  in total swedish match registered projects that led to energy improvements of 898 mwh in 2015 in terms of total cost savings
these registered projects led to cost savings of 783115 sek in 2015 using average 2015 currency rates from the swedish riksbank

needed to be withdrawn for irrigation purposes varies significantly from one year to another due to natural differences in climate
behavior such as the amount of rain that has fallen during the year figures for water withdrawal are therefore highly vola
tile in relation to total company sales msek total water withdrawals decreased by 75 percent to 607 m3

in 2015 73 percent of the companys total water was withdrawn for the production of lights products a result of water with
drawals taking place in the companys poplar farms in brazil approximately 20 percent was withdrawn for the production of
smokefree products while production of cigars accounted for 7 percent of total water withdrawals
  for the production of smokefree products total water withdrawals increased by 19 percent to 174168 m3 in 2015 the snus
factories in sweden have had to manage an increasing complexity in terms of production for the production of cigars total water
withdrawals increased by 30 percent to 58976 m3 in late 2015 opportunities were identified to reduce water consumption in the
santiago factory in the dominican republic and investments were made to change the urinals to a water free model the
impact can be observed from october 2015 and the trend in 2016 clearly shows significantly less water usage than in 2015
for the manufacturing of lights products water withdrawals decreased by 79 percent due to the decrease of water withdrawals
for the poplar farms in brazil
