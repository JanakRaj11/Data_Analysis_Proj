                                                                                           4

macroeconomic environment
in terms of the business environment 201011 was a mixed year while the longterm
signals were largely positive there were some industryspecific concerns that adversely
affected business with the global economy recovering from the lows of 2008 we are
seeing positive trends that have led to lower risk perceptions greater global financial
stability and improved business sentiments much of the new growth impetus is coming
from the developing and emerging economies including the indian economy which is well
on its way to regaining the high growth momentum witnessed immediately prior to the
economic meltdown of 2008 since economic growth and infrastructure development share
a reciprocal relationship the infrastructure industry in india is poised to grow significantly
in the coming years however the commodity price based inflation seen since the
beginning of 2010 has led to a margin squeeze in the indian construction industry since not
all input cost increases can be passed on to the customer also an increase in the
benchmark repo rate and subsequent hardening of lending rates across the industry has
resulted in early signs of a slowdown in large investment outlays with an expected
economic growth and largescale infrastructural development in india we look forward to a
good next year for the construction industry


construction industry landscape
despite high expectations 201011 witnessed a slowdown in the momentum of new
project development in the construction sector on account of fewer new projects and major
implementation issues with ongoing projects the power sector showed a similar trend
with low rates of realization on the planned generation capacity environmental
repercussions of planned hydel power projects and global safety concerns over nuclear
power generation are significant factors currently affecting the development of the power
sector while some of the factors for this slowdown can be attributed to administrative
issues with the implementation agencies much of it is related to planning and policy 
especially the critical need to find the right balance between sociopolitical and economic
factors serious issues regarding land acquisition environmental clearances and risk
ownership in publicprivate partnerships will have to be addressed soon if we wish to see a
sustainable growth in india




                                                                                                  5

the following sections contain some of my key perspectives on sustainability corporate
governance technology and innovation and corporate social responsibility that together
will help us achieve our organizational goal of creating responsible infrastructure


sustainability at hcc
we pride ourselves on being providers of high quality infrastructure that promote economic
growth and improve the quality of life for all the people we have a longstanding
commitment of creating responsible infrastructure hence the core concept of
sustainability namely holistic growth with a responsibility towards people and the
environment has easily found a home at hcc as we continue to innovate and apply next 
gen practices to successfully execute some of the largest and most challenging projects in
the country we also remain committed to our various social responsibilities hccs
sustainability drive has taken on the form of specific initiatives in different areas on the
environmental front we have made progress on minimizing the environmental impact at all
our project sites through reduced material consumption and waste generation we have
taken concrete steps to precisely measure our water consumption and discharge at our
sites and are implementing water reuse and recycling techniques that will help us fulfil our
stated goal of zero water discharge one of our key policy initiatives involves is to
rigorously focus on the safety and health of our employees and ultimately achieving the
goal of zero reportable injuries across our operations over the past year we have
received multiple recognitions for our safety records our environmental health and
safety practices go beyond the statutory requirements and form part of our
internationallycertified integrated management systems we are also working towards
improving awareness of the integrated management systems among our employees as
part of our social commitment we are actively engaged in numerous initiatives across our
local communities in the areas of education healthcare and disaster relief


corporate governance
our commitment to the principles of transparency integrity professionalism and
accountability in all our dealings forms the foundation for our continuous endeavour to
create sustainable value for our stakeholders including the society at large in this pursuit
hcc places highest emphasis on business ethics and corporate governance practices
across all its business activities these strong governance systems have helped us make

                                                                                                6

progress towards our sustainability goals our board of directors and management are
playing active roles in fulfilling their obligations and responsibilities timely disclosures and
transparent business practices have made our governance framework very effective hcc
has established systems to encourage employee participation in various environmental
health and safety and social initiatives in addition a number of new programs and
initiatives have been undertaken to effectively engage our internal and external holders
with the goal of making them a part of our sustainability journey


technology and innovation
in a highly competitive construction market improving technical and technological
competencies and enhancing efficiency is becoming increasingly important at hcc we
firmly believe that technological innovation will not only make us competitive but also help
us meet our goals of creating responsible infrastructure we are based in india but we
operate in a manner that is worldclass in that respect we are a global company with an
objective of capturing creating and delivering value we have developed a strategic plan
for research and development rd in 201011 we also created an innovention forum
for collecting and developing new ideas generated within the organization the program
has witnessed overwhelming participation from our employees they have submitted ideas
for improving efficiency in ongoing projects as well as novel strategies for energy and
water conservation and reducing environmental damages many of these ideas are being
developed in collaboration with the company management and a few have already been
implemented at our sites to encourage and recognize employee participation the top
innovative idea generators are rewarded with trophies and cash prizes through effective
implementation of these strategies it is our endeavour to achieve excellence in
construction design and solutions we recognise that innovation is going to be the key
industry differentiator for us going forward and hence we believe it would be material to
our sustainability as a company


corporate social responsibility
at hcc our corporate social responsibility csr activities build an important bridge
between business operations and social commitments thereby ultimately helping us focus
on the development of responsible infrastructure our csr initiatives fall under the five
categories of education water conservation disaster response hivaids awareness and

                                                                                                7

community development further to our restrategising csr initiative in 200910 we
continued to contribute to and invest in the communities around our project sites under
each of these categories as part of our achievements in the workplace intervention
program wpi for raising awareness about hivaids among our workforce we made great
inroads in expanding our pool of master trainers and peer educators with this enhanced
inhouse training capacity we no longer need to rely on outside resources to carry forward
the wpi program another major csr highlight was the disaster relief and restoration work
undertaken by the employees of two hcc project sites in the immediate aftermath of the
leh flash floods in august 2010 the courageous and earnest service performed by our
employees won an allround appreciation from the members of local communities as well as
the local administration this is a reflection of the deep social commitment ingrained in our
organization and in our people our commitment to the communities around us does not
depend on having a formal policy alone it is part of the dna of our company that the
personnel at site respond to the needs of the communities around them


the rest of the report provides highlights of our sustainability initiatives and achievements
in 201011 as we move forward in our sustainability journey we welcome feedback from
you and all our stakeholders




                                                                                            8

from the president and whole time directors desk
excerpts from interview with mr arun v karambelkar




in the year 201011 we made continued and significant progress towards fulfilling hccs
top three organizational sustainability commitments  health safety  environmental
practices water management and awareness of workforce the scope of existing
initiatives was extended to cover more number of project sites and new sustainability
strategies were designed and implemented

corporate social responsibility and inclusivity of all stakeholders is intrinsic to the way we
do business society is the biggest stakeholder across our business verticals especially in
infrastructure projects and it is our endeavor to create dependable and responsible
infrastructure that excels in aesthetics engineering quality and being ahead of schedule
the monumental bandraworli sea link project in mumbai inaugurated in june 2009 is
testament to the quality of our work the road surface is in good condition and has
required negligible maintenance work even after three monsoon seasons

creation of responsible infrastructure entails responsibility towards people environment
investors employees and clients a major aspect of this responsibility is providing a safe
workplace environment to our employees who often work at challenging locations building
upon hccs excellent safety track record we were accorded several recognitions for
various project sites during the past year among the many proactive measures we have
undertaken to further enhance safety at our project sites are improved workforce
awareness programs and videobased safety trainings having achieved progress in our
accident statistics we are in the process of implementing a more stringent severity index
which will ultimately pave way to a zerotolerance policy requiring a total absence of fatal
accidents

as signatories of the ceo water mandate we continue to implement solutions and make
progress in addressing the issue of water scarcity this includes creating better awareness
and installing water flow meters across the project sites for measuring water consumption

                                                                                                 9

moreover hcc has adopted specific budget allocation for constructing wastewater
treatment units water reuse and recycling facilities at all old and new project sites we
are on track to meet our goal of making all our sites zerowater discharge and then moving
towards being a waterpositive organization

sustainability is increasingly playing a major role in how we operate as a business our
organizational sustainability framework is built around integrated management system
ims champions at every project site at each quarterly project managers meeting one
session is dedicated exclusively to planning and reviewing hccs sustainability initiatives
nonfinancial aspects of our performance are beginning to differentiate us from
competitors while qualifying for global projects and partnerships looking forward every
strategic decision we make about entering into new sectors will take into account
sustainability aspects including the potential impact of planned activities on the natural
environment over the coming years we intend to keep building on our current progress
and will strive to achieve the highest global sustainability standards

ec strategy implementation

our strategy to move from being a construction firm to evolve into an engineering
procurement construction epc entity is in response to the industry needs and is in sync
with our growth strategy

the recent trends of global knowledge transfer global partnerships valuedriven high
impact projects along with improvements in what if virtual design efficiency delivery
times and efficiency of scale have direct impacts on our business

our business ecosystem is experiencing shifts  more of our projects are public private
partnerships and the scale is only growing larger we see that our customers are moving
towards value instead of commodity we are increasingly working with our suppliers on a
collaborative mode borrowing and sharing expertise our investors are globally influenced
and are mostly image and optics driven our workforce consists of people of a younger
average age who are technology savvy and driven by performance

these shifts in our business ecosystem coupled with the trends impacting our business are
some of the key drivers in our vision to move towards the epcm space this is what forms
our value strategy




                              growth strategy




                                                                      value strategy

                  must do                             opportunistic




in order to move into the epcm space in 201011 we developed and implemented the

       case study project implementation system  project tree
project tree is an hcc initiative that seeks to improve the overall project management
capabilities of the organization and to have better control on the projects ms parsons
brinckerhoff one of the worlds leading project management consultants was brought to
help us conduct this exercise and to recommend best practices project tree was first
implemented in november 2009

five pilot projects were chosen in order to study the systems within hcc  maroshiruparel
tunnel badarpur elevated corridor kishanganga hydroelectric power project teesta
hydroelectric power project stage vi lot iv and vishakhapatnam cavern project

the overall exercise was divided into three phases

phase i  study of existing practices and systems within the company establishing the gaps
with respect to the best practices of project management and identify the systems
processes and documentation necessary to close these gaps

phase ii and phase iii  implementation of the accepted systems and processes closing the
gaps identified previously and training the employees on the use of tools methods
practices systems and gauge the improvements

after the study of the headoffice and the pilot project sites during phase i the
consultants identified certain processes and systems to be missing in the organization the
hcc management agreed to bring in these processes and tools in order to close the gaps

during phase ii and phase iii the teams visited the project sites set up the tools
processes and systems that were identified and trained the project teams on the use and
importance of these processes in managing the projects

at the end of the exercise certain key documents were developed and submitted to the
management for review and acceptance and subsequent implementation across the
organization

the pilot project sites that were part of this exercise are now reaping the benefits of the
implemented project control system through the use of new tools and systems

code of conduct

good governance and ethical business practices are more important now than ever we
have always strived to embed our core values1 into everyday decision making processes
and this philosophy is further strengthened by adoption of a code of conduct there are
two separate categories of codes of conduct  one for the nonexecutive directors and
the other for the executive directors and the designated employees in the senior
management2 the code is intended to serve as a guiding principle for senior management
who affirm compliance with this code on an annual basis as at the end of each financial
year the code of conduct for executive and nonexecutive directors clearly defines
processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest

the code of conduct is handed over and explained to all the designated employees in the
senior management during induction the company has also instituted a comprehensive
code of conduct for prevention of insider trading for its directors and designated
employees it deals with the treatment of insider information is available to all the
designated employees of the company it clearly mentions that all directorsmembers of
senior managementdesignated employees shall comply with insider trading regulations
issued by the securities and exchange board of india and the insider trading code issued
by the company as may be applicable to them

further the code of conduct for senior management also provides that they and their
immediate family members should not accept any gift gratuity fee or other benefits of any
kind from suppliers customers competitors and related business parties if it is known
believed or suspected that its purpose is to influence a transaction andor if the value such
an item is significant andor might cause embarrassment to the company

compliance officer who shall be available to the senior management to answer their
queries and to help them comply with the code

economic performance
hcc entered the year 201011 with a healthy order book and during the year we
efficiently executed these orders more or less as per schedule given the damp market
conditions the executed orders could not be fully replenished with new orders and the
order book reduced a little to rs 18127 at the close of 201011 the order backlog is well
distributed across various sectors including power transport water and industrial

our turnover improved by 73 to rs 4144 crore in 201011 with the second half of
200910 witnessing an increase in activity one had expected 201011 to be a better year
for execution but as the year progressed some serious issues regarding land acquisition
and environment clearances derailed the anticipated growth however the group turnover
crossed rs 7000 crore postacquisition of karl steiner ag switzerland operating
ebitda margins increased to 132 from 122

while we continued topline growth in line with the project execution schedule for the year
it is commendable that this was achieved by maintaining ebitda margins in an inflationary
environment through a judicious mix of projects and effective monitoring of operational
costs across projects

interest costs on the other hand have been high largely due to an increase in working
capital requirements given the delays in payments and settlement of claims by some
clients as well as increase in interest rates caused by rbi policies this impacted the
bottom line to an extent the company has controlled capital requirements by increasing
subcontracting activities across its different projects

                  market capitalization of hcc visàvis industry players


suppliers

we have stringent policies and practices governing suppliers and transporters registration
evaluation and selection we also practice periodic evaluation of their performance the
evaluation has clauses of cost effectiveness health and safety practices and compliances
amongst others we strongly prefer procurement of materials required at the project sites
from locations in proximity not only will this create opportunities for livelihood during the
project duration but will also help the local suppliers to upgrade and maintain quality of
products to cater to hccs quality standards


                                                                                             43

while we continue to define all procurements within india as local hcc makes every
attempt at procuring most materials from in and around the project sites to reduce
complexity of logistics barring some standard raw materials which are procured centrally
our top 10 significant suppliers in terms of their monetary value are all locally based and
account for as much as 4112 of the total supplier costs


   case study monetary savings  resource conservation through
                      procurement changes
procurement of construction material accounts for as much as 40 of hccs total
expenses it thus becomes imperative to conserve and use these resources optimally as
they bear a cost implication on our business in 201011 we undertook the following
initiatives to conserve resources and minimize waste leading to significant cost savings of
more than rs 55 lakhs at the maroshi ruparel tunnel project and more than rs 45 lakhs
at teesta hydroelectric power project lot iv

1 procuring steel to custom specifications directly from vendor
steel rebars a necessary resource in our business is available in the market in random
lengths between 10 to 12 meters we often have to convert them into specific lengths 
shapes per our requirements the cutting and bending is done at our project sites for
large scale infrastructure projects these modifications at the field result in a substantial
waste of resources to avoid this we partnered with tata steel one of our key steel
suppliers to directly procure rebars of custom lengths and sizes this requires us to plan
our material needs ahead of time to give sufficient lead time to our suppliers this
cooperation has worked successfully especially in our maroshi tunnel project  where we
had to use many 125 m long rebars to make steel rings use of fixed length rebars led to
zero wastage at this site we have also achieved significant reduction in wastage at our
badarpur flyover project by using fixed length rebars

2 controlling rolling margins
we worked with our suppliers to procure steel rebars with controlled rolling margin
tolerance in order to conserve amount of steel used but remained within critical
standards and quality levels required

3 material reconciliation
it used to be a practice across our sites to order fuel as and when required directly by our
appointed project site authorities fuel being a non renewable fast depleting resource we
have begun streamlining and optimizing its consumption now all orders are required to be
placed through the head office we have also placed a cap of rs 5000 for any emergency
direct onsite fuel purchase during project planning specific budgets are allocated for
each type of materials in the past year we strongly pushed our site teams to use lesser
than the allocated budget for hsd many of our sites have managed to keep their spending
on hsd well below the budget owing to enhanced awareness and strict monitoring of
consumption patterns

we intend to extend this material reconciliation targets to other major construction
materials at all sites by creating a core team to monitor the site performance on these
parameters we will continue to aggressively implement our waste minimization initiatives
across our projects

                                                                                                44

environmental performance

environmental policy

it is our environmental policy to manage our project activitiesproductsservices in an
environmentally responsible and lawful manner so that their environmental impacts are
reduced to a practicable minimum and that there is continual improvement in our
environmental performance




scope and comparison

while we have introduced the scope for this report we will discuss some other aspects of
our scope impacting the comparison of the environmental performance parameters herein

under the hydropower vertical last year we had 11 projects compared to the 13 this year
3 new sites  punatsangchchu dagachhu and pare  have started to report on their
sustainability performance in addition to fullfledged reporting from our kishanganga site
which started only last year our project at chamera has been demobilized and hence is not
in scope this year

in our transport vertical 4 new projects have been brought under the sustainability
umbrella  nh 34 package 3 4 and 5 along with the kolkata elevated corridor project the
chennai bypass project badarpur elevated corridor project and nh 28 packages 1 2 3
and 4 are not in scope this year as these projects have begun to demobilize

                                                                                          45

in the water vertical ghodazari site from last year is nearing completion and has not
reported this year pws nc25 has been added to scope

the nuclear  special project vertical has grown in scope by introducing three new sites as
a part of this report  aditya potshell civil works and fabrication works and padur rock
cavern project have been added

this change in scope itself makes comparison of the data from last year to this difficult as
we have reported vertical wise and not project wise on many indicators further our
projects have different requirements in each of their phases in terms of materials required
or power consumption making comparison invalid between two different phases thus we
here present our performance on the environmental indicators with this disclaimer for the
period 201011

energy consumption

in 201011 we used 8472 million litres of diesel and 1218 million litres of aviation
turbine fuel atf we require atf for high altitude operations as it is a suitable fuel for low
temperature zones our cumulative electricity consumption at all project sites within scope
was 256 million kwh


                                                                                             46

due to direct energy consumption our total greenhouse gas ghg emissions stood at

many of our sites have adopted different methods of energy conservation

 from energy savings due to process redesign
  uri site saved 435751 kwh by replacing higher capacity compressor with smaller
  capacity compressor for the gantry vibrator operation on site

  fuel of 809 l was saved by replacement of 500kva dg by 125kva dg for domestic use
  during non commercial uses

 savings due to conversion and retrofitting of equipment
  the conversion from halogen lamps to high pressure sodium vapour hpsv lamps
  resulted in huge savings of 112050 kwh at the aap fabrication site and 124150 kwh
  at the civil works site

  at the assam road project by fixing the apfc panel power factor we achieved a rebate
  of 12 in energy consumption amounting to as much as 2721 kwh

  aap civil works site started used of 2 phase ac arc welding machine in lieu of motor
  generator dc arc welding machine accruing savings of 51236 kwh further this site
  also made changes to the sloping belt system for transport of batch aggregates so that
  it would come to a halt immediately instead of the one minute it used to take before
  this has resulted in 5571 kwh of savings by replacing 75 kw sump pump with an over
  head water tank this site further saved 15936 kwh

 changes in employee behavior
  the assam road project team educated all people on site to put off geysers  lights
  before leaving the rooms or when not in use subsequently reducing power consumption
  by 38880 kwh
  chutak project practiced switching off dg sets for fixed low utility hours at the officer
  and worker camps saving 18209 kwh of power consumption

                                                                                         47

water management at hcc un ceo water mandate cop  2011

the concept of sustainability which has so far been used to focus only on environmental
issues can only work effectively if developmental and societal issues such as poverty
reduction sustainable agriculture and comprehensive water management are taken into
account

water is an important environmental and developmental area of concern at hcc we have
begun recycling water and now use 30 per cent less water than before at our construction
sites we have gained a lot in this process  despite the recent drought in andhra pradesh
which put a stop in the construction activity around the state we were able to continue our
construction because we were recycling water

we believe water supply in india is in imminent danger however this shortage can be
effectively addressed by recycling industrial water and a good part of our personaluse
water this would require largescale investment in water recycling and reuse
implementation so infrastructure is not only in conflict with environment part of it is
actually environment protecting and enhancing

water initiatives undertaken by us as part of the un ceo water mandate essentially reflect
hccs commitment towards water resource management we strive for and will continue to
pursue the development of sustainable infrastructure by adopting sustainable water
resource management approaches at our construction sites and by advocating the same to
our peer industry group people and communities in hccs sphere of influence at local
national and global levels

introduction
with unprecedented increases in urban populations constrained water supplies energy
shifts to mitigate climate change and vulnerability to disasters communities worldwide
are seeking more sustainable infrastructures that are resilient highperforming resource
efficient costeffective and environmentfriendly in order to create an enabling
environment there is need for coordinated effort from all the stakeholders in general and
corporate players engaged in developing infrastructure in particular

hcc an integrated group spanning engineering  construction real estate infrastructure
and urban development  management recognizes the correlation of business
sustainability with water resource and is committed to reducing the amount of water used
across our construction project sites

as the first indian company to endorse united nations global compacts ceo water
mandate we make it a point to embed the principles of water resource management in our
work as a responsible corporate steward we have always motivated other companies to

                                                                                             50

join this initiative by presenting best practices of water stewardship at hcc at various
local regional national and international conferences and symposia such moves are
crucial in bringing about inclusive development for the nation and for the development of
sustainable infrastructure

this chapter describes the efforts we undertook in the past one year to maintain and
improve our group wide water consciousness as well as implementation of the 4r water
principles reduce recycle reuse and recharge at all our direct operations and beyond
besides efforts have also been made to highlight hccs engagement with various
organizations dealing with issues related to water each section of this chapter outlines
activities  efforts undertaken by us in implementing the six key elements of the ceo water
mandate direct operations supply chain and watershed management collective action
public policy community engagement and transparency


direct operations
considering the significance of water management at our projects sites hcc has
internalized a process for implementing the six key areas of action under the aegis of the
ceo water mandate the implementation process was thoroughly described in hccs first
communication on progress copwater in 2009 the specific elements of this process
are listed below

   hccs un water mandate team  communication mechanisms the team comprises
    of water experts and practitioners based at hccs head office in mumbai who
    communicates with the project sites through a nodal officer water champion
    designated at each site

   implementation process the implementation process includes visit of un water
    mandate team members to project sites for assessment of ground situation techno
    economic and social assessment for the implementation of identified water
    interventions costing of the feasible interventions and development of detailed
    proposal for water intervention activities at the sites in consultation with respective
    project managers and the respective water champion each feasible proposal has a
    specific deadline for its execution at the project site the implementation process is
    schematically described in the diagram below

   methodology  tools a set of resource documents are created to serve as
    implementation tools these have been found effective for increased standardization
    and systematic performance management

   monitoring water related activities on site and internal accountability mechanisms
    commitment for implementation from project managers and monthly progress reports
    from each project sites enables our un water mandate team at mumbai head office to
    keep track of all the interventions being undertaken and their performance against
    anticipated outcomes

details of this implementation process can be found in hccs copwater of 2009

                                                                                              51

water intake by source

water meters have been installed on all our operating sites our total water consumption
for the financial year 201011 stands at 178 million m3 including groundwater surface
water rainwater water from municipalities and water tankers we recycled 374372 m3 of
water which is 21 per cent of all water consumed across all our project sites

snapshots of water interventions at our project sites

during the past year our un water mandate team visited several construction sites across
india and abroad to implement technically and socioeconomically feasible proposals for
reduction recycle reuse and recharge of water efforts were also made to evaluate the
performance of water interventions proposed earlier

out of several water interventions proposed and implemented at our construction projects
we present the following two illustrate the progress we have made on our ceo water
mandate commitment

              case study water conservation and reuse at the
                           padur cavern project
the padur cavern site is a prestigious contract work from indian strategic petroleum
reserves limited isprl to construct a strategic crude oil storage cavern at padur
karnataka the work includes construction of underground rock caverns part a to store
125 million tons crude oil the sub activities include detailed engineering and design
underground excavation access tunnels water curtain galleries main storage cavern
shafts and associated underground civil works including geological mapping the main
activity of tunnelling requires high quantities of water for borehole pressurization drilling
dust suppression during mucking curing and rockbolt grouting

our vizag cavern project at vishakhapatnam andhra pradesh which has similar features
as the padur site served as a good example of implementation of wastewater treatment
and reuse details of vizag cavern project water interventions can be found in hccs cop
water for 2009 and 2010 motivated from the vizag cavern success story we installed a
tailormade wastewater treatment plant of 1 mld capacity to treat the wastewater to
reusable parameters and recycled it for the tunnelling activities


                                                                                              53

apart from the wastewater treatment our un water mandate team explored the rain water
harvesting potential at the site and suggested a proposal to recharge the borewell located
at the workers camp by rooftop rain water harvesting systems




recycling of tunnel wastewater for tunnel construction activities by introducing wwtp

as of august 2011 the aforementioned tunnelling activity is in its primary stage therefore
the water consumption and corresponding wastewater generation is relatively very low
02mld when compared to designed capacity of the wastewater treatment plant 1mld
the treated water is currently being used for tunnelling activity as well as for dust
suppression the water consumption for tunnelling activities is however expected to reach
1 mldday as the project progresses

this water intervention assists the hccs project site at padur in
        minimize dependency for water on external sources
        save costs expected to be incurred for the procurement of water and
        save huge quantity of fresh water for the neighbouring community

case study installation of desalination plant at dgnp drydock site
the dgnp drydock project is located besides sea face at mumbai maharashtra the
construction activity mainly involves cement concrete work the only way to fulfil the
water requirement of this project was to procure fresh water from municipal corporation of
greater mumbai mcgm however this would have created a water burden on the local
community which already faces acute water scarcity especially in summer we therefore
decided to install a desalination plant of 5 m3  hr capacity

the parameters of treated water were set as below
       quality of water  suitable for construction purpose
       quantity of processed water or output from the plant  5m3hr
       assumed hours of operation  20hrday


                                                                                         54

till june 2011 3282 kl of treated water was made available through the desalination
plant and was used for construction activities the projected water conservation for the
period of 3 years is estimated to be 108000 kl


supply chain and watershed management
we recognize the fact that the adoption of comprehensive and total water management
aimed at developing responsible infrastructure is not possible without engaging
contractors  subcontractors who execute various subtasks at our projects sites
suppliers supplying raw materials and service providers assisting directly or indirectly in
the execution of our construction projects

we are effectively engaging stakeholders by communicating the significance and strategies
of adopting the 4r water practices through focused events conferences workshops 
symposium organized at local state and national levels

for instance on the occasion of world water day 22 nd march 2011 a communiqué
detailing the significance of hccs water initiatives was sent to all contractors suppliers 
service providers it was aimed at sensitizing them to adopt water conservation measures
in their respective activities  operations




     world water day 2011 celebrations               hcc communiqué sent out on the
         at the hcc head office                          world water day 2011




                                                                                             55

collective action  public policy
recognising the importance of joint efforts through collective action and in keeping with
the role hcc has historically played in the public policy arena we have been involved in the
articulation and promotion of actions and activities through partnership with civil society
representatives multilateral agencies corporate groups and others we also participate in
various policy advocacy forums at the company local regional national and international
levels

water initiative at kihim maharashtra

kihim is a coastal village in raigarh district of maharashtra ie in the konkan coastal zone
it has a scenic beach and is primarily a tourist destination details of the interventions at
kihim can be found in hccs copwater for 2010

in line with our earlier initiative efforts are continually being made to spread the
significance of environmental enhancement projects at kihim amongst local residents of
kihim aimed at addressing fresh water availability in the coastal village of maharashtra
efforts were made to establish rain water harvesting systems in the village there were a
total of three pilot proposals three public proposals four private proposals and seven
community proposals execution of rainwater harvesting rwh structures was carried
out as per these proposals total water conserved through these rwh structures in 2010


                                                                                            64

is summarized hereunder all the results are based on community observations and log
records maintained by members of the community

below are the figures for months of july 2010 to sept 2010

      quantity of water recharge through bore wells is 785 m3
      quantity of water recharge through open well is 1388 m3
      total quantity of water recharge through bore well  open well is 2173 m3
      quantity of treated municipal tap water saved by using rain water for household
       activities is 1688 m3

after the implementation of these aforementioned rwh based water initiative these
proposals proved to be significant for the longterm water conservation solution at kihim
it should be noted that through the aforementioned interventions at kihim villagers have
realized that abandoned wells can be used for water recharge and that rwh lightens the
work load of women by making water available for household activity at the utilization
point the execution of rwh projects at kihim helped the plumbers understand the
functional purpose of each component of design it also allowed the masons to display their
skill to increase the quantity of recharged water we further explored a pilot project
wherein the roof of a local school was connected to the recharge well over the years our
initiatives have positively impacted residents of kihim and during the past year they
voluntarily came forward for guidance on adopting rainwater harvesting in their respective
premises
following are some pictures of the voluntary implementation of rwh projects under the
technical guidance of our un water mandate team

employee health and safety

at hcc safety at the project site has always been an area of utmost priority a number of
our projects were commended with certificates of appreciation for achieving record safe
man hours in the year 201011

 the polavaram right main canal project achieved 6 million safe man hours from

  527 million safe man hours from october 2008 to september 2010 and were highly
  commended by the client nhpc national hydro power corporation for this
  achievement despite logistic and climate constraints

last year we had reported the injury rate and lost days per million manhours worked for all
sites where data was available in order to streamline the reporting this year we have
calculated these parameters only for those sites that are in scope this year this is
presented in the following graph which gives a vertical wise trend at sites in scope



                                                                                          71

we see an encouraging trend of fall in injury rate across all four verticals all four projects
in scope under the water vertical stood out with their record of zero injuries and fatalities
while we maintain a record of even first aid level injuries we have reported injuries that
classify as losttime cases herein the lostdays count start only after the 48hour period
for reportable injuries as per the factories act 1948 we have continued to enforce
stricter safety measures to avoid a similar incident at the site




                                                                                              72

hivaids awareness
we have long recognized the serious impact that hivaids amongst migrant workers can
have on the enterprise and has initiated the workplace intervention program wpi since
2004 the program aims to sustain optimal workplace productivity by conducting
prevention education and awareness training as hivaids have emerged as a major
threat not only to the health system but also to the economy of the nation we view
hivaids more as a socialeconomic issue than a purely social one

our goal is to educate raise awareness on hivaids among the workforce to enable them
to protect themselves and their families by minimizing hiv infection and contributing a
supportive environment for prevention response

rationale for adopting hivaids as csr mandate

 we directly and indirectly employ 45000 migrant laborers and truck drivers they form
  one of the most vulnerable groups to acquire hivaids due to lack of knowledge and
  awareness mainly falling under the productive and reproductive age group of 1549
  they act as a bridge population

 while there is still no cure for hivaids prevention has proven to be effective

 workplace intervention program wpi helps protect the rights of infected people and
  reduces the stigmadiscrimination attached to the epidemic

 national aids control organization naco emphasizes partnerships and alliances with
  corporateprivate sector in combating hivaids as these sectors have a significant
  stake in the overall wellbeing of the nation

components of the hivaids wpiprevention program

      hivaids educational and awareness programs
      training the trainers  master trainers program
      training of peer educators
      behavior change activities
      involvement of people living with hivaids in training programs
      linking testing care and support services with the government facilities

the wpi model is based on three tier system viz training of trainers creating trained
peer educators and sensitization of management officers so that their support the
program will percolate down to all beneficiaries the objective behind deputing a team of
trained trainers master trainers is to promote good health among our workforce in order
to derive higher productivity prevention of infection and providing care by reducing the
stigma and discrimination at the workplace




                                                                                          77

training of the trainers master trainers program

the master trainers play very important role in prevention and creating hivaids
awareness at project sites in following way

      sustainability of the program
      consistency in delivering correct hivaids messages to the workforce
      regular monitoring within the sitedepartment
      abiding to the hivaids work place policy by implementing effectively the wpi
       program
      reaching to the employees who are vulnerable and at risk and ultimately
       securing them and their families future and health
      catering to all the employees entering in the project at any given point of time by
       educating making them aware on the issue and empowering them for adopting
       preventive measures
      broadening the csr hivaids initiative and expanding to community systematically
       and effectively
      creating conducive environment which will result in minimizing infection and stigma
       and discrimination

in the past year the training of trainers  master trainers tot was conducted at our
head office for volunteers nominated from various departments during this program

building on the drn model in india and mexico the engineering  construction disaster
response partnership drp4  a new private public partnership model for disaster
response emerged in the early months of fy 201011 this includes global partnerships and
regional networks hcc was one of the actively participating companies that shared
specific interventions in past natural disasters to steer work in the creation of drp

in 201011 hcc expanded the emergency trainings to cover more number of sites and
employees while the first responder training is a basic training given to employees on
how to respond during crises engineering in emergencies training is an advanced level
residential training given to a subset of hcc engineers to qualify them for emergency relief
and rehabilitation work the following table shows the total number of manhours and
employees covered under both the training programs

chutak hydroelectric project kargil sent relief material and a rescue team for the
rehabilitation work at leh this included 500 packets of food material 500 blankets and a
rescue team of 25 people supervisor cook and laborers


community development

each of the infrastructure projects that we build has a positive impact on the communities
that benefit from it in addition during the course of our construction some of our sites
have taken up activities to help the surrounding communities




                                                                                          81

community development initiatives by hcc at assam road project site

the assam road project is one of the most prestigious projects of hcc in northeastern
india being carried out under the national highways development project nhdp ministry
of roads and transport government of india upon its successful completion the highway
project will connect the extreme eastern and western parts of the country and contribute
to the overall development within assam the project stretches along the northern half of
the dima hasao autonomous hill district in assam a region marked by difficult hilly
terrain underdevelopment and militancy very poor connectivity to the outside world has
been identified as the major cause for the lack of development in this region

as the lone contractor in the area until recently we have played a pivotal role in providing
connectivity to this remote region resulting in new employment opportunities for the local
communities and tourism activity this will hopefully bring an end to the militancy

through structured intervention we have been successful in winning the faith and building
up the confidence of the residents of dima hasao district some of our initiatives include
sponsorship and material help in the local community festivals and construction of
approach roads for easier transportation of the local people we have also sponsored a
national integration mela at haflong and initiated the restoration and protection of stone
house a local heritage structure originally built in the 16th century in addition we have
sponsored the construction of a temple and developed a football field for the village youth
a total of rs 719680 was spent on these community initiatives

concrete life cycle and its stages building through an example

concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials while the availability of
raw materials is rapidly depleting the capability of existing processes to recycle materials
has remained constant or is not rapidly evolving the national readymixed concrete
association nrmca of usa envisions the transformation of the built environment by
improving the way concrete is manufactured and used in order to achieve an optimum
balance among environmental social and economic conditions a structured approach to
overcome this sustainability challenge is to individually address the various lifecycle of
concrete as shown in the figure below

hcc has begun to embrace such concepts and inducing them in live projects in a phased
manner following are some of the sustainability strategies our rd department has been
actively pursuing




                                                                                            89

      improved concreting practices that eliminate one or two steps completely leading
       to reduced energy consumption example alternative concreting ways for dam
       concrete
      enhanced use of supplementary cementitious materials such as polycarboxylate
       based water reducers
      judicious selection of equipment for aggregates and their optimal use in concrete
      concreting that require less curing by balancing between strength gain rate and
       specifications
      judicious use of chemical admixtures through research and development
      recycling of concrete and asphalt pavements
      use of large volumes of pond ash for embankment construction and subgrade
       stabilization
      alternative additive materials that reduce section thicknesses while improving the
       performance  and hence the life  of structure


research  development collaborations
we gain rd insights and foresights through our close and active associations partnering
and participation in various national and international industry dialogues

procuring value

with dramatic changes in the nature of construction technology it will become critical for
suppliers and manufacturers to propose valueadded products and services hence a part
of our rd efforts involve the procurement of such value additions through coordinated
and planned partnerships with our suppliers some of the strategies under consideration
include alternative concrete placement techniques advanced concrete proportioning
methods alternative and sustainable pavement designs soil stabilization strategies and
construction equipment modifications tailored for specific applications

academic dialogue

as a structured part of our overall research efforts the rd department carries out active
academic and research dialogue on concrete technology technology management and
alternative construction methodologies

one such event was an industryacademia workshop hosted by hcc in february 2011 the
daylong interaction the first of its kind to be held in india brought together leading
experts from both the academic and industry community on a common platform and
offered fresh perspectives on a range of issues related to concrete science and technology

the discussions were held under six broad themes  educational needs of industry and
academia fundamental research applied research domestic and international
collaborations ongoing research in the industry and industry research needs reputed
faculty members from the indian institutes of technologies iits the indian institute of
science iisc bangalore and howard university usa as well as eminent industry
researchers participated in this event

                                                                                             90

some of the key outcomes of the discussions include identification of key areas of basic
and applied concrete research over the next five years identification of research areas
where industry and academia can collaborate the need for enhancing industryacademic
interaction through internships sabbatical research leaves for faculty members instituting
industrial professorships and sponsored research to ensure an ongoing engagement and
continuation of such a novel effort a second meeting on similar lines will be organized by
the iit kanpur in august 2011

international conversations

internationally construction companies engineering organizations professional societies
and standardizing bodies are rapidly assimilating sustainability as a key organizational
attribute at hcc we firmly believe that benchmarking and learning from international
practices is a critical and sustainable way of learning best practices

as a part of endeavor hcc has become member of the massachusetts institute of
technology mit  led industrial liaison program the department of civil engineering at
the mit is home to the concrete sustainability hub which has been primarily created
through industryacademic collaboration the primary goal of this interdisciplinary center
is to accelerate emerging breakthroughs in concrete science and engineering and
transferring that science into practice

in addition we also regularly invite international experts to address various gatherings as
part of our sustainable capacity building efforts such dialogues provide a critical
international flavor and insight to our initiatives

through sustained efforts driven by the objective of establishing sustainable overall
competitiveness the culture of focused research and development are taking deeper roots
into hccs culture

    case study ip protection at aditya aluminum project orissa

challenges

a total of 180 potshells were required to be delivered within a timeframe of 15 months for
the aluminum smelter project as per the contract the design drawings for these potshells
were to be released to hcc after the client confirmed compliance to hccs intellectual
property documents protection setup our challenge was to implement the solution within
45 days and get required compliance confirmation from the client

business need

some of the key client requirements are summarized below
 a clear audit trail for all the documents the requirement was so stringent that the client
  also wanted to trace how many printouts were fired for each document and who all have
  access to them


                                                                                           92

     to prevent leakage of information from the endpoints of desktoplaptop the desktop and
      laptop needed to be protected for information leakage

     this setup had to be isolated from rest of the computer network only one system in that
      setup should have access to email while rest of the services like ftp telnet remote
      desktop network sharing had to be blocked

     all data pertaining to intellectual property should not be allowed to be stored on local
      desktops

     audit trails on who accessed the yellow rooms where the documents were generated and
      printed


    solutions implemented

   in order to generate audit trails for the documents hcc implemented seclore information
    rights management solution with plugins for autocad to protect the drawings it also
    provided protection for ms word excel powerpoint text and jpeg the concept of seclore
    hot folder was also implemented and policies were created for the use of these folders the
    strength of this software was that the moment any user stores or creates a document in
    that folder the policy gets applied to that document with the help of information rights
    management control was applied to the edit copy and print functions on the contents of
    the documents

   on the perimeter security for the network we implemented firewall and network access
    control so that only registered mac address of the pc can only access this network
    services like ftp telnet and remote desktop were also controlled with the implementation
    of firewall and network access control we implemented end point protection to control
    the usage of usb bluetooth and ir devices the software also was able to capture snapshot
    of the prints taken from the machine for server authentication we implemented the rsa 2
    factor authentication manger for login and logout processes a system idle timeout policy
    was also defined for desktops and laptops

   an access control system which monitors and controls access to these rooms

   when certain documents were shared with the client manager for approval its usage was
    controlled by specifying a document expiry so that they automatically expire after the
    timeline predefined on the server

    we successfully met the stringent client compliance for ip protection of the design drawings
    by implementing the above solutions




                                                                                                 93

the assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with international
federation of accountants international standard for assurance engagements other than
audits or reviews of historical financial information isae 3000 our evidencegathering
procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance as set out in isae 3000 on
reporting principles as well as sustainability performance indicators as per gri 2006 gri g3
guidelines

our review methodology

    interviews at the companys corporate office with engineering and construction
      business heads function heads and key personnel to understand the sustainability
      vision mechanism for management of key sustainability issues and engagement with
      key stakeholders

    evidencing support of claims made in the report regarding the companys sustainability
      performance
    review of selected qualitative statements and sample case studies in various sections of
      the report

observations
our key observations are as follows
 the company has continued to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability by publishing
   its second sustainability report at the gri g3 a level and its third communication on
   progress cop to the un ceo water mandate in a row5
 the company has an occupational health  safety oh  s reporting system which
   records first aid incidence rate and environmental incidents hcc could report these
   statistics in addition to the injury rate fatalities severity and frequency rate henceforth




5
    this year the sustainability report also contains the cop to the un ceo water mandate

                                                                                             130

   the company has taken the following concrete actions to strengthen its water management
         o installation of flow meters to track water usage at project sites as witnessed at all
            three sites visited
         o construction of water treatment facilities as evidenced at kolkata elevated corridor
            project site
   a certain amount of data changed during the process of review the company is still in the
    process of establishing indicator protocols and streamlining data compilation for key
    performance indicators such as air emissions waste
   the company has continued to report on issues identified as material in its previous
    sustainability report beyond bread 200910 these views on materiality continue to
    remain internal to a large extent and the company could incorporate materiality analysis by
    external stakeholders in the future
   given the presence of its project sites across the country the companys current definition
    for local suppliers includes all those entities that are located within india going forward the
    company might consider suppliers operating in and around the project sites specifically as
    local

our conclusion

on the basis of our review scope and methodology nothing has come to our attention that
would cause us not to believe that the report presents the companys triplebottomline
performance in material respect

our assurance team
our assurance team comprising of multidisciplinary professionals has been drawn from our
climate change and sustainability services and undertakes similar engagements with various
indian and international companies as an assurance provider ey is required to comply with the
independence requirements set out in international federation of accountants ifac code of
ethics for professional accountants eys independence policies and procedures ensure
compliance with the code
