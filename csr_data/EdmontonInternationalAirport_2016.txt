at edmonton airports weve spent many years working towards
greater social environmental and financial sustainability in our
operations laying the cornerstones of a strong organization
that is able to meet todays needs without compromising
tomorrows opportunities

over the past year as we faced shifting economic conditions
that solid foundation played an important role in giving us
the strength and flexibility to adapt eia is a major economic
driver for our region supporting over 12000 jobs and
contributing 12 billion in gdp with a total economic impact
of 22 billion in 2014 now more than ever our community
needed us to continue delivering our mandate of driving
economic prosperity

our tradition of sustainable management helped us to meet
that challenge as we drew upon our financial sustainability
experience to adjust to the downward shift in our revenues
as a result we strategically managed expenses continued
to pay down debt and through it all increased our already
positive organizational credit rating

we capitalized on the trust and support we have earned
through our social sustainability efforts to raise a record
