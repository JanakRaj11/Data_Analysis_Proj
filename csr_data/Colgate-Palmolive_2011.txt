 colgates goal is to

certified sustainable         an industry consortium the coalition on sustainable palm oil with the mission of accelerating
    palm oil and              the availability of sustainable palm oil and its derivatives colgate has also sought alternatives
  derivatives from            such as the procurement of certificates or the replacement of palm oil and its derivatives in
  roundtable on
                              colgate products with other oils in addition colgate continues to support a moratorium on

                              who have direct contact with the producers
                                 in 2009 colgate committed to purchasing palm oil and palm kernel oil from rspo members
                              only and advised each of its suppliers of that commitment during these discussions we also
                              confirmed that none of the palm oil or its derivatives should be sourced from the borneo region
                                 initially the company established a target date of 2011 for sourcing 100 percent certified
                              sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil however as a result of a lack of availability within the
                              marketplace in 2011 colgate revised the target date to 2015
                                 it is important to note that colgates need is for palm kernel oil a palm oil derivative rather
                              than crude palm oil although the production of sustainable crude palm oil increased somewhat
                              between 2009 and 2011 the production of palm kernel oil has not as of september 2011 it
                              was reported that there were only 04 million metric tons of certified sustainable palm kernel oil
                              in production representing just 7 percent of total production colgates recent effort to convert

                              onstrates how challenging it is to identify a consistent supply stream only one supplier globally
                              had the capacity to satisfy the request
                                 a challenge remains as to how to verify supplier compliance as colgate does not have
                              direct contact with the growers we must rely on the rspo who conducts audits and on the
                              legal documents provided by the three brokers from whom we purchase palm oil and palm oil
                              derivatives
                                 colgate continues to advocate for the availability of sustainable palm oil and its derivatives
                              and remains committed to working towards its target date of 2015 for sourcing 100 percent
                              certified sustainable palm oil and palm oil derivatives the company will report quantitative and
