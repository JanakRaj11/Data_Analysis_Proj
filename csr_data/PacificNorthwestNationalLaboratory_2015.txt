greatest challenge lies in reducing building energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions as fulfilling
our research mission drives us to expand into new laboratory and computing intensive facilities to
offset these impacts we are committed to building facilities that meet the guiding principles for
highperformance sustainable buildings and to using our facilities as a living laboratory to explore
issues that affect not only our campus but also are challenges throughout doe
we also leverage our science to create a more sustainable world by training the problemsolvers of the

stem education programs we support we have been fostering the next generation of scientists and
engineers as well as developing a stemliterate community for decades the local stem high school
spearheaded by battelle delta has graduated two classes secured funding for a new facility and
outperformed others on state assessments these efforts havent gone unnoticed as the washington
office of the superintendent of public instruction recognized battelle for its thought leadership in
