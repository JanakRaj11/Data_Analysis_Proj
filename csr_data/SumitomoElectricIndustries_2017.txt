             our history and business

      starting with copper wire production the electric wire and cable business of sumitomo electric has expanded in the respective segments
      including the manufacturing of power cables and communication cables and then magnet wires automotive wiring harnesses and electronic
      wires for information equipment in line with the development of society in the meantime we also began to diversify our business in early
      years based on the technology to produce electric wires and cables the production of cemented carbide tools and special steel wires
      launched in 1931 and 1932 respectively was a firm step into the areas outside the electric wire segment we have accelerated the
      diversification with the target of increasing the ratio of the nonelectric wire business to 50 since the 1960s and offered
      innovative products and technologies such as compound semiconductors optical fibers artificial diamonds and
      hightemperature superconductivity in sequence so as to support the changing times the sumitomo
      electric group has thus continued to develop unique technologies and persistently
      pursued new business opportunities and is now conducting global business
      operations in the following five major business segments

             we have established an integrated system to produce aluminum wires
             for wiring harnesses that help improve the fuel eﬃciency of automobiles
             aluminum wiring harnesses help reduce the weight of automobiles and also
             save fuel and rare resources i have been committed to the startup of a new
             plant of stec in thailand and establishment of a mass production system
             since 2014 for the purpose of facility reinforcement in response to the increase
             in the overseas production of aluminum wires for wiring harnesses
             when i was assigned to the country and started to work there was only a
             building and i had no other equipment or staff at first i therefore faced various
             challenges every day including the decision of machine specifications trial run
             and installation of equipment as well as quality assurance it was especially
             hard to meet the quality standards along with repeated conference calls with
             associated companies and repeated trial production selfaudits were
             conducted to pass strict quality audits and training was also given to local
             employees
             we then made the first delivery of standard aluminum wires in september
             2014 and also started to deliver highstrength aluminum wires that are as
             strong as copper wires in october 2016 in may 2017 we established the
             groups first integrated production system for aluminum wire materials which
             covers the casting rolling and subsequent processes stec has grown to be a
             hub plant in asia that supplies highquality products to 13 harness production

enhancing the capacity of cellular phone wireless networks
the gan transistor we have developed is an element with a function to
amplify radio wave signals and used mainly for transmission of radio wave
from cellular phone base stations as highspeed communication devices
became widespread it was required to downsize and sophisticate the base
stations as well as to construct more base stations this increased demand

for gan transistors because they are more efficient and require less electricity
for amplification than siliconbased devices using conventional technologies
in addition a base station using gan transistors can be downsized with no
need of fans to control temperature rise which degrades the performance of
the station and can also reduce the installation cost
devices are a key to communications and their quality is therefore crucial

             vehicles which have been becoming popular in recent years an important
             component of the batteries is a tab lead a conductive material in which an
             insulation layer is attached around a conductor it serves as a lead wire of the
             batteries and also has contact with electrolyte inside the batteries to take out
             electricity to external electrodes etc
             our product tablead  has higher insulation capacity and durability by
             attaching an insulation layer made of a material the heat deformation of which
             is suppressed based on our patented technology to a conductor plate treated
             to enhance the corrosion resistance using a sophisticated welding technique in
             addition the material of the insulation layer has the capacity to seal the
             electrolyte so that the liion battery has higher performance and longer life the
             product has also been designed to minimize environmental impact through
             measures such as nonchromium surface treatment of the conductor

key technologies to the constant speed running of railroad vehicles
an air spring is a suspension based on the elasticity of compressed air this is
currently a mainstream technology for railroad vehicles because it has large
functional advantages including the adjustment of vehicle height and vibration
damping the sumitomo electric group is one of the manufacturers that
started to develop the product in the 1950s it was adopted for 0 series

shinkansen trains in 1964
the latest shinkansen uses a tilting system with air springs so that they can run
without slowing down even over curved sections to facilitate constant speed
running and help maintain the promptness of transportation and reduce
energy use and co 2 emissions this is considered to be a technology that
accelerates modal shift from air transportation
while modal shift is attracting attention on a global scale we make effective
use of the relevant technologies we have accumulated over more than 60

   air springs which are mounted between the car body and bogie are
   important parts for signiﬁcantly reducing the vibration transmitted from the
   wheels to the car body and improving ride comfort of trains
   air springs can help speed up a train and provide a comfortable ride by
   absorbing the vibrations of the running train
   our air springs are widely used around the world in subways commuter

             sumitomo electric sintered alloy ltd is in charge of the manufacturing and
             marketing of sintered parts most of the sintered parts produced by our company
             are currently used in automobiles and each car contains approximately 10 kg of
             sintered parts they started to be used in wider fields when a variable valve
             timing mechanism vvt was employed in cars we are also working to apply
             them to magnetic components of boosting converters and other items in
             anticipation of the coming age of electric vehicles
             sintered parts are produced by compacting metal powder by a press and
             sintering it they contribute to resource saving because no chips are generated
             from molding or processing and to energy saving because sintering requires a
             lower temperature than molding once a mold is created it is also easy to
             manufacture the part in large quantities we discuss what shape is easy to
             produce with customers at the development stage and achieve high quality
             along with energy saving short production time and cost reduction at the same
             time in the production of sintered parts for vvt in 2015 as a result of the
             automation of the dedicated production line and improvement of the cutting
             tools we successfully developed new machining processes including the
             perforating and grooving of green compact compressed by a press before
             sintering which replace machining processes after sintering in recognition of this
             initiative we won the new product award in the process development section
             of the 38th japan powder metallurgy association award for fiscal 2016 in the

    i think that mr john is making a great contribution to safety activities in our company as a
    safety officer who is dedicated to safety activities thanks to his enthusiasm the
    management and the employees are able to communicate closely one example of this

    close communication is the smallscale safety meetings called msts which have been
    organized by mr john to promote bottomup activities by limiting participants to a leader
    of a working group and its group members in this meeting all the members are able to
    give comments related to safety freely while they seldom do the same in formal meetings
    many of the manufacturing facilities in wini are old as they were originally relocated from
    japan and other production sites and some of them are not in conformity with global
    standards although upgrading of them involves enormous costs including opportunity loss

    due to the shutdown of the facilities as well as facility remodeling cost we are upgrading
    them step by step to eliminate unsafe facilities under the slogan of safety first and with
    the understanding of the management i would like to be continuously dedicated to

             our efforts to strengthen the system for
             stable procurement are producing steady results

             the sumitomo electric group is committed to the development
             and implementation of a business continuity plan bcp for
             procurement divisions which prepares for largescale disasters
             and other emergency situations to ensure stable supply of
             products and services and thereby avoid impact on the
             production activities of our customers the bcp assumes a
             situation that the suppliers of our parts and materials have
             suﬀered damage from disaster and suspended production
             activities to minimize the impact of such suspension on our
             production and enable quick recovery we have examined
             alternative suppliers and products in addition to replacement
             with commodity items we are also developing a
             communication network with suppliers to ensure that we can

    i am using the teleworking system
    rieko miki      assistant manager solution support groupir office accounting division


    i returned to work immediately after my daughter reached the age of one after returning to work i
    had no choice but to shorten the working hours due to the long commute time i also have
    experience that i interrupted my work in haste with a call from the daycare center telling that my
                                                                                                                                                                                   preservation
                                                                                                                                                                                   environmental




    daughter got sick then i learned the introduction of a teleworking system and consulted my
    superior if i could use the system with his approval as well as an understanding of work
    colleagues i started to use the system once a week or so the reduction of the commute time
    enabled me to work on a fulltime basis and i have also expanded the scope of work than that
    when i was using the shorttime work system the teleworking system can now be used in more
    various ways and is easier to use which is convenient for me above all i am grateful that my
                                                                                                                                                                                       social contribution




    superiors and colleagues express understanding for the use of the system it would be difficult in
    many ways to balance child rearing and work without the understanding of the company while it is needless to say that cooperation
    of family members is also essential i feel that the work environment in sumitomo electric which has welldeveloped systems for
    employees who are raising children and caring for family members is very pleasant while there are various troubles as my daughter
    is still small i would like to do my best while thanking the company for the support

   was established in 2002 through consolidation of the magnet wire division of sumitomo electric with daiichi denko corporation while the wintec
   group has six production sites in total composed of two in japan namely shigaraki in shiga and taguchi in niigata and four overseas sites in thailand
   malaysia china and indonesia we have never achieved the target of zero accidents in the group as a whole in fiscal 2014 five accidents involving injury
   occurred in the group three in japan and two in other countries and shigaraki works which is the mother factory was designated by the safety 
   environment department of sumitomo electric as an operation site subject to priority management to enhance and promote safety activities
   the concept of the safety activities is bottomup activities with a topdown approach in these activities the top management clearly indicates the
   policy collects information on problems identified in a bottomup manner such as troublesome and difficult operations which will be addressed by
   promoting safety activities under the initiative of it and helps solve the problems the solution of the problems then leads to the identification of other                                                      human resources
   problems which makes the activities endless with an upward spiral while there is a topbottom relationship at each level this article focuses on
   bottomup activities and assistance of them and introduces 1 activities between shigaraki works the mother factory and overseas bases and
   2 examples of activities in shigaraki works

   ① support for overseas bases by shigaraki works as the first step we started to hold monthly conference calls mainly with japanese expatriates and
   annual gatherings with both local staff and japanese expatriates in the first conference call the overseas bases made requests for actions to address
   their problems including the provision of more specific directions on horizontal development for information sharing and investigation training of local
   staff in charge of safety and safety managers and supervisors and promotion of hardwarerelated measures and the shigaraki works enhanced its
   support activities equipment design staff also join the conference calls and discuss any unclear points and whether any support is needed or not
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 preservation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 environmental




   thus the conference calls serve as a means not only to give unilateral directions but also to accomplish the directions that have been given the
   annual gatherings are used for information sharing and personal exchange as well as for training of local staff in addition some of the bases are
   designated as special operation sites for safety management by the division to enhance support activities including the dispatch of staff to the sites
   and the information is shared with other sites to improve the level as a whole

   ② bottomup activities at shigaraki works troublesome and difficult operations are identified and discussed in each workplace and the results are
   reported at the time of a workplace inspection in which the president and equipment design and maintenance staff participate to discuss and
   promote solutions including budgeting of hardware on the spot any problems are reported to the top management to solve them which facilitates
   other reports of problems and thereby maintains the activities accordingly the commitment of the top management to achieving and continuing zero
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     social contribution




   accidents is significant we have also set up workplace exchange meetings to share hiyari or nearmiss reports and information on their improvement
   at other workplaces in order to stimulate the activities the bottomup activities will be also introduced into other group sites and shigaraki works
   will continuously assist them in stimulating and establishing the activities as the mother factory
   we unfortunately failed to achieve zero accidents in fiscal 2016 when a no lost work time injury occurred at shigaraki works which should serve as a
   model for safety on march 14 2017 and the groups record of having no accident ended at 517 consecutive days learning a lesson from the
   accident that even an operation that is not considered dangerous troublesome or difficult operations can cause an injury we will all enhance the
   awareness of never injuring or getting injured and improve sensitivity to risks to further deepen the bottomup activities with a topdown approach
   we will continue to strengthen the safety activities to achieve and maintain zero accidents in the wintec group for each fiscal year

                when the comprehensiveness of the boundaries is assessed based on greenhouse gas ghg emissions a representative environmental
                indicator the emissions from the boundaries of the environmental management of our group 1497 thousand tons account for the vast
                majority of 1819 thousand tons which are estimated ghg emissions from the boundaries of consolidation for financial reporting in fiscal 2016
                in the meantime out of the 247 consolidated subsidiaries excluding the 3 listed companies mentioned above  the environmental management
                of our group covers 147 companies in production units 45 in japan 33 in china 34 in asia except china 14 in the americas and 21 in
                europe and other in fiscal 2016 our trial calculation indicates that environmental impact such as ghg emissions of the 147 companies is

  we received energy saving training at the electronics plant of electronics group through
  the training we found that the utility rules were not strictly followed and visualization of
  the equipment was insufficient in the plant and considered that it was necessary to take actions urgently in the
  conventional energy saving diagnosis our activities were accomplished when we improved the items indicated in the
  diagnosis however this training developed our abilities to find such items by ourselves using energy saving handbook and

  are told to do so we will widely share the recognition we learned from the training that improvements should be found
  and made voluntarily with the involvement of all staff to make even more improvements

my ﬁndings on the csr activities and information disclosure by the sumitomo electric group are as follows

 evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of                                                 this ﬁscal year

  the board of directors                                                             increase in the employment rate of
the board of directors of sumitomo electric started to evaluate                        the physically or mentally disabled
its eﬀectiveness in 2016 and a summary of the results is                            the ministry of health labour and welfare plans to raise the
presented in the report of this ﬁscal year it mentions a notable                   legally required employment rate of persons with disabilities
point which is the recognition of the board that what structure                   from the current rate of 20 to 23 by the end of ﬁscal 2020
the board should have from the perspectives of diversity etc                     and the rate will rise to 22 in april 2018 in the meantime
should be examined as a future challenge to further enhance the                     sumitomo electric has been committed to the employment of
eﬀectiveness of the board of directors while many diversity                        persons with disabilities which is shown in the increases in the
measures of japanese companies are intended for employees                          employment rate over time and the rate has already exceeded
diversity in a company generally means diversity in its                             22 as of 2017 this is also highly commendable as a result of
management organization including the board of directors in a                       the business attitude to promote the employment of persons
global sense quite a few studies in the us and europe also                         with disabilities not just to meet the legally required percentage
claim that companies with more female directors have
signiﬁcantly higher proﬁt margins the fact that the board of
directors of sumitomo electric has recognized the necessity to
                                                                                                   a s p e c t s n e e d i n g i mp ro v e me n t

functions is actually working well for enhancing the governance                      improvement of environmental performance
and that the companys governance system is healthy

 growth strategy with the use of                                                   targets in the action eco21 campaign which are the reduction
