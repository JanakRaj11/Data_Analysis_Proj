     we will press forward toward the goal
     of further increasing corporate value
     i am shigeru murayama the new representative director and president of kawasaki heavy industries ltd i was appointed
     at a meeting of the board of directors following approval by our shareholders at the 190th ordinary general meeting of
     shareholders held on june 26 2013
        before proceeding as the newly appointed president i wish to address our stakeholders with an explanation on
     recent events
        as you will no doubt have already heard in the media an extraordinary meeting of the board of directors held on june
     13 2013 voted to relieve three directors of their positions as president senior executive vice president and senior vice
     president respectively
        further the same meeting of the board of directors resolved officially to terminate negotiations on management
     integration with mitsui engineering  shipbuilding co ltd and resolved to introduce a new management team with me
     as president
        this situation came about after the three directors in question attempted to implement executive measures in opposition
     to the views of the majority of directors and acted generally without due regard for the board of directors for this and
     related reasons the board of directors was forced to conclude that from the perspective of corporate governance and
     compliance the directors in question were not qualified to bear the core responsibility for the management of khi
        i wish to express my greatest gratitude to stakeholders for your patience and understanding toward this recent series of
     decisions made by our corporate organs which may have caused certain distress and concern at the same time i hope that
     we can rely on your continued support as we focus ongoing efforts on the management of group operations going forward

         on march 20 2013 khi took part in science yard 2013 a
         science and technology encounter event for elementary
         schoolchildren in the kansai region sponsored by leave a nest
         co ltd this marked the second year of khis participation
               each year khi prepares for the event by developing
         an educational program using our products as materials
         in fiscal 2013 we developed a program based on the                  children making their own cranes
         workings of hydraulic products and organized a
         handicraft workshop                                                       what the children said
               as part of our program which was designed to allow              i managed to make a good model quickly when we set the
         children to experience the wonder of science and                         big syringe against the little one i never thought that the
                                                                                  little one would win
         technology and the fun of making things children used
                                                                                the workshop helped me understand how cranes lift heavy
         two syringes of differing size to discover pascals                      weights
         principle assembled a model of a crane and practiced                 i want to find out what other situations pascals principle is
                                                                                  used in
         lifting heavy objects with small amounts of force we
                                                                                i was really surprised that we were able to make a crane
         hope that encounters with technology of this kind will                   with syringes it was very hard to do but i was really happy
         inspire many children to decide i want to be an engineer                when i managed it i really enjoyed myself
                                                                                when i get home i want to make another one

       all divisions must adapt to achieve                                          recognizing the difference in thinking
       the groups mission                                                          between japan and overseas

     the khi groups mission is all about csr to achieve it                      csr as we think of it in japan sometimes differs from
     would be the most wonderful thing imaginable the                            the idea of csr that people have overseas it is not a
     issue going forward is how individual divisions should                       question of asking who is right and who is wrong but
     adapt to the mission statement one problem is that                          we need to recognize that there are differences in
     the mission statement speaks of enriching lifestyles                      europe at the root of csr is the idea that firms should
     which might be difficult to understand enrichment                           change the way they do business to resolve social
     includes both material and financial aspects but i dont                    issues for instance to take the example of human
     think thats the whole story                                                rights the idea is not to engage in businesses that help
        if we view the earth as a kind of system we need to                      to advance human rights but to change the business
     look ahead constantly to see what courses are open to                        process to eliminate practices that infringe on
     us by taking the worldwide lead i think we can                             human rights
     achieve integrated csr to do this an essential                               in japan contributing through business activities is
     precondition is to devise criteria on the amount of                          recognized as csr in global operations we must win
     risk we can take and the purposes of taking such risk                       the sympathies of people from a rich diversity of
     and this needs to be set out clearly in terms of                             backgrounds and csr is a valuable tool in this regard
     corporate policy                                                            i would like khi to think about what it can do to help

     segments counterbalancing decreases in segments
     such as precision machinery overall net sales        ship  offshore structure
     were roughly on a par with those of the previous       thanks to orders received for one submarine
     fiscal year due to increases in the aerospace and      and five other vessels including lng carriers the
     other segments despite a decline in the precision     consolidated value of orders received a major
     machinery segment caused by the economic               boost rising 658 billion from the previous fiscal
     slowdown in china and a drop in the ship              year to 1057 billion
     offshore structure segments overall operating        an increase in the construction of lng and lpg
     income decreased reflecting lower profitability in    carriers and others was balanced by a decrease

     despite the drop in net sales operating income          grew 123 billion year on year to 2070 billion
     supported notably by cost reductions and the              operating income dropped 07 billion to 70

     increased sales to the japan railways companies          net sales were supported by the continuing high
     but a shrinkage in overseas net sales contributed         level of lng storage tank projects as well as by
     to an overall lack of movement in net sales which        increases in material handling systems municipal

     component parts for the boeing 777 and 787               motorcycle  engine
     however the consolidated value of orders declined        motorcycle sales to europe decreased but higher

     billion year on year to 148 billion due to stronger   a steep 648 billion yearonyear decline mainly
     net sales cost reductions and other factors            due to reduced demand for hydraulic equipment

      i methods used to calculate the fair value of financial instruments and details of securities and derivative
          instruments

        assets
        cash on hand and in banks
          the fair value of cash on hand and in banks is stated at the relevant book value since the settlement
          periods are short and the fair values are substantially the same as the book values
        receivables
          the fair value of receivables is stated at present value computed by applying a discount rate reflecting the
          settlement period and the credit risk
        investments in securities
          equity securities are stated at the fair value and bonds are stated at market price or the asking price of
          financial institutions see note 2k investments in securities for the detailed information by
          classification

        liabilities
        trade payables shortterm debt and current portion of longterm debt
          since the settlement periods of these items are short and their fair values are substantially the same as
          their book values the relevant book values are used
        longterm debt less current portion
          the fair value of bonds payable is calculated based on trading reference data the fair value of longterm
          debt is calculated by applying a discount rate to the total of principal and interest that discount rate is
          based on the interest rates of similar new loans
