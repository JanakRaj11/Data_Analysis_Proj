                          all of the countries in which we operate and along
                                        our entire supply chain

                        dear readers
                        for our fifth sustainability report we have focused on the theme of responsible behaviour as we
                        advance along the path towards sustainable growth we are guided by this principle in all divisions of
                        the company in all of the countries in which we operate and along our entire supply chain

                        progress and challenges in achieving csr goals
                        in the fiscal year 201617 we worked intensively to realise our csr goals and enjoyed much success
                        across the group we have made considerable progress in lowering the costs associated with
                        pharmaceutical waste achieving a further 5 per cent to 82 per cent decrease in the reporting period
                        when compared with the reference year 201415 as a result we are conserving natural resources and
                        significantly reducing the financial burden on our company this means that we are well on our way to
                        achieving our companywide goal of cutting the cost of pharmaceutical waste by 10 per cent by
                        201819 our second core objective relating to our employees is to reduce the illness rate by 1 per cent
                        as a result of our occupational health management system we have recorded an improvement of 035
                        percentage points in comparison with the reference year however even more comprehensive efforts
                        are needed if we are to achieve our goal

                        last year our csr activities also focused on data protection and compliance in the field of data protec
                        tion an online training tool has been introduced in germany and used to gradually train our employees
                        since the start of 2017 in order to fulfil the requirements of the european general data protection
                        regulation which comes into effect in may 2018 we are planning corresponding online training across
                        the group for the fiscal year 201819 due to focussing on providing training in the compliance guide
                        lines we achieved the objective of training 100 per cent of employees within the focus group

                                                                                              letter from the executive board   5




introduction of a supplier code and guidance document for donations and sponsorships
for the first time we have established a supplier code for the purchase of indirect and trading goods
this will allow us to improve the integration of sustainability criteria in our strategic procurement pro
cesses and thus take on more responsibility along our supply chain in cooperation with our partners
the new donation and sponsorship guidance document will help us to act even more responsibly
across national boundaries as we play an active role in society after all we aim to use our skills and
resources to make a positive contribution to the common good beyond the scope of our core business




       the independence as a family business
          allows the phoenix group to pursue
    longterm strategies in order to grow profitably


sustainability integrated in all corporate processes
as a family business we make decisions independently and pursue a longterm strategy in order to
grow profitably through organic increases in revenue and targeted acquisitions we make sure that
our sustainability management policy always translates into our corporate acquisitions most recently
this can be seen in the takeover of mediq apotheken nederland bv  one of the largest in the history
of our company it is therefore very important to us that we actively communicate our csr activities
in the current year we want to make our employees even more aware of  and passionate about 
sustainability issues this is the only way we can work together to achieve our csr goals and succeed
in growing sustainably as a company

sustainability integrated in all levels of the company
for the phoenix group corporate success and social responsibility go hand in hand we have set our         g4 16
selves the goal of integrating sustainabilityoriented principles in all quality management processes and
in our cooperation with customers business partners and employees we plan to gradually extend this
process to all of our companys subsidiaries this also applies to newly acquired businesses which we
include in all social and environmental sustainability objectives

it is the internationalisation of our markets and varying conditions in the countries in particular that
represent a significant challenge in this regard  a challenge we are meeting with a management struc
ture established across the group a csr programme and binding targets

since the markets we operate in are partly very diverse we continue to deal with most issues at a local
level in accordance with our slogan think together global  act local it is all the more important that
we continue to intensify the cooperation between our subsidiaries exchange best practices and learn
from our colleagues at other sites at the same time we are pushing ahead with groupwide initiatives
which are successful examples of the centralised coordination of sustainability issues such as the
employee survey phoenix pharmacy partnership and the europewide talent management programme

in view of our further development in the field of sustainability we are also benefitting from external
expertise in our industry and are involved in working groups related to the european association girp        see glossary page 68
and in national associations on the spot

four areas of responsibility linked to management approaches
our corporate mission statement forms the basis of our csr strategy our work is carried out to the
highest possible quality standards going beyond merely satisfying applicable laws and directives and
is guided by keen cost awareness

in terms of value creation our established management systems have encompassed comprehensive
quality management for a long time this includes a regular assessment of customer satisfaction

our markets are subject to constant change it is therefore all the more important that our company
remains highly stable and flexible at the same time the phoenix group is enhancing its approach
to economic responsibility by continuously expanding its portfolio and accelerating the process of
groupwide cooperation in doing so the company is working against the current driving forces in our
business further cutbacks resulting from the changing political environment in many healthcare systems
as well as the increasing pressure on margins in wholesale and retail

the essential issues for our own value creation are in particular adherence to quality standards com
prehensive availability of drugs secure processing of customer data and combatting counterfeit
pharmaceuticals we take these points into account in a number of ways through our strict quality

                                 in germany when weighted according to revenue we are ranked third in badenwuerttemberg and
                                 sixth in germany

                                 a strategy focussed on growth and cost efficiency

                                 the pillars on which the phoenix groups growth strategy is built our ultimate goal is to create value
                                 for our company and our stakeholders on a sustainable basis market leadership and efficiency are
                                 therefore top priorities we want to grow organically as well as through acquisitions and aim to consis

                                 and productivity

                                 addition to groupwide initiatives we are most notably benefitting from process optimisation measures
                                 carried out successfully on a local basis which then serve as a starting point for improvement measures
                                 in other countries the local expertise within the phoenix group allows us to take better account of the
                                 national and regional differences that exist in the european pharmaceutical markets

                                 in the fiscal year 201617 the phoenix group was able to further expand its market position as a
                                 leading pharmaceutical trader in europe and successfully develop its business although conditions
                                 remained challenging we succeeded in growing significantly more strongly than the market as a whole
                                 revenue in the reporting year increased by 51 per cent to 244 billion and total operating performance

                                 from 4954 million to 4178 million this is mainly owing to the great pressure on wholesale margins
                                 in germany and in the united kingdom and to negative foreign exchange rate effects

        see glossary page 69   on the other hand we have registered positive results from our warehouse excellence and indirect

apotheken nederland bv by the brocacef groep nv in the netherlands alongside pharmacies and the
pharmaceutical wholesale business this takeover also includes prewholesale activities  an important                         see glossary page 69
step on our path to becoming an integrated healthcare provider the result of this acquisition is the
formation of a leading player in the dutch healthcare market furthermore we are bringing together the
best practices of mediq and brocacef and are applying them to the entire supply chain

in october 2016 we also took over the pharmaceutical wholesaler farmegra doo and the national
pharmacy chain apoteka lijek pzu in montenegro our market position was thereby significantly
expanded in addition the hungarian company novodata zrt a provider of goods management and till
systems to pharmacies has been part of the phoenix group since may 2016 and helps to strengthen
our expertise and market position

investments in logistics

                                   in the interest of reducing pharmaceutical waste caused by missed expiry dates we are in constant

                                   considerable progress made in reducing costs
                                   we have set ourselves the target of reducing the cost of pharmaceutical waste by 10 per cent by
                                   201819 in comparison with the 201415 figures in the reporting year the costs incurred amounted to
                                   3183 million compared with 3350 million in the previous year and 3468 million in the reference
                                   year this already equates to a cost reduction of around 82 per cent within two years as a proportion
                                   of revenue costs fell during this period from 015 per cent to 013 per cent in the reporting year in order
                                   to maintain this positive trend the country managers decided at their annual meeting in 2016 to cut
                                   costs by 30 per cent over the next three years

in contrast to the reduction in costs our records show an increase in the amount of pharmaceutical
waste in the reporting period we registered 1432 tonnes of waste within the phoenix group  a rise
of almost 19 per cent compared with the previous year this is attributable to the increase in revenue as
well as the integration of the dutch company mediq in the phoenix group consequently the volume
of transported goods has increased furthermore patients in most countries return damaged and
expired products to pharmacies these products are then disposed of by wholesalers which means
that the amount of pharmaceutical waste cannot be fully controlled by our company

high rate of recycling for nonhazardous waste
besides hazardous waste our company processes also generate other waste materials that are con
sidered nonhazardous these include plastics paper and cardboard waste from power generation
and mixed waste which is properly disposed of by specialist partner companies overall more than
23100 tonnes of nonhazardous waste were produced in the reporting period the majority of such waste
is recycled in all of the subsidiaries of the phoenix group as far as possible we allow biodegradable
waste to decompose naturally

in western european countries heating gas and electricity are predominantly used instead of district heating

1	explanation of the deviating reported values in previous years the czech republic used a different reporting unit in

  previous years reports gj instead of mwh




the phoenix group is constantly reviewing the benefits of renewable energy sources with the aim of
improving climate protection some of our subsidiaries are already using photovoltaic equipment to
generate electricity eg in the czech republic or biomassfuelled heating systems eg in macedonia
our scandinavian business units have been obtaining their electricity exclusively from green sources
since 2010

we are also offering our employees new ways in which to make their very own contributions to climate
protection for example employees in germany have been able to lease bicycles in collaboration with
the company jobrad since september 2016 thus avoiding emissions from transport promotional
days were organised in the distribution centres which subsequently led to around 120 employees
accepting the offer the bikes can also be used for leisure and purchased after the end of the lease
term at a price specified in the contract

detailed vehicle database
transmed maintains a complete overview of its vehicles including their features and consumption data
the company has been evaluating the annual mileage per branch since 2012 as well as information
about the categories and types of vehicles the engine and fuel types and co2 emissions per kilometre

recently the organisation has been receiving occasional requests from customers to provide informa
tion about co2 emissions per package transmed will respond to these changing requirements and in
the reporting period has already been working on ways of calculating the emissions data according to
the mix of the fleet and routes as a function of the vehicle utilisation first results from the project are
expected at the end of 2017

raising awareness about ecoefficient driving style
transmed regularly informs its employees about fuelefficient driving some of the most effective meas
ures include switching off the engine when making a delivery carrying out regular checks on tyre
pressures and on the ignition system using fuelefficient engine oils and lowresistance tyres ensuring
optimal loading and using air conditioning and heated seats sparingly

pilot projects for alternative fuels and drives
tamro the swedish subsidiary of the phoenix group has been involved in trialling ecofriendly fuels in
conjunction with its logistics partners this collaboration has focussed on the use of hvo100 a type of
biodiesel that is extracted from waste materials such as used grease or cooking oils as well as vegetable
oils from oilbearing crops hvo100 is thus obtained from renewable energy sources furthermore the           see glossary page 69
exhaust fumes do not contain sulphur or aromatics and no ash is produced in the combustion process
after the launch of the joint initiative 18 per cent of all trips to pharmacies on behalf of the company in
2016 were made with vehicles using hvo100 fuel

the transmed branch in hanover germany participated in a pilot project to test whether or not electri
cally powered vehicles are able to cope with the practical requirements of pharmaceutical wholesale
even though it appears that this is not yet the case due to intensive charging cycles emobility is a
subject that the company will return to in the future and one which will be regularly investigated

education and further training secure future expertise
we want to attract committed young people to embark upon a career in our company in order to meet
our need for skilled workers in the future recruitment fairs career and student information days as
well as training fairs are used to raise awareness of our company as a modern employer and to enter
into a dialogue with school and university graduates as well as with experienced candidates in many
cases we conduct actual interviews on the spot

in germany we offer a wide range of apprenticeships and dual study programmes these include busi
ness administration apprenticeships in wholesale and retail training as warehouse logistics specialists
or bachelors degrees in business management or business information systems in the 2016 training           three quarters of our
year the phoenix group employed 130 apprentices and 17 students of dual study courses in our home           apprentices were

market germany at 76 per cent the overwhelming majority of the apprentices were employed in per           permanently employed

manent positions after they completed their training

the phoenix group encourages groupwide crossborder communication right from the start of their
professional careers with us and offers students of dual courses the opportunity to spend time abroad
for example in croatia hungary italy and the netherlands

professional qualifications in all areas
we have established an efficient system for further training across the company which allows employ
ees to enhance their professional skills and can give their personal development a significant boost

at the start of their employment new employees take part in induction seminars that are tailored to         g4 la9
their individual needs and the requirements of the respective phoenix group countries in this context
our new employees completed around 10250 hours of training in the reporting year as a result of the
stringent requirements for good distribution practice gdp the emphasis of these training measures
was on handling drugs in the fiscal year 201617 we spent 3120 hours of further training on this topic

all employees complete induction programmes and training courses that suit their particular area of
responsibility training courses on gdp the code of conduct the anticorruption policy and the compe
tition compliance policy are all part of the mandatory programme occupational health and safety 
with a particular focus on conversations about returning to or absence from work corporate integration
management addiction prevention and addiction support as well as stress management  is also
given high priority as are personnel management legal considerations quality data protection it and
languages our employees also have the possibility of using elearning systems to gain professional
qualifications in the workplace

at the same time the phoenix group is intensifying the crosseuropean exchange of best practices for
the implementation of training concepts so that we may learn from our colleagues in other countries
the pharmacy retail business was one of the most recent areas of focus in the reporting year our
subsidiaries are making this a special priority for example our subsidiary in the united kingdom is
concentrating on developing the expertise of young professionals in its pharmacies within the scope of
the rowlands pharmacy foundation programme employees who have recently completed their training
as pharmacists are supported to gain management skills through training courses and mentoring
programmes in the reporting period 26 members of staff also benefited from vocational training
opportunities that were offered in various divisions of the company

                the phoenix group first announced its interest in acquiring mediq in
                december 2014 and the dutch competition authorities acm gave
                the green light about 18 months later the largest single acquisition in
                the history of the phoenix group became official in june 2016we have
                thereby taken a further decisive step towards achieving our vision of

efficient followup to the employee survey
with the aim of finding out more about our employees level of satisfaction and their needs and in order
to derive specific improvement measures we conducted a groupwide employee survey at the end of
2015 it boasted a response rate of 64 per cent and indicated a strong commitment to the company
a positive assessment of leadership performance as well as valuable opportunities for solidifying the
phoenix group as an attractive employer in 2016 the results were communicated simultaneously to
all employees in an open and consistent manner

managers defined action points for their respective areas of responsibility and developed measures in
conjunction with their employees the focus lies on the issues our employees were less satisfied
with but which have a considerable impact on motivation and commitment these include aspects of
leadership communication change management the feedback culture and further training at all levels

in the numerous workshops held in all divisions of the company more than 140 improvement measures
were defined threequarters of which had already been implemented by the end of april 2017
the majority of these measures related to issues of communication and information sharing which
were made significantly more efficient with tools such as newsletters or the intranet that was enhanced
as a digital platform the creation of information points in the distribution centres has also played an
important role they can be used by employees who do not have a pc or access to the internet to view
company information other projects concentrated on the improved definition of responsibilities within
work processes an enhanced feedback culture and on establishing a healthy motivating and respect
ful working environment

the continued consistent implementation of measures a standardised process and the achievement
of objectives will be closely monitored by subsidiary management and the executive board of the
phoenix group the company is planning to conduct another international employee survey in 2018
