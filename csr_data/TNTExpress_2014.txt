i letter to stakeholders

dear stakeholders

it is my pleasure as new ceo of tnt express to present the 2013 results back in january 2013 the
termination of the intended merger with ups reset tnt express to pursue its standalone strategy
against a challenging economic background we launched deliver our companywide improvement
programme the programme had four priorities reshape our portfolio focus on distinctive service
propositions execute better and invest in infrastructure and it

deliver has already produced results we succeeded in achieving considerable indirect cost savings
and improvements in our local operations we updated our before 1200 pm premium delivery coverage
in more than 900 european locations and announced the expansion of our intercontinental express
freight capabilities in 10 additional countries outside of europe we also sold the hoau domestic
business in china deliver is gaining momentum and will contribute to our performance

while 2013 saw a slight improvement of our road safety and environmental performance we refined our
corporate responsibility strategy and adopted plans and targets to achieve further improvement in these
areas

trading conditions in the express delivery market remained demanding and tnt express business
performance was under pressure within the europe main and pacific segments the challenging
economic climate adversely impacted our results however our business strengthened in europe other
 americas and amea and the brazil domestic turnaround gained pace overall adjusted operating
income decreased from 264 million to 230 million which is not satisfactory

against this backdrop we have reassessed the companys strengths and weaknesses and identified the
main business opportunities and challenges from this we have drawn a number of important
conclusions

first tnt express needs to have an absolute focus on the business areas in europe in which it has a
distinctive position and can generate profitable growth this means accelerating investments in our
european road network which is already unique it also means focusing on our already large sme
customer segment and developing our position in those industries that best match our operations
industrial automotive hightech and healthcare

second our service performance and productivity need to improve while our service to customers is
certainly competitive our processes are not sufficiently optimised endtoend we aim to realise the
perfect transaction to benefit even better service levels and lower costs productivity can also be
improved in a large part through better use of technology

third our current organisational structure is not aligned to the distinct requirements of our domestic and
international businesses we will therefore organise to win by introducing a new organisation structure
that separates the main domestic activities from the integrated international express activities in europe
and asia middle east  africa

initiatives to address these challenges have been launched under the banner of a multiyear strategy
outlook which will integrate deliver outlook will be further developed in the coming period we are
confident outlook will fully support the realisation of financial and other stakeholder objectives

we are committed to securing an even more solid position for our company i would like to thank our
customers for their ongoing confidence in our services and all tnt express employees for their support
in achieving this ambition and their continued hard work

kind regards

in 2013 tnt express experienced a 47 decrease in the groups reported revenues and a 110
million decline in reported operating income the decrease in reported revenue is significantly
influenced by negative foreign exchange movements of 197 million 28 the negative impact of
foreign exchange on the reported operating income was 18 million in addition reported operating
income absorbed net oneoff losses of 164 million 2012 106

after adjustment of oneoffs and foreign exchange differences adjusted revenue declined by 19
while adjusted operating income declined by 34 million compared to 2012

in europe main the demanding trading environment already experienced in 2012 continued to affect
tnt express results with particular pressure in italy despite positive volume growth adjusted revenue
declined as a result of price pressure and lower weight per consignment

europe other  americas benefited from a better trading environment than europe main and
consequently adjusted revenues increased growth in the customer segments targeted by the company
was healthy and yield management was successful this combined with strong cost control led to
improved adjusted operating income

consignment dropped significantly negatively affecting revenues and profitability results were also
affected by high wage and other cost inflation

in asia middle east and africa adjusted revenues declined as a result of weaker export volumes from
china to europe and lower export volumes to europe from large accounts revenues were also lower
because of actions taken to rationalise the customer and business portfolio and the sale of china
domestic as of 1 november 2013 cost management however supported profitability and operating
results in nearly all units were ahead of 2012

in brazil domestic the turnaround continued apace with a considerable reduction in losses

continued focus on working capital and relatively low levels of investments coupled with oneoff
benefits the ups termination fee proceeds from the sale of china domestic and logisprings
divestments of shares in apriso and datatrac ensured a positive cash flow before financing and
dividends at the end of 2013 net cash improved to 472 million 2012 139 with available cash and
cash equivalents of 700 million and an undrawn committed facility of 570 million tnt express
financial position is sound as reflected in its credit ratings of bbb stable by sp and baa2
negative by moodys

tnt express proposes to compensate the loss out of the distributable part of the shareholders equity
and to pay a pro forma final dividend relating to the full year 2013 adjusted results of 0024 per share
out of the distributable part of the shareholders equity to be received in stock or cash the 0022 per
share interim dividend together with the proposed final dividend 0046 per share in total represents
a 2013 payout of 40 of normalised net income

ups offer

on 19 march 2012 united parcel service inc ups and tnt express reached an agreement on a
recommended allcash offer by ups of 950 per ordinary share for tnt express in the process of
obtaining approval from the european commission the intended merger was prohibited by the
european commission on 30 january 2013 due to competition concerns following the termination
ups paid a 200 million termination fee to tnt express

deliver

on 25 march 2013 tnt express launched the deliver improvement programme

deliver was built around four priorities
 reshape tnt express portfolio
 focus on tnt express distinctive service proposition
 execute better
 invest in infrastructure and it

collectively the latest deliver forecast is for 240 million annual improvements by 2015 the
programme is supported by capital expenditure of 175 million and restructuring costs of 200 million
implementation of the programme will require transition oneoffs of around 50 million

during 2013 the first important milestones for overhead and operational improvement projects were
achieved resulting in 35 million of savings by yearend deliver led to roughly 1500 redundancies in
2013 which is regretful but unavoidable in total over 4000 positions are expected to be affected by
2015

china domestic
in line with the priorities of the deliver improvement programme on 28 march 2013 tnt express
announced the sale of its domestic road operations in china hoau to private equity funds under the
management of citic pe consequently on 1 november 2013 tnt express announced the completion
of the sale subject to finalisation of the completion accounts the transaction result will be around nil
and the proceeds around 80 million in 2013 61 million was received

brazil domestic
on 30 january 2014 tnt express announced that it had terminated discussions with potential bidders
for the disposal of brazil domestic as it was unable to realise a transaction on acceptable terms as of
2014 brazil domestic will no longer be reported as a discontinued operation the activities will be
managed as a separate business unit within tnt express

result of price pressure and significantly lower weight per consignment adjusted revenues in pacific

cost of materials
cost of materials decreased by 21 million mainly due to lower fuel expenses changes in the business
portfolio china and india domestic and a positive impact from foreign exchange differences

work contracted out and other external expenses
work contracted out and other external expenses include fees paid for subcontractors external
temporary staff rent and leases these costs decreased by 122 million 33 compared to 2012
favourable foreign exchange differences of 94 million and changes in the business portfolio
contributed to the decline more significantly cost saving initiatives compensated for inflation and the
cost of handling increased volumes

salaries and social security contributions
salaries and social security contributions decreased by 4 million to 2174 million 02 in 2013
compared to 2012 the increase in salary costs from annual salary inflation pension and restructuring

exchange differences and changes in the business portfolio average ftes decreased from 61358 in
2012 to 58225 in 2013

in 2013 salary costs included 90 million in restructuring costs related to the deliver improvement

million 23 to 6420 million 2012 6572

total depreciation amortisation and impairment costs
total depreciation amortisation and impairment costs increased by 152 million 541 due to 163

to property plant and equipment

in 2012 impairments were taken on assets held for disposal in china domestic 75 million and a

net financial expense results mainly from longterm borrowings primarily financial leases and net
interest expenses on foreign currency hedges the expenses are only partially offset by interest income
on cash positions while centralised cash on deposits are significant they only generated a marginal
interest due to the current low interest rates in the market

net financial expense decreased by 6 million mainly due to a 1 million decline in fair value hedges
and net foreign exchange losses and 4 million lower interest on foreign currency hedges the
decrease in interest on foreign currency hedges was caused by lower interest rate differentials between
currencies in foreign exchange forward contracts and increased usage of natural hedge positions within

europe mains adjusted revenues decreased by 27 despite challenging market conditions overall
consignment volumes grew by 17 revenue per consignment however declined by 40 reflecting
pressure on prices and a decline in average consignment weight both partly explained by growth in
lowerweight b2c volumes revenues were also negatively impacted by the shedding of lossmaking
customers in italy and the discontinuation of a major fashion contract in the united kingdom the
fashion contract represented 16 of the segments revenue in 2012

new tariff structures were introduced in 2013 to attract more sme customers and supported growth in
this segment

in support of profitability in the europe main business units tnt express implemented tight cost control
and launched the deliver improvement programme however the realised savings in 2013 were not
sufficient to offset pricing pressure and inflation europe mains adjusted operating income declined by
52 million

most business units showed weaker yearonyear performance with particular pressure on the results in
france and italy in italy where revenues decreased markedly tnt express rolled out accelerated
restructuring measures the uk  ireland business unit after adjusting for the discontinuation of a
major fashion contract performed well

a positive sign in the second half of the year was the return to growth in the european road and air
networks overall the tonnage transported by the european road and air networks increased by 05
and 10 respectively compared with 2012

adjusted revenues for the segment went up by 33 this was the result of successful yield
management volume growth was muted with flat consignment volumes and a 30 decline in average
kilogrammes per day in the most profitable customer segments however growth was sustained
revenue per consignment and revenue per kilogramme increased by a solid 44 and 75
respectively

adjusted operating income increased year on year by 380 due to yield enhancement and cost control

both domestic and international timedefinite and daydefinite services the majority of revenue comes
from the australian domestic market where tnt express provides both a daydefinite fastestbyroad
service and a nextdaybyair service

2013 performance

australias economic growth over the past few years has been fuelled by the success of its commodities
sector however this sector was under pressure in 2013 due to a slowdown in global demand as a
result the countrys economic growth declined in 2013 compared to 2012

a significant drop in average consignment weight 77 caused by lower volumes from customers in
the commodities sector and price pressure negatively affected revenues in response management
developed new but lighterweight accounts to ensure capacity utilisation and to maintain the companys
market position despite significant consignment growth 68 adjusted revenues decreased by 04

cost savings as part of the deliver improvement programme were accelerated in the second half of
2013 the pacific management team also brought forward tariff increases and prioritised the
development of higherweight shipments however productivity gains and overhead reductions were not
enough to compensate for lower prices and wage inflation of around 4

the implementation of further efficiency measures and reorganisation is on track this includes
significant investments in infrastructure and automation in key locations in australia

vi amea
general

the amea segment constitutes the businesses in asia the middle east and africa with fully owned
subsidiaries in 21 countries tnt express operates domestic and international express services within
amea and provides intercontinental services mainly to and from europe and the united states its
dedicated intercontinental air fleet serves shanghai hong kong singapore and dubai in asia tnt
express operates domestic and regional road networks connecting more than 126 cities and providing
an attractive alternative to air and sea transportation

china represents tnt express largest operation in amea on 1 november 2013 tnt express
divested its chinese domestic road transportation business hoau tnt express will continue to
develop its international express delivery service to and from china which relies on a network of 34
depots and three international hubs in beijing shanghai and shenzhen

in the middle east tnt express operates a regional road network connecting seven countries
construction started for tnt express future air and road hub at dammam airport saudi arabia
allowing for improvements in customs clearance efficiency and delivery speed in the region in africa
tnt express has own operations in four countries and serves the rest of the region through
partnerships and agents

in the first three quarters of 2013 tnt express operated freighters to and from asia and the middle
east two boeing 747 freighters serving shanghai and singapore on a rotational basis and two boeing
777 freighters serving hong kong and dubai the two boeing 747 freighters have been classified as
assets held for disposal since the end of 2011 at the end of 2013 tnt express concluded that an
economically viable sale could not be made under the current market circumstances and that it would
focus on securing aircraft utilisation via air cargo sales blockedspace agreements and charters

since the freighters were no longer accounted for as assets held for disposal at the end of the year the
previous impairments and fair value adjustments of 94 million were reversed and depreciation was
restored a depreciation amount of 24 million was included in the fourthquarter results to recoup the
depreciation not accounted for in the years 2012 and 2013 the adjusted operating income in 2013 has
been normalised for the reversal of the 94 million impairment and fair value adjustments the adjusted
2012 and 2013 operating income includes an annual depreciation of 12 million

2013 performance

business conditions in amea and in particular china while still relatively strong were weaker than in
previous years this was partly due to lower exports to the united states and europe

adjusted revenues decreased by 70 as a result of weaker business conditions and lower export
volumes from large accounts to europe revenues were also affected by the rationalisation of tnt
express customer portfolio the closure of tnt express indian domestic air activities in 2012 and the
sale of china domestic on 1 november 2013

the introduction of vat in china had a negative impact on prices tnt express was unable to fully pass
on the vat to all customers some competitors operating under different licenses were not required to
apply vat to their customers however revenuequality improved in 2013 because of active portfolio
management revenue per consignment and revenue per kilogramme increased by 71 and 140
respectively

management implemented several cost reduction measures including the closing of depots to achieve
optimum depot spread optimised pickups and deliveries and lower overhead

adjusted operating income improved year on year by 26 million as a result of cost optimisation and
yield initiatives the operating result in nearly all units was ahead of 2012

in 2013 reported revenue was 09 above last year due to increased revenue from air cargo sales the
adjusted unallocated net costs were 23 million excluding goodwill impairments of 58 million 9
million of restructuring costs 200 million income from the ups termination fee and 5 million of ups
offerrelated costs

adjusted for oneoff items the unallocated segment generated a 11 million higher loss than in 2012
this was largely due to lower results from tnt innight and higher pension costs after a slow start tnt
innight continued to achieve higher volumes among agricultural and automotive customers

viii discontinued operation  brazil domestic
general

at the beginning of 2013 it was announced that brazil domestic would be divested the process was

ii health and safety
management and performance

tnt express manages health and safety via a systemsbased approach its global health and safety
policy and management framework are based on the international ohsas 18001 standard all business
units are required to achieve and maintain external certification to this standard as a minimum

health and safety risks associated with operational activities are identified and assessed and
subsequently managed and controlled to acceptable levels by implementing effective risk controls within
the operational processes each business unit has a documented risk assessment process in place to
control this particular risk at a local level

tnt express monitors its performance through a set of performance metrics the kpi for safety is the
losttime accident lta ratio the lta ratio is defined as the number of employees that are absent from
work as a result of a workrelated workplace or road traffic accident for at least one working day in the
reporting period excluding the day the accident occurred per 100 fte annual targets are set to drive
performance improvements tnt express health and safety performance is included in the
performance management framework and is subject to quarterly reviews

tnt express acknowledges the safety record of its entire operation a significant part of which is
executed by subcontractors where possible subcontractors are involved in improvement initiatives and
training programmes

preventive measures
tnt express uses the safe vehicle safe driver safe journey approach to identify and implement
effective risk mitigation measures for road safety tnt express pursues continuous improvement in
each of these areas vehicle driver and journey in addition to subcontractor management the main
challenge in reducing road accidents is to ensure consistent application of this approach particularly in
lessdeveloped countries and to ensure subcontractors adopt corresponding standards in practice
where applicable tnt express promotes the improvement of the quality of public infrastructure which
is another relevant factor in enhancing road safety

in 2013 tnt express overall performance improved in terms of fatal accidents and ltas tnt express
regrets any accident including one for which it has no blame to review its own performance focus is
on blameworthy accidents the sole road traffic blameworthy fatal accident in tnt express own
operations occurred in chile 2012 0 similarly tnt express reviews the performance of its
subcontractors as blameworthiness in accidents involving subcontractors cannot currently be
established by tnt express all fatal accidents irrespective of blameworthiness are reported tnt
express is taking action to ensure that the information required to determine blameworthiness in fatal
accidents which involve subcontractors can also be obtained as of 2014 road traffic fatal accidents
involving subcontractors totalled 13 2012 19 which represented a significant decrease compared to
2012 the improvement of the lta ratio in 2013 is supported by continued focus on safety
enhancement

blameworthy road traffic incidentscollisions per 100000 kilometres deteriorated by 68 to 079 in
2013 tnt express has performed a thorough review and determined that the increase is not due to any
common or consistent underlying cause a pilot study conducted in the uk  ireland business unit
confirmed that targeted action including installing reversing cameras in vehicles and developing driver

key initiatives

road safety initiatives
these include driver training driver recognition programmes road safety charters and safe driving
competitions for employees and subcontractors example initiatives are
 the french business unit established a crossfunctional road safety committee the committee is
   responsible for developing and implementing a strategy with specific objectives to optimise road
   safety systems and procedures training communication and subcontractor management
 the uk  ireland business unit took action to reduce manual handling injuries  a key risk factor in
   the industry the business unit implemented a wearable device to encourage correct manual
   handling behaviour
 the italian business unit took proactive measures to improve subcontractor performance by directly
   or indirectly involving drivers in onsite safety briefings and proactively sharing risk assessment
   information

healthrelated initiatives
these include health assessments injury rehabilitation flu vaccination and screening for certain medical
conditions example initiatives are
 the german business unit provided automatic heart defibrillators to all its depot locations
 the uk  ireland business unit implemented employee awareness campaigns to raise awareness
   about signs and symptoms of heart disease lung cancer and stroke
 the australian business unit operated a wellbeing programme covering health and wellness
   initiatives to support employees and their families

improving safety culture
to complement safety standards controls and tools tnt express has stepped up efforts to strengthen
its safety culture this is done by addressing the attitudes beliefs perceptions and values of employees
and subcontractors in relation to safety tnt express promotes a safety culture in which management
exhibits leadership and commitment to safety and all employees assume responsibility for the health
and safety of themselves and others example initiatives are
 the tnt express hub in liège belgium is halfway through a threeyear programme designed to
     reinforce its safety culture and improve its lta ratio by 50 several behaviourbased safety tools
     and bestpractice techniques are being applied including extensive training and coaching
 the australian business unit implemented a safety observation programme with targeted
     interventions and challenged observed behaviour and common practice

outlook and commitments
tnt express most relevant overall safety target is the reduction of ltas the objective is to realise 20
lta per 100 fte by 2015 compared to 269 in 2013 in support of this target tnt express has
adopted a health and safety action plan for the years 2014 to 2015 based on recognised industry best
practices the action plan has ten focus areas as shown below the development and deployment of
the action plan is led by tnt express health and safety professionals from the operating units and head
office the revised health and safety management system its objectives and working plans have been
shared with the operating units and a self assessment tool will be used to monitor progress and
measure performance successful deployment at subcontractors will be given a high priority

management and performance

tnt express considers energy and carbon efficiency to be a priority therefore tnt express is
committed to mitigating its environmental impact with a focus on three areas
 operations improve co2 efficiency and air quality of activities including subcontractors
 customers provide co2 information to customers and help them reduce their emissions
 people encourage awareness and train employees and subcontractors in environmental
   management

tnt express relies on a comprehensive environmental management system to plan implement
monitor manage and improve the impact of its activities clear policies standards and management
controls are in place to manage the environmental impact of tnt express fleet and infrastructure at
each important juncture planning acquisition and operation for subcontractors and suppliers policies
and guidelines are in place to ensure they meet tnt express environmental management
requirements

tnt express operations comply with all applicable environmental laws and standards to ensure
consistency all business units and networks must also comply with the iso 14001 standard tnt
express includes environmental requirements in its capital expenditure and procurement review
process

annual action plans are implemented locally to improve the carbon efficiency of operations
performance is measured through kpis related to energy co2 emission and co2 efficiency tnt
express environmental performance is included in the performance management framework and
subject to quarterly reviews

in 2013 the total co2 emissions of tnt express own and subcontractor operations scope 1 2 and 3
of the greenhouse gas protocol decreased by 03 to 2346 ktonnes the co2 emissions of tnt
express own operations scope 1 and 2 increased in absolute terms by 31 to 1078 ktonnes 2012
1046 as a result of higher air operation activity levels co2 emissions of subcontractor operations
scope 3 decreased by 29 to 1268 ktonnes in 2013 54 of total co2 emissions was related to
subcontractor operations

the co2 efficiency of tnt express air operations measured in co2 per freight tonne kilometre
improved in 2013 due to higher load factors and the use of relatively fuelefficient boeing 777 freighters
throughout the entire year

the co2 efficiency of large trucks measured in co2 per kilometre also improved due to the transition to
newer fuelefficient vehicles and focus on driver behaviour tnt express also took measures to improve
the utilisation of its network shorter routing and better load factors the impact of these initiatives is
however not registered in the efficiency indicator used for vehicles co2 per kilometre

the relatively cold winter in europe in the beginning of 2013 led to the reported deterioration of the co2
efficiency of tnt express buildings

the number of own trucks and vans in european union countries at euro 4 or higher standards
increased by 123 refer to chapter 5 for more information

key initiatives

operations

road
in all major markets electric and lowcarbon emitting vehicles and electricassisted tricycles were tested
and deployed particularly for city deliveries operating units also tested fuelefficient innovations such
as telematics fuel savers and aerodynamic vehicle equipment with a partner tnt express developed
onboard computer technology that calculates fuel efficiency and provides insights into driver behaviour
and driving style this innovation resulted in fuel and co2 efficiencies of between 10 and 15 in the
pilot study conducted in the benelux to ensure maximum impact and scalability best practices are
shared and where possible replicated on a global scale including subcontractors

air
tnt express aims to constantly improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft operations by applying best
practices in network and flight planning takeoff inflight procedures and ground processes in the years
to 2017 a significant number of short haul aircraft will be replaced by younger more fuelefficient
aircraft types

supply chain and innovation platforms
                                                                                               th
at the industry level tnt express participated in several of the european unions 7 framework
programme for research fp7 programmes citylog straightsol frevue which aim to
generate zeroemission solutions for deliveries to city centres in the frevue programme tnt
express has committed to partner with the cities of amsterdam london madrid and rotterdam tnt
express is also cofounder of the green freight europe gfe sector initiative which aims amongst
others to reduce co2 emissions of the transportation sector by supporting its members through a
standard methodology for monitoring and reporting on carbon emissions

customers
tnt express actively engages with customers interested in climate changerelated performance
through a range of services
 co2 report to track and analyse historical co2 emissions
 co2 quote to predict future co2 emissions
 co2 scenario to model and optimise co2 emissions in the transport supply chain
 co2 neutral to offset co2 emissions related to the transport of their consignments

people
driver behaviour has a major impact on vehicle fuel efficiency therefore tnt express drivers are
trained in driving behaviour which helps to reduce fuel consumption and improve safety ecodriving is
included as a standard requirement in driving courses in various locations and is also offered to
                                th
subcontractors in 2013 the 7 drive me challenge edition was held at the duiven road hub in the
netherlands tnt express drivers and subcontractors from operating units worldwide competed in fuel
efficiency safety and customer experience

outlook and commitments

the corporate co2 efficiency index and the related 40 overall improvement target established in 2007
have been replaced by measures and targets better aligned with tnt express core operational
processes targets have been set for the main operating units and are included in local carbon
management plans in the coming years these mediumterm targets include
 100 of own drivers trained in ecodriving
 90 of own vehicles in the european union at euro 4 or higher emission standards
 telematics applied to 50 of own road vehicles
 100 of own linehaul trucks and trailers equipped with aerodynamics and
 100 of bae 146 aircraft replaced by newer more fuelefficient fleet

where possible subcontractors will continue to be involved in initiatives and training programmes

employees

as a global service provider tnt express largely depends on its people to deliver the best possible
service to customers therefore tnt express considers both employees and subcontractors to be vital
assets and pursues a corresponding policy towards human resources management and people
development

tnt express uses the investors in people iip standard to provide a consistent and structured
approach to people management the standard requires identifying and communicating clear business
objectives to all employees and providing performance feedback development plans and adequate
training the objective is to achieve and maintain iip certification for all operations in 2013 82 of
employees were working at iipcertified sites 2012 82

training and other development actions are undertaken at all levels within the organisation all global
trainingrelated development activities are centrally managed to ensure alignment with the companys
values and strategic priorities implementation takes place at local level to ensure local cultures and
languages are taken into account and to minimise cost of travel

tnt express places particular focus on identifying recognising and developing employees with the
potential to become leaders employees are encouraged to join talent pools to develop leadership
capabilities and to ensure succession planning annual performance calibration and succession and
talent reviews are conducted to discuss and assess employee performance results and to guarantee
succession planning of talents in addition tnt express global talent development initiatives are
designed to train and prepare employees to take them to the next level in their careers

employee engagement is measured every year through the global engagement survey voice in 2013
tnt express scored 67 on employee engagement 2012 71 a decline mainly due to a reported
increase in workload in 2014 management will pay particular attention to the areas highlighted by the
engagement survey

human rights

in 2013 tnt express revised the tnt express business principles to better align them with the
specifics of its activities and the un guiding principles for business and human rights the revised
business principles provide more clarity and detail on specific tnt express human rights aspects
related to labour and employment and replace the sa 8000 certification

humanitarian partnerships

tnt express provides expertise and capacity to selected humanitarian partners often at the local level
with a close link to the companys expertise culture employees and customers examples include the
wooden spoon charity for disadvantaged children in the united kingdom the die tafeln food
redistribution charity in germany and austria and the kind heart foundation for distributing medicine
and medical equipment in russia these activities serve to engage and develop employees while
delivering safe and efficient supply chain solutions for people in need

tnt express evaluated its moving the world partnership with the united nations world food
programme in regards to its future potential and strategic financial and cultural fit and decided to
discontinue this partnership by the end of 2013

in 2013 at the request of the united nations global logistics cluster trained tnt express employees
were sent to help ensure that critical relief supplies reached those affected by the haiyan typhoon in the
philippines

as per 10 april 2013


throughout 2013 each member of the supervisory board was able to secure sufficient time for the
proper performance of his or her duties this was confirmed by the high frequency of meetings and ad
hoc conference calls in combination with a very high attendance rate as shown in the table above

all members were independent in accordance with principle iii2 of the dutch corporate governance
code with four male 66 and two female 33 members the composition of the supervisory board
complied with the gender diversity rules of the dutch management and supervision act wet bestuur
en toezicht

the members represented four different nationalities their average age at the end of 2013 was 62 with
ages ranging between 47 and 73 most of the members possess a university degree or equivalent
functional expertise covers finance and general management and business experience ranges
geographically from europe and north america to asia

in 2013 tnt express complied with the requirement of the dutch corporate governance code
stipulating that a supervisory board member may not hold more than five memberships in supervisory
boards of dutch listed companies including tnt express a chairmanship counting twice

matters pertaining to the executive board

ceo succession
immediately following the withdrawal of ups merger offer in january an executive search was initiated
by the supervisory board for a ceo to take over from mr bot who served as ceo ad interim since
september 2012 a dedicated selection committee was established comprising four members of the
supervisory board the committee drew up a list of selection criteria and engaged a professional
executive search firm to perform an international search mr gunning was excluded from this process as
he was already considered a potential candidate following an extensive process the supervisory
board found mr gunning to be the strongest candidate on the list of internal and external candidates in
view of his extensive international business experience in executive positions his track record in
successfully turning around businesses and delivering results and shareholder value were also
considered as highly valuable to the company

during the selection procedure for the new ceo the supervisory board acknowledged the importance
of a balanced composition of the executive board suitable female candidates were identified in the
search process however they proved not to be available as a result the composition of the executive
board in 2013 did not comply with the gender diversity rules recommended by the dutch management
and supervision act

contract
in compliance with the dutch management and supervision act which took effect in january 2013 tnt
express concluded a service agreement with mr gunning the agreement is for a period of four years
and ends by operation of law on 1 june 2017 mr bots employment agreement remained unaffected as
it already existed at the effective date of the act mr bots employment agreement is for an indefinite
period and ends either on the date of his retirement or by notice of either party requiring a notice period
of six months

compliance

in 2013 the internal audit internal control risk management business ethics and export control
functions were grouped together into one compliance function under the responsibility of the
compliance director

internal audit
the internal audit function provides assurance and advice on the quality of governance risk
management and internal control processes companywide its riskbased audit approach is designed to
add value and improve the operations of tnt express by ensuring that controls are being applied
effectively and control gaps are addressed internal audit strives to align the cost of control with the size
and type of risk and the risk appetite of tnt express internal audit carries out operational financial
ics compliance project and corporate responsibility audits within its riskbased approach the tnt
express audit environment consists of business entities head office functions projects and processes
when not selected on the basis of risk each year the small and medium entities in the risk scope are
selected on a rotation basis with the objective of ensuring all entities are audited within a fouryear
period the external auditor compliance director and the audit committee are aligned in defining the
tasks and plans of the internal audit function

internal control
the executive board used elements of former obligations under the sarbanesoxley act in establishing
the companys governance and internal controls over financial reporting icfr furthermore the
executive board has chosen to expand the scope of the icfr framework beyond the minimum
requirements that would have been mandatory according to the sarbanesoxley act to include certain
smaller entities and most entities acquired in the past few years

in addition the approach is based on the principles outlined in auditing standards as 2 and takes into
account certain elements of the as 5 as promulgated by the public companies accounting oversight
board pcaob however tnt express approach to icfr does not imply an assessment of the
adequacy and effectiveness of tnt express internal control and risk management processes over
financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act nor is there an assessment by tnt
express external auditor to that effect

throughout 2013 tnt express documented and evaluated the design of icfr in addition tnt
express continued a comprehensive programme of testing the operational effectiveness of its icfr
further initiatives on entitylevel controls were undertaken including integrity awareness and training
and reinforcement of policies and procedures in 2013 the executive board engaged the external
auditor to perform specific agreedupon procedures on the icfr process in all entities included in the
scope of the icfr programme the executive board believes that this approach develops the discipline
needed to maintain and embed icfr across the company the findings of the external auditor were
reported to the executive board and the audit committee of the supervisory board

risk management
tnt express has a continuous formal and structured risk management and reporting system in place

average bonus received over the last three years multiplied by a maximum of two tnt express
believes that such payment is reasonable taking into account the special position of members of the
executive board in a change of control situation also in such an event the supervisory board may
decide that performance shares vest in whole or in part

best practice provision iv11
this provision stipulates that a companys general meeting may pass a resolution to set aside the
binding nature of a nomination for the appointment of a member of the board of management or of the
supervisory board andor a resolution to remove a member of the board of management or of the
supervisory board by an absolute majority of the votes cast which majority may be required to represent
a proportion of the issued capital which proportion may not exceed onethird if this proportion of the
capital is not represented at the meeting but an absolute majority is in favour of any such resolution a
new meeting may be convened at which the resolution may be passed by an absolute majority of the
votes cast regardless of the proportion of the capital represented at the meeting

tnt express applies this best practice provision except for a minor deviation for a resolution to appoint
a member of the executive board or of the supervisory board other than in accordance with a
nomination by the supervisory board there is no second meeting allowed in which the requirement of
onethird of the capital can be set aside tnt express deviates from this best practice provision for
reasons of stability and continuity

encumbrance or other disposal of shares with the exception of the sale to tnt express or to another
company assigned by and affiliated in a group with it as well as the assistance in the repayment or
withdrawal of preference shares

the foundation is an independent legal entity in the sense of section 571 paragraph 1 sub c of the
dutch financial supervision act

to enable the foundation to perform its duties tnt express has granted it a call option when
exercising the call option the foundation is entitled to subscribe to preference shares consisting of the
right to repeatedly subscribe for preference shares up to a maximum corresponding with one hundred
percent 100 of the issued share capital in the form of ordinary shares as outstanding immediately
prior to the exercise of the subscribed rights less one preference share and minus any shares already
held by the foundation the foundation has the right to exercise the call option at any time either wholly
or partly

the foundation may exercise the call option for certain reasons including
 to prevent slow down or otherwise complicate an unsolicited takeover bid for and an unsolicited
    acquisition of ordinary shares by means of an acquisition at the stock market or otherwise
 to prevent and countervail concentration of voting rights in the general meeting of stakeholders and
 to resist unwanted influence by and pressure from shareholders to amend the strategy of tnt
    express
and with respect to the foregoing to give tnt express the opportunity to consider and to explore
possible alternatives and if required to work these out and to implement them in the event an actual or
threatening concentration of voting rights arises among the shareholders which according to the
provisional judgement of the executive board and the supervisory board and the board of the
foundation is considered to be unsolicited and not in the interest of tnt express and its enterprise
and to enable tnt express to do so by temporarily neutralising such concentration of voting rights

as from six months after the issuance of the preference shares to the foundation the foundation may
require tnt express to convene a general meeting of stakeholders to propose cancellation of the
preference shares against repayment of the paid amount if preference shares are issued tnt express
must convene a general meeting of stakeholders to be held no later than 12 months after the date on
which the preference shares were issued for the first time or 60 days after the foundation has
demanded the cancellation of its preference shares the agenda for that meeting of stakeholders must
include a proposal for a resolution relating to the repurchase or cancellation of the preference shares

tnt express has granted the foundation the right to file an application for an inquiry into the policy and
the course of events of tnt express with the enterprise chamber of the amsterdam court of appeal
ondernemingskamer tnt express believes that this may be a useful option amongst others in the
period before the issuance of preference shares as it does not cause a dilution of the rights of other
shareholders to enable the foundation to function properly the executive board holds meetings with
the board of the foundation on a regular base

the members of the board of the foundation are mr bouw chairman mr tiemstra and ms tonkens

proposed remuneration policy as of 2014

the supervisory board has decided that the main principles of the current remuneration policy will
remain unchanged the policy continues to be based on performance and is aligned with the objectives
of the major stakeholders however based on the revised strategy with a desire to simplify the policy
and taking into account the outcome of the benchmark test the supervisory board has decided to
propose amendments to the shortterm and longterm instruments of the variable component of the
current remuneration policy the proposed adjustments have been tested under various share price
scenarios the maximum payout under the proposed policy is similar to the payout under the current
policy

the proposed remuneration policy as of 2014 will be submitted for adoption by the annual general
meeting of shareholders on 9 april 2014

below is a description of the proposed remuneration policy

base compensation
the remuneration policy for members of the executive board permits the base compensation to be
adjusted in line with the average increase in the collective labour agreements adopted by the larger tnt
express entities in europe although the results of the benchmark test and the developments in the
collective labour agreements could lead to an increase of the base compensation the supervisory
board decided that the annual base compensation for members of the executive board will remain
unchanged

variable income
the supervisory board has reviewed the current variable incentive schemes in light of the companys
strategy for the upcoming years for the variable income the supervisory board proposes adjustments




                                                                                                               57

the supervisory board believes that the effectiveness of the variable incentive instruments will be
improved by reducing the number of targets thus focusing on the critical areas as defined in the revised
strategy all targets and objectives are quantitative

the variable income policy comprises the following instruments
 shortterm incentive
 voluntary bonusmatching plan linked to shortterm incentive proceeds and
 equitybased longterm incentive to ensure alignment with longterm value creation and the interest
   of shareholders the tnt express performance share plan

the proposed 2014 shortterm and longterm incentive plans for members of the executive board are
aligned with the variable income programmes for senior management

shortterm incentive
the annual shortterm incentive opportunity amounts to 100 of the annual base compensation for an
on target performance the reward of the shortterm incentive will be delivered as follows 50 in cash
and 50 rights to shares lockedin for three years

the 2014 shortterm incentive entirely focuses on financial targets comprising
 70 company results
 30 cash flow

results relating to the targets lead independently to a shortterm incentive payout

in order to qualify for the shortterm incentive scheme a member of the executive board is required to
be in service on 31 december of the relevant year

bonusmatching plan
a member of the executive board may participate on a voluntary basis in the bonusmatching plan by
investing a maximum of 50 of the gross payout of the shortterm incentive of the previous year in tnt
express shares however the investment in tnt express shares cannot be more than the net proceeds
of the bonus after a threeyear holding period these shares will be matched on a onetoone basis

the matching of bonus shares occurs under the condition of continued employment and if at least 50
of the bonus shares is retained during the holding period

longterm incentive
the supervisory board can award conditional rights to tnt express shares to members of the
executive board under the tnt express performance share plan from 2014 the award is based on a
value of 50 of the annual base compensation the actual number of rights to shares granted is
determined by dividing the available amount 50 annual base compensation by the fair value of the
right to a share according to ifrs

the performance shares vest after a threeyear period the actual number of shares that vest depends
on the performance of the following performance measures
 50 financial target the tsr performance of the company will be measured on a threeyear basis
    against a peer group of aex companies 50 weighting and of tnt express three main direct
    competitors deutsche post dhl fedex and ups 50 weighting during the threeyear vesting
    period the tsr data and risk profiles are compiled and reported as an index by an external data
    provider after three years the final performance of the company over the threeyear period
    compared to the final performance of the peer group determines the number of shares to be vested
    as presented in the following table

            20                  5000



    the performance schedule sliding scale is designed such that a tsr performance of the company
    at index level 0 difference leads to a vesting of half of the maximum of granted rights to shares
   50 nonfinancial targets consisting of targets considered most relevant for the company during
    the threeyear vesting period for 2014 a customer satisfaction target

the maximum number of shares that can vest under the plan amounts to 100 of the base allocation

the remuneration committee advises the supervisory board on the actual number of 2014
performance shares that vest which will be determined by the tsr performance over the period 2014 to
2017 and the performance on the nonfinancial targets over three calendar years preceding the vesting
date

are set out below these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless
otherwise stated all amounts included in the financial statements are presented in euro unless
otherwise stated

basis of preparation
the consolidated financial statements of tnt express have been prepared in accordance with
international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union ifrs includes
the application of international financial reporting standards and international accounting standards
ias related interpretations of the international financial reporting interpretations committee ifric
and interpretations of the standing interpretations committee sic the consolidated financial
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for financial instruments and
assets held for disposal

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates it also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
tnt express accounting policies the areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are

                                                                                                   statements
                                                                                                    chapter 5



disclosed in the critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying tnt express accounting
policies section

the international accounting standards board iasb has issued certain international financial
reporting standards or amendments thereon and the ifric has issued certain interpretations the
impact of changes when adopted by the european union on tnt express consolidated financial
statements has been assessed

changes in accounting policies and disclosures

a new and amended standards adopted by tnt express

   ias 19r employee benefits revised is effective for tnt express as of 1 january 2013 in
    accordance with ias 8 tnt express has restated the financial statements as at 31 december
    2012 refer to adoption of ias 19r below

   ifrs 13 fair value measurement is effective for tnt express as of 1 january 2013 ifrs 13
    aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value
    and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across ifrs
    the requirements do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it
    should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within ifrs
    the adoption of ifrs 13 did not materially impact the consolidated financial statements for long
    term debt stated at amortised cost tnt express has included an additional disclosure following the
    requirements of ifrs 13 refer to note 30

   amendment to ias 1 financial statement presentation regarding other comprehensive income
    the main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to classify items
    presented in other comprehensive income on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable
    to profit or loss subsequently reclassification adjustments the amendments do not address which
    items are presented in other comprehensive income and do not have an impact on equity and total
    comprehensive income

   amendment to ifrs 7 financial instruments disclosures on offsetting financial assets and
    financial liabilities this amendment includes new disclosures to facilitate comparison between
    those entities that prepare ifrs financial statements and those that prepare financial statements in
    accordance with us gaap refer to note 29


b new standards amendments and interpretations not yet adopted

a number of new standards amendments and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective
for the financial year beginning 1 january 2013 and are not early adopted by tnt express the items
applicable are presented below

   ifrs 9 financial instruments addresses the classification measurement and recognition of
    financial assets and financial liabilities ifrs 9 was issued in november 2009 and october 2010 it
    replaces the parts of ias 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial
    instruments ifrs 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories
    those measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost the determination is made at
    initial recognition the classification depends on the entitys business model for managing its
    financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument for financial
    liabilities the standard retains most of the ias 39 requirements the main change is that in cases
    where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities the part of a fair value change due to an
    entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income
    statement unless this creates an accounting mismatch

   ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements builds on existing principles by identifying the
    concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the
    consolidated financial statements of the parent company the standard provides additional
    guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess tnt express does
    not expect a material impact and will adopt ifrs 10 on 1 january 2014

   ifrs 11 joint arrangements replaces ias 31 interests in joint ventures and deals with how a
    joint arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control should be classified under ifrs
    11 joint ventures are required to be accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereas
    under ias 31 jointly controlled entities can be accounted for using the equity method of accounting




                                                                                                          76

                                                                                                    statements
                                                                                                     chapter 5



      or proportionate consolidation method had ifrs 11 been applied as at 31 december 2013 tnt
      express would have applied the equity method instead of the proportionate consolidation method to
      account for joint ventures the reported net sales and operating income for 2013 would have
      decreased by 86 million 2012 87 and 7 million 2012 11 respectively while profit attributable
      to shareholders would remain constant refer to note 32 for the disclosure on joint ventures tnt
      express will adopt ifrs 11 on 1 january 2014

     ifrs 12 disclosures of interests in other entities includes the disclosure requirements for all
      forms of interests in other entities including joint arrangements associates special purpose entities
      and other offbalance sheet vehicles tnt express does not expect a material impact and will adopt
      ifrs 12 on 1 january 2014

there are no other ifrs or ifric interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to
have a material impact on the group

adoption of ias 19r
the impact of the adoption of ias 19r on the group is as follows the corridor approach has been
eliminated and all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income as they
occur all past service costs are immediately recognised and interest cost and expected return on plan
assets are replaced by a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net
defined benefit liability asset

in accordance with ias 8 tnt express has restated the financial statements of the comparable interim
period and the financial statements as at 31 december 2012 consequently the restated employer
pension expense in 2012 was 3 million higher net of tax and the restated closing equity position as at
31 december 2012 was 100 million lower net of tax respectively the equivalent effect of the
adoption as per 1 january 2012 on equity amounted to 40 million net of tax the 2012 earnings per
share have decreased by 005 cents to 0158 cents following the ias 19r restatement

the following table summarises the effects on the statement of financial position of the adoption of ias
19r

adoption of ifrs 13
tnt express has applied ifrs 13 as of 1 january 2013 consequently debit value adjustments and
credit value adjustments were evaluated for all applicable financial assets and liabilities the impact of
these adjustments was not considered to be material

consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the financial numbers of tnt express nv and its
subsidiaries associates and joint ventures and have been prepared using uniform accounting policies
for similar transactions and other events in similar circumstances all significant intercompany
transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions have been eliminated on consolidation
unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred a complete list of subsidiaries associates and joint ventures included in tnt express
consolidated financial statements is filed for public review at the chamber of commerce in amsterdam
this list has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of article 379 1 and article 414 of book 2
of the dutch civil code

as the financial statements of tnt express nv are included in the consolidated financial statements
the corporate income statement is presented in an abridged form article 402 of book 2 of the dutch
civil code

subsidiaries associates and joint ventures
subsidiaries are all entities including special purpose entities over which tnt express has the power
to govern financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than onehalf
of the voting rights the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or
convertible are considered when assessing whether tnt express controls another entity

an associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture over which
commercial and financial policy decisions tnt express has significant influence significant influence is
the power to participate in financial and operating policy decisions of an entity but is not control or joint
control over those policies tnt express share of results of all significant associates is included in the
income statement using the equity method the carrying value of tnt express share in associates
includes goodwill on acquisition and changes to reflect tnt express share in net earnings of the
respective companies reduced by dividends received tnt express share in nondistributed earnings
of associates is included in net investment when tnt express share of any accumulated losses
exceeds the acquisition value of the shares in the associates the book value is reduced to zero and the
reporting of losses ceases unless tnt express is bound by guarantees or other undertakings in
relation to the associate

a joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby tnt express and one or more other parties
undertake an economic activity subject to joint control joint ventures in which tnt express participates
with other parties are proportionately consolidated in applying the proportionate consolidation method
tnt express percentage share of the statement of financial position and income statement items are
included in tnt express consolidated financial statements

business combinations
tnt express uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries
the consideration of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred equity
instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange the consideration
transferred includes also the fair value arising from contingent consideration arrangements acquisition
related costs are expensed as incurred identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition
date irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interest

the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of tnt express share of the identifiable
net assets of the subsidiary is recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of
tnt express share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in
the income statement

tnt express treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners for
purchases from noncontrolling interests the difference between any consideration paid and the
relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains
or losses on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity

when tnt express ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is
remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in income statement the
fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent accounting for the retained




                                                                                                            78

                                                                                                    statements
                                                                                                     chapter 5



interest as an associate joint venture or financial asset in addition any amounts previously recognised
in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if tnt express had
directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities this could lead to a reclassification of amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income to the income statement

the noncontrolling interest is initially measured at the proportion of the noncontrolling interest in the
recognised net fair value of the assets liabilities and contingent liabilities losses applicable to the non
controlling interest in excess of its share of the subsidiarys equity are allocated against tnt express
interests except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding obligation and is able to
make an additional investment to cover the losses subsidiaries accounting policies have been changed
where necessary to ensure consistency with tnt express accounting policies

functional currency and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of all tnt express entities are measured using the currency
of the primary environment in which the entity operates the functional currency the consolidated
financial statements are presented in euro which is the functional and presentation currency of tnt
express

foreign currency transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are
translated to the functional currency using yearend exchange rates

foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency
transactions and balances and from the translation at yearend exchange rates are recognised in the
income statement except for qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges that are
directly recognised in equity

foreign operations
the results and financial position of all tnt express entities none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy with a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows
 assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate
 income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and
 the resulting exchange differences based on the different ways of translation between the statement
     of financial position and the income statement are recognised as a separate component of equity
     translation reserve

foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
entities and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments
are recognised in the translation reserve when a foreign operation is sold such exchange differences
are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale

goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate

intangible assets

goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the share of the
identifiable net assets acquired by tnt express goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint
ventures is included in intangible assets goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in the carrying
amount of investments in associates

goodwill is recognised as an asset and although it is not amortised it is reviewed for impairment
annually and whenever there is a possible indicator of impairment any impairment is recognised
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed goodwill is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses on disposal of an entity any residual amount of goodwill is included in
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal

goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to ifrs has been retained at the previous
historical values as no adjustment was required on transition these have also been subject to
impairment tests at that date and will continue to be at least annually




                                                                                                           79

                                                                                                  statements
                                                                                                   chapter 5



other intangible assets
costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical
cost and amortised using the straightline method over the estimated useful life apart from software
other intangible assets mainly include customer relationships assets under development licences and
concessions other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at
the acquisition date

an asset under development is reclassified when it is ready for use and is subsequently amortised using
the straightline method over its estimated useful life other intangible assets are valued at the lower of
historical cost less amortisation and impairment

property plant and equipment
property plant and equipment are valued at historical cost using a component approach less
depreciation and impairment losses in addition to the costs of acquisition the company also includes
costs of bringing the asset to working condition handling and installation costs and the nonrefundable
purchase taxes under the component approach each component of an item of property plant and
equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall be depreciated
separately

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into
account any residual value the assets residual value and useful life is reviewed and adjusted if
appropriate at each balance sheet date subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount
or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably

land is not depreciated system software is capitalised and amortised as a part of the tangible asset for
which it was acquired to operate because the estimated useful life is inextricably linked to the estimated
useful life of the associated asset

leases of property plant and equipment are classified as finance leases if the company bears
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised at the leases
inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum
lease payments the corresponding rental obligations net of finance charges are included in longterm
debt property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of
the assets useful life and the lease term

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment

goodwill
goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an
indication that the asset might be impaired

for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped by cashgenerating unit cgu the
lowest level at which there are separately identifiable cash flows for impairment testing of goodwill the
group of cgus is defined as the lowest level where goodwill is monitored for internal purposes this
level may be higher than the level used for testing other assets but is not at a higher level than an
operating segment

if the recoverable value of the cgu is less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the
unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit the recoverable amount is the
higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use in assessing the value in use the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the asset specific risks for the purpose of
assessing impairment corporate assets are allocated to specific cgus before impairment testing the
allocation of the corporate assets is based on the contribution of those assets to the future cash flows of
the cgu under review goodwill following the acquisition of associates is not separately recognised or
tested for impairment

impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period

finitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment
at each balance sheet date tnt express reviews the carrying amount of its finitelived intangible
assets and property plant and equipment to determine whether there is an indication that those assets
have suffered an impairment loss if any indication exists the recoverable amount of the assets is
estimated in order to determine the extent if any of the impairment loss an asset is impaired if the




                                                                                                         80

                                                                                                     chapter 5



recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of
an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use

if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying
amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount any impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount
since the last impairment loss was recognised the recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years a
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement

financial assets and liabilities
tnt express classifies financial assets and liabilities into the following categories
 financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
 loans and receivables
 heldtomaturity investments
 availableforsale financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

the classification depends on the purpose for which the financial asset or liability was acquired
management determines the classification of tnt express financial assets and liabilities at initial
recognition

financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives and other
assets and liabilities that are designated as such upon initial recognition

measurement at fair value requires disclosure of measurement methods based on the following fair
value measurement hierarchy
 level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets
 level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly prices or indirectly
    derived from prices
 level 3 inputs not based on observable market data

financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recorded at fair
value and subsequently remeasured at fair value in the statement of financial position tnt express
designates certain derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm
commitment fair value hedge hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability
or a highly probable forecasted transaction cash flow hedge or hedges of a net investment in a foreign
operation net investment hedge

if a derivative is designated as a cash flow or net investment hedge changes in its fair value are
considered to be effective and recorded in a separate component of equity hedge reserve until the
hedged item is recorded in income any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is
considered to be ineffective or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness is immediately
recorded in the income statement

at the inception of the transaction tnt express documents the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions the company also documents the assessment both at hedge inception and
on an ongoing basis of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are
recorded in the income statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or
liability that are attributable to the hedged risk

unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities
classified at fair value through income statement are directly recorded in the income statement

amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged
item will affect the income statement for example when the forecasted sale that is hedged takes place
however when the forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a nonfinancial
asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the
initial measurement of the asset or liability




                                                                                                           81

                                                                                                    statements
                                                                                                     chapter 5



when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting any cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the
forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement when a forecasted transaction
is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gains or losses that were reported in equity are
immediately transferred to the income statement

loans and receivables
loans granted and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market and for which tnt express has no intention of trading loans
and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position except
for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date these are classified as noncurrent
assets

loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method

heldtomaturity investments
heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities where tnt express has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity

heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method

availableforsale financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets that are either designated in this
category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets they are included in non
current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance
sheet date

availableforsale financial assets are carried at fair value unrealised gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of financial assets classified as available for sale are recognised in other
comprehensive income when financial assets classified as available for sale are sold or impaired the
accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as a gain or a loss

the fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices if the market for a financial asset
is not active and for unlisted securities tnt express establishes fair value by using valuation
techniques these include the use of recent armslength transactions reference to other instruments
that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuers specific
circumstances

financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction
costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net
of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of
the financial liability using the effective interest method

impairment of financial assets
tnt express assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired in the case of equity securities classified as available
forsale a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in
determining whether the securities are impaired if any such evidence exists for availableforsale
financial assets the cumulative loss  measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the
current fair value less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in income
statement  is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement impairment losses on
equity instruments recognised in the income statement are not reversed through equity

inventory
inventories of raw materials and finished goods are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable
value historical cost is based on weighted average prices

accounts receivable
accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method less allowance for doubtful debt an allowance for doubtful debt is
established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables the amount of the allowance is the difference
between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted
at the effective interest rate the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement any reversal
of the impairment loss is included in the income statement at the same line as where the original
expense has been recorded




                                                                                                           82

                                                                                                 statements
                                                                                                  chapter 5



the risk of uncollectibility of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are assessed individually based on
factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectability the assumptions and estimates applied for determining the valuation
allowance are reviewed periodically

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value cash and cash
equivalents include cash at hand bank account balances bills of exchange and cheques only those
which can be cashed in the short term all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents bank overdrafts are not
netted off from cash and cash equivalents

assets or disposal groups held for disposal and discontinued operations
assets or disposal groups held for disposal are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair
value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally by means of disposal rather than
through continuing use assets held for disposal are no longer amortised or depreciated from the time
they are classified as such

assets held for disposal are available for immediate disposal in its present condition and are considered
as highly probable

operations that represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or that
are part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale and either have been
disposed of or have been classified as held for disposal are presented as discontinued operations in
tnt express financial statements

equity
ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares or options are presented in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds

where any group company purchases tnt express equity share capital treasury shares the
consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is
deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled reissued or disposed of where such shares are
subsequently sold or reissued any consideration received net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related income tax effects are included in equity

provisions for pension liabilities
the obligation for all pension and other postemployment plans that qualify as defined benefit plans is
determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value
of the plan assets tnt express uses actuarial calculations projected unit credit method to measure
the obligations and the costs for the calculations actuarial assumptions are made about demographic
variables such as employee turnover mortality and disability and financial variables the discount rate
is determined by reference to highquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in
which the benefits will be paid

actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise

pastservice costs if any are recognised immediately in the income statement

gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised at the date of
the curtailment or settlement

pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or
due

other provisions
provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event it is probable
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation provisions are measured at the present
value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the
balance sheet date the discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the gross up of the




                                                                                                        83

                                                                                                    chapter 5



provision following the discounting of the provision is recorded in the income statement as interest
expense

provisions are recorded for employee benefit obligations restructuring onerous contracts and other
obligations

provisions for employee benefit obligations include longservice leave or sabbatical leave jubilee or
other longservice benefits longterm disability benefits and if they are not payable wholly within 12
months after the end of the period profitsharing bonuses and deferred compensation the expected
costs of these benefits are recognised over the period of employment actuarial gains and losses and
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to income in the period in which such gain or
loss occurs related service costs are recognised immediately

provisions recorded for restructuring largely relate to termination benefits termination benefits are
payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits tnt express recognises termination
benefits when the company has committed to terminate the employment of current employees according
to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or to provide termination benefits as a result of
an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy benefits falling due more than 12 months after
balance sheet date are discounted to their present value

provisions for onerous contracts are recorded when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation
under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to arise from that contract taking into
account impairment of tangible assets first

the provision for other obligations relates to legal and contractual obligations and received claims

trade accounts payable
trade accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method

income taxes
the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive
income

the amount of income tax included in the income statement is determined in accordance with the rules
established by the taxation authorities based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable

deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities are calculated using the substantively
enacted tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled deferred tax assets are
recognised if it is probable that they will be realised deferred tax assets and liabilities where a legally
enforceable right to offset exists and within the same tax group are presented net in the statement of
financial position

revenue recognition
revenue is recognised when services are rendered goods are delivered or work is completed revenue
is the gross inflow of economic benefits during the current year that arise from ordinary activities and
result in an increase in equity other than increases relating to contributions from equity participants

revenue from delivered goods and services is recognised when
 the company has transferred to a buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
   and services
 the company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
   with ownership nor effective control of the goods and services sold
 the amount of revenue can be measured reliably
 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company
 the costs to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and
 the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably

revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable

amounts received in advance are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are rendered to
customers or goods are delivered




                                                                                                          84

and when a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made

sharebased payments
sharebased payment transactions are transactions in which tnt express receives benefits from its
employees in consideration for equity instruments or for amounts of cash that are based on the price of
equity instruments of the company the fair value of the equitysettled sharebased transactions is
recognised as an expense part of the employee costs and a corresponding increase in equity over the
vesting period the fair value of payments of sharebased payment plans based on market conditions is
calculated using the monte carlo model the fair value of payments of sharebasement plans based on
nonmarket conditions are based on the share price on the date the grant is made corrected for a
dividend yield the equity instruments granted do not vest until the employee completes a specific
period of service

interest income and expense
interest income and expense are recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest
method interest income comprises interest income on lendings changes in the fair value of financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss foreign currency gains and gains on hedged items interest

currency losses changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
impairment losses recognised on financial assets and losses on hedged items

all borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method except
to the extent that they are capitalised as part of the cost of the qualifying asset

grants
grants are recognised initially as income when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received
and tnt express has complied with the conditions associated with the grant grants that compensate
tnt express for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in the
same period in which the expenses are recognised grants that compensate tnt express for the cost
of an asset are deducted from the historical value of the asset and recognised in the income statement
on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset

operating leases
leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
operating leases payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the
lessor are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the lease




                                                                                                       85

economic characteristics consistency with the core principle of ifrs and when operating segments are
similar in respect of
 the nature of products and services

segments benelux france germany italy and uk  ireland have been aggregated into europe main

critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying tnt express
accounting policies

the preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments estimates and
assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets
liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from these estimates estimates and
judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected
the critical accounting estimates judgments and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below

business combinations
tnt express accounts for all its business combinations applying the acquisition method the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised and measured on the basis of their fair values at the
date of acquisition to determine fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed tnt express
must make estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available any
excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired represents
goodwill

for purposes of preparation of the consolidated financial statements internal reorganisations or transfer
of businesses between tnt express companies were accounted for at predecessor carrying amounts
these transactions did not give rise to goodwill

impairment of assets
in determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill property plant and equipment and
financial fixed assets management must make significant judgments and estimates to determine
whether the fair value of the cash flows generated by those assets is less than their carrying value
determining cash flows requires the use of judgments and estimates that have been included in the
strategic plans and longrange forecasts of tnt express the data necessary for executing the




                                                                                                         86

                                                                                                 statements
                                                                                                  chapter 5



impairment tests are based on management estimates of future cash flows which require estimating
revenue growth rates and profit margins refer to note 1 for applied sensitivities on intangible assets

depreciation and amortisation of property plant and equipment and intangible assets
property plant and equipment and intangible assets except for goodwill are depreciated or amortised
at historical cost using a straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into account any
residual value the assets residual value and useful life are based on tnt express best estimates and
are reviewed and adjusted if required at each balance sheet date

impairment of receivables
the risk of uncollectability of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are individually assessed based on
factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectability should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates revisions
to the estimated valuation allowances would be required

restructuring
restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring operations including combinations andor
relocations of operations changes in tnt express strategic direction or managerial responses to
declining demand increasing costs or other market factors restructuring provisions reflect many
estimates including those pertaining to separation costs reduction of excess facilities contract
settlements and tangible asset impairments actual experience has been and may continue to be
different from these estimates

income taxes
the company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision and liability for income taxes there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business
tnt express recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be
due based on its best interpretation of the relevant tax laws and rules where the final tax outcome of
these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made

tnt express recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits
will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered this is based on estimates of taxable income by
jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are
recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods and depending
on the tax strategies that the company may be able to implement changes to the recognition of deferred
tax assets could be required which could impact tnt express financial position and net profit

accounting for assets held for disposal
accounting for assets held for disposal requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates such
as the assumptions used in fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to dispose

pension benefits
the present value of the pension obligation depends on a number of factors that are determined on an
actuarial basis using a number of assumptions any change in these assumptions will impact the
carrying amount of pension obligations the assumptions used in determining the net pension
expenseincome include the discount rate which is based on the longterm yield of highquality
corporate bonds other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market
conditions tnt express reviews the assumptions at the end of each year refer to note 10 for more
information

contingent liabilities
legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions
due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters it is often difficult to predict the final outcome cases
and claims against the company often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are
subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to the facts and circumstances
of each particular case and claim the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law in the normal
course of business tnt express consults with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters

goodwill
goodwill is allocated to tnt express cashgenerating units cgus and tested for impairment
previously the cgus were northern europe southern europe  mea asia pacific north america
brazil domestic other south americas and other networks following the revised organisational
structure implemented as of the second half of the year the cgus for goodwill impairment testing
purposes have changed they changed into benelux france germany italy uk  ireland europe
other north america brazil domestic other south americas pacific asia middle east and africa
amea and other networks consequently the relevant goodwill was reallocated to the new tnt
express cgus based on the relative value of the cgus which were part of the former cgus northern
europe and southern europe  mea

the total goodwill balance at 31 december 2013 amounted to 1039 million 2012 1340 which was
allocated to europe main for 287 million 2012 525 europe other for 457 million 2012 458 pacific
for 20 million 2012 20 asia middle east and africa for 250 million 2012 250 north america for
0 million 2012 0 brazil domestic for 0 million 2012 0 other south americas for 25 million
2012 29 and other networks for 0 million 2012 58

in 2013 the goodwill balances were tested for impairment twice with an additional test performed in the
second quarter considering the revised cgu structure and the weaker performance of the former cgus
southern europe  mea and other networks

the impairment test in the second quarter resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss of 296
million in the income statement the annual impairment test performed at 31 december 2013 resulted
in no additional impairment charges recognised at yearend more information is disclosed in the
following sections




                                                                                                       89

                                                                                                  statements
                                                                                                   chapter 5



goodwill impairment testing second quarter
in the second quarter a detailed review of the recoverable amount of each cgu was performed the
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use fair value less
cost to sell represents the best estimate of the amount tnt express would receive if it were to sell the
cgu the fair value was estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows taking into
account the cost to sell

for mature markets the estimated future net cash flows are based on a fiveyear forecast and business
plan for emerging markets where no steady state has been achieved to date a tenyear forecast has
been applied to estimate the future net cash flows as at the second quarter of 2013 the cash flow
projections were based on financial budgets excluding deliver and have been approved by
management

budgeted gross margins are based on past performance and expectations for market development the
applied growth rates do not exceed the longterm average growth rate of the related operations and
markets and are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports the discount rates used vary
from 75 to 134 pretax posttax 73 to 108 to reflect specific risks relating to each cgu

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values of all cgus are
 maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development to determine the revenue
    mix and growth rate
 level of capital expenditure in network related assets that may affect the further rollout of the
    network
 level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taking into account
    the nature of the underlying costs potential economies of scale and
 discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency
    and inflationrelated risks

based on the impairment test management concluded that the recoverable amount based on value in
use of other networks and the former cgus northern europe and southern europe  mea was below
the carrying amount for a total amount of 296 million this can be specified as follows
 former cgu southern europe  mea 159 million
 former cgu northern europe 79 million and
 other networks 58 million

of the total goodwill of 571 million of the former cgu southern europe  mea the total impairment
was 159 million this was due to the weaker performances of france and italy and the higher
granularity of the new cgus as a result of which compensating developments no longer could be taken
into account

for the former cgu northern europe an amount of 79 million was impaired out of a total goodwill of
659 million as a result of the generally worsened economic climate and the higher granularity of the
new cgus

for other networks the total of 58 million goodwill was impaired as a result of the discontinuation of an
important fashion contract and the decline in the results of tnt innight activities

goodwill impairment testing as at yearend
at 31 december 2013 the annual impairment test was performed consistently with the approach
described for the second quarter of 2013 with the exception of
 the cash flow projections used for the impairment testing at yearend include committed savings
    from deliver and
 the discount rates used vary from 75 to 111 pretax posttax 73 to 107 to reflect specific
    risks relating to each cgu

based on the impairment test management concluded that the recoverable amount based on value in
use for all cgus was above the carrying amount at 31 december 2013

in 2012 as a result of managements decision to divest the china domestic operation the business was
classified as an asset held for disposal as a disposal group china domestic was measured at the
lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell which resulted in a write down of its carrying
amount by 75 million refer to note 8 for the disclosure information related to assets held for disposal

china domestic was part of the former cgu asia pacific of the total goodwill amount of the former
cgu asia pacific 125 million was allocated to china domestic as part of its carrying amount




                                                                                                         90

                                                                                                  statements
                                                                                                   chapter 5



consequently the write down of its carrying amount was accounted for as a goodwill impairment of 75
million with the remaining 50 million classified as held for disposal

in 2012 the exit of the indian domestic business and the liquidation of the related legal entity were
finalised consequently a goodwill impairment of 19 million was recorded relating to the allocated
goodwill of the indian domestic business the goodwill of 19 million was allocated to the former cgu
asia pacific

tnt express pension expense is affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations
management reviews these and other assumptions every year measurement date for tnt express
postemployment benefits is 31 december changes in assumptions may occur as a result of economic
and market conditions if actual results differ from those assumed this will generate actuarial gains or
losses

ias 19r employee benefits requires an entity to determine the rates used to discount employee benefit
obligations with reference to market yields on highquality corporate bonds the first step of the process
is to identify a set of bonds that accurately reflects the relationship between yield and remaining time to
maturity for highquality corporate bonds for this tnt express uses the iboxx aarated corporate
bond universe using the bond selection regression analysis is used to find the bestfitting curve that
states yieldtomaturity as a function of remaining time to maturity the nelsonsiegel model is applied
to fit the curve towards tnt express 22year duration the resulting discount rate per 31 december
2013 was 39 2012 39

the expected return on plan assets equals the used discount rate

assumptions regarding future mortality are based on advice published statistics and experience per
country the average life expectancy of men after retiring at the average age of 67 is 20 years 2012
22 the equivalent life expectancy for women is 22 years 2012 24

the domestic air network in india in 2012 and in 2013 a reduction in ftes in the united kingdom due to
the discontinuation of a major fashion contract and to further restructuring the average number of ftes
relating to discontinued operations amounted to 7527 2012 8457

    after the grant
 for each bonus share that is sold within three years the associated right to one matching phantom
    share lapses if more than 50 of the bonus shares is sold within three years the entire right to

oneoff investmentmatching plan
in 2011 before the demerger of the express activities in order to align the objectives of members of the
executive board and senior management with longterm value creation and the interests of
shareholders the supervisory board of tnt nv decided to apply a voluntary oneoff
investmentmatching plan in which the cash proceeds from the unwinding of the tnt nv
bonusmatching plan performance share plan and option plan could  post demerger  be invested in
tnt express nv shares the participants in these plans could elect to invest from their net proceeds
an amount equal to 25 or 50 of their total gross unwindingrelated sum but not more than the net
proceeds thereof in tnt express shares on the same date these shares in the plan called
investment shares were purchased the participant received free of charge a matching right on
phantom shares representing the value in cash of half of the number of investment shares matching on
a 1 05 basis this matching right will vest and the cash value of the phantom shares comprising the
matching right will be paid after three years provided that the participant has remained an employee
throughout and still owns at least 50 of hisher investment shares if prior to vesting the participant
sold more than half of hisher investment shares the matching right will forfeit in full and if the
participant sold 50 or fewer of hisher investment shares the number of phantom shares comprising
the matching right will be reduced proportionally

from the cash sum invested the shares are purchased on euronext amsterdam 2 august 2011
average purchase price of 768share

performance share plan
2013 grant
on 30 april 2013 the first grant under the tnt express performance share plan occurred for a selected
group of senior managers the number of shares comprised in the share award reflects the position that
the participant holds and managements assessment of hisher future contribution to the company

the performance shares vest after a threeyear period upon continued employment the actual number
of shares that vest depends on the performance of the following performance measures
 50 financial target the total shareholder return tsr performance of the company measured on
     a threeyear basis against a peer group of companies full aex
 50 nonfinancial targets customers employees and sustainability measured on an annual basis

the actual number of 2013 performance shares that will vest at the vesting date will be determined by
the tsr performance over the period 2013 to 2016 and the performance on the nonfinancial targets
over three calendar years preceding the vesting date

the maximum number of shares that can vest under the plan amounts to 100 of the base allocation

the total costs incurred in 2013 for the 2013 grant amount in total to 1283645 and are based on a
fair value of 449 per share as the average of a fair value of 323 per share for the tsr and 575 per
share for the nonfinancial elements these total costs are based on the assumption of a 78 average
probability of meeting the nonfinancial targets

the fair value of the 50 tsr portion has been measured using the monte carlo fair value
measurement method the fair value of the 50 nonfinancial portion is derived form the share price at
euronext amsterdam at the grant date 30 april 2013 583 corrected for the dividend yield for the
threeyear vesting period significant assumptions used in the calculations are as follows

2012 compensation grant
due to the intended merger with ups the 2012 grant of performance shares did not take place in 2013
the supervisory board decided to provide for a limited 2012 compensation grant by excluding the 50
grant value related to the tsr performance of the company as a result the grant value of this
compensation grant is only based on the value 50 that in the regular grant is related to the
performance of the company on the nonfinancial targets

for the 2012 compensation grant the following specific rules apply
 the regular threeyear vesting period is shortened to two years
 the actual number of awarded compensation shares is adjusted for the 2012 achievement of the
     nonfinancial targets being 6667 and
 the vesting of the awarded compensation shares is contingent on continued employment at the
     vesting date

taking into account the current performance of and the major restructurings within the company mr
gunning and mr bot have decided to fully waive any of their 2013 shortterm incentive entitlements

bonusmatching share plan
in 2013 appointed members of the executive board could on a voluntary basis participate in the
bonusmatching plan by investing a maximum of 50 of the gross payout of the shortterm incentive of
the previous year however the investment in tnt express shares cannot be more than the net
proceeds of the bonus after a threeyear holding period these shares will be matched on a onetoone
basis and settled in shares

in the event that the company results target is met every year during this threeyear holding period a
maximum additional match will be made on a onetotwo basis resulting in a total award of three
matching shares if the performance is below the company results target there is no delivery of
additional matching shares for that specific year

the matching of bonus shares occurs under the condition of continued employment and if at least 50
of the bonusmatching shares is retained during the holding period

in 2013 only the cfo was eligible for participation in the bonusmatching plan mr bot invested the
maximum net proceeds of his 2012 bonus as allowed under the plan being in total 48000 from this
amount 8140 shares were purchased on euronext amsterdam 4 june 2013 average purchase price of
590share the granted matching right comprises three times the number of purchased shares

the costs incurred for the plan in 2013 amount in total to 33906 and are based on the fair value per
share and the following assumptions
 the holding period criterium will be fully met taking into account the relevant period lapsed 8
   months from the total threeyear vesting period and
 an average probability of 90 during the holding period that the company results target is met every
   year multiplied with the factor 1241 representing the relevant period lapsed

the fair value per share of 578 is derived from the share price at euronext amsterdam at the grant
date 4 june 2013 578 corrected for a dividend yield for the threeyear vesting period

oneoff investmentmatching plan
in 2011 before the demerger of the express activities the supervisory board of tnt nv decided to
apply a voluntary oneoff investmentmatching plan in which the cash proceeds from the unwinding of
the tnt nv bonusmatching plan performance share plan and option plan could  postdemerger  be
invested in tnt express nv shares in order to align the objectives of members of the executive board
and senior management with longterm value creation and the interests of shareholders refer to note

the 2013 grant of performance shares for the members of the executive board was based on a value of
30 of their annual base compensation the actual number of rights to shares granted is determined by
dividing the available amount 30 of the annual base compensation by the fair value of the right to a
share according to ifrs

at the time of the grant mr gunning was not yet a member of the executive board and therefore not
eligible for the 2013 grant

2012 compensation grant
due to the intended merger with ups the 2012 grant of performance shares did not take place in 2013
the supervisory board decided to provide for a limited 2012 compensation grant by excluding the grant
value related to the tsr performance of the company 50 weight the grant value of this
compensation grant was therefore only based on the value that related to the performance of the
company on nonfinancial targets 50 weight for the 2012 compensation grant specific rules apply
refer to note 18 for more details this resulted in a grant of 10 of the annual base compensation for
each of the members of the executive board 30 annual base compensation x 50 grant value
related to nonfinancial targets x 2012 performance score on nonfinancial targets of 6667 the
actual number of rights to shares granted is determined by dividing the available amount 10 of the
annual base compensation by the fair value of the right to a share according to ifrs

mr gunning was not eligible for this compensation award since he was not a member of the executive
board in 2012

amortisation and impairment charges sharebased payment expenses results from investments in
associates foreign exchange gains and losses investments in property plant and equipment financed
via financial leases book results on sale of property plant and equipment and changes in provisions

24 net cash from operating activities 397 million 2012 359
in 2013 the net cash from operating activities increased by 38 million from 359 million in 2012 to
397 million

cash generated from operations
the cash generated from operations increased from 446 million in 2012 to 514 million in 2013 in
2013 the profit before income taxes contributed 41 million or 478 million 2012 403 adjusted for the
noncash impact of depreciation amortisation impairments and sharebased payments this is 75
million higher than 2012 and is mainly due to the receipt of the ups termination fee of 200 million and
miscellaneous items of 18 million offset by a decrease in operating income adjusted for the noncash
impact of depreciation amortisation and impairment primarily related to europe main of 143 million

the change in net pension liabilities of 7 million in 2013 2012 22 reflects the total tnt express
noncash employer pension expense for the postemployment defined benefit plans of 29 million
2012 24 compared to the total tnt express cash contributions to various postemployment defined
benefit plans for a total amount of 36 million 2012 46 of which 1 million is related to a recovery
payment for the defined benefit plans in the netherlands the cash contributions have been lowered for
the reclassification of the italian tfr plan provision for pension liabilities to other current liabilities for
agreed redundancies not yet paid

in 2013 there was a net cash inflow presented of 64 million in other provisions compared to a net cash
outflow of 13 million in 2012 this was mainly due to the addition to the other provisions of 120 million
mainly restructuring offset by utilisation of the restructuring and other provisions and the transfer of the
provisions related to brazil domestic to liabilities related to assets held for disposal as at the end of the
first quarter

million 2012 8 are included for shortterm debt of which 3 million 2012 6 is due to cash pools that
are offset against the interest received and for interest on foreign currency hedges of 16 million 2012
19 and interest paid on taxes of 1 million 2012 0 the decrease in interest on foreign currency
hedges was mainly caused by lower interest rate differentials between currencies in foreign exchange
forward contracts

the interest paid and received on notional cash pools are reported on a gross basis in accordance with
ifrs from an economic and legal perspective the 3 million 2012 6 interest paid fully nets off against
the 4 million 2012 6 interest received the amounts are not netted in the income statement and cash
flow statement because under ifrs such offset needs in practice to be irreversibly exercised from time
to time

similarly the interest paid and received on various foreign currency derivatives have been aggregated
on a gross basis while economically the 5 million of interest received 2012 6 is offset against the
16 million 2012 19 of interest paid on hedges

income taxes paid

25 net cash used in investing activities 40 million 2012 81

shortterm bank balances and deposits of 5 million 2012 8 of which 4 million 2012 6 is due to

million 2012 6 and interest received on taxes of 0 million 2012 0

risks arise in the normal course of business to manage market risks tnt express uses a variety of
financial derivatives




                                                                                                          123

the tables within this note provide quantitative information regarding tnt express exposure to the
financial risks mentioned above there are certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses
presented primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a parallel fashion and instantaneously
while at the same time for example the impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures
and vice versa is ignored in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions
that normally would arise from the market shifts assumed

tnt express uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging exposures the
company enters into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with
its underlying exposures and does not take positions independent of these exposures none of these
financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take speculative positions

financial risk management is carried out by the tnt express treasury department under policies
approved by the executive board the tnt express treasury department identifies evaluates and
hedges financial risk in close cooperation with operating units the executive board provides written
principles for overall risk management as well as written policies covering specific areas such as
interest rate risk foreign exchange risk credit risk and liquidity risk periodic reporting on financial risks
has been embedded in the overall risk framework and has been provided to the executive board in a
structural way

interest rate risk
part of tnt express borrowings and leases are against floating interest rates these floating interest
rates may fluctuate substantially and could have a material adverse effect on tnt express financial
results in any given reporting period borrowings that are issued at variable rates expose the company
to cash flow volatility from movements in interest rates borrowings that are issued at fixed rates expose
the company to fair value interest rate risk tnt express financial assets are on average of such short
term nature that they bear no significant fair value interest rate risk but do cause cash flow interest rate
risks group policy is to significantly limit the impact of interest fluctuations over a term of seven years
as a percentage of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation at 31 december
2013 tnt express gross interest bearing borrowings including finance lease obligations totalled 221
million 2012 236 of which 161 million 2012 187 was at a fixed interest rate

although tnt express generally enters into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives in
order to attempt to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations these measures may be inadequate
or may subject the company to increased operating or financing costs

at 31 december 2013 if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1 higher with
other variables held constant the profit before income tax would have been 7 million higher 2012 4
and equity would be impacted by 10 million 2012 9 due to the outstanding interest rate swaps with
a nominal value of us199 million refer to note 30

foreign currency exchange risk
tnt express operates on an international basis generating foreign currency exchange risks arising from
future commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities investments and divestments in foreign
currencies other than the euro tnt express functional and reporting currency these significant
operational foreign currency cash flow risks are mostly not hedged tnt express treasury department
matches and manages the intragroup and external financial exposures although the company generally
enters into hedging arrangements and other contracts in order to reduce its exposure to currency
fluctuations these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to increased operating or
financing costs

the two main noneuro currencies of tnt express are the british pound and us dollar of which the
2013 exchange rates to the euro are shown in the following table

credit risk
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if counterparties with whom tnt express
enters into financial transactions are unable to fulfil the terms of the agreements credit risk arises from
cash and cash equivalents derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as
credit exposures relating to customers the company attempts to minimise its credit risk exposure by
only transacting with financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines and by managing its
customers portfolio tnt express continually monitors the credit standing of financial counterparties
and its customers individual risk limits are set on internal and external ratings in accordance with limits
set by the executive board the utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored at balance sheet date
there were no significant concentrations of credit risk related to customers the top ten customers of
tnt express account for 2 of the outstanding trade receivables at 31 december 2013

liquidity risk
prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash the availability of funding through
an adequate amount of undrawn committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions
due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses tnt express attempts to maintain flexibility in
funding by keeping committed credit lines available

tnt express has central availability to the following undrawn committed facilities

capital structure management
it is the objective of tnt express when managing the capital structure to safeguard its ability to continue
as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and
to maintain an optimal capital structure tnt express capital structure is managed along the following
components
 an investment grade credit rating at bbb by sp and baa1 by moodys
 an availability of at least 400 million to 500 million of undrawn committed facilities
 cash pooling systems facilitating optimised cash requirements for the group and
 a tax optimal internal and external funding focused at optimising the cost of capital for the group
     within longterm sustainable boundaries

tnt express credit ratings per 31 december 2013 are bbb stable by sp and baa2 negative by
moodys the rating agencies have removed the positive outlooks on our ratings in january 2013
following the withdrawal of the offer by ups a downgrade in the credit rating of tnt express may
negatively affect its ability to obtain funds from financial institutions retain investors and banks and
increase its financing costs by increasing the interest rates of its outstanding debt or the interest rates at
which the company is able to refinance existing debt or incur new debt this could affect its return for
shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders

the terms and conditions of tnt express material shortterm and longterm debts as well as its
material drawn or undrawn committed credit facilities do not include any financial covenants there
are also no possibilities to accelerate these material debts and committed facilities in case of a credit
rating downgrade the debt and credit facility instruments vary on a case by case basis and mostly
contain customary clauses as are generally observed in the market such as negative pledge conditions
restrictions on the use of the proceeds of the sale of assets or businesses and in most cases change
of control clauses

audit of the financial statements of our report we are independent of the company within the meaning
of the relevant dutch ethical requirements as included in the verordening op de gedrags en
beroepsregels accountants vgba and the verordeninginzake de onafhankelijkheid van
accountantsbijassuranceopdrachten vio and have fulfilled our other responsibilities under those
ethical requirements

we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion

the key audit matters from our audit
key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements key audit matters are selected from the matters communicated with
the supervisory board of tnt express nv but are not intended to represent all matters that were
discussed with them our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our
audit of the financial statements as a whole our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with
respect to any of the key audit matters described below and we do not express an opinion on these
individual matters

assets of tnt brazil classified as held for disposal
the assets and liabilities of tnt brazil are reported as an asset held for disposal on the balance sheet
and presented as a discontinued operation in the income statement as of the first quarter in 2013 a
specific disclosure is included in note 8 to the financial statements the valuation and the intention to
sell assumption related to this entity are significant to the financial statements and our audit

this involves management judgment given the nature of the business and the related negotiations
concerning the disposal on 30 january 2014 tnt express nv announced that it would retain its
brazilian domestic business as part of our procedures we considered the accounting treatment as well
as the disclosure as a subsequent event in note 35

                                                                                                   chapter 5



strategic initiatives
the company is currently engaged in a number of strategic initiatives most notably the deliver
programme these initiatives impacted our audit as follows
 the new reportable structure resulted in a change in reportable segments under ifrs 8 refer to
   note 34 to the financial statements
 the company announced a number of restructuring initiatives during the year in our audit we
   addressed the appropriateness and timely recognition of costs and provisions in accordance with
   ias 37 these recognition criteria are detailed and depend upon local communication and country
   specific labour circumstances we refer to note 11 to the financial statements
 we have identified an increased risk in the companys control environment in areas where these
   organisational changes took place and specifically discussed this risk managements mitigating
   actions and our observations with the companys executive board and audit committee we refer to
   chapter 4 section v risk management

sensitivities with respect to the valuation of goodwill
as a result of changes to the organisational structure the company performed a goodwill impairment
test during the second quarter of 2013 which led to an impairment charge of 296 million subsequently
during the 2013 fourthquarter closing process the annual goodwill impairment test was performed
resulting in sufficient headroom concerning the carrying value of goodwill the assumptions and
sensitivities in the 2013 fourthquarter impairment test are disclosed in note 1 to the financial
statements these impairment tests are significant to our audit because the assessment process is
complex and requires management judgement and is based on assumptions that are affected by
expected future market conditions as a result our audit procedures included amongst others using a
valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by tnt express
nv in particular those relating to the forecast revenue growth and the weighted average cost of capital
for various cash generating units we also focused on the adequacy of the companys disclosures
regarding those assumptions

airplanes reclassified to fixed assets
two boeing 747 freighters were reclassified from assets held for disposal to property plant and
equipment because a disposal under acceptable conditions was no longer viable this changes the
underlying valuation from fair value to carrying value in the financial statements as disclosed in note 8 to
the financial statements during our audit we identified this valuation risk and performed procedures
focused on the timely reclassification and valuation of the airplanes we reviewed independent valuation
reports which support the valuation of these airplanes

assumptions and forecasts underlying valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax
positions
the group operates in various countries with local tax regulations the country specific tax risks are a
significant risk in our audit as these could entail potential material amounts due our procedures
included amongst others the involvement of tax specialists tnt express has disclosed the tax risks in
note 28 to the financial statements

the company has recorded deferred tax assets in the financial statements resulting from temporary
differences and losses carried forward of 198 million as disclosed in note 23 to the financial
statements the company recognises these deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered the realisation probability is
impacted by uncertainties regarding the realisation of such benefits including the expiration date of
losses and future taxable income our audit procedures included amongst others evaluating
assumptions and methodologies used by the company to determine the recoverable amount per
country

risk of management override of internal controls
the company operates in multiple jurisdictions and is subject to the risk of management override of
controls in order to address this risk the company has established a comprehensive governance
structure as detailed in chapter 4 of the annual report in our audit we performed procedures which
allow us to rely to the extent possible on managements governance structure we also perform
additional audit procedures designed to identify the risk of management override of controls these
procedures included amongst others an assessment of the toneatthetop budget to actual analysis
consideration of bonus schemes assessment of internal control deficiencies followup on whistleblower
allegations revenue recognition and cost cut off procedures as well as examination of manual journal
entries we also maintained unpredictability in our audits and made specific enquiries at different levels
in the organisation to establish consistency




                                                                                                        144

                                                                                                   chapter 5



our findings with respect to going concern
the financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting the use of
this basis of accounting is appropriate unless management either intends to liquidate tnt express nv
or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so


as part of our audit of the financial statements we concur with managements use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements


management has not identified a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the ability of to
continue as a going concern and accordingly none is disclosed in the financial statements based on
our audit of the financial statements we also have not identified such a material uncertainty

however neither management nor the auditor can guarantee the companys ability to continue as a
going concern

responsibilities of the executive board and the supervisory board for the financial
statements
the executive board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european
union and with part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code and for the preparation of the executive board
report as set out on pages 3 to 23 pages 41 to 52 and pages 62 to 68 in accordance with part 9 of book
2 of the dutch civil code furthermore the executive board is responsible for such internal control as
the executive board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that
are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error the supervisory board is
responsible for overseeing the companys financial reporting process

our responsibility for the audit of the financial statements
the objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors
report that includes our opinion reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the dutch standards on auditing will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements

as part of an audit in accordance with dutch standards on auditing we exercise professional judgement
and maintain professional scepticism throughout the planning and performance of the audit we also
 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to
   fraud or error design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit
   evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting
   a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may
   involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal
   control
 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
   that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
   effectiveness of the entitys internal control
 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
   estimates and related disclosures made by management
 evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements including the
   disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events
   in a manner that achieves fair presentation
 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of tnt express nv
   and business activities within tnt express nv to express an opinion on the financial statements
   we are responsible for the direction supervision and performance of the group audit we remain
   solely responsible for our audit opinion

we are required to communicate with the supervisory board regarding among other matters the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies
in internal control that we identify during our audit

we are also required to provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable
related safeguards




                                                                                                        145

notes to the environmental performance

9 co2 emissions absolute
for sector comparison purposes the co2 footprint according to the greenhouse gas protocol
corporate standard revised 2004 can be reported in three categories

       scope 1 covers all direct emissions generated by sources that are owned or controlled by the
        company such as operational vehicles aviation and heating
       scope 2 includes all emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the
        company
       scope 3 refers to indirect emissions that are a consequence of the companys activities but occur
        from sources not owned or controlled by the company

gri g4s increased focus on materiality led to the decision by tnt express to exclude the co2
emissions from company cars and business travel by air from its reporting

tnt express subcontractor co2 emissions scope 3 decreased by 29 to 1268 ktonnes which was
mainly caused by the reduction of road linehaul in australia and reduction of subcontractor air activities
the subcontractor co2 emission is calculated based on secondary indicators such as kilometres driven
and costs because of the unavailability of primary data fuel consumption of subcontractor activities

the co2 efficiency for tnt express european air network and long haul flights improved due to higher
load factors and the use of relatively fuelefficient boeing 777 freighters for the entire year only 9
months in 2012

at the end of 2013 tnt express operated 50 aircraft since 2012 tnt express air operations are
included in the eu emission trading scheme eu ets the eu ets aims to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by putting a price on carbon and includes all flights arriving at or departing from any
european union airport the co2 emission of tnt express flights subject to eu ets was 664 ktonnes

improved network optimisation and positive changes in capacity load factors tnt express recognises
that an adjustment is required to the efficiency indicator to adequately reflect network efficiencies

assurance report
to the executive board of tnt express nv

our opinion and conclusion on the corporate responsibility chapters
our engagement consists of a combination of audit and review procedures on the content of chapter 3
and section ii of chapter 5 and the annexes in the annual report of tnt express nv amsterdam
referred to as cr chapters we recommend reading our complete assurance report for a
comprehensive understanding of our opinion and conclusion

based on our audit procedures in our opinion
 the data and graphs as included in the cr chapters and marked with a rhombus  as
   mentioned in our audit procedures are in all material respects presented reliably and adequately in
   accordance with the tnt express nv reporting criteria

based on our review procedures we conclude that
 concerning the other elements of the cr chapters nothing has come to our attention that would
   cause us to conclude that the cr chapters in all material respects do not provide a reliable and
   adequate presentation of the corporate responsibility policy of tnt express or of the corporate
   responsibility related performance during the reporting year in accordance with tnt express
   reporting criteria

the responsibilities of the executive board and our responsibilities
the executive board of tnt express nv is responsible for the preparation of the cr chapters in
accordance with the reporting criteria

we are responsible for providing an assurance report on the cr chapters included in the annual report
based on our audit and review procedures

what we have audited and reviewed
we have examined the content of the cr chapters in which tnt express nv renders account of its
performance related to corporate responsibility in 2013


our examination consisted of the following combination of audit and review procedures
 audit of data and tables as included in the annual report related to the following key performance
   indicators
     number of employees and fulltime equivalents employed
     workplace fatal accidents and road traffic blameworthy fatal accidents own
     losttime accidents per 100 fte
     absenteeism  of total standard working hours
     co2 emissions absolute of own operations scope 1 and 2 of the greenhouse gas protocol
     co2 efficiency of own fleet split into network flights long haul air large trucks and small trucks
      and vans
     co2 efficiency buildings and
     percentage of sustainable electricity
 review of all the other elements included in the cr chapters of the annual report


we do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and feasibility of prospective information such as
targets expectations and ambitions included in the sustainability information


the tnt express nv corporate responsibility reporting criteria
tnt express nv developed its reporting criteria on the basis of the g4 guidelines of the global
reporting initiative gri as mentioned on the pages 163 to 164 of the annual report the reporting
criteria as developed by tnt express nv contain certain inherent limitations which may influence the
reliability of the information the cr chapters do not cover the information for all entities of tnt express
nv as the cr chapters only includes data from entities that are fullyowned or majorityowned and
from those jointventures where tnt express nv has a controlling interest with respect to corporate
responsibility this is adequately disclosed on page 163 corporate responsibility reporting scope

we consider the reporting criteria to be relevant and sufficient for our examination




                                                                                                        165

                                                                                              statements
                                                                                               chapter 5



the basis for our opinion and conclusion
we planned and performed our work in accordance with dutch law including standard 3410n
assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports

audit procedures focus on obtaining reasonable assurance substantiated by sufficient and appropriate
supporting audit evidence the audited data are marked with a rhombus  review procedures focus
on obtaining limited assurance which does not require exhaustive gathering of evidence therefore
providing less assurance than audit procedures consequently we report our conclusions with respect
to the audit and review procedures separately we believe these combined procedures fulfil a rational
objective

audit procedures
with regard to the audited data among others we have gathered audit evidence from the following
procedures
 performing an external environment analysis and obtaining insight into the industry relevant social
   issues relevant laws and regulations and the characteristics of the organisation
 assessing and testing the systems and processes used for data gathering consolidation and
   validation including the methods used for calculating and estimating results
 testing the design existence and the effectiveness of the relevant internal control measures during
   the reporting period
 reconciling reported data to internal and external source documentation
 examining the existence and validity of certificates issued in respect of the management system
   standards which have been adopted by tnt express and
 performing analytical procedures relation checks and detailed checks

review procedures
our most important review procedures are
 assessing the acceptability and consistent application of the reporting policies in relation to the
   information requirements of tnt express stakeholders
 reviewing internal and external documentation to determine whether the information in the cr
   chapters is substantiated adequately
 validating and testing of the model used for estimating the co2emissions of subcontractors
 evaluating the overall presentation of the cr chapters in line with tnt express reporting criteria
   and
 assessing whether the sustainability information has been prepared in accordance with the gri g4
   guidelines

we believe that the evidence obtained from our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion and our conclusion
