we have built new buildings which consume 50 less energy and 40             few years we plan to do this through a variety of offset programs in

systems with the help of this granular data we identified potential

is less than three years while that for uninterruptible power supply
ups systems is just over four years we have built a very strong
practice of smart building solutions which gives us realtime control

our water sustainability strategy across campuses includes reducing

our aim is to make our campuses water sustainable we have reduced                             every new building on our campus follows integrated design methods
our per capita fresh water consumption by 18 and our total fresh                              to maximize daylight and minimize heat efficient building envelopes

emissions
emissions are categorized as direct and indirect by the ghg protocol
based on the following criteria 
 we have identified operational control as the basis to determine
  our scope of emissions
 direct ghg emissions are emissions from sources that are owned
  or controlled by the reporting entity
 indirect ghg emissions are emissions that are a consequence of
  the activities of the reporting entity but occur at sources owned or
  controlled by another entity                                                                              200708 200809 200910 201011 201112

emissions into three broad scopes  scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3                              nox and sox emissions

for rinsing                                                                    gambles lifecycle assessment of its detergent product uncovered

second it looks at making products truly green to eliminate emissions
                                                                               of electricity to reduce the footprint they created a detergent which
and reduce environmental impact for example internal combustion

engines in cars are now being replaced with batterypowered ones
                                                                               widen perspective  taking a larger system perspective helps identify

a few key principles can enhance the success of green innovation               fields are suited for co2 storage companies are investing and taking
efforts                                                                       practical action a business benefit is that pumping co2 into oil and
radically reduce resource intensity  an important indicator of resource       gas fields can be designed to push extra oil and gas to production
dependency is resource intensity which is the amount of resources             wells helping enhanced oil recovery
energy oil material or water used to produce unit output exploring        benchmarking for differentiation  focused performance benchmarking
innovative ways to reduce resource intensity is imperative eliminating        and transparency in sustainability can help foster trust and provide
resource usage instead of reducing usage reclaiming value from waste         differentiation for example patagonia launched the footprint
digitizing and dematerializing exploring resource sharing as a business      chronicles an interactive minisite to allow consumers to track the
model designing for reuse exploring alternate and greener resource           social and environmental impact of specific patagonia products from
usage and localization can all lead to radical deintensification            design through delivery this transparency helped build trust and
collaborative innovation  challenges in social and environmental              position them as leaders
sustainability are too interconnected and complex for one sector or            this wave of green innovation presents immense opportunity for
organization to address independently collaborations across supply           businesses like ours to play a leading role in driving innovation and in
chains businesses and industry sectors and with employees and                leveraging it to differentiate grow and prosper
consumers can lead to innovations with a far greater impact than
localized innovation for example walmart built a network with
employees nonprofits government agencies and suppliers to green
its supply chains spurring innovation in areas such as materials
processes supply chains and engineering

our server room monitoring solution is a costeffective environmental    and airconditioning engineers ashrae recommendations using
monitoring solution for realtime monitoring of key environmental        this solution it is possible to closely monitor temperature and humidity
parameters in enterprise server rooms it provides information           and maintain them at upper limits of the ashrae recommendations
and alerts for organizations to take corrective action when key          this will result in savings of 15 to 20 of energy used for cooling
environmental parameters are offthreshold limits it helps cut down     we have 105 server rooms which host servers routers and other
