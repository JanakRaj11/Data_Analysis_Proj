rethinking the box with advanced
bay boxtm
valvoline continually seeks new ways to make oil changes easier faster and
more cost effective with the advanced bay boxtm valvolines latest bag and
box motor oil packaging system weve set a new standard redesigned box

help installers to distinguish between products the redesign will also simplify
box breakdown for easier disposal and recycling once the product is empty
better product flow and waste minimization will be achieved through an
integrated funneling system and an angled rack design

a customizable and modular rack design will allow for setups that can
accommodate any service bay size and shape and even better the rack

the atmosphere annually


emergency preparedness
valvolines historically limited environmental impacts are attributable to our long
term commitment of continual improvement in our prevention and preparedness
programs for over twenty years we have invested significant resources in these
programs including tank upgrades the relocation of underground piping and
tanks to aboveground locations and the installation of secondary containment
systems and high level alarms our storage vessels and piping are visually
inspected on a regular basis with more extensive tank integrity testing conducted
in accordance with our internal and external api standards our preparedness

part of our culture our sites actively pursue source reduction reuse recycling
and recovering materials we have challenged the sites to move waste streams to
recycling or to eliminate them through our source reduction program as even the
