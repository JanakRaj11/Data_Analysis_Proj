product stewardship
product stewardship is an integral part of sustainability at cytec it
encompasses the responsible and ethical management of our products
throughout the product lifecycle our product stewardship initiatives also
span the value chain from our suppliers of raw materials to our customers
extending down the value chain to the ultimate finished article

compliance
the foundation of our product stewardship program is global product
regulatory compliance we built and maintain a centralized database for
all product related data and global processes we assess the potential
hazards of our products and communicate safe handling information to
our employees and customers no matter where they are located our
active safety data sheets sds and labels are available in 34 formats and
22 languages including chinese japanese and korean while we focus
on chemical inventory management on a local basis this is done with
oversight and vision to make the best use of available data to allow our      coatings are used in various applications such as wood
products to enter new markets                                                flooring cabinets and appliances

hazard assessment                                                             product sustainability metrics
cytec strives to help our customers have the appropriate product              in order to improve in the area of product sustainability cytec formed a
stewardship attributes to safely handle and use our products to this end    crossfunctional team to develop metrics for sustainability of our products
we have developed a riskbased process that focuses on product hazard        and to develop a baseline for new products our cims process allows the
customer programs and practices where needed customer product               determination of environmental friendliness using chemicals modeling as
stewardship training is provided a prime example is the proactive            part of the stagegate process use of epa sustainable futures models as
development of product stewardship training for customersdistributors        well as others allows us to rate the health and environmental hazards and
handling our eco2fume and vaphor3phos fumigants the training               potential risks of our products in a qualitative manner as such we get an
included classroom as well as handson product training before customers      early indication of the environmental aspects of a potential new product
could use the product similar safe handling guides have been developed             for existing products we are looking at the hazards and
