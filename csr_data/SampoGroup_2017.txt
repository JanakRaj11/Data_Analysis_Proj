             a good year in spite of political surprises
       many people were taken by surprise in 2016  including us at sampo however in spite of
                           this we were able to report very good results

sector or at the very least the postponement of new             regulation without an explicit mechanism and goals
plans for additional regulation the outcome of this            for deregulation there is not a chance for europe to

the new solvency ii regulation that was applied with           finland and norway into the parent company nordea

operation as we had been preparing for it for many             in denmark finland and norway are now conducted
years furthermore our solvency level clearly exceeds         via local branches this increases agility and reduces
minimum regulatory requirements consequently no              bureaucracy  two characteristics that customers

testing goodwill for impairment

goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with ias 36 impairment of assets no impairment losses have been recognised
based on these tests


for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment sampo determines the recoverable amount of its cashgenerating units to
which goodwill has been allocated on the basis of value in use sampo has defined these cashgenerating units as if group and
mandatum life


the recoverable amounts for if have been determined by using a discounted cash flow model the model is based on sampos
managements best estimates of both historical evidence and economic conditions such as volumesinterest rates margins capital
structure and income and cost development the value in use model for mandatum life is greatly influenced by the longterm
development of insurance liabilities affecting eg the required solvency capital and thus the recoverable amount that is why the
forecast period is longer for mandatum life 10 years the derived cash flows were discounted at the pretax rates of the weighted
average cost of capital which for if was 72 and for mandatum life 76 these are lower than last year due to the decrease in the
interest rates of nordic bonds


forecasts for if approved by the management cover years 2017  2019 the cash flows beyond that have been extrapolated using
a 2 growth rate a 2 growth rate for years beyond 2026 has been used for the for mandatum life as well as it is believed to be
close to the anticipated inflation


in mandatum life the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by some eurm 410 with the calculation method used
eg an increase of about 2 in the weighted average cost of capital could lead to a situation where the recoverable amount of the
entity would equal its carrying amount


as for the if group the management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would not
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount

available the fair value is assessed using discounting method values for the discount rates are taken from the markets yield
curve

option pricing models

17 determination and hierarchy of fair values

a large majority of sampo groups financial assets are valued at fair value the valuation is based on either published price
quatations or valuation techniques based on market observable inputs where available for a limited amount of assets the value
needs to be determined using other techniques the financial instruments measured at fair value have been classified into three
hierarchy levels in the notes depending on eg if the market for the instrument is active or if the inputs used in the valuation
technique are observable

on level 1 the measurement of the instrument is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

on level 2 inputs for the measurement of the instrument include also other than quoted prices observable for the asset or liability
either directly or indirectly by using valuation techniques

in level 3 the measurement is based on other inputs rather than observable market data

the figures include the financial assets classified as assets held for sale

since january 1 2008 the main swedish pension plan has been closed to new employees born in 1972 or later and the
corresponding norwegian pension plan has been closed to new employees since january 1 2006 regardless of age in may 2015 if
decided that all employees born in 1958 or later that were covered by the norwegian definedbenefit pension plan would be
switched to a definedcontribution plan as of january 2016 as of the same date it was also decided that existing retirees would
no longer be covered by the plan and that future retirees would cease being covered by the plan when they are no longer
employed by if accordingly the norwegian pension plan now consists solely of active people employed prior to 2006 and born no
later than 1957


the pension benefits referred to are oldage pension and survivors pension in sweden for norway oldage pension and
survivors pension are included as well as disability pension up to july 1 2016 following an amendment to the plan all
employees will instead be covered by a definedcontribution plan for disability pension a common feature of the definedbenefit
plans is that the employees and survivors encompassed by the plans are entitled to a guaranteed pension that depends on the
employees service period and pensionable salary at the time of retirement the dominating benefit is the oldage pension which
refers in part to temporary pension before the anticipated retirement age and in part to a lifelong pension after the anticipated
retirement age


the retirement age for receiving premature pension is normally 62 years in sweden and normally 65 years in norway in sweden
premature oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 65 of the pensionable salary
and applies to all employees born in 1955 or earlier and who were covered by the insurance sectors collective bargaining
agreement of 2006 in norway premature oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70 of the pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1957 or earlier and who were employed by if in
2013


the anticipated retirement age in connection with lifelong pension is 65 years for sweden and 67 years for norway in sweden
lifelong oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 10 of the pensionable salary
between 0 and 75 income base amounts 65 of salary between 75 and 20 income base amounts and 325 between 20 and 30
income base amounts in norway lifelong oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70 of the pensionable salary up to 12 national insurance base amounts together with the estimated statutory old
age pension paidup policies and pension payments from the swedish plans are normally indexed upwards in an amount
corresponding to the change in the consumer price index however there is no agreement guaranteeing the value and future
supplements in addition to the contractual pension benefit could either rise of fall pension payments from the norwegian plans
are were earlier indexed upwards in an amount corresponding to 80 100 of the change in the consumer price index instead as
of january 2016 a paidup policy is issued on retirement whereby if is no longer responsible for and has no obligation in respect
of future indexation of the insured plans


the pensions are primarily funded through insurance whereby the insurers establish the premiums and disburse the benefits ifs
obligation is primarily fulfilled through payment of the premiums should the assets that are attributable to the pension benefits
not be sufficient to enable the insurers to cover the guaranteed pension benefits if could be forced to pay supplementary
insurance premiums or secure the pension obligations in some other way in addition to insured pension plans there are also
unfunded pension benefits in norway for which if is responsible for ongoing payment


to cover the insured pension benefits the related capital is managed as part of the insurers management portfolios in such
management the characteristics of the investment assets are analyzed in relation to the characteristics of the obligations in a
process known as asset liability management new and existing asset categories are evaluated continuously in order to diversify
the asset portfolios with a view to optimizing the anticipated riskadjusted return any surplus that arises from management of the
assets normally accrues to if andor the insured and there is no form of transfer of the asset value to other members of the
insurance collective


the insurers and if are jointly responsible for monitoring the pension plans including investment decisions and contributions the
pension plans are essentially exposed to similar material risks regarding the final amount of the benefits the investment risk
associated with the plan assets and the fact that the choice of discount interest rate affects their valuation in the financial
statements


when applying ias 19 the pension obligations are calculated as is the pension cost attributable to the fiscal period using
actuarial methods pension rights are considered to have been vested straight line during the service period the calculation of
pension obligations is based on future anticipated pension payments and includes assumptions regarding mortality employee
turnover and salary growth the nominally calculated obligation is discounted to the present value using interest rates based on
the extrapolated yieldcurves in sweden and in norway for aaa and aa corporate bonds including mortgagebacked bonds as at
30 november approximately updated to reflect market conditions middecember the discount rate chosen takes into account the
duration of the companys pension obligations after a deduction for the plan assets a net asset or net liability is recognized in the
balance sheet


the following tables contain a number of material assumptions specifications of pension costs assets and liabilities and a
sensitivity analysis showing the potential effect on the obligations of reasonable changes in those assumptions as at the end of the
fiscal year as apparent from the tables the said amendments to the insured plan in norway have been taken into account when
preparing the annual accounts for 2015 and had a material impact on both recognized costs and assets and obligations


the carrying amounts have been stated including special payroll tax in sweden 2426 and a corresponding fee in norway

im and on sampos return on the risk adjusted capital rorac the value of one calculated incentive unit is the tradeweighted
average price of sampos ashare at the time period specified in the terms of the scheme and reduced by the starting price

im stays below these in addition the return on the risk adjusted capital is taken into account if the return is at least risk free
return  4 per cent the roracbased incentive reward is paid out in full if the return is risk free return  2 percent but less than
risk free return  4 per cent the payout is 50 per cent if the return stays below these benchmarks no roracbased reward will

charges the shares are subject to transfer restrictions for three years from the day of payout a premature payment of the reward
may occur in the event of changes in the group structure or in the case of employment termination on specifically determined
