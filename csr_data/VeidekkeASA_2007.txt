towards our corporate vision of creating a better
future for people at all stages of life

about this report 
many of the daytoday operations in a company like veidekke are concerned with social responsibility in
practice our core operations include the development and building of houses offices hotels roads brid
ges tunnels and railways we pave operate and maintain kilometre upon kilometre of public roads we
have about a thousand ongoing projects in different parts of scandinavia at any one time clearly there
are many people who are affected in one way or another by our operations  because they live next door
to a building site or because they are clients or employees or politicians who make decisions at local or
central level about our future projects no matter what processes we implement at veidekke we must
never forget the people who are affected by our operations our commitment to corporate social respon
sibility will always be reflected in the way we manage the group and it is therefore rooted in our basic
values to be professional honest enthusiastic and groundbreaking

we have also set four primary objectives for our endeavours to ensure responsible operations in all parts
of our organisation we will always

 run a healthy and profitable business
 live up to societys and veidekkes own ethical standards
 have an open dialogue and maintain good relations with the world outside the company
 be open and proactive with regard to problems and incidents

we will live up to these standards  whatever the project or task in hand

this is veidekkes first separate report on corporate social responsibility it starts with a review of our con
tact with stakeholders and interest groups this is followed by reports on our economic social and envi
ronmental performance in this we have been inspired by the internationally recognised global reporting
initiative gri we have not however included all the recommended themes but have selected only the
ones we regard as relevant to our core operations

the social and environmental indicators have a dominant place in this years report but we plan to report
more fully on economic performance in coming years

employees as coowners
veidekkes goal is that 50 per cent of the employees
own shares in the company today 36 per cent of
the employees have shares


injuries on the building site
we have set a clear target to achieve an injury rate lower than 5 for
all our scandinavian operations by 2010 in 2006 the injury rate
number of injuries per million hours worked was 57 compared with
93 the year before



recruitment
in the past year veidekke has recruited 753 new employees we have a
turnover of 54 per cent among the salaried staff and 91 per cent among
the skilled workers we have given much attention to recruiting new
employees and we have eg 262 apprentices in our company

         people to work longer veidekkes initiative has been de
         scribed as the ideal solution this is a typical winwin situ
         ation good for the employees who are encouraged to
         work longer although they could have taken early retire
         ment with a pension and good for veidekke who can
         keep valuable manpower at a time when the industry is
         suffering from a shortage of qualified workers and it is
         also good for the community which benefits both from
         more value creation and better adjusted elderly members
         in short it benefits everyone

         this is veidekkes first separate report on corporate social
         responsibility we have been working on this theme for
         many years but have never set it down systematically
         between two covers before now as this report shows
         we have made good headway but there are still many
         challenges ahead we have a particular interest in ensu
         ring steady recruitment to an industry which has had an
         urgent need for employees for years it is also our aim to
         increase employee involvement both with the help of
         processes to improve interaction on the construction site
         and by encouraging employees to purchase shares
         moreover we have set ambitious targets for the further
         reduction of injuries in our workplaces these are three of
         the most important elements of our commitment to so
         cial responsibility in the years ahead at veidekke we see
         a direct connection between corporate social responsibili
         ty and our four key value drivers close interaction with
         customers and other stakeholders employee involve
         ment a decentralised organisation and good project con
         trol thus csr also acts as a key driver in our work to
         achieve our primary objective which is to improve profit
         ability in the group and strengthen our scandinavian
         position

promoting an open and constructive dialogue with our
stakeholders and interest groups is an important part of
our business philosophy
                   the business of running our operations brings us into con          dialogue with our stakeholders we make it
