employees and the larger stakeholder community



dear stakeholders
we present you our third corporate responsibility report as you already know the year 200910 was a turbulent year across the
world which left us with many thoughts one that took centre stage amidst all of it was how to strengthen our tech manufacturing
capacities in a manner that is sustainable clean and innovative and is also admired it is increasingly going to become difficult for
companies across the world to pretend that sustainability is not central to their business processes in fact i believe that the most
commercially resilient companies will now recognise sustainability as one of the key business imperatives
towards this we at moser baer india have inculcated sustainability as an innate element of our dna in all that we do  our
processes services and thinking we are deeply committed towards adhering to all such steps which will help us meet the needs
of the present and the future generations in essence we have not only made it one of our core values but we are also making
efforts to understand how social components of sustainability will affect us as a company what are the limitations of our
resources that we are using and what are the carbon footprints that we are leaving behind and what needs to be done for we
understand that if the society around us fails we too will not succeed in real sense
we have begun the entire process by first evolving and adhering to the code of corporate governance to ensure best practices
within the company i believe sustainability is also about creating a successful business we see sustainability initiatives as a
critical aspect of our business and not as an addon using sustainability principles we try to ensure the success of our company
for the benefit of our customers our suppliers our shareholders our employees and the larger stakeholder community
additionally while pursuing our business goals we remain committed to protecting the environment and ensuring safety and
security of our employees safety is intrinsic to our work culture and is evident in all our operations and product development we
have put in a strong environment health and safety ehs framework at moser baer each year we achieve our stringent goals
through ehs objective driven targets which are set to reduce injuries prevent accidents and reduce wastage and our carbon
footprint into the environment
all these goals are integrated into our annual business plans so that they remain central to our plans as important as sales and
profits
we also continue to make efforts to internalize the ten guiding principles of the united nations global compact in the areas of
human rights labour environment and anti corruption into our organizational policies operations and culture
moser baer is leading actively in mutual aid scheme jointly with local administrative authorities and fire brigade to help
neighbourhood in case of emergency we are also member of national disaster management authority ndma
in this report you will read about the progress made by the moser baer trust especially in the field of healthcare education and
livelihood and how we remain committed towards achieving the country development goals and millennium development goals
in our spheres of influence especially near our plant sites in noida and greater noida respectively
our main focus is on doing integrated community development in the villages around our plants using innovative csr practices
which are participatory and inclusive in nature our focus remains on sustainable socio economic development programs which
empower the community to assert their rights and prepare them to take charge of their lives
we release this report every year to inform and engage better with all our stakeholders it showcases our efforts learning failures
and success and is our sincere attempt towards initiating a dialogue with all our customers with employees with shareholders
government ngos and the communities at large i am confident that we at moser baer india will continue to keep up with
sustainability ethos and keep you informed

8   organisation profile   governance
                           the concept of governance is not new and is definitely not
                           something that is unique it is as old as human civilisation
                           since governance is the process of decision making and its
                           implementation we believe that management is only a
                           trustee of the shareholders capital

                           we consider that corporate governance is integral to the
                           processes and structure by which the business and the
                           affairs of the company are directed and managed the
                           objective is to enhance long term shareholder value through
                           sustained corporate performance and accountability whilst
                           taking into account the interest of all the stakeholders

                           moser baer practices true corporate governance where
                           transparency integrity and accountability are hallmark of all
                           its activities as we believe that good governance is perhaps
                           the single most important component for sustained
                           development we encourage a process driven approach to
                           meet our vision statement

                           the corporate governance philosophy of the company is
                           based on the following principles

                                 satisfaction of the spirit of the law through ethical
                                 business conduct

                                 transparency and a high degree of disclosure levels

                                 truthful communication about how the company is run
                                 internally

                                 a simple and transparent corporate structure driven
                                 solely by the business needs

                                 strict compliance with clause 49 of the listing
                                 agreement as amended from time to time

                                 establishment of an efficient corporate structure for
                                 the management of the companys affairs

                                 management is the trustee of the shareholders
                                 capital and not the owner

                           the company has also evolved the code of corporate
                           governance to ensure the best practices of governance
                           within the company an active wellinformed and
                           independent board is necessary to ensure the highest
                           standards of corporate governance our board exercises its
                           fiduciary responsibilities in the widest sense as
                           independence of the board is critical for ensuring that the
                           board fulfils its oversight role objectively moser baer
                           maintains an appropriate mix of executive and independent
                           directors on its board this has allowed the company to
                           progress from a single entity business to a diversified
                           business conglomerate globally

                                                                                                                                   9
