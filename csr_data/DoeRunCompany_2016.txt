our employees

workplace safety is our highest value and our subsidiary fabricated products inc fpi reached 15 million hours
without a lost time accident in 2015 and achieved a perfect safety record for 16 years while we celebrate these
safety achievements we also mourn when accidents impact our team in january 2015 doe runs mining
operations tragically experienced a fatality at one of our mines and we lost a trusted and highly respected coworker
and friend we worked with federal authorities to understand what caused this accident and to ensure all
precautions for safety are taken to best protect our employees

one precaution we focus upon is reducing employee exposure to lead in 2014 lead manufacturing and mining
companies across the industry introduced voluntary targets to reduce workforce lead exposure the us
occupational safety and health administration requires that employees of lead industry companies be removed and
reassigned from their jobs if their bloodlead levels exceed 50 micrograms per deciliter μgdl on a sixmonth
average doe run voluntarily reassigns employees if they reach bloodlead levels of 30 µgdl1

doe run has taken a protective approach by proactively monitoring employees bloodlead levels on a monthly
basis versus a quarterly or annual basis if they exceed our threshold our target for 2015 was to reduce the number
of employees at each location who surpassed the threshold of 19 μgdl we achieved that target at our southeast
missouri mining and milling semo division and fpi but missed our target at our resource recycling and
herculaneum operations read more about our progress

global outlook

in 2015 global demand for lead grew at a lower level than anticipated as chinas economic growth slowed the
result was lower prices for base metal commodities including lead doe run adjusted to the cooling global economy
by postponing nonessential projects reducing overtime where possible and unfortunately by reducing our
workforce these decisions though difficult enabled the company to manage through a challenging time without
some of the more drastic measures taken by other companies in the industry

despite the lower commodity pricing the longterm outlook for lead copper and zinc is promising since the closure
of the doe run primary smelter in 2013 the company has diversified its customer portfolio in the global market and
has settled into its new business model as a global leader in exported lead concentrates the change to the
companys business model also impacted company spending with missouri vendors as materials related to primary
metal production were no longer required the smelter closure also impacted us metal imports and in 2015 the
us imported record levels of lead metal the majority of lead imports are utilized in motive and stationary batteries
and advances in battery technologies provide a promising outlook for leadbased batteries for use in hybrid electric
cars and renewable energy storage both markets are expected to experience strong growth so although lower

metal prices may prevail for a longer period we believe recovery of metal prices will take place in late 2016 with
the measures we have put into place we are wellpoised for a market recovery

the reputation of lead

as a member of several trade associations doe run is a staunch advocate for open communication with
stakeholders and for greater understanding on how to use and reuse lead in a safe manner most people do not
realize that leadbased batteries start nearly one billion vehicles every day a day without lead would mean a day
without modern transportation without medical radiation therapies without security screening and much more
improved communication efforts on the value of lead and greater education on the proper handling of lead are
necessary to build a better understanding among the public and policymakers

as the largest lead mining company in the us doe run has taken an active role in working alongside state and
federal government to help legislators learn more about our industry in april 2015 doe run employees hosted a
doe run day at the missouri state capitol building employees staffed tables with information on missouri
minerals battery recycling mining and remediation and visited each state legislators office to share information on
our industry the event successfully opened dialogue about the important role mining plays for missouris economy
and the company intends to repeat the effort every couple of years

at the federal level doe run was invited by the us office of accountability to respond to its critical materials
supply survey regarding us access to critical materials that may have a strong value to our economy and national
security doe run responded by explaining the importance of lead metal to the us economy and to us domestic
and international security for example lead is used to start all motive vehicles provide emergency power for
missioncritical equipment and for medical and military applications all of which directly support our nations
defense

safety at the core
   sustainability2015doeruncom committedsafework

sixteen years is a long time to maintain a record of no losttime accidents just ask fabricated products incs fpi
facility in casa grande arizona employees there have worked 15 million hours with no losttime accidents totaling
more than 15 million consecutive safe hours at its two locations

if you would have told me 15 years ago when we had one full year under our belt that 16 years later wed still be
adding to this record i doubt i would have believed it said tim rango sales human resources and safety manager
for fpi a subsidiary of doe run specializing in metal fabrication but today knowing our team and the culture we
have here i believe we have what it takes to continue our record long into the future

fpis casa grande facility fabricates lead and lead alloy products while the facility in vancouver washington
produces lead oxides for the battery industry

fpi employees work in an environment with mechanical equipment mobile equipment and heavy suspended loads
of hot or molten materials it is critical that we have strong safety processes in place to protect our employees keep
our operations running smoothly and provide quality products to our customers says mark yingling vice president
 environmental health  safety at doe run our fpi employees have created an exemplary culture of safety and
we congratulate them for their commitment to keeping each other safe year over year

when asked what the key has been to such a safe environment dave olkkonen general manager says it starts
with hiring for the right fit our first step is to find employees who share our common values of safety and respect for
one another we want to be a good fit for them and they have to also share in our commitment to our safety
performance it is understood that we must always find a way to do a job safely or we wont do it at all

the division rewards employees with a lunch celebration when they achieve good results we invite employees to
ask our leadership team questions anytime they have questions or suggestions olkkonen said by promoting
communication were fostering a level of respect and team work that carries over into the workday we watch out for
one another

working safely protects lives jobs and the community

just ask steve rhoades general supervisor at resource recycling doe runs secondary lead smelter located in
southeastern missouri in 2015 doe runs resource recycling facility invested in new measures to keep both
employees and the environment safer

our people are what keep us in business and our community allows us to operate so its critical that we take steps
to work safely and protect our employees and neighbors said rhoades

doe run took a big step in improving air quality in 2015 with a 12 million ventilation project that reduces exposure
to potential airborne lead particles at resource recyclings metal refinery in order to reduce the potential for fugitive
emissions from the refinery and other process buildings the facilitys operations are enclosed in negative pressure
buildings negative pressure is produced by large ventilation fans that draw the air in through ductwork and
eventually through baghouses which collect lead particles and other airborne materials before releasing the air
outside

we are always working to lower employee exposure to airborne lead said bruce chamberlain operations
manager metals division doe run made several improvements in this area and the ventilation is a part of that
success we set our levels for employees well below the government requirements and in 2015 our average blood
lead level for metal division employees was 1501 micrograms per deciliter μgdl we focus on this for continuous

improvement and establish metrics to help us continue the path of reduced exposure

the project construction took place over eight months and includes a 250horsepower fan that can draw between
110120 thousand cubic feet of air per minute missouribased lee mechanical fabricated and installed the system

safety measures

one of doe runs core values is being safe  protecting one another this means a commitment from the company
to continually invest in safety programs and equipment to protect employees and neighbors and a commitment from
employees to operate safely and watch out for fellow coworkers


safety gloves

employees protect their hands by wearing different types of
gloves based on the task to be completed


climbing harness

climbing harnesses are used by employees to ensure work
conducted at elevation is completed safely

ventilation fan

in 2015 the company invested in a 12 million ventilation
project at the resource recycling facility

behind the numbers

total case incident rates lost time accidents bloodlead
levels what do they have in common lower is better when it
comes to employee safety

there are various ways to measure progress in keeping
employees safe said justin province environmental health 
safety ehs manager in our industry we routinely work with
large equipment and around molten metal clear safety
processes and open communication among employees helps
us create a safe productive environment we must always
maintain our focus and dedication to safety

doe run tracks and reports on bloodlead levels the trace
amount of lead the body may absorb through exposure
accidents and incident rates monthly and annually in each of
the above categories and in 2015 the company identified
several areas for focused improvement

we are always monitoring our health and safety numbers and
identifying ways to make adjustments to improve safety at our
facilities said yingling

throughout 2015 doe run analyzed the safety performance

numbers and the related incidents in many cases these lost time accidents involved soft tissue injuries like deep
bruises muscle pulls or sprains that take time to heal while these types of injuries are common among any type of
industrial job doe run wanted to assess what changes could be made to minimize accidents like these

we are fortunate to have a knowledgeable and experienced workforce said yingling being too familiar with a job
can sometimes lead to overconfidence its important to stay alert and look out for potential dangers through
continued assessment

doe run reassessed its performance against the mining industrys coresafety program which the company first
introduced in 2013 building on the companys progress ehs team members conducted a companywide
assessment in each of the programs 20 key areas following assessment the coresafety team determined they
would focus primarily on these categories collaborating and communication risk management change
management assurance and management systems coordination

the central coresafety team focused on collaboration and communication first to engage more employees in the
process the initial team of more than 75 employees across all locations divisions and including both hourly and
salary staff discussed how doe run could foster stronger twoway communication about safety issues location
teams meet monthly to share ideas research solutions and when appropriate present suggested improvements to
division leadership teams so that any necessary corrective measures are taken

one of the specific areas of focus was hand safety after investigating past incidents related to hand burns the
coresafety team researched alternative hand protection products and identified a different glove that better
protects employees stated province after introducing the new glove and processes for the casting area the
number of handrelated injuries has greatly reduced

separately the team also responded to employee suggestions to research cooling gear for those who work closest
to the furnaces the company purchased the new gear which keeps employees cooler and more comfortable

success one microgram at a time

doe runs standards for workforce exposure to lead are more stringent than government requirements and monthly
progress is measured to the microgram one millionth of a gram in 2015 the average bloodlead levels
companywide declined to 1102 micrograms per deciliter μgdl and the number of employees who recorded a
bloodlead level of greater than 19 ugdl also declined from 223 to 188

doe run proactively reassigns workers who have a bloodlead level of 30 µgdl to a job area with reduced
exposure stated mark yingling thats 20 points less than the standard set by the occupational health and safety
administration osha for medical reassignment yingling attributes the success to concerted efforts at each
division we also counsel employees who cross a certain threshold to identify particular areas of exposure and
work on individualized plans to address those areas

certifications and achievements

doe runs success depends on achieving high
standards for its operations and safety certifications
and awards are measures of the companys progress

third mine and mill earns iso certification

in 2015 a third doe run mine and mill operation 
brushy creek mine and mill  completed its iso
140012004 certification for environmental
management developed by the international
organization for standardization iso the iso
140012004 certification helps companies set
operational goals and maintain an environmental
management system

continuous improvement is a way of life when it comes
                                                                       brushy creek mine and mill iso certification
to environmental stewardship said samantha
                                                             brushy creek mine and mill completed iso 140012004 certification for
anderson environmental programs manager at doe                                 environmental management
run completing the iso certification process helps
the company develop a framework to analyze the
environmental challenges we face and then identify
areas where we can implement consistent practices
across our operations and finetune processes that
may be specific to an individual mine or mill

brushy creek mine and mill achieved iso certification over a sixmonth period which included a rigorous onsite
assessment from a thirdparty iso registrar to refine the sites procedures and enhance environmental
performance

during the iso certification process doe run audited the efficiency and potential environmental impact of current
operations at brushy creek mine and mill then the team developed a management system to reduce
environmental impact and set specific targets and timelines for improvement

    increase materials recycling by 5 percent
    reduce hazardous waste by 5 percent
    construct a water treatment plant which was completed in 2014 read more about doe runs water
    management
    complete an hvac geothermal heating project for the site read more about this new energyefficient
    system

thirdparty auditing of our progress is one of the most valuable features of iso said anderson quarterly auditing
by an internal team and an annual audit conducted by a third party helps us track our progress against the iso
14001 standard outside auditors assist us by looking at our programs with a fresh perspective and sharing
information on the latest industry trends

at brushy creek mine and mill internal teams identified several solutions to everyday operational obstacles as part
of the iso auditing process for example the underground crew noted that traditional sticker labels for containers
sometimes disintegrated in the damp environment which could create confusion about what is stored inside
employees researched alternative methods to label containers underground ultimately moving to durable color
coded zip ties that could withstand the environment

changing the label system was a simple solution and it makes a big difference in how we work said anderson

the experience that the environmental and mine operation teams gained during the previous iso certification audits
at the companys sweetwater mine and mill and fletcher mine and mill made for a more efficient certification
process at brushy creek mine and mill the teams knowledge ultimately reduced the process by several months

in 2016 doe runs buick mine and mill will be implementing some of the environmental management best
practices developed at the other facilities to prepare for the iso certification process in 2017 casteel mine and no
29 mine will also undergo iso certification in 2017

pursuing certifications like iso help us in our goal to meet our commitment to remain good stewards of the
resources we share with our stakeholders and communities of interest said anderson

doe runs resource recycling facility has held an iso 140012004 certification since 2003 additionally
herculaneum resource recycling and fabricated products incs fpi vancouver washington facilities maintain
iso 90012008 certification for quality management systems

maintaining a safe workplace requires a team effort and doe run reinforces safety and emergency preparedness
through regular employee training in 2015 doe run employees completed 16687 safetyrelated training hours
the mine rescue teams also complete eight additional hours of training monthly and participate annually in mine
rescue competitions to keep their critical safety response skills sharp

in july 2015 doe runs maroon mine rescue team earned the overall champion title at the northern regional mine
rescue contest the event tested 10 mine rescue teams abilities to handle emergency situations underground

other 2015 accomplishments of the mine rescue teams include

   the maroon team won best in state at the missouri mine rescue association contest held in rolla missouri
    the gray team finished in third place in the team technical competition at the southeast regional mine
    rescue contest in maysville kentucky
    at the same competition in kentucky the gray teams captain wayne marlin earned first place in the written
    team trainer test

while mine rescue contests are competitive events participants value each teams commitment to safety above all
else in 2015 doe runs denny dickerson was inducted into the missouri mine rescue hall of fame for his many
years of service as a skilled mine rescuer he was nominated by another mine rescue team doe run regularly faces
in competition

treating missouri waterways with care
   sustainability2015doeruncom treatingmissouriwaterwayscare

doe runs water management approach is simple if it falls on our operations or is part of our processes its our
responsibility to manage water plays a vital role in the companys mining milling and recycling operations  and it is
also vital for recreational activities and the economies of the communities where doe run operates

its important that we care for this valuable resource by minimizing our operations impact on the water at our
properties said mark yingling vice president  environmental health and safety we have invested millions of
dollars collecting and treating water at our properties

doe run invested 132 million in 2015 to increase its water management capacity by building a water treatment
plant at buick mine and mill the company partnered with engineers at woodard curran to build the facility  the
second of five planned water treatment plants for its mines and mills read about the first plant at brushy creek
mine and mill

the plants flocculation and chemical precipitation technology helps the company meet water permit limits more
efficiently previously water at the buick mine and mill site was pumped to the tailings storage facility where metals
and other impurities settled out of the water to meet permit limits before being released to struthers creek via a
meander system the new plant relies on a process similar to municipal water treatment plants to collect and treat
water that comes in contact with doe runs operations after treatment the water released meets the permit limits

buick mine is one of our larger mines which means we have a higher volume of naturally occurring water to
manage here than at some of our other sites said amber nipper water treatment specialist at doe runs southeast
missouri mining and milling semo division to accommodate the additional treatment needs we built the buick
plant on a much larger scale

when operating at full capacity the plant can process up to 10000 gallons of water per minute by comparison a
similar though smaller scale plant at brushy creek mine and mill treats 4000 gallons per minute this additional
capacity means doe run is prepared for high rain fall at the site because any storm water flow must also be
collected and sent to the plant for treatment before it can be released

missouri weather can be unpredictable and we often experience very wet springs falls and winters as we did in
2015 in addition the amount of water we encounter underground in the mines can vary based on the area we are
actively mining said samantha anderson environmental programs manager at semo we were very deliberate in
designing a plant that can operate reliably and flexibly in even the most challenging conditions

the company also created a basin to collect and retain storm water at no 29 mine in 2015 to learn about other
2015 environmental improvement projects at doe run read fulfilling environmental commitments

in 2016 doe run will build two additional water treatment plants a plant at sweetwater mine and mill will manage
water collected from the site the new plant in viburnum will treat process waters from casteel mine and no 29
mine as well as storm water from nearby tailings sites a fifth and final water treatment plant is planned for 2017

charting a new course for west fork stream

in 2014 and 2015 doe runs water management efforts included redirecting a portion of the west fork stream that
ran across company property due to a land depression that occurred in the stream and subsequent decrease in the
streams water flow doe run requested and received permission from the us army corps of engineers and the
missouri department of natural resources to create a new channel for the stream in order to protect its flow

the west fork stream flows across our property and downstream to other property owners so it was very
important for us to work collaboratively with our neighbors county commissioners and regulators as we addressed
this issue said yingling together we determined that we needed to reroute a 2350foot portion of the west fork
stream to preserve its flow

with a team of contractors regulators and state organizations the company engineered a new channel for west
fork stream located approximately 400 feet from the original channel during summer 2014 regulatory agencies
including missouri department of natural resources missouri geological survey and us army corp of
engineers provided oversight and support throughout the process in total doe run invested approximately 1
million in the project

the new channel performed even better than expected said yingling within a few days fish began swimming
around the rocks covering the floor of the new creek channel and aquatic plants started growing after just a few
weeks in our talks with local property owners we heard that they are pleased with the creeks performance and
with the native plants we planted alongside the banks to stabilize the channel

doe run hopes to receive final approval from the us army corp of engineers and missouri department of natural
resources to make the channel permanent by summer 2016 the company will fill cracks in the old channel with
clay and revegetate it with waterfriendly plants it will serve as a flood plain in the event that the new channel
overflows during heavy rainfall




                                                                              map of west fork stream
                                                  doe run worked with contractors regulators and state organizations to engineer a new
                                                     channel for west fork stream located approximately 400 feet from the original
                                                                                       channel

fulfilling environmental commitments
   sustainability2015doeruncom environmentalcommitments

in 2015 doe run improved efficiency and reduced the environmental impact of its southeast missouri mining and
milling division semo operations by investing in two environmental projects these projects helped fulfill the
companys environmental commitments as part of an agreement with the state of missouri and the environmental
protection agency epa

doe run is delivering on the promises we made to our local communities to improve our shared environment said
jerry pyatt doe run president and ceo since reaching the agreement in 2010 we have invested more than 2
million in a series of environmental improvement projects at our semo facilities as well as at several schools
throughout southeastern missouri these investments support our continued promise to operate our business in a
sustainable manner minimize our impact and benefit our communities

projects harnessing natural resources

not only does doe run mine the valuable metallic minerals in southeast missouri the company also relies on
natural resources like water to support and in some cases improve operations in 2015 doe run implemented an
alternative way to heat and cool buildings by tapping into geothermal energy and thereby reduce its impact to the
environment

doe run installed geothermal heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems to improve energy efficiency
at brushy creek mine and mills surface building  which houses offices and employee change rooms  as well as
the semo central office in viburnum the geothermal systems rely on the earths constant temperature and a
closedloop system that recirculates water through heat pumps to improve efficiency electric compressors and the
pumps help control the temperature of air that heats or cools the buildings using 25 percent to 50 percent less
electricity than conventional heating or cooling systems these systems also reduce carbon dioxide and greenhouse
gas emissions

in the winter the water flowing through these pipes absorbs heat from the earth and circulates it through a heat
pump where it warms air that is blown through the hvac system to heat the building in the summer the heat pump
draws heat from the building into the water pipes the cooler water absorbs the heat from the air and cooled air is
sent back into the building employees can control the temperature of the building by using thermostats

while we experience hot summers and cold winters above ground the temperature a few feet below the earths
surface remains relatively consistent approximately 60 degrees fahrenheit said eric van de mark civil engineer
and project manager at doe run the geothermal hvac systems harness that constant temperature for more
efficient temperature control by tapping into this renewable energy source were decreasing our overall energy
use environmental impact and spending

doe run invested 1 million in this project and worked with microgrid energy of st louis lee mechanical of park
hills missouri and ridge runner of salem missouri to install the geothermal hvac systems

many of doe runs other environmental investments in 2015 focused on water management learn more here

projects managing natural resources

this year also marked the completion of a fouryear 23 million process to construct concentrate enclosure systems
at all four of doe runs mill facilities as part of the environmental commitments of the 2010 agreement the
enclosures store the lead concentrate that results from doe runs milling process the lead concentrates are

eventually transported around the globe to be processed into lead metal and alloys

doe run invested approximately 84 million to construct the final lead concentrate enclosure and baghouse at
fletcher mill in 2015

each of the facilities filter air within the enclosure and use a negativepressure ventilation system to minimize the
potential of emissions as a result of lead concentrate handling said van de mark the lead concentrate
enclosures help us maintain the quality of our lead concentrates by protecting them from wind rain and snow and
also reduce potential fugitive emissions we have since seen improvements in our air monitoring

a path forward

doe run continues to manage other environmental projects as part of the 2010 consent decree including
implementation of environmental management systems at several of its mines and mills and remediation of the
herculaneum smelter property while doe run has completed a significant portion of its agreement the company is
committed to exploring new ways to continue reducing its impact and improving its operations

community projects

doe run invested in several other projects from 20122014 that brought environmental improvements to schools in
the communities in which it operates as part of the agreement

solar panels

doe run invested 500000 in the installation of solar panels and energyefficiency upgrades at herculaneum high
school which are projected to save the school more than 44000 annually

school bus retrofits

the company issued grants totaling 300000 to seven missouri school districts these grants funded upgrades to
retrofit dieselpowered school bus engines that can reduce exhaust emissions by up to 90 percent missouribased
central states bus sales inc helped perform the improvements

school lab cleanouts

doe run also contributed 200000 to help local schools safely dispose of chemical waste from science labs and
darkrooms

on track with reclamation
   sustainability2015doeruncom ontrackwithreclamation

when st joseph lead company the predecessor to doe run constructed a railroad line through herculaneum in
1890 the company probably never imagined that those same tracks would help a new mississippi river shipping
facility prosper 125 years later

doe run and its predecessors built and expanded the infrastructure that established and grew the town of
herculaneum  by river rail and road that same river and rail access now supports the expansion of new industry
for the area through the riverview commerce park llc rcp shipping facility and fulfills part of doe runs plans
for the closure and repurposing of the companys primary smelter location rcp capitalizes on the existing
infrastructure to ship materials downriver

the railroad line plays a critical role in transporting materials to rcp in fact our rail access helped us double our
shipping capacity in 2015 said mark denton project manager at rcp

expansion to the infrastructure at the rivers edge also increased rcps capacity to accommodate more shipments
and improve the efficiency of operations the port doubled in size with the construction of a second loading dock
and a new barge fleet staging area where barges can park rcp began using the staging area in spring 2015 and
opened the second loading dock in spring 2016

our smelting operations were a major economic driver in herculaneum so we are pleased that our work to
remediate and repurpose the property helped bring new industry to the area said chris neaville asset
development director for doe run as we continue the reclamation process at the herculaneum smelter property
we hope to identify additional ways the land can benefit local businesses and the community

remediation of the 18acre port site took place with oversight from the missouri department of natural resources
mdnr voluntary cleanup program and epa region 7 the remediation included installing a threefootthick cap
layer of soil and rock across the property which was completed in 2015 rcp has submitted the completion report
for the site to mndr and is awaiting final approval for the work

other reclamation work at the herculaneum site in 2015 included moving a large amount of slag a glassy sandlike
material leftover from smelting situated on the north end of the property to a new slag storage area at the south end
of the property when work is completed at the site the storage area will be capped with soil to protect the slag from
rain or wind slag remediation is expected to be completed in 2020 while doe runs refinery and strip mill will
continue to operate plans are underway to dismantle the plants furnace buildings in 2017 clearing the way for
more new economic opportunities in herculaneum

additional reclamation progress

there have been thousands of lead mines in missouri over the centuries doe run works to improve the
environment through remediation of historic lead mining sites by implementing these cleanup projects doe run
continues to be good stewards of our land and minerals in total doe run invested more than 63 million in
environmental spending including remediation in 2015

    jasper county in 2015 doe run completed remediation at three historic lead sites operated by a former
    subsidiary kansas explorations inc at jasper isherwood and snapp these efforts included excavation of
    soil and mine waste and replanting native vegetation at the properties the company also piloted an
    innovative way to successfully recover metals from tailings which may be useful in future remediation
    projects doe run will provide ongoing maintenance at the snapp and isherwood sites to ensure that plants

are growing and address any erosion that occurs a private land owner is evaluating the opportunities to
repurpose the jasper site located alongside the highway for commercial real estate development

glover doe run continued efforts to dismantle this
former smelter which currently serves as a transloading
facility in 2015 crews removed two baghouses from
the glover facility and received approval from mdnr to
cap the slag pile construction on this cap will be
completed in 2016

detective work 1200 feet underground
   sustainability2015doeruncom mineexploration

successful mining starts with strong investigative skills and sound interpretation skills we are using data to help
create a picture of whats underground long before we ever sink a mine shaft and cut a drift underground tunnel
said george moellering exploration manager at doe runs southeast missouri mining and milling semo division
its a lot like putting together a puzzle without knowing in advance what the end image looks like

we collect data from core samples 1 and historical geological information known about an area and then begin
interpreting that data to provide us with a picture of what we believe is taking place underground based on the data
we estimate tonnage and the ore grade2 if it appears the grade and tonnage provide a reasonable economic
return we begin developing the area for mining

determining economic value

before a new ore body is determined to have sufficient economic value to mine several teams evaluate criteria
including ore grade the distance from existing mined areas to the ore body elevation and costs to reach the ore
body

as a company doe run maintains a core library dating back to approximately 1949 when predecessor st joseph
lead company explored what is today known as the viburnum trend the library contains samples from more than
10000 surface drill holes the successful exploration and subsequent mining of this area of southeast missouri has
earned the viburnum trend a global reputation as the secondlargest lead mining district in the world

in 2012 the company began its review process for completing mining in this area of the brushy creek mine as part
of their protocol doe run reviews all past surface and underground prospecting data both log books and core
samples and checks in with work crews to discuss any significant underground mineral observations to ensure that
valuable mineralization will not be stranded and unattainable during this process the mine geology group noted
copper mineralization had been observed in sections of the mine floor during the mining crews final pass through
the area

the review processes identified the core log entries from 1981 which supported the initial rationale for mining the
area

doe runs core room

measuring core samples

core samples are cylinder mineral samples generally 15 in
diameter drilled out of an area to determine the geologic and
chemical makeup


examining mineral makeup

the core room contains samples from more than 10000
surface drill holes geologists use bright lights and magnifying
glasses to carefully examine samples

archiving data

doe run maintains a core library dating back to approximately
1949 geologists log the minerals identified in each sample to
inform future drilling

our mine geologists reviewed the core samples that indicated
six ore runs were originally identified in the area of the brushy
creek mine said moellering five of those ore runs
represented the upper zone of the bonneterre formation
which we had been mining for decades the sixth ore run on
the core sample represented a new zone on a previously
unmined level of the mine some 100 feet below our mined
areas near the lamotte sandstone

this sixth run indicated in the core sample was ignored over
the years because a series of surface exploration drilling did
not suggest strong mineralization furthermore once mining in
the upper portion of the bonneterre formation took place
surface drilling to the lower ore zone was not possible and
underground jackhammer drilling methods were not capable of
reaching the lower ore zone

separately these two puzzle pieces seemed insignificant but
when placed together in context they revealed something
completely different

based on these two findings the historic core logs and newly observed mineralization the mine team began
underground exploration with a diamond drill in august 2012 and over the next several months crews drilled 48
holes that indicated mineralization existed from the floor of the last mining pass at 122 feet elevation all the way to
35 feet below sea level in some places the mineralization was 150 feet thick most surprising from a geological
standpoint was that the highest grade ore was located at the point of contact between the bottom of the bonneterre
formation and the lamotte sandstone

as a result of the exploration 11 separate areas known as ore blocks were identified as prospects the final
tonnage for the combined blocks was estimated at more than 430000 tons of lead zinc and copper ore with an ore
grade about three times the mineralization traditionally found in the area

it took development crews approximately eight months to develop this unique mining zone in order for mine crews to
gain access to the ore

getting to this ore body created some challenges said randy hanning mine operations manager this is the first
ore body next to the lamotte sandstone which was a new situation for us the sandstone is pretty porous as
opposed to our traditional mine horizons that are in dolomite a much harder and more stable host rock to
compensate crews made modifications to the mine design in order to respond to the mine conditions and ore grade

addressing ventilation requirements at that depth also required a different approach with the mine crews drilling a
125by6foot opening through the roof of the new area to the floor of the previous area to improve ventilation
expedited advancements by the development crew to the lower zone allowed production from the area to begin in
june of 2014 the extra effort has paid off with high mineralization of galena lead sphalerite zinc and
chalcopyrite copper

unlike our extraction in the bonneterre zone where we have long understood the pattern and elevation of the ore
the deep ore zone mineralization at brushy creek is located at a greater depth  nearly sea level  and the mineral
content from one mining advance to the next is less predictable explained chris hogan brushy creek mine
geologist so far we have been successful in recovering nearly 100000 tons of this resource between june 2014
and the end of 2015 but we still have only a portion of the puzzle put together for this area so we believe we have a
long way yet to go this is what makes exploration so rewarding and is what extends the life of our mines

growing partnerships through responsible forestry
   sustainability2015doeruncom responsibleforestry

doe runs commitment to be responsible with the resources in its care extends from the minerals mined
underground to the land above as part of this promise doe run oversees more than 70000 acres of land including
35000 acres of forests located around its operations in several counties in southeast missouri

many people see timber as a nonrenewable resource because trees are removed in the process this couldnt be
further from the truth said dave patterson forester at doe run in fact part of responsible forestry is harvesting
some trees to give other growing trees room to thrive some trees can be harvested every year into the foreseeable
future to provide timberbased products and valuable jobs when a forest is sustainably managed

in 2015 doe runmanaged forests provided approximately 3 million board feet of timber used to create forest
products such as railroad cross ties hardwood flooring steel mill blocking pallet material and cabinets one
company even uses the timber to make barrels for wine and spirits right here in missouri

doe run partnerships grow missouris economy ec9

in 2015 doe run supported missouri businesses by spending more than 153 million with 632 missouri vendors
this accounts for 43 percent of total company spending

doe runs vision for sustainable forestry

sustainable forestry means taking responsibility for the overall health of the ecosystem doe run divides its forests
into stands  sections of land up to 40 acres where trees and soil have similar characteristics forestry experts
closely monitor the growth and health of each stand and approximately every 15 to 20 years doe run hires local
loggers to harvest trees in a particular stand a sawmill in boss missouri cuts those logs into green lumber which is
then purchased by local operations such as a flooring plant and palletmaking company

harvesting trees in this systematic way allows doe run to provide timber to local partners while also maintaining
the ecological balance of the land the surviving trees then have enough room in nutrientrich soil to grow big and
strong

when determining where to harvest we take into consideration factors like the natural topography soil erosion
patterns water quality and the wildlife that live in that ecosystem of the forest said patterson from there we
identify whether some trees need to be thinned out so stronger trees can grow to maturity we also evaluate if we
need to plant additional trees to help that ecosystem flourish doe runs goal for our responsible forestry is to work
with mother nature and not disrupt the natural balance of our land

if an area of the forest needs to be replanted crews plant the appropriate tree species to thrive in that environment
as of 2015 doe run has replanted approximately 600000 seedlings throughout its forested land in southeast
missouri

the power of missouri white oak

white black and red oak make up approximately 75 to 80 percent of doe runs harvested timber most of the timber
harvested from doe runs forests supports products at a number of local companies white oak in particular is
highly desired for barrel making which makes it a valuable local resource for independent stave company the

worlds largest supplier of staved barrels for wine and spirits based in lebanon missouri

white oak trees grow slowly which means they have more rings when they are harvested said justin nichols log
procurement manager at independent stave the rings in older trees are important in cooperage or barrel making
because they provide a deeper flavor as the spirits or wine soak into the barrel white oaks chemical complexity
offers a multitude of options for creating different flavors

doe run serves as one of independent staves top ten suppliers of white oak timber in 2015 independent stave
purchased more than 200000 board feet of white oak from doe run to craft barrels for wineries and distilleries
around the world

we do not harvest any of our own timber we rely on more than 2000 missouri suppliers to provide the white oak
we need said nichols our partnership with doe run helps us provide customers with highquality barrels and
supports jobs right here in lebanon

from bark to barrels

cooperage or barrel making is a multistep process that can take three to six months to complete because
independent staves white oak barrels are highly desired to age some of the finest wines and spirits around the
world each barrel is closely inspected prior to distribution to ensure highquality standards are met


step 1

sawmills cut logs into vertical planks called staves white oak
staves contain a natural substance called tyloses that makes
the wood watertight

step 2

the staves are formed into a barrel shape by applying heat
steam and pressure metal hoops hold the staves in the curved
shape

step 3

the inside of a completed barrel is toasted to create a
