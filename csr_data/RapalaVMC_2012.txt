market risks and mitigation actions are analyzed in more detail in the section financial risks and in note 22 to
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
    in respect of manufacturing activities the group is not critically dependent on any single external production
factor supplier the group uses several subcontractors in china but the group is not as such critically dependent
on any of these subcontractors this risk has been further reduced as the new production facility in indonesia has
taken over some production previously done by chinese subcontractors availability of competent production labor
is essential and the group aims to maintain good employer reputation and labor relations
    there are signiﬁcant dependencies between the groups manufacturing units which could cause supply
problems eg in case of ﬁre or other hazard such hazard could lead to property damages but also to business
interruption losses throughout the supply chain therefore rapala has increased the emphasis of hazard risk
management the group has together with its insurance company continued to conduct annually several hazard
prevention reviews to groups key locations group management has also continued to build risk awareness
throughout the organization
    the group is with assistance of its insurance broker further developing the global insurance programs which
cover most of the group companies global insurance policies which take into account the groups interdepend
ency are in place for property damage and business interruption transportation as well as general and product
liabilities
    the board evaluates the groups operational risks at least once a year as part of operational plans and budgets
group management monitors and coordinates the continuous management of operational risks which is the
responsibility of the management of each business unit

the groups ﬁnancial risks consist of market risks credit and default risks and liquidity risks the board evaluates
ﬁnancial risks several times during the year and group management monitors and manages them continuously
