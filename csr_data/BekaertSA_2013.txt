our responsibility in the workplace
our people

in response to rapid and structural changes in the global solar energy market to growing
uncertainty in other markets and to longer term overall instability bekaert implemented a major
realignment program in 2012 the company has done the maximum possible to mitigate the
social impact for the affected employees by offering a fair severance plan and by offering
guidance toward reemployment
excluding the population entitled to an early retirement settlement more than 80 of the people
in belgium were reemployed by yearend 2012 in china too most people have entered into a
new job very fast

seizing opportunities of change
apart from the initiatives and solutions to ease the social consequences for the affected
employees bekaert also attached great importance to guiding its teams through these
turbulent times interactive sessions with managers across the globe were set up to
understand and listen to employees concerns hopes and expectations and to answer their
questions special efforts were also made to provide adequate coaching tools to the managers
at those sites experiencing major changes

we continued the bekaert leadership journey a worldwide management development
program that was launched in 2010 in 2012 we introduced the second module which focuses
on leading with others and emphasizes truly working together in order to achieve our
company objectives and our common aspiration

safety first

because our people are our most important asset safety comes first always providing a safe
working environment for all employees is key to us

the right safety attitude
investigations show that the majority of workplace accidents are caused by human factors
rather than by machine related hazards a good attitude towards safety is the best way to
avoid accidents the right behavior starts with acting proactively and implementing the right
mindset based on experiences within our plants in brazil and ecuador we introduced an
assessment system that aims for improved safety awareness and provides a behavioral risk
profile that is used to define specific training programs

measuring and improving safety
the bekaert safety policy is deployed through the safety tree model and monitored via the
bekaert safety evaluation system bekses in 2012 regular bekses audits based on
ohsas 18001 were carried out in a substantial number of plants in other plants an action
plan based on the 2011 audits was implemented

international health and safety day
in september 2012 bekaert organized its fifth international health and safety day this years
edition focused on electrical safety safety guidelines and checklists were provided and most
of the plants performed safety audits dedicated training programs have been introduced to
keep electrical safety always in mind by organizing the international health and safety day on
a yearly basis bekaerts top management and all management teams reconfirm that the
safety and health of all bekaert employees worldwide is and remains one of the main priorities

our responsibility towards the environment
better together for a cleaner world is one of bekaerts ambitions we continuously strive to use
fewer materials bring down our energy consumption and reduce waste
bekaerts concern for the environment is threefold

on the one hand we develop new ecofriendlier production processes for our plants
worldwide in 2012 we executed audits in no less than 90 of our plants to check the
implementation of our internal procedures for avoiding the pollution of soil and groundwater
action plans were defined to take proactive measures and keep awareness for the
environment top of mind we continued to work on the new environmental technologies
project that was launched in 2011 in order to build up knowledge and expertise in
environmental technologies and thereby boost the environmental performance of plants
worldwide some examples include the increased recuperation of chemicals through
improvement of the scrubbers the treatment of waste lubricants and improvement projects
toward attaining zero disposal of copper and zinc
in 2012 90 of our consolidated plants worldwide were iso 14001 certified bekaerts full
worldwide certification remains an ongoing goal and an element in the integration process of
newly acquired entities and of the companies that have been added to the consolidation
perimeter

secondly bekaert invests in product innovations that allow for process improvements at the
production sites of our customers special wire coatings for example can eliminate certain
process steps for our customers and hence improve environmental impact as well as the
production cost

thirdly bekaert also develops products that contribute to a cleaner environment to name a
few we manufacture super and ultratensile steel cord that answers the need for lightweight
materials in cars stainless steel wedge wires used for oil and water filtration cable armoring
solutions for green power transmission and substitutes for solventbased coatings
