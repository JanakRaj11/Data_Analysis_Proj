                2015 sustainability report
introduction
sustainability plays a critical role in how we measure our success at sokol blosser our definition
of sustainability and therefore how we measure our success each year is based on the triple
bottom line simply put it is people planet and profit our long term viability and success as a
company is dependent on how we treat our staff and the community around us how we care for
the environment on a local and global scale and running a profitable business running our business
through these lenses aligns with our mission and values

 mission to be a winery to which people feel a personal connection because of the high quality of
 the product the good to the earth way it is produced and the engaging authenticity of the sokol

we have developed goals in each of the three categories  people planet and profit  that we will
strive for and measure our progress each year some of these goals are long term pursuits and
we will slowly chip away at them over time and perhaps never reach them in our lifetime the
importance of the goal and measurement cannot be overlooked as it aligns our business interests
and daily activities toward becoming a better more sustainable company in the long run

as a recognition of our commitment to sustainability and to provide a framework for becoming even
more sustainable we became bcorp certified on april 15 2015

planet
being good stewards of the land to leave it in as good or better shape for the next generation
is a key part of being sustainable at sokol blosser we have made many strides in this area
over the past ten years namely
    organic certification for our vineyard in 2005
    us green building council leedcertified barrel cellar in
      2002 first winery in the world to achieve this
    onsite 25kw solar panel system
    renewable wind power purchased from pge
    50 biodiesel in vineyard tractors and trucks
    member of the prescott western bluebird recovery project
    brochures and copy paper are made from as much post
      consumer waste recycled content when working with printers we always request for
      the most sustainable options  both in paper and ink  and weigh out the decision
      based on whats sustainable for the environment and balance it with sustainable
      decisions for the business
    packaging is heavily integrated with our sustainability efforts these include lighter
      glass weight for evolution wines eliminated foil capsules of our still wines wine labels
      printed on 100 recycledpostconsumer waste paper composite corks majority kraft
      case boxes fsccertified wood boxes fsccertified paper for 2bottle bags and
      reusable 6bottle canvas bags

the following elements are lofty goals that may take a generation to reach

net zero energy
in 2015 we essentially kept our onsite energy consumption flat with 2014 levels onsite energy
consumption increased by 003 our long term goal is to reach net zero energy which
we would accomplish through a combination of energy consumption and onsite energy
generation likely through an expanded solar panel pv system there are advantageous tax
credits available through 2019 to expand our pv system and our goal is to be able to do this
expansion to take advantage of the tax credits prior to 2019 here is our breakdown of energy
consumption and generation by facility area

    tasting room 63400 kwh energy used this is an 240kwh decrease from 2014
      less than 1 we hosted more events and more guests in 2015 than 2014 so we are
      pleased that we were able to keep our energy consumption in our tasting room steady
      we generated 23338 kwh energy by onsite pv system this is a decrease of 127 or
      3272kwh from 2014 our onsite pv system is generating 368 of our tasting room
      energy consumption
    officeswinery 86240 kwh energy used this is a 3440kwh or 4 increase from 2014

                                               4

    refrigerationbarrel cellar 87600 kwh energy used this is a 2315kwh or 26
      decrease from 2014
    vineyard 3717kwh energy used this is an 830kwh or 18 decrease from 2014

additionally for the energy that we cannot produce onsite we purchase exclusively wind
power through pges clean wind program in 2015 we purchased 165037 kwh through the
program offsetting 221205 lbs of c02 which equates to 246842 miles not driven or 26 trees
planted annually we have participated in pges clean wind program for seven years

in 2015 we installed two new systems that use considerable energy a new refrigeration system
for our winery for chilling tanks primarily during fermentation and new led lights in our
winery according to energy trust we anticipate the new refrigeration system will save 30698
kwh or a decrease of about 35 over current usage and the lights should save 20021 kwh
or a decrease of about 23 of our current usage it will be exciting to track our consumption
progress and report on our energy savings next year

additionally we have an onsite electrical vehicle charger that had 26 hours of charging in 2015
from visitors vehicles

reduce waste sent to the landfill
we have never tracked the amount of waste we generate in a year and this is something we
want to start doing we recycle as much as we can but we have never quantified how much
we recycle and how much we send to the landfill we had hoped to develop a system during
2015 to track the waste we send to the landfill but we were unable to do so this will be
something we target in 2016 so that we can then create a plan to reduce this amount over the
next three years

we always enjoyed being able to recycle the vast amount of plastic shrink wrap we generate
from receiving pallets of glass bottling the wine and shipping the wine back out however
due to economic changes in china it has become more difficult to find outlets that will take
our soft plastic recycling




                                               5

carbon neutral
in 2008 we joined the carbon neutral challenge with 14 other
oregon wineries in 2009 we joined the climate registry as a
founding member we tracked our level of carbon emissions for
four years reporting them annually to the climate registry and we
stopped doing this in 2012 we plan to restart this carbon accounting
process again in 2016

engage in good practices that help to protect our environment
as certified organic farmers we constantly look for new ways to take
care of our land in a more sustainable way we have helped a vineyard
that we farm and manage in the eolaamity hills blossom ridge
undergo a transition to organic farming that vineyard should achieve organic certification in 2016

as members of the prescott western bluebird recovery project we maintain about 15 birdhouses
located around the winery and vineyard in 2015 resident bluebirds laid 30 eggs and 26 of those
survived and hatched and the baby bluebirds were banded

we purchased a beehive from a local hive maker in 2014 and an additional one in 2015 we worked
hard throughout the year to attract and keep a queen bee and her hive we were able to harvest a
small amount of honey that we shared with our staff

as a monoculture we grow only one thing wine grapes in 2013 we planted a small fruit orchard
below our vineyard shop and finally in 2015 it started to bear fruit that employees and their
families harvested and consumed


profit
running a profitable business is perhaps the most important element to having a longterm viable
and sustainable company as a small closelyheld company owned by the sokol blosser family we
do not disclose our financial statements yet take great pride in being in business for the last 44
years
