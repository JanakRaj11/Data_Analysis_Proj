options to comply with future ghg regulations
mge takes its environmental per
formance seriously and is voluntarily
reducing its co2 rates even without
regulations if potential ghg regulations
are enacted mge will have already laid
the groundwork to manage its co2
impacts and minimize risks through
energy 2015 co2 monetization and
monitoring new technology and
approaches

the company will examine a combina
tion of mitigation options to respond
to potential co2 regulations options

  reducing co2 emissions by changing
   generation approaches such as
