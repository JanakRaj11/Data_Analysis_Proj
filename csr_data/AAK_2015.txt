during 2014 our global lost time injury rate at our produc
tion sites dropped by an impressive 58 percent from 12 to
05 moreover lost day rate  a measurement of the sever
ity of incidents  decreased by 41 percent to 72 this is an
effect of the relentless work done by our global safety team
that continued to pay off during 2014
   the negative impact of corruption is gaining more and
more attention globally both from stakeholders and from
tightened legislation businesses all over the world are
exposed to corruption risks on a daily basis we already
address anticorruption in our code of conduct our supplier
 code of conduct and our code of conduct for agents and
 distributors but in addition we have rolled out two elearning
 modules for our employees in order to increase their aware
 ness of corruption and to give them knowledge about how to
 deal with it

local engagement
being a global company aak contributes to the develop
ment of the local communities in which we operate we
do so primarily by creating jobs paying taxes and doing
business with local enterprises in addition we endeavour to
be a good corporate citizen by taking issues such as health
and safety diversity labour standards and our environmental
impact seriously
   however we realize that there are a variety of different
ways to further engage actively with the local communities
in which we are situated i am very pleased to see the many
ways in which our employees truly engage with their local
communities the initiatives presented in this report are only
a few of those implemented by our employees

responsibility going forward

ferrero palm oil charter what does that mean
moving beyond certification ferrero launched a palm oil
charter in 2013 to strengthen the commitment to responsible
sourcing of palm oil the charter has ten specific criteria to
address the leading causes of deforestation and to create
a balance between the conservation of the environment
community needs and economic benefit and viability fer

targets of the charter to achieve sustainable supply chains
becomes extremely challenging when a single actor takes on
the journey alone which is why it is inevitable to work closely
together with suppliers to ensure continuous progress

supply chain
this section covers activities related to the sourcing of raw materials that aak uses
in its production plants sustainable sourcing of raw materials is the backbone of
aaks business and a key element of the aaktion program the combination of the
right raw materials and valueadding functionality is key to the wide range of solu
tions offered just as it is vital for aak to obtain the right raw materials aak places
equal emphasis on sustainable growing and procurement for this reason aak
has implemented a supplier code of conduct that among others applies to aaks
direct raw material suppliers worldwide



continued enforcement of aak supplier code of conduct
introduced in late 2009 the aak supplier code of conduct

supplier management

in addition to palm oil shea and rapeseed aak processes
a range of other raw materials while aaks engagement in
palm oil and shea is evident the work to enhance sustain
ability aspects covers all the raw materials in the companys
supply chain
   until 2010 aak operated two different supplier approval
practices since then the company has been working to
integrate them into one common practice based on quality
food safety environmental and ethical requirements today
aaks supplier approved process is globally based on the
same principles
   the supplier code of conduct is a fundamental tool for as      materials suppliers still by urging suppliers to positively in
sessing suppliers in this context aak has decided to work        fluence their suppliers aak aims to broaden the companys
within its sphere of influence ie to focus on those whom        sphere of influence and inspire other players in the supply
aak has the best chance of influencing  aaks direct raw          chain to act responsibly




  
          minimal impact on the environment


aak takes a holistic approach to responsible sourcing of           what commitments does aak make to ensure no
its raw materials what does that mean                            deforestation
a holistic approach for aak means that we are interested         aak strives to do business with honest and committed palm
in engaging and developing the entire supply chain in the          oil suppliers who manage their production in an environ
large number of countries around the world from where our          mental and sustainable manner and in accordance with our
raw materials originate our approach includes responsible         aak palm oil policy and our aak supplier code of conduct

adherence to social and environmental standards as well as         production and we are very committed to ensure no defor

aak will continue and further strengthen its obligation to         of palm oil and associated products including palm kernel
source raw materials in a sustainable and ethical way and          oil is a means to assess if a supplier works in accordance
always with respect for people involved in our operation and       with aaks palm oil policy in parallel with the work on estab

to responsible sourcing we can create and secure our future       assessment is necessary for us to prioritize efforts and to
as well as create value for our customers                         identify those origins where there is a significant risk of policy

what measurements does aak take in order to source its
raw materials with minimal environmental impact
to minimize our environmental impact is important to aak
and we seek to optimize our supply chain so that our carbon
footprint is kept to a minimum last year we opened a new

as part of implementing our sustainable palm oil policy             origin we managed to end 2014 at 89 percent traceable

become a mandatory requirement for new suppliers as part               for oil being produced away from origin we generally
of our standard approval procedure for palm oil suppliers          find that the whole industry is having difficulties in getting
2014 was a successful year in the sense of relatively quickly       fully traceable oil to the mill level the reason is that much of
adjusting our supply chain to meet the necessary require           these suppliers feedstocks are commingled in land tanks at

for us to work closely with our suppliers and explain to them       this makes it difficult to maintain traceability back to mills
why aak requests information which for some suppliers is            where the crude oils could possibly have been produced
regarded as sensitive information nevertheless our suppli           despite our strong progression on traceability during 2014
ers have generally welcomed the initiative which aak among          our journey is far from completed it has to be emphasized

          kolo nafaso  womens groups in
          burkina faso


we continue to develop kolo nafaso our womens groups
program in burkina faso kolo nafaso which means the
house of shea kernel benefits started as a project in 2009
but has now developed into a program consequently this is
not on trial basis but has turned into one of the ways in which
aak are sourcing shea kernels on a permanent basis
   during the season 20142015 we have been reaching out
to 55000 women our goal was 50000 but so far we have
experienced an ever increasing interest from women and
womens groups to participate in the program the result is
very much aligned with our aim to reach out to a broader
base of women
   the women should benefit from our way of working which
is by following the fair trade principles aak is prefinancing
educating the women in how to process the shea giving
support in logistical issues as well as paying a quality bonus
but not only the women will benefit from being able to deliver
quality shea kernels aak will also benefit from buying shea
kernels that are both traceable and of better quality
   for the coming season we intend to increase the number
of women even further to include 70000 women we also
create work for local people with positions such as extension
workers team leaders drivers accountants and warehouse
personnel to increase the safety awareness we have put
time and resources into new safety gear for our extension
workers driving around on inferior roads our personnel
has recently participated in a firstaid course which should
increase their possibility to help each other and the people
around us in case of need
   the cooperation with the womens groups and being on
the ground in many areas of burkina faso is vital to aak it
helps us to get to know much more about the value chain
and also to spread our knowledge to raise awareness

environment
the section on environment covers aaks impact on the environment in terms of
consumption and emissions from our production plants it is a clear top priority
for us to minimize our use of natural resources and emissions per processed final
product even though our stronger focus on speciality drives a higher degree of
processing we have been able to create strong results within this area over the
last years and also during this year due to a strong focus on internal and external
benchmarking as well as best practise sharing to make this section easier to
navigate it has been divided into four subsections energy air water and waste

aaks production plants differ in size capacity and the types      to achieve this environmental projects are implemented
of processes used processing vegetable oils is both com        consumption and emissions are monitored and best practic
plex and energyintensive                                       es are identified by benchmarking production plants against
   aak is very much aware of the footprint that production       each other and against other players in the industry a hand
plants leave on the environment therefore the company          ful of aaks various environmental projects are described in
constantly strives to reduce its consumption of energy and       this section presented by the employees who are directly
water and to reduce waste and emissions as part of the         involved in achieving the results
aaktion program the aim is to become more environmen              as a matter of course we take environmental laws and
tally friendly  and improve day by day                         regulations very seriously and are proud to report that in
                                                                 2014 we recorded no incidents of noncompliance




environmental objectives
resource efficiency                                              waste
a common way of measuring resource efficiency is to calcu       sending waste to landfill means not utilizing any of the po
late the amount of resources consumed versus the produc         tential value that may still be present whats more in many
tion output however aaks strategy of producing and selling    countries a landfill tax has been introduced to reduce the
more specialized refined products means that all things        amount of waste disposed of in this way

   aak does not have a group policy that stipulates a com       employees than to female employees not because the
mon crossgroup notice period for significant operational       basic salary for male employees is higher but because male
changes instead we abide by national legislation and local     employees generally have jobs with a higher salary for the
agreements based on collective bargaining combined with         same job the salary for male and female employees is the
that which is outlined in the csr policy we give fair notice   same

a threeyear research project financed by the danish devel
opment cooperation danida through the danish embassy in
burkina faso was launched in june 2015 during a work
shop in bobodioulasso the aim of the project is to secure
the shea supply for future generations the shea parkland
in west africa is getting older and the rejuvenation of shea
trees in the fields is therefore of utmost importance further
more the pressure on the trees could be on the increase
due to population growth modernization of agriculture and
an increased use of shea trees for fuel wood
   the project which is called researchdevelopment project
on shea tree regeneration is a partnership between aak
the national agricultural and environmental research
institute inera and treeaid a british development
and environmental ngo inera will bring in the technology
package treeaid will teach the techniques in the vil
lages and aak will set their womens groups and extension
workers at the disposal of the project the aim is not to do        aak very much believes that it is time to start regenerat
fundamental research but to base the project on existing          ing the shea parkland in west africa for the benefit of future
results from the research and adapt them to a context of          generations

          support to school in benin west africa


in may 2014 school benches donated by aak were delivered              the number of students is likely to increase further and
to collège denseignement général de komiguéa in order             aak is already planning for additional support  perhaps with
for the school to be able to handle the large influx of mainly   more school benches but definitely with teaching materials
girl students the number of schoolgirls have increased dra       through an upcoming project we will provide the schools
matically since the benin government decided that schooling        library with lending books for students who cant afford to buy
for girls should be free this great initiative meant however    their own
no funding of school benches buildings or books
   the village of komiguéa is located next to aaks shea pro      christer yxell
curement center and many of the employees come from the            country manager benin and togo
village therefore we at aak really wanted to help together
with the people of komiguéa we have now been able to ex
