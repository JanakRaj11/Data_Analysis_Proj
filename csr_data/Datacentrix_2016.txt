   relating to transactions with other components of the same entity
 whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entitys chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources
   to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and
 for which discrete financial information is available

reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria
 its reported revenue from both external customers and intersegment sales or transfers is 10 or more of the combined
   revenue internal and external of all operating segments or
 the absolute measure of its reported profit or loss is 10 or more of the greater in absolute amount of i the combined reported
   profit of all operating segments that did not report a loss and ii the combined reported loss of all operating segments that
   reported a loss or
 its assets are 10 or more of the combined assets of all operating segments

if the total external revenue reported by operating segments constitutes less than 75 of the entitys revenue additional operating
segments must be identified as reportable segments even if they do not meet the quantitative thresholds set out above until at
least 75 of the entitys revenue is included in reportable segments

property and equipment
all items of property and equipment except for land which is stated at cost are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation
and any impairment losses costs include costs incurred initially to acquire or construct an item of property and equipment and
costs incurred subsequently to add to or replace part of it costs relating to the daytoday servicing of items classified as property
and equipment are recognised in profit or loss if a replacement cost is recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property and
equipment the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised depreciation is charged so as to writeoff the cost of assets
over their estimated useful lives to their residual values using the straightline method depreciation commences when the assets
are ready for their intended use

assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or where
shorter the term of the relevant lease computer equipment utilised in large enterprise outsourcing contracts are depreciated over
the term of the contract which is considered to be the useful life to their residual values

when the recoverable amount of an asset has declined below its carrying amount the carrying amount is reduced to reflect the
decline in value in determining the recoverable amount of assets expected future cash flows are discounted to their present values

a gain or loss arising on the disposal or derecognition of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss

spare parts are included in property and equipment if it meets the definition of property plant and equipment in terms of ias 16
otherwise it is classified as inventory

impairment of assets
at each reporting date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is
any indication of impairment goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis regardless of whether there are any indicators
of impairment or more frequently when there is an indication that the cashgenerating unit to which it belongs may be impaired

if any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss
if any where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset the group estimates the recoverable
amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs if the recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is
estimated to be less than its carrying amount its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount

impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss for the year it is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated
to the cashgenerating unit and then to the other assets of the cashgenerating unit on a prorata basis the recoverable amount is
determined in terms of the value in use

other than for goodwill where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount this is done so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years a reversal of an
impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit and loss unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount in which case
the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase

a cashgenerating unit within the group is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows that are largely
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets

intangible assets

goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of the groups interest over the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities of a division subsidiary at the date of acquisition goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less
accumulated impairment losses

a recognised impairment loss is never reversed in a subsequent period on disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of
goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal

software
all items of software are stated at original cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses amortisation is charged so as
to writeoff the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives to residual values using the straightline method

intangible assets  business combinations
other intangible assets are stated at fair value as determined as part of business combinations less accumulated amortisation
other intangible assets are amortised over the estimated useful lives of the relevant assets

leases
at inception of an arrangement the group determines the classification of the arrangement as a finance lease or an operating lease
leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to
the lessee all other leases are classified as operating leases

the group as lessee
assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or if lower at
the present value of the minimum lease payments the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial
position as a finance lease obligation lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability finance charges related to leases are recognised
in profit or loss as they accrue

assets held under operating leases are not recognised in the groups statement of financial position rentals payable under operating
leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straightline basis over the term of the relevant lease benefits received and receivable as
an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straightline basis over the lease term

the group as lessor
assets utilised in finance lease arrangements with the group as lessor are not recorded as assets of the group amounts due from
lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the groups net investment in the leases finance lease
income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the groups net investment
outstanding in respect of the leases and is recognised in profit or loss

rental income from operating leases excluding costs for other services is recognised on a straightline basis over the term of the
relevant lease and recognised in profit or loss initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to
the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straightline basis over the lease term amounts due from the lessee are
recognised as receivables

tax
income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax the charge for current tax is based on the
results for the year as adjusted for items which are nontaxable or disallowed it is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
by the reporting date

deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax base used in the computation of taxable profit in principle deferred
tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised such assets and liabilities
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business
combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit

deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising from investment in subsidiaries except where the
group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future

tax continued

deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled deferred tax
is recognised in profit or loss for the year except when it relates to items recognised directly to other comprehensive income or
equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with accordingly

deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable
entities when the different taxable entities intends to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis

inventories
all inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value cost is determined on the weighted average basis redundant
and slowmoving inventories are identified and writtendown with regard to their estimated economic or realisable values the net
realisable value is determined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to
make the sale

when inventories are sold the carrying amount is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised

financial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument

financial assets
financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is party to a contract
whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially
measured at fair value plus transaction costs except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss

financial assets are classified into the following specified categories financial assets at fair value through profit or loss fvtpl
heldtomaturity financial assets availableforsale afs financial assets and loans and receivables the classification depends
on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition

effective interest method
the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over
the relevant period the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts including all fees paid
or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the
expected life of the financial asset or where appropriate a shorter period income is recognised on an effective interest basis for
debt instruments other than those financial assets designated as at fvtpl

loans and receivables
trade receivables loans and other short term receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market are classified as loans and receivables loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method less any impairment interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate except for shortterm receivables
when the recognition of interest would be immaterial

impairment of financial assets
financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period financial assets are impaired where
there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted

for all other financial assets including finance lease receivables objective evidence of impairment could include
 significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty or
 default or delinquency in interest or principal payments or
 it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation

financial assets continued
impairment of financial assets continued
for certain categories of financial asset such as trade receivables assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis

for financial assets carried at amortised cost the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount
and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate the carrying
amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade
receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account when a trade receivable is considered
uncollectible it is writtenoff against the allowance account subsequent recoveries of amounts previously writtenoff are credited
against the allowance account

changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss

derecognition of financial assets
the group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity if the group neither transfers
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset the group recognises
its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay if the group retains substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset the group continues to recognise the financial asset and also
recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received

financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the group

classification as debt or equity
debt and equity instruments are classified either as financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangement

equity instruments
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities
equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs

financial liabilities
financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fvtp or financial liabilities at amortised cost

financial liabilities at amortised cost
financial liabilities at amortised cost including borrowings are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method with interest expense recognised on an effective yield
basis the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest
expense over the relevant period the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments
through the expected life of the financial liability or where appropriate a shorter period

derecognition of financial liabilities
the group derecognises financial liabilities when and only when the groups obligations are discharged cancelled or they expire

derivative financial instruments
the group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk
including foreign exchange forward contracts further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 31

derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to
their fair value at each reporting date the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately

1 summary of significant accounting policies continued

revenue
revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided in the normal course of business net of discounts and valueadded taxation

revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the group the
amount of revenue can be measured reliably and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured
reliably

contracts containing multielements are split upfront into the various elements ie the sale of goods and service and maintenance
components are separately measured and recognised

revenue earned from the sale of goods is recognised when goods are delivered and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed

revenue derived from services rendered relating to service and maintenance contracts are recognised by reference of the stage of
completion the stage of completion of the contract is directly linked to the period of the contract which varies between 12 to 36
months the revenue received in relation to these contracts is deferred and recognised over the remainder of the contract life

rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straightline basis over the term of the relevant lease and classified as revenue

the interest income earned on finance leases are recognised as revenue

interest and dividends received
interest income on investments is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate
applicable which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to
that assets net carrying amount

dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established

foreign currencies
transactions in currencies other than south african rands are initially recorded at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the
transactions monetary assets and liabilities denominated in such currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at reporting date
profits and losses arising on exchange are accounted for in profit or loss

finance costs
all finance costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred as the group has no qualifying assets as
defined in ias 23 borrowing costs

employee benefits

shortterm employee benefits
shortterm employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided a liability is recognised for the amounts expected to be
paid if the group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee
and the obligation can be estimated reliably

sharebased payment transactions
the group issues equitysettled payments to certain employees equitysettled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at
the date of grant the fair value determined with the binomial model at the grant date of the equitysettled sharebased transactions
is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and
adjusted for the effect of nonmarket vesting conditions at each reporting date the group reconsiders the estimates made

the expected life used in the binomial model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate for the effects of non
transferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations options are granted to employees and directors in terms of equity
compensation plans at fair value of the companys shares at the date of granting the options when exercised at a later date shares
are issued at the option value

1 summary of significant accounting policies continued

employee benefits continued
sharebased payment transactions continued
any losses or profits incurred by the group or the datacentrix holdings share trust on the exercise of options by employees are
accounted for in share premium shares held by the trust are treated as treasury shares any potential losses that could be incurred
by the trust where vested options are immediately exercisable are recognised in share premium potential losses or profits on vested
options exercisable at future dates or profits on options exercisable immediately are disclosed by way of a note

retirement benefits
payments to defined contribution retirement plans are recognised as an expense as they fall due unpaid amounts are reflected as a
liability at reporting date and prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction in future
payments is available

other employee benefits
the groups net obligation in respect of longterm employee benefits is the amount of future benefits that employees have earned in
return for their services in the current and prior periods that benefit is discounted to determine the present value benefits are
classified as shortterm in nature if these are expected to be paid within 12 months after the end of the reporting period

leave pay accrual
the leave pay accrual included under the employee related liabilities in note 25 relates to possible vesting leave pay to which
employees may become entitled upon leaving the employment of the group the accrual arises as employees render a service that
increases their entitlement to future compensated leave and is calculated based on an employees total cost of employment the
accrual is utilised when employees become entitled to and are paid for the accumulated leave pay or utilise compensated leave due to
them

critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

critical judgements in applying the groups accounting policies
in the process of applying the groups accounting policies which are described earlier in this note management has made the
following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements

revenue recognition
note 3 sets out the different types of revenue recognised for the businesses of technology solutions managed services and business
applications in making its judgement of how to treat the revenue of the various transactions management considered the detailed
criteria for the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods and services set out in ias 18 revenue and in particular whether the
group had transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods

where a single contract price is negotiated with a customer for both goods and services the split is determined with reference to the
usual sales prices for these specific goods and services

consolidation of the datacentrix holdings share trust  share incentive trust of the group
management considered the various elements on determining whether it controls and should consolidate the datacentrix holdings
share trust as set out in ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements and the definition of a structured entity as set out in ifrs 12
disclosure of interests in other entities

management has made considerations from strategic points of view which include datacentrix holdings being closely involved in the
design and purpose of the trust as a vehicle to operate the share incentive scheme of the group and the authority to appoint the
trustees of the trust from an operational perspective the trust receives financial support from datacentrix holdings limited which
also includes the absorption of any potential deficit of the trust on termination should this occur and the fact that the operations of
the trust is considered to be contingent to the purpose of the trust based on these indicators the trust is a structured entity and is
controlled by datacentrix holdings limited and therefore consolidated in the group

key sources of estimation uncertainty
the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below

1 summary of significant accounting policies continued

critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
critical judgements in applying the groups accounting policies continued

impairment of goodwill
determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash generating units to which goodwill has
been allocated the value in use requires the group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit
and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value a fiveyear model is applied refer to note 11 for details

useful lives and residual values of assets
useful lives and residual values of assets are reviewed at least once a year at year end management is of the opinion that the useful
lives and residual values of the assets currently carried are in line with industry norms refer to note 10 11 and 12 for details

inventory carried at net realisable value
the net realisable value of inventory represents the estimated selling price in the current market at year end the group provides for
the amount which the cost of inventory is higher than the net realisable value multiplied by the units of stock on hand at year end no
such provision was required in the current or prior year

allowance for credit losses
the allowance for credit losses relates to possible recoverability and ageing issues regarding specific debtors these are analysed on
a oneonone basis first and then on a portfolio basis objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include
the groups past experience of collecting payments an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average
credit period of 45 days as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on
receivables

fair value of financial instruments
as described in note 31 the directors used their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments
not quoted in an active market for derivative financial instruments assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted
for specific features of the instrument other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on
assumptions supported where possible by observable market prices or rates

fair value of sharebased payments reserve
the fair value is determined using the binomial model refer note 28 for inputs and assumptions made in the binomial model

adoption of new and revised international financial reporting standards ifrs
in the current year the group has adopted all of the new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the international
accounting standards board iasb and the international financial reporting interpretations committee of the iasb that are
relevant to its operations

the intangible assets included above have the following finite useful lives
 customer relationships five years 2015 five years
 other intangible assets  licences fifteen years 2015 fifteen years

additions to intangible assets relate to the acquisition of infrasol proprietary limited as disclosed in note 14

customer relationships have been valued in accordance with an excess earnings multiperiod excess earnings method meem
valuation method which considers the projected earnings attributable to existing customer relationships at the time of the
acquisition the group reviews the useful lives of the intangible assets at the end of each reporting period no changes have been
deemed necessary in the current or prior year

the group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired the
calculations were done with reference to the smallest cash generating units being the
 gauteng commercial business within the technology solutions division
 enterprise resource planning business within the business applications division
 gauteng enterprise information management business within the business applications division
 infrasol proprietary limited and
 enetworks proprietary limited respectively

the recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined based on value in use this value in use is determined by means
of a discounted cash flow model five year cash flow forecasts were used to assess this the key assumptions in the calculations
included an average discount rate of 15 2015 15 4 terminal growth rate and expected volume growth of 7 the risk profiles
of the cash generating units are considered to be similar and hence a similar discount rate has been used management considers
these rates to be highly conservative

no indicators of impairment were present based on the current year review and therefore no impairment loss was recognised

estimation of fair values
the following summarises the valuation methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments
reflected in the tables below

loans and receivables
the carrying value of loans and receivables which include cash and cash equivalents with a remaining life of less than one year
approximates fair value due to the shortterm period to maturity the fair value of longterm receivables is calculated based on the
present value of future principal and interest cash flows

other financial liabilities
the carrying value of other financial liabilities with a maturity of less than one year approximates fair value due to their shortterm
nature for longer maturities fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flow

forward exchange contracts
the fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on observable inputs quoted in the market within the valuation model which
compares the contracted forward rate to the present value of the current forward rate on an equivalent contract with the same
maturity date

investments
the fair value of heldtomaturity investments is calculated based on the present value of future principal and dividend cash flows

fair value hierarchy
the tables below analyse financial instruments carried at cost which approximated fair value by valuation method the different
levels have been defined as follows
 level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as
     prices or indirectly ie derived from prices
 level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs

markets the executive committee monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the group through
monthly analysis reports which analyse risks these risks include market risk currency risk interest rate risk and price risk credit

foreign exchange risk interest rate risk credit risk the use of financial derivatives and nonderivative financial instruments and the
investment of excess liquidity the group does not enter into or trade financial instruments including derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes
