 at a glance global warming may seem like an issue that is far removed from the kirin group however
 climate change is already having a major impact on our business in sri lanka which is the main
 production region of the tea leaves used to make kirin gogonokocha  landslides caused by torrential
 rainfall in 2015 caused major damage to many of the tea farms and the people who worked there
 and at the end of last year they were struck by widespread drought in australia one of our major
 manufacturing centers the effects of drought have caused major impediments to operations in the past
 it was against this background that the kirin group established global warming as one of the key
 themes of its longterm environmental vision and it has engaged in emission reduction efforts
 with the goal of halving co2 emissions compared to 1990 levels across the entire value chain of the                         50 reduction of co2 emissions                            70 reduction of co2 emissions

       so different from conventional plants                                                                                      savings although the plant had continued to implement watersaving activities it was
       because the facility had watersaving functions we did not make new capital investments                                   difficult to clear the hurdle of 40 m3kl due mainly to an increasing frequency of cleaning

       cascade system for water was introduced
       this used rinsing water for the pipe and tank cleaning process as cleaning water in the pre                                membrane technology which filters impurities at an ion level and does not permeate
       washing process cleaning water was further recycled for use as reserved cleaning water                                    anything but water this facility was introduced in 2008 by lion a group company in
       however the system was not easy to control because it was difficult to maintain a good                                     australia where the risk of droughts is higher than in japan because the facility made
       balance between the amount of recoverable water and the amount of water consumed                                           it possible to reuse water through sophisticated processing it was also introduced in
       and to match the timing of collection and consumption therefore we thoroughly confirmed                                   japan

       adjusted the amount of cleaning water as a result we managed to accumulate expertise for                                  water that we previously drained and we managed to achieve a water intensity of 39
       effectively using the facility and succeeded in saving a significant amount of water                                       m3kl in 2010 the fiscal year in which we installed the facility we continued to make
       to change the conventional process there is a need for example to confirm and                                            improvements and currently post water intensity below 37 m3kl today this water
       guarantee that cleaning is performed reliably as well as its quality during the cleaning                                    saving technology is being shared within the kirin group and the entire group continues
       process to achieve this we organized a team by appointing new members responsible                                         to pursue watersaving activities

       responses to climate change and water issues in tea leaf production regions through certification


       tea farms in sri lanka which are a major production region of the black tea leaves
       used in the kirin gogonokocha  range have suffered major impacts from climate
       change in recent years in the rainy season heavier rainfall than usual has become
       more frequent and in the uva region which is an important producer of black tea
       there have been landslides that have caused major loss of life at the glen alpin
       tea estate which kirin representatives visited in february 2017 we were told that
       a village in the highlands at an altitude of 1500 meters had been ordered by the
       government to relocate due to the risk of landslides in the training for rainforest
       alliance certification the farmers are taught how to prevent fertile soil from being
       washed away by erosion caused by rain specifically they are taught to plant
       grass whose roots sink deep into the soil and crawl along the ground on slopes




                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
       to prevent the rain from hitting the ground directly and eroding the soil this kind




                                                                                                                                                                                                                             activity

       of action simultaneously prevents disasters such as landslides caused by rain and
       prevents the loss of fertile soil and is also a climate change adaptation measure
       another important action is to prevent pollution of the rivers from wastewater
       from the tea farms tea farms are dispersed throughout the highlands of inland sri
       lanka so any pollution of the rivers will impact on the people living downstream




                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
       with rainforest alliance certification for example even if the tea crops are
       sprayed with pesticides the farmers are taught to keep the amount of pesticide
       sprayed to a minimum and to establish buffer zoned of a certain distance from the      water filter system that uses bricks pebbles sand coconut shells charcoal and other materials
       rivers where no spraying is to take place these measures prevent the rivers from
       being polluted by pesticides factory wastewater is also filtered appropriately
       before being discharged into the waterways or disposed of through percolation
       in the ground many of sri lankas tea farms are very large in scale with several
       thousand people living on the farm therefore handling of domestic wastewater




                                                                                                                                                                                                                 environmental management
       from those homes is also important partly because sri lanka is still a developing
       nation joint wastewater treatment tanks are expensive and out of the reach of
       most people so wastewater is treated by filtrating it through materials that are
       easy to obtain locally such as bricks pebbles sand coconut shells and charcoal
       proper treatment of the farm residents domestic wastewater is included in the
       criteria for rainforest alliance certification the sri lankan tea farms appreciate
       the act of obtaining certification as it is helping to prevent the pollution of sri    some locations have not made progress in this area but improvements are being planned in anticipation of
                                                                                               obtaining certification
       lankas rivers and to conserve biodiversity on the tea farms and their surrounding
       areas as well as contributing to improvements in the sanitary conditions of the

       water is the main resource for the kirin group and although we at the group have             into account the balance with energy consumption and other environmental measures going
       conventionally made keen efforts to save water we are coming to realize that only so        forward we will operate based on this fundamental policy and make efforts to reduce water
       much watersaving can be done based on creativity and innovation in order to further        consumption in line with the level of water risk at each location
       save water we would need to recycle and reuse water by consuming more energy that          on the other hand in regions whose water security is at high risk there is potential for

   in collaboration with lions suppliers the lion achieved 517 reduction in weight of per
   plastic hdpe bottle depending on the production site packaging plant we were able to
   achieve bottle weights of between 60 grams and 68 grams per bottle down from the original
   72g this light weighting project is estimated to reduce the hdpe amount by around 290
   tonnes per year we are aiming to implement a similar project for our 2l milk bottles reducing
   the bottle weight from 405g to 375g

   dairy farms total costs recent personalised onfarm energy
   assessments by dairy australia found that while no two dairies are
   the same milk cooling milk harvesting and hot water production
   are the areas of highest energy use the assessments identified
   opportunities for farmers to increase profitability by reducing costs
   and simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas emissions
   seven lion landcare grant recipients used the funding to
   implement the proposed assessment changes for example
   replacement of constant speed vacuum pump with variable speed
   controlled pump or conversion of waste milk heat to water heating

   reducing losses from disposing of food products
   kirin holdings participates in japan tcgf which was launched by companies in the consumer
   goods industry in august 2011 and pursues activities to resolve common issues in areas
   where they do not compete for example the sustainability project committee identifies and
   aims to resolve environmental issues in the value chain of manufacturing distribution and

   sales processes eg stop global warming reduce wastes etc specifically the committee is
   working to change to labeling the year and month as the best before date for soft drinks by
   so doing we expect to see significant effects on cutting losses from disposing of products
   also we can cut environmental loads on the supply chain co2 emissions from transporting
   between distribution centers and transportrelated activities etc and reduce inefficiencies
   eg storage space in distribution warehouses and loading and unloading tasks at stores as
   well by changing how to manage product delivery storage and display in stores based on the
   new bestbefore labelling
   we also continue to exchange information on retail sales and demand fluctuation factors with
   plants and distribution centers to improve demand projections and reduce disposal losses
   in addition we will move forward with efforts to reduce disposal losses by strictly managing
   sales volume targets implementing these steps we will prevent valuable biological resources
   and containers and packaging from going to waste
