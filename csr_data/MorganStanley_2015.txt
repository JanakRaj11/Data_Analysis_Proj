equity securities prices may fluctuate in response to specific situations for each company industry market conditions and general economic environment companies paying dividends can reduce or cut payouts at any time
bonds are subject to interest rate risk when interest rates rise bond prices fall generally the longer a bonds maturity the more sensitive it is to this risk bonds may also be subject to call risk which is the
risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option fully or partially before the scheduled maturity date the market value of debt instruments may fluctuate and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may
be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer
international investing entails greater risk as well as greater potential rewards compared to us investing these risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of
currency fluctuations these risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economics
reits investing risks are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate lack of liquidity limited diversification and sensitivity to economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions
private funds which include hedge funds are private equity funds often engage in speculative investment techniques and are only suitable for longterm qualified investors investors could lose all or a
substantial amount of their investment they are generally illiquid not tax efficient and have higher fees than many traditional investments
the investor should note that funds that invest exclusively in one sector or industry involve additional risks the lack of industry diversification subjects the investor to increased industryspecific risks
