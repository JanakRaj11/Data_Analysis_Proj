sustainability is an economic state where the demands
placed upon the environment by people and commerce can
be met without reducing the capacity of the environment to
provide for future generations it can also be expressed in the
simple terms of an economic golden rule for the restorative
economy  leave the world better than you found it take no
more than you need try not to harm life or the environment
make amends if you do

my school initiative by employees in pune
my school is an initiative anchored by a group of selfmotivated employees from our pune development center encouraged and supported
by the senior leadership and the infosys foundation my school is now a reality the idea was seeded by our executive vice chairman
s gopalakrishnan when he recommended that sparsh  a healing touch the csr wing of pune dc should try to help the villages in and
around hinjewadi sparsh has been working in the area of education for a long time and the team realized that the mann school would benefit
immensely from its support
the core team started with providing raincoats and school bags to the children and a water filter to the school to help increase the attendance
of students before they realized that basic amenities like benches and desks were absent in the school students would have to sit on the bare
floor which would get terribly cold during winter and the monsoons the leaking roofs would make life even more difficult during the rains
with support from the infosys foundation the group donated benches and desks to the school it also felt the need for a proper school building
with basic sanitation facilities to arrest the dropout rate among children especially girls
sharad pawar former cabinet minister for agriculture consumer affairs food and public distribution inaugurated the school on october 16 2013
15000 employees from the pune dc and infosys foundation contributed towards the building of the school with 10 classrooms computer lab
pantry staff room and a library the overall cost of the building was us 230000 and more than half of it came from employee contributions
including amounts donated by security staff the core team consisting of 14 people and over 100 volunteers worked tirelessly for two years to
make the dream a reality
infosys pune dc was recognized for its csr effort through employee initiatives by the maharashtra chamber of commerce industries and
agriculture through the b g deshmukh award

    per capita emissions is calculated by dividing the gross ghg emissions by the total employee count across operations in india the employee count considered for fiscal year 2014 is 126612
    which is calculated by totaling the swipe count of employees and number of support staff in our offices the percentage reduction of per capita scope 12 for fiscal year 2014 against the
    baseline year 2008 appears as 593 in our annual report the number has undergone a change based on a comprehensive ghg verification carried out in may 2014 and it currently
    stands at 55

    our total scope 3 emissions have increased by 32 over fiscal year 2013 due to the change in the defra emission factors for air travel which now includes the influence of radiative
    forcing in air travel emissions the co2 emission factor has increased by 90 over the previous figure

our initiatives on waste management are spread across three
dimensions namely influencing social behavior process optimization
and the implementation of technology

influencing social behavior
employee engagement and awareness programs are conducted across
all campuses through eco clubs to sensitize employees on waste
management and achieve segregation at source all the common areas
and pantries in the campuses have colorcoded and labeled bins to
ensure segregation of waste the following initiatives are in progress 
 to make segregation easier for employees pantries and food courts
  across all campuses will have a standardized green bin for wet waste
  and blue bin for dry waste
 stickers with images to identify items that go into wet and dry waste
  bins have been designed and are being printing for all campuses
  this will educate employees on waste segregation at source              whitebreasted kingfisher mysore campus
 mailers and posters have been created to strengthen awareness and
  sensitize employees about waste reduction

process optimization
the waste generation patterns are continuously monitored in
our campuses and the process of waste management is modified
accordingly
 we have initiated a detailed quantification of all kinds of waste to
  analyze and reduce waste
 we have taken a corporate decision to ban all singleuse plastic and
  paper tableware cups spoons plates and stirrers from food courts
  we have phased out disposable cutlery in most of our campuses
  and replaced them with steel and glass cutlery with cooperation
  from our vendors this helps in reducing the waste generated and         peninsular rock agama bangalore campus
  will also make segregation easier for employees
                                                                           all of our existing campuses are situated on governmentapproved
 we have standardized the design of wastestorage yards to enable         land industrial zones none of our campuses fall within or are
  better segregation and storage and in turn enhance the recycle value    adjacent to protected areas or highbiodiversity areas as notified in the
  of waste                                                                siting guidelines issued by the ministry of environment and forests

we installed an anaerobic digestion plant in our mangalore campus to
                                                                           saplings on our campuses
convert food waste into biogas which is used for cooking in the food
courts the technology is based on thermophilic dry digestion process      the annual increment in the number of trees across our campuses over
and the digesters operate at temperatures in the range of 5055 degrees    the last six years is as follows 
celsius these plants are automated and the process parameters such
as ph gas quantity generated etc can be remotely monitored on a                          cumulative number of trees planted
computer each tonne of food waste produces about 140 m3 of biogas                                    india campuses
every day which is equivalent to three commercial cylinders
composting
we have installed composting facilities in our bangalore jaipur and
                                                                                                                                          390255




chandigarh campuses food waste along with garden waste is mixed
in equal proportions and is being composted by invessel composting
in jaipur and chandigarh and by using an organic waste converter
in the bangalore campus the compost generated is used as manure
                                                                                                                               288065

smarter operations  central command center
at infosys we use pioneering green technologies to address resource     effectiveness this capability is not just limited to diagnostics but also
conservation through an integrated design approach smart building       helps in making recommendations for new building designs
technology is the way to realize maximum benefits of integrated
designs through smarter operations
smart buildings use inbuilt artificial intelligence and energy saving
algorithms to constantly optimize operations on the go and build
highlevel diagnostics they offer maximum leverage on the variability
that exists with building operations such as weather occupancy and
equipment condition we use a combination of sensors controllers
actuators feedback and energy saving intelligence to make building
operations most efficient using this technology we have recently
set up a central command center at our bangalore office to remotely
monitor review manage and optimize our building operations
the command center has access in real time to all the smart buildings
in our campuses across the country building efficiency experts
with expertise in areas of hvac airconditioning lighting plug
load energy and water continuously review building operations in
realtime as well as analyze historical data to identify improvement
opportunities unlike standard locationbased setups which may not      central command center bangalore campus
always have trained professionals overseeing the building operations    the command center can provide data for all our india campuses
our command center has expert engineers to monitor and analyze           and buildings to our internal stakeholders  from a facility manager
data operational parameters such as design vs actual performance      to senior management  aiding them to view details from one
equipment health system key performance indicators and other            location and also get current and past data on energy consumption
diagnostic parameters at the equipment and system level and historic     equipment condition and operating patterns comparative analysis
trends are reviewed energy and water wastage are also identified and    can also be carried out easily between multiple buildings or campuses
reviewed from the command center setup centralized expertise allows     this changes the whole landscape of building operations
us to smarten our diagnostic capability and hence enhance operational

we have evaluated the reports adherence to the following principles of verisustain on a scale of good acceptable and needs improvement
stakeholder inclusiveness the stakeholder identification and engagement process includes engagement with key stakeholders of business verticals to identify key
sustainability challenges and concerns through different channels the material issues emerging from the stakeholder engagement were collected and prioritized and the
results are fairly reflected in the report in our view the level at which the report adheres to this principle is good
materiality the company has carried out the materiality assessment based on requirements of gri g4 inputs to materiality determination consider the aspects that are
internally and externally material to the organization and concerns of stakeholders in our view the level at which the report adheres to this principle is good
responsiveness we consider that the response to key stakeholder concerns through its policies management systems and governance mechanisms are fairly reflected in
the report in our view the level at which the report adheres to this principle is good
completeness the report has fairly reported the general and specific standard disclosures including the management approach monitoring systems and sustainability
performances indicators against gri g4 requirements corresponding to in accordance  comprehensive however few disclosuresperformance indicators  internal and
external to the company for geolocations beyond indian operations  are partially reportedresponded the company has confirmed that the systems for aggregating data for
these disclosures are being developed in our view the level at which the report adheres to this principle is acceptable
reliability the majority of data and information verified at head office and sites were found to be accurate some of the data inaccuracies identified during the verification
process were found to be attributable to transcription interpretation and aggregation errors and these errors have been corrected hence in accordance with the moderate level
assurance engagement we conclude that the specified sustainability data and information presented in the report are generally reliable in our view the level at which the
report adheres to this principle is good
neutrality the disclosures related to sustainability issues and performances are reported in a neutral tone in terms of content and presentation in our view the level at which
the report adheres to this principle is good

opportunities for improvement
the following is a summary of observations and further opportunities for improvement reported back to the management of infosys and are not considered for drawing our
conclusion on the report however they are indeed consistent with the managements objectives already in place
       the stakeholder engagement process may be further strengthened based on multistakeholder engagement mechanism consolidate key stakeholder concerns
            across geolocations of infosys operations and disclose key risks and its financial implications
           a system for periodic communication of sustainability performance may be evolved to disclose key sustainability performance disclosures in the companys website
            for the benefit of stakeholders
           a comprehensive supply chain risk assessment covering the value chain partners will help in evolving appropriate sustainability strategies to manage risks

our competence and independence
we are a global provider of sustainability services with qualified environmental and social assurance specialists working in over 100 countries while we did conduct other third
party assessment work with infosys in 201314 in our judgement this does not compromise the independence or impartiality of our assurance engagement or associated
findings conclusions and recommendationswe were not involved in the preparation of any statements or data included in the report except for this assurance statement dnv
gl maintains complete impartiality toward internal stakeholders interviewed during the verification process
