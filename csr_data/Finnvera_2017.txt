   our greatest impacts on the environment and society arise      it is very likely that the coming years will be characterised
indirectly through the operations of our client companies       by constant changes in the operating environment changes
one example of this is shipbuilding increasingly often cruise   that are increasingly challenging to predict changes arise
vessels use energy solutions and materials that minimise the      from factors such as political decisions and various crises
