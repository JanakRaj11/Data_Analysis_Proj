use of resources
the company monitors its use of resources mostly through its reporting to the
national regional and local governments where we operate our owned and operated
manufacturing facilities and where such reporting is required

the companys policy is to comply with relevant laws and regulations in regards
to the efficient use of resources including energy water and other raw materials
furthermore the company continuously aims to implement energy use and water
efficiency initiatives the companys manufacturing process is fairly energyintensive
as plastics are used to construct hardside luggage products plastics are used in
the form of sheets polycarbonate or polypropylene granules sheets are used in the
extrusion vacuum forming or pressure forming processes granules are used in the
injection molding process

the manufacturing process at our three plants uses a closedloop water system
                                                                                           資源使用
