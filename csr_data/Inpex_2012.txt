                                      with natural gas as the core of our business
                                    we will grow into an integrated energy company
                                   by making contributions to a stable energy supply
                                                to broader communities

                 in 2012 the inpex group takes the helm in strengthening our csrbased management
                  through the interview with our president  ceo we convey our stance in contributing
                          to societal and economic development through our business activities

                                                                      and established a companywide csr promotion system and
            in recent times energyrelated issues have               positioned csr as a foundation of management in our medium to
            gained globalwide public attention particu             longterm vision released in may 2012
            larly in japan where future energy policy                   i believe that csr not only means to fulfill a responsibility to
   has become a key issue following the great east                    society as a corporate citizen but also to create positive value using
   japan earthquake additionally global companies                   international guidance materials such as iso 26000 as a reference
   are increasingly expected to address societal issues               we strive to contribute to society through our business and develop
   though csrbased management as a company                          into a company that is regarded as an indispensable presence to
   operating globally what type of csr initiatives are               society and i expect each of our employees to constantly consider
   you implementing                                                  ways in which heshe can contribute to society through hisher

       as a company whose main business is the development of            speaking of our employee base it will become more diverse in
       oil and natural gas the first and foremost mission of the     the future with a greater ratio of nonjapanese workers as our
inpex group is to ensure a stable and efficient supply of energy     business activities become increasingly global given this
   in december 2011 inpex signed the united nations global           circumstance i believe that reflecting the diverse views and

          canada has rich reserves of shale gas and in      have gained both in japan and overseas to

     fullscale development as part of this project         shale gas is a type of unconventional natural gas the gas
          one of the growth strategies of the inpex          instead of occurring in traditional gas fields like conventional

     upstream oil and gas business and we believe           cracked by a process called hydraulic fracturing which releases
     our participation in this project will further          the gas in step with advances in extraction technology in
                                                             recent years shale gas production volumes have increased
     enrich our natural gas asset portfolio this is the     dramatically especially in north america and this type of gas
     first time that the inpex group has been                is starting to garner more attention                                   participating in our first shale gas project




entrusting our future to
renewable energy
     since 2011 i have been working in the business planing unit
which is involved in developing renewable energy supervising the
commercialization of our geothermal power generation project
     in japan which has the third most geothermal resources in the
world more and more people are paying attention to geothermal
power generation as an exceptionally promising future source of
energy although at present less than 1 of japans total power
comes from geothermal power generation it holds great promise as
a method for providing a stable supply of electricity another reason                                                                                  shusaku sako

     in june 2011 the inpex group commenced a joint survey with
idemitsu kosan co ltd in preparation for the development of
geothermal power in hokkaido and akita the first phase the
terrestrial survey has concluded and the second phase which
includes geological and physical exploration began in fiscal 2012 i
specialize in using the results of these explorations to estimate the
volume of hot water and steam in the ground it is an extremely
difficult task but this makes it all the more rewarding nothing beats
the feeling when your predictions turn out to be accurate
     in the third phase we will drill a test well to a depth of 1500 to
2000 meters to survey the actual volume of hot water and steam in
the ground if our test results are favorable we will conduct a final
series of surveys including an environmental assessment of the
surrounding area it takes about 10 years from the beginning of the
first survey until geothermal power generation commences but i
enjoy having the opportunity to participate in this kind of longterm
project
     by ensuring close communication with the local residents from
the survey phase i hope we can promote this project in cooperation
with the local community
