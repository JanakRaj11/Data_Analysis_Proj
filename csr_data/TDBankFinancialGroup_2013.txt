responsible for sustaining public trust




i have long held the view that a banks primary purpose          in the years leading up to and through the financial crisis   as we adapt to the realities of a lowinterestrate environ
is to create wealth in the real economy banking means           decisions we made at td have reinforced our commitment         ment the prospect of slower loan growth in canada and
helping clients start and grow their businesses helping         to oldfashioned banking we see ourselves as custodi       the challenging regulatory environment in the us we will
customers save for retirement and borrow sensibly to             ans of a great institution our chief responsibility  both    look at ways to be more efficient and to add new revenue
achieve their goals protecting peoples money and               social and financial  is to ensure that we hand over to       streams but what wont change is our focus on people
enabling money to move around the world quickly and              our successors a better institution than the one we joined    our customers employees and communities this focus is
safely but the financial crisis of 2008 revealed a culture      that responsibility permeates everything we do and guides      the heart and soul of td and its what makes us unique in
of greed and dishonesty that shocked the public and              us in how we run the bank it means putting customers          the world

     create a strategic framework the main suggestion from the panel was                   this feedback was particularly helpful while designing the 2012 report
     to group the material issues and present them in a framework to show where             please see page 14  for our updated discussion on material topics
     td intends to focus and the connection to tds strategy




     expand analysis from own operations to broader impacts the panel                      we do understand this assessment however tds position has been that we
     found that some material issues were defined too narrowly for example                cant make environmental demands of others until our own house is in order
     defining ghg emissions and energy in terms of tds own footprint could                 were now building what we have learned into our procurement policy to drive
     overlook opportunities to influence others in the value chain such as suppliers       diversification of our financing portfolio and to design customer products with
     and customers to reduce their impacts                                                environmental benefits read pages 5758  for more details




     be customerfocused as in 2011 panel members had a mixed reaction to the             at the heart of td is our passion to deliver legendary customer service at
     priority treat customers fairly and provide support in tough times while some       every opportunity the reference to tough times came from our ceos
     associated it with td going the extra mile to help those who needed it most           commitment in 2008 to stand by our customers in the good times and bad
     others want to see td supporting all customers always not just in tough times        as economic pressures continue to have an impact on many families and
     there was a general view that treat customers fairly was a basic expectation         businesses we believe these words to be just as relevant today
     and service excellence was more in keeping with tds culture
                                                                                            we too recognized a need to improve our handling of complaints which is why
     the panel pointed out that there is still work to do in this area such as build      in 2012 we introduced new programs in both canada and the us to empower
     ing relationships with customers making better use of the banks ombudsman            employees and improve training see page 30  for more details our preference
     program and providing useful information to lowincome individuals                    is for canadian customers to use the ombudsman service when they have been
                                                                                            unable to reach a satisfactory outcome with our business managers




     be an extraordinary workplace panel members noted the evident enthusiasm              tds employee turnover rates are comparable to our peers for the financial
     td employees have for their work and commended td for its work on diversity            services industry us turnover rates tend to be higher than those in canada
     and inclusion staff turnover was cited as a factor in the quality of customer         due to a greater number of banks
     relationships the panel suggested giving more power to frontline staff to make
                                                                                            td helps is one example of where we have empowered frontline employees to

literacy a key skill for the future

td strives to create opportunities for youth
and one way we do that is by promoting childrens
literacy which is a critical cornerstone of a childs
development


why it matters
in todays skillsbased economy robust literacy is
not a nicetohave it is a musthave

numerous studies demonstrate the impact of
improved literacy on an individuals education
health income and career opportunities
competence in basic literacy is also a necessary
foundation for skills development in other fields
such as financial literacy

there are several barriers however constraining
the ability of children to become fully literate
among them are access to books and opportunities
to read  things many of us take for granted
literacy experts also cite another challenge that
literacy is deeply underappreciated                      summer reading programs across north america       childrens literature awards which support
                                                           which helped almost 600000 children keep            childrens authors and foster new reading

internal controls that are designed to support the reporting process there are currently no legislative or regulatory
requirements requiring the bank to prepare publish or have verified a corporate responsibility report

level of assurance

accordingly we do not express a reasonable level of assurance while we considered the effectiveness of
managements internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures our assurance
engagements were not designed to provide assurance on internal controls and accordingly we express no conclusions
thereon

work performed

        defined boundary
     has the bank collated corporate data relating to the subject matter from all relevant operations level data

the procedures we undertook to form our conclusions included but were not limited to

     interviewing selected personnel to understand the key corporate responsibility issues related to the data and
        processes for the collection and accurate reporting of the subject matter


                                                                                                                         3

     where relevant performing walkthroughs of systems and processes for data aggregation and reporting

        procedures

        evidence into the report through observation

limitations of our work performed

our procedures did not include providing conclusions in relation to

     the completeness or accuracy of data sets or information relating to areas other than the subject matters
     information reported by the bank other than in its report such as information contained on its website
     managements forward looking statements
     any comparisons made by the bank against historical data
     the report being in accordance with requirements of the gri g3 or g31 guidelines other than those contained
        within the scope of our work as set out above or to a particular application level

        paper to hectares of forest to be conserved and the appropriateness of using forest conservation as an offset
        for paper purchases
     whether the obligations of the nature conservancy of canada ncc or the nature conservancy tnc
        under agreement with the bank to help to protect an agreedupon amount of forested area were fulfilled by the
        ncc and tnc

our conclusions

subject to the limitations of our scope noted above and based on our work as described in this report we conclude
that nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the three subject matters are not in all material
respects fairly presented in accordance with the gri g3 and g31 guidelines and internally developed criteria
