 case study

 chep works with unhcr
 to improve delivery of
 lifesaving refugee aid
 chep is performing an indepth study of the global supply chain network
 for the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr
 vicente escribano head of unhcrs supply management logistic service
 said the efficiency of our supply chain is often literally a matter of life and
 death to the refugees and families we serve so any improvements we can
 make could have a massive impact
 we approached chep as a global supply chain leader to ask
 if they would evaluate if and how improvements could be made
 to improve our logistics and associated costs working with
 chep is a great opportunity for unhcr and chep providing its
 resources and expertise on a voluntary basis is a real bonus
 the unhcr leads and coordinates activities worldwide to protect and
 seek durable solutions for refugees providing protection and assistance
 to more than 46 million refugees returnees internally displaced and
 stateless people
 cheps plant network optimization team in the us is reviewing the current
 state of unhcr resources to reduce the lead time required to service
 refugee camps the unhcr study involves multicountry air sea and road
 transportation and multiple data sources factors which greatly increase
 the scale and complexity of the study
 the study is due to be completed by late 2015
