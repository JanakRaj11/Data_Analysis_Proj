                                       n big cities such as hong kong one of the most densely populated areas on our planet waste




                                   i   disposal is a problem that will never go away and only gets worse over time the current and
                                       growing population of 7 million people create 1300 metric tons of sewage sludge per
                                       day  projected to increase to about 2000 metric tons by 2027  and what to do with that
                                   waste is a headachecausing challenge

                                   but where there is a problem a will to tackle the problem and a group of dedicated and creative
                                   engineers there is a solution
the sludge treatment
 facilities are the perfect        innovative spark

 example of a sustainable          for decades hong kong mixed its sewage sludge with general household waste and buried it
                                   in landfills to dilute that material and make it stable in a landfill demanded a ratio of one part
 project from relieving
                                   sludge to ten parts household waste but the volume of sludge is growing at a faster rate than
 pressure on hong kongs
                                   the volume of household waste and when those lines crossed too much sewage sludge found
 landfill sites to producing all
                                   its way into the mix
 of our own power inhouse
 through two turbines that         concern increased over the years that large amounts of sludge being deposited into the
                                   three hong kong landfills could result in the landfills becoming full early and as the volume
 utilize steam as a byproduct
                                   of sludge increased there would be insufficient municipal waste to blend with that sludge
 from the incineration
 process and exporting
 leftover power to the local
 grid there is no incoming
 main water supply and
 no sewage outfall zero
 discharge policy to the
 sevenhectare site
 everything is produced
 and processed within
 the facility

what do you do with processed sewage sludge that is still
70 percent water

hong kongs waste managers imagined and proposed a
creative solution burn it with the help of jacobs engineers
this solution has been implemented

the burn
will sludge that is mostly water burn our intuition might tell us
no but in fact it will not only will it ignite if you get it hot
enough it will generate enough calorific value to support auto
combustion

getting something so wet to burn involves heating a vibrating
sand fluidized bed incinerator and then metering the liquid
sludge onto the superheated sand bed where it ignites diesel
fuel is used to start off the process by bringing the sand up to an
operating temperature of 850ºc even with threequarters water
the sludge burns vigorously and the resulting inert ash is
about 10 percent of the original volume easily absorbed into
existing landfills

power for the people
an additional benefit of the autocombustion of the sewage
sludge is that it creates a constant supply of highpressure steam
powerful enough to make surplus electricity that is capable of
supporting up to 4000 average hong kong families

jacobs duties involve carrying out contract administration and
project management as well as providing specialist and expert
advice on design construction and operational aspects of the
hong kong sludge treatment facilities which became
operational at the beginning of april 2015

we are proud to work with the hong kong environmental
protection department and look forward to more innovative
projects in years to come

                                 fort carson aims to be net zero energy ready


                                          or the us armed forces net zero energy ready is more than just a buzzword target




                                 f        its a longterm missioncritical requirement why because without secure and
                                          uninterruptible energy supplies every mission no matter the location is subject to
                                          potential failure and of course renewable energy can reduce or eliminate commodity
                                 costs associated with fossil fuels

                                 the overall objective of net zero requires all new vertical construction be designed and
                                 constructed to minimize all utility demands and to be supplemented by renewable sources

                                 as part of the relocation of the 4th infantry division to fort carson colorado usa a combat
                                 aviation brigade was established at butts army airfield baaf in support of fort carsons goal
                                 of becoming a net zero energy installation by 2020 the development of baaf required all
                                 facilities be net zero ready with a sustainability goal of all new construction designed to
                                 achieve a minimum silver certification level under leadership in energy and environment

taking the lead
in 2012 usace omaha district awarded two separate design
build contracts for two facilities to the 13th combat aviation
brigade the first was an aviation support battalion asb
hangar a 136377squarefoot aircraft maintenance facility
that includes administrativeoperations space maintenance
and repair shops parts and tool storage more than 86500
square feet of aircraft maintenance bays 58000 square yards
of airfield pavement and two exterior rotarywing wash racks

the second contract was for a 10story air traffic control
tower atct and adjoining air field operations building
afob that provides command control and management of
flight operations and movement control for the entire baaf
the total project encompasses 22624 square feet

the quest for net zero at fort carson became very real
with a goal to complete construction on both projects by
the end of 2014 jacobs joined the designbuild team to

there is no single template for the design or type of
construction that can meet a goal as aggressive as net zero
energy ready it takes rather a combination of many design
decisions that coalesce into a unified energyefficient product
in the final design the plans for both the asb hangar and the
atct included maximizing use of energyefficient equipment
constructing highperformance building envelopes
optimizing building orientation and promoting continuous
commissioning and energy monitoring during operations

its net zero ready goal but exceeded it as a net zero building a
first of this facility type for the army the asb hangar was also
completed under the established project construction budget

sustainability goals achieved
not only did the facilities achieve high levels of energy usage
reductions they also exceeded the established sustainability
goals at no additional cost to the government

for the asb there was an 89 percent reduction in waste sent
to landfills 28 percent of onsite materials were recycled and
41 percent of building materials were acquired nearby the
whole package was honored with an award for construction
excellence ace and has achieved leed platinum
certification this is the first leed platinum hangar type
facility for the army the usace omaha district also recently
received the usace building the future sustainability award
for their partnership with the 13th combat aviation brigade on
the asb hangar

the atct diverted 78 percent of construction waste from
landfills recycled 36 percent of onsite materials and acquired
12 percent of building materials nearby

                                       ntesa sanpaolo spa a leading banking group in europe and much of the world




                                   i   commissioned the new turin headquarters to host their employees  who were scattered
                                       across ten old buildings in different parts of turin italy  in one new facility that also
                                       provides large spaces for the community

                                   old buildings limited them in other ways turin is an ancient city nestled into the western alpine
                                   arch in far northern italy a strategically important area permanently occupied for more than 2000
                                   years today it is tightly packed with historically significant art galleries restaurants churches
thanks to the clear vision        palaces opera houses piazzas parks gardens theatres libraries and museums

intesa sanpaolo wanted to honor their home city by building an
iconic new headquarters structure respectful of the history the
skyline the community and the environment from a business
standpoint they needed to reduce the total amount of office
space they occupied increase employee interaction efficiency
and effectiveness and cut operating expenses particularly rental
and energy costs

pinnacle of design
the restraints on design were as much aesthetic as physical
which led intesa sanpaolo to famed italian architect renzo piano
who designed such iconic structures as the new york times
building in new york city the shard of glass near london
bridge in england the tallest skyscraper in the european union
and the auditorium parco della musica public music complex in
rome  among many many others

with renzo pianos reputation for cultural sensitivity and status in
italy intesa sanpaolos desire to create a bioclimatic building as
their new world headquarters and with jacobs providing project
and construction management the company was set to make a
dramatic statement in their beloved hometown

the resulting tower at 166 meters high with three levels of
parking 26 floors of offices a floor for training and the first three
stories open to the public rises like a cool pinnacle of ice a
manmade counterpoise to the majestic snowcapped alps rising to
the north

emphasizing efficiency
with a final overall reduction of nearly 50 percent in energy use
and cost for lighting heating cooling pumps fans and hot
sanitary water the intesa sanpaolo tower easily qualified for
leed platinum certification the highest possible rank awarded
in september 2015 by the us green building council the leed
rating system evaluates environmental performance from a
wholebuilding perspective over its life cycle

                             healing community

                                       ustainability does not always strictly mean the use of energy and material resources




                             s         in fact one of the most important aspects of sustainability involves the daily interaction
                                       of people particularly for children and adults in need the smallest genuinely
                                       sustaining unit is family and community

                             jacobs served as program and construction manager for an excellent example of this element
                             of sustainability the bronx mental health redevelopment project in new york with six buildings
                             that enclose more than 400000 square feet on a 35acre site the facility is designed and built

the experience of being in a village over the course of the day
with a strong connection to surrounding lawns trees and birds
creates an embracing environment light is an important
component of sustainable human mental health just as
daylighting is a vital component of the design philosophy of
sustainable buildings

caring for children
the bronx childrens center provides all inpatient residential
academic recreation and clinical services for up to 86 children in
grades 112 residential areas are organized into six houses each
with two subclusters of bedrooms around a shared living area
this model has proven to be an effective way to safely supervise
children and promote social interaction in smaller groups in
each house

the children move through their daily schedule to academic
recreational and social spaces that form a neighborhood
outdoor recreational areas each with their own secure and
separate space form functional parks that surround the
building and can be accessed directly from the neighborhoods

caring for adults
the bronx adult center in a design echo of the childrens center
is arranged as a treatment mall where inviting storefronts for
patient programs are arrayed around gathering spaces along a
main street illuminated largely by natural light the design
provides a healing environment that is less institutional and
promotes participation among the 156 patients a soothing color
palette and durable costeffective finishes are inspired by
natural elements

a separate residential village includes residential space for 188
adult patients in three buildings built for environmental
sensitivity sustainability and interaction among the mental
health treatment community

brain trust
the entire bronx mental health center campus is registered
under leed leadership in energy and environmental design
and expects to earn a silver classification level because of its
impressive quantifiable results most significant were

   reduction in overall energy usage of 233 percent

   more than 87 percent of onsite generated construction waste
   diverted from landfill

   nearly 30 percent of total building materials came from
   recycled materials

   approximately 25 percent of total building materials were
   extracted harvested recovered and manufactured within
   500 miles of the project site

   approximately 80 percent of all wood used meets forest
   stewardship council fsc criteria

   77 percent of the roofs have a high reflectivity reducing cooling
   loads and therefore overall energy use

minority women and community participation was strongly
encouraged on the bronx mental health redevelopment project
through outreach programs the goal of the project team was to
maximize the public involvement and benefit by creating new
jobs and revenue for the surrounding community we tracked
business and workforce goals separately the project achieved
17 percent minority business enterprise and 14 percent
womens business enterprise participation the project also
achieved 44 percent minority 2 percent women and 18 percent
local community workforce participation

jacobs is pleased to have been involved in this project that
sustainably improves the life and health of countless residents of
the state of new york

                                            to explore the solar energy potential of southern australia they did not realize how
                                            much renewable power they would be providing a halfdecade later

                             with the recent completion of two solidstate photovoltaic pv plants that account for the largest
                             solar capacity 360000 megawatt hours each year in australia nearly 400 hectares 988 acres of
                             solar collectors now power approximately 60000 average homes in new south wales every year

together the nyngan and broken hill plants are projected to
produce 360000 megawatt hours of renewable energy annually
for the next 30 years or longer both projects became operational
last year and were officially opened at a ceremony on january 20
2016 the more than 2 million modules of pv panels installed at
the plants double australias solar output and prove the
engineering and economic viability of largescale solar plants on
the continent

industrial demand
each pv module is installed at a fixed nontracking tilt of
25 degrees facing north the opposite direction of fixed panels in
the northern hemisphere theyre wired in standard arrays that
connect to inverters that transform the direct current produced
by the sun into alternating current compatible with the
commercial power grid

the broken hill area has one of the highest levels of solar
radiation measured in new south wales making it an ideal
location for a solar power plant known as the silver city
broken hill sits on the worlds largest silverleadzinc mineral
deposits with several active mines and a city of 19000 people that
create significant and predictable longterm demand for electrical
power an existing substation near the project site allowed for
efficient connection into the national electrical grid

the remote nyngan solar plant receives strong and consistent
solar radiation and is located between the regional center of
dubbo 166 kilometers to the southeast and a cluster of mines
around cobar the town name is derived from the aboriginal
term for copper 132 kilometers to the west together they
generate persistent demand for electrical power in the region
which is well served by an existing electrical grid to distribute
the new solar energy




                                                                    29

earth friendly
the advanced cadmium telluride thin film pv modules used at
the plants produced by first solar convert sunlight into electricity
in a process that creates no air emissions no waste production no
water use and has one of the smallest carbon footprints of any
current pv technology

together the broken hill and nyngan solar plants are projected to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 300000 metric
tons of co2 equivalent per annum this is the same as
permanently removing about 88000 cars from the road
particulate and heavy metal emissions will also be significantly
                                                                         our involvement in the

when the nyngan and broken hill projects began the use of
solidstate technology was a novelty in the australian electricity

the right mix
because parks are about the confluence of natural open space
and people the best parks are designed with both in mind
with consideration of that philosophy the masterplans of the
two dallas parks were directed by public input and conceived
and executed by jacobs

the plans include long looping trails that concentrate people
and attention to the peaceful interior of the parks with ample
open space for playgrounds unstructured fields picnicking
ball fields and appreciation for historic buildings among many
other pleasant outdoor experiences

engaged communities
for the dallas projects ample time was spent consulting with
neighbors community leaders city staff and current park
users to develop final design programs open public meetings
were held multiple times and thousands of stakeholders were
invited to participate by mailed and posted notices

at the white rock lake park the communityguided master
plan created by jacobs included

     trail repair and conservation along an eroding shoreline
     included a wetlands protection development grant

     improved lighting

     a fenced park for people to enjoy their freerunning dogs

     new trails that connect to a larger regional trail system

at kiest park similar stakeholder guidance led to a new jacobs
masterplan that featured

     a loop trail connected to the regional system with parking

     public meetings

of the vibrant dallas outdoor life for years to come

     the cleaner air for scotland strategy was launched at the scottish
     transport emissions partnership annual conference held in
     november 2015 in edinburgh scotland the national cross
     government strategy sets out actions to reduce air pollution and
     health inequalities and support overall quality of life transport
     scotland and its partner organizations are tasked with developing a
     national low emissions framework nlef that will support the
     delivery of the strategy  to achieve further reductions in air
     pollution and fulfill scotlands legal responsibility to comply with the
     european union and scottish requirements for air quality

     jacobs has been working with transport scotland since july 2015 to
     provide technical support in the development of nlef to establish
     consistent and acceptable criteria and procedures across scotland to
     address poor air quality cased by emissions from road transportation

     jacobs outlined an approach with five key stages for nlef that will
     assist selected local authorities with appraising adopting and
     implementing one or more transportoriented air quality
     improvement measures the assessment procedure will aid in

       clearly identifying and understanding the air quality problem for
       areas in scotland

       identifying adopting and implementing transportoriented air
       quality improvement measures to address each problem and

       managing and evaluating the performance of measures

     to date we have produced three reports
