the likelihood of threats could be mapped relatively easily or

we continue to assess our product portfolio to identify the

to assess whether the necessary conflict minerals in our

in 2015 we expanded the number of suppliers covered by our

 targeting zero waste is ambitious abb could anchor its

basis of our opinion
a multidisciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed work at headquarters and
site level we undertook the following activities
   review of the current sustainability issues that could affect abb and are of interest to stakeholders
   review of abbs approach to stakeholder engagement and recent outputs although we had no direct
    engagement with stakeholders
   review of information provided to us by abb on its reporting and management processes relating to
    the principles
   interviews with selected directors and senior managers responsible for management of sustainability
    issues and review of selected evidence to support issues discussed we were free to choose
    interviewees and interviewed those with overall responsibility for the programmes to deliver the nine
    group sustainability objectives for 2020 we also interviewed management responsible for
    sustainability in brazil china poland and switzerland
   site visits conducted in guarulhos brazil beijing china lodz poland and lenzburg switzerland to
    review the process and systems for preparing site level sustainability data and implementation of the
    sustainability strategy we were free to choose the sites we visited and they were selected on the basis
    of the significance of their contribution to abbs overall environmental impacts to provide a
    geographical and divisional spread in 2015 and a different geographical footprint to the 2014 site visits
    the selected sites were all within the top 20 sites for impacts based on the data in scope
   review of supporting evidence for key claims and data in the report our checking processes were
    prioritised according to the materiality of issues at a consolidated corporate level
   review of the processes at group level for gathering and consolidating the specified performance data
    and for a sample checking the data consolidation



opinion
on the basis of the work undertaken nothing came to our attention to suggest that the report does not
properly describe abbs adherence to the principles in terms of reliability of the performance data with
the exception of consolidated data for lost days nothing came to our attention to suggest that these data
have not been properly collated from information reported at operational level nor that the assumptions
used were inappropriate


observations
without affecting our assurance opinion we also provide the following observations


stakeholder inclusiveness
the participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to
sustainability
abb began working with a stakeholder panel at group level in 2015 which has strengthened its approach to
stakeholder engagement the statement from the panel is a positive addition and adds to the transparency
of the report the recommendations from the stakeholder panel are useful and include short and longer
term points in addition to addressing short term priorities abb should consider developing a roadmap for
implementation of the longer term recommendations
in addition we recommend abb consider extending its stakeholder engagement arrangements to more
clearly include requirements with respect to local engagement the outcomes of these engagements
should be integrated into decision making at a global level

                     materiality
                     the process for determining the issues that are most relevant to an organisation and its stakeholders
                     this year abb sought input on the issues in its materiality matrix from the stakeholder panel validating the
                     priority issues it has identified we restate our recommendation that abb should report on the extent to
                     which different material issues are relevant at local level across the organisation
                     management of the priority issues is well embedded within the business at a group and local level
                     however the connection between targets at a site country and group level is not completely aligned and
                     there would be benefit in ensuring this is clearer
                     safety has again been an area of considerable focus for abb with development of a number of new
                     programmes to support the strategy reporting has been enhanced with the introduction of leading
                     measures hazards and safety observation tours to support the existing lagging ones data accuracy in
                     these indicators should improve as the systems become embedded
                     abb is planning to introduce peer to peer auditing programmes initially in safety to promote sharing and
                     learning across operations we recommend considering including performance data reviews in these to
                     increase confidence in data reliability and consistency
                     responsiveness
                     the extent to which an organisation responds to stakeholder issues
                     the abb sustainability board meets annually and provides senior oversight of the sustainability strategy and
                     progress it has the capacity to oversee the process of understanding and responding to strategic
                     engagement with stakeholders abb should consider whether more frequent meetings would enhance
                     oversight of the strategy and programme meetings should be timed to allow review of stakeholder input
                     as well as the annual sustainability performance report
                     the group level objectives are not consistently focused on the key programmes and activities covered by the
                     relevant issue areas we support the recommendation made by the abb sustainability board to enhance
                     the overall governance of the development of targets and tracking of progress against them this should
                     include ensuring the targets represent an appropriate challenge for the organisation
                     while the objectives dashboard page 811 provides a useful indication of performance against targets abb
                     should ensure that each target is specific and measurable and that associated kpis report actual
                     performance against each target
                     abb has sought feedback on its sustainability approach and reporting through the introduction of a
                     stakeholder panel and the move last year to assurance that considers its overall approach as well as data
                     accuracy some of the recommendations made will take time to implement it will be important in
                     demonstrating responsiveness to report on how the company has responded to feedback
                     completeness
                     how much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organisation and its stakeholders
                     is reported
                     abbs reporting of performance including the disclosure of data is comprehensive this gives stakeholders
                     confidence that these aspects are managed appropriately
                     abb has improved the basis for calculating scope 2 ghg emissions by using local emission factors rather
                     than a single global emission factor we recommend that local factors are reviewed annually to account for
                     any changes in the energy mix
                     although abb has a target for decreasing energy intensity there is currently no target for reducing green
                     house gas ghg emissions we recommend establishing a target for reducing ghg emissions we also
                     recommend abb expand on its preparedness to respond to the outputs from cop21
                     the analysis of where abb believes it can support the realization of the un sustainable development goals
                     sdgs is encouraging and we look forward to seeing this developed further
                     we restate our recommendation that abb should consider reporting on tax and include additional
                     indicators related to integrity and human rights in addition to training and capacity building




60   performance summary  abb sustainability performance report 2015

neutrality
the extent to which a report provides a balanced account of an organisations performance delivered in a
neutral tone
the section on challenges and progress adds to the overall balance of the report report users
understanding of the context for these could be improved by providing further detail throughout the report
in future
reliability
the accuracy and comparability of information presented in the report as well as the quality of underlying
data management systems
abb has established a variety of process for collecting and consolidating the various data it reports the
company continued its wellestablished annual process for submission and approval of environmental data
from its sites to a central database including an annual training process for data owners at site level for
the environmental data in scope we saw evidence that the central team had undertaken further checks and
where necessary corrected data prior to consolidation the group intends to replace the existing database
in 2016 which should further strengthen the reporting process
the kpis relating to the nine group sustainability objectives have been internally developed and we restate
our recommendation to report these definitions in future where data collection processes have already
been established for reporting these kpis the processes were clearly described by data owners we restate
our recommendation to ensure these processes are documented for continuity
last year we noted that the data for co2 from transport by own fleet is an estimated figure the basis for
which has not been reviewed in the last 5 years given that this represents around 20 of the group carbon
footprint we restate our recommendation that the basis for this estimation is reviewed
this year as last year we noted a number of cases where data reported in the global incident database
gid were lower than local systems for lost days we recommend considering how to raise visibility of this
indicator at site and country level to improve accuracy of the consolidated global data
