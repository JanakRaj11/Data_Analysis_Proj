contributors to air and ghg emissions we have a
number of emissions control measures in place to mitigate
the impact of our operations on the environment

for instance hk electric is constructing two new gasfired
generating units that will be equipped with a selective
catalytic reduction system the system significantly
improves nitrogen oxide nox removal performance and
can further reduce nox emission by 90 compared to
conventional gasfired plant

the three coalfired plants in zhuhai jinwan and siping
have enforced their emissions control in recent years to
meet and outperform tightened regulatory requirements                  avr conducts research on using co2 emissions from the plant for

information other than the consolidated financial statements and
auditors report thereon
the directors are responsible for the other information the other information comprises the information included in
the annual report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors report thereon

our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon

in connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information
and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated

if based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information
we are required to report that fact we have nothing to report in this regard


responsibilities of the directors for the consolidated financial statements
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view
in accordance with hkfrss issued by the hkicpa and the hong kong companies ordinance and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are
free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error

in preparing the consolidated financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the groups ability to
continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the directors either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations or has no realistic
alternative but to do so

the directors have delegated the oversight of the groups financial reporting process to the audit committee


auditors responsibility for the audit of the consolidated financial
statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our
opinion this report is made solely to you as a body in accordance with section 405 of the hong kong companies
ordinance and for no other purpose we do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person
for the contents of this report reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with hksas will always detect a material misstatement when it exists misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements

as part of an audit in accordance with hksas we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
scepticism throughout the audit we also

    identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to
     fraud or error design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is
     sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement
     resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery
     intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal control

     we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
     requirements regarding independence and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
     reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable related safeguards

     from the matters communicated with those charged with governance we determine those matters that were of most
     significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit
     matters we describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
     the matter or when in extremely rare circumstances we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our
     report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
     benefits of such communication

                judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of
                assets liabilities income and expenses the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
                experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results
                of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not

                period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
                periods

                judgements made by management in the application of hkfrss that have significant effect on the financial

           financial statements unrealised losses resulting from intragroup transactions are eliminated in the same
           way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment

           changes in the groups interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for
           as equity transactions whereby adjustments are made to the amounts of controlling and noncontrolling
           interests within consolidated equity to reflect the change in relative interests but no adjustments are made
           to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised

           when the group loses control of a subsidiary it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that
           subsidiary with a resulting gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss any interest retained in that
           former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is recognised at fair value and this amount is regarded
           as the fair value on initial recognition of a financial asset see note 2g or when appropriate the cost on
           initial recognition of an investment in a joint venture or an associate see note 2e

           in the companys statement of financial position an investment in a subsidiary is stated at cost less
           impairment losses see note 2l

     e	joint ventures and associates
           a joint venture is an arrangement whereby the group or the company and other parties contractually
           agree to share control of the arrangement and have rights to the net assets of the arrangement

           an associate is an entity in which the group or the company has significant influence but not control or
           joint control over its management including participation in the financial and operating policy decisions

           an investment in a joint venture or an associate is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements
           under the equity method unless it is classified as held for sale or included in a disposal group that is
           classified as held for sale under the equity method the investment is initially recorded at cost adjusted
           for any excess of the groups share of the acquisitiondate fair values of the investees identifiable net
           assets over the cost of the investment if any thereafter the investment is adjusted for the post acquisition
           change in the groups share of the investees net assets and any impairment loss relating to the investment
           see notes 2f and 2l any excess of the groups share of the acquisitiondate fair values of the investees
           identifiable net assets over the cost of the investment the groups share of the postacquisition post
           tax results of the investees and impairment losses for the year if any are recognised in the consolidated
           statement of profit or loss whereas the groups share of the postacquisition posttax items of the
           investees other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive
           income

           when the groups share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture or an associate the groups interest
           is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the group has
           incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee for this purpose
           the groups interest is the carrying amount of the investment under the equity method together with the
           groups longterm interests that in substance form part of the groups net investment in the joint venture
           or the associate

                unrealised profits and losses resulting from transactions between the group and its joint ventures and
                associates are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the investee except where unrealised
                losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case they are recognised
                immediately in profit or loss

                when the group ceases to have joint control over a joint venture or significant influence over an associate
                it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that investee with a resulting gain or loss being
                recognised in profit or loss any interest retained in a former joint venture at the date when joint control
                is lost is recognised at fair value and this amount is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a
                financial asset see note 2g or when appropriate the cost on initial recognition of an investment in
                an associate any interest retained in a former associate at the date when significant influence is lost is
                recognised at fair value and this amount is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a financial
                asset

          f   goodwill
                goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination or an investment in a joint venture or
                an associate over the groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets liabilities and
                contingent liabilities

                contingent liabilities over the cost of a business combination or an investment in a joint venture or an
                associate is recognised immediately in profit or loss

                goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses goodwill arising on a business combination is
                allocated to each cashgenerating unit or groups of cashgenerating units that is expected to benefit from
                the synergies of the combination and is tested annually for impairment see note 2l in respect of joint
                ventures or associates the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the interest
                in the joint venture or associate and the investment as a whole is tested for impairment whenever there is
                objective evidence of impairment see note 2l

          g	other investments in equity securities
                the groups and the companys policies for investments in equity securities other than investments in
                subsidiaries joint ventures and associates are as follows

                investments in equity securities are initially stated at fair value which is their transaction price unless fair
                value can be more reliably estimated using valuation techniques whose variables include only data from
                observable markets cost includes attributable transaction costs

                investments in equity securities that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair
                value cannot be reliably measured are subsequently recognised in the statement of financial position at cost
                less impairment losses see note 2l

                investments are recognisedderecognised on the date the group commits to purchasesell the investments
                or they expire

     h derivative financial instruments
           derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value at the end of each reporting period the
           fair value is remeasured the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit
           or loss except where the derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting or hedge the net investment
           in a foreign operation in which case recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the
           item being hedged see note 2i

     i   hedging

           i   fair value hedges
                 changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are
                 recognised in profit or loss along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities
                 that are attributable to the hedged risk

           ii cash flow hedges
                 where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of
                 a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk
                 of a committed future transaction the effective portion of any gain or loss on remeasurement of
                 the derivative financial instrument to fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income and
                 accumulated separately in equity in the hedging reserve the ineffective portion of any gain or loss is
                 recognised immediately in profit or loss

                 if a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or
                 nonfinancial liability the associated gain or loss is reclassified from equity and included in the initial
                 cost or other carrying amount of the nonfinancial asset or liability

                 if a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a
                 financial liability the associated gain or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the same
                 period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss such as
                 when interest income or expense is recognised

                 for cash flow hedges other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements the
                 associated gain or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the same period or periods during
                 which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss

                 when a hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised or the group revokes
                 designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur
                 the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until the transaction occurs and it is
                 recognised in accordance with the above policy if the hedged transaction is no longer expected
                 to take place the cumulative unrealised gain or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or loss
                 immediately

           iii hedge of net investments in foreign operations
                 the portion of the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value of an instrument used to hedge a
                 net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in
                 other comprehensive income and accumulated separately in equity in the exchange reserve until the
                 disposal of the foreign operation at which time the cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from equity
                 to profit or loss the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss

           an arrangement comprising a transaction or a series of transactions is or contains a lease if the group
           determines that the arrangement conveys a right to use a specific asset or assets for an agreed period of
           time in return for a payment or a series of payments such a determination is made based on an evaluation
           of the substance of the arrangement and is regardless of whether the arrangement takes the legal form of
           a lease

     l   impairment of assets

           i   impairment of investments in equity securities and other receivables
                 investments in equity securities and other current and noncurrent receivables that are stated at cost
                 or amortised cost are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is
                 objective evidence of impairment objective evidence of impairment includes observable data that
                 comes to the attention of the group about one or more of the following loss events

                     significant financial difficulty of the debtor

                     a breach of contract such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments

                     it becoming probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation

                     significant changes in the technological market economic or legal environment that have an
                      adverse effect on the debtor and

                     a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument
                      below its cost

                 if any such evidence exists any impairment loss is determined and recognised as follows

                     for investments in subsidiaries recognised at cost and joint ventures and associates recognised
                      using the equity method see note 2e the impairment loss is measured by comparing the
                      recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount in accordance with note 2lii
                      the impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to
                      determine the recoverable amount in accordance with note 2lii

                     for unquoted equity securities and other financial assets carried at cost the impairment loss
                      is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the
                      estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar
                      financial asset where the effect of discounting is material impairment losses for equity securities
                      carried at cost are not reversed

                     for trade and other current receivables and other financial assets carried at amortised cost the
                      impairment loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the
                      present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective
                      interest rate ie the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these assets where
                      the effect of discounting is material this assessment is made collectively where these financial
                      assets carried at amortised cost share similar risk characteristics such as similar past due status
                      and have not been individually assessed as impaired future cash flows for financial assets which
                      are assessed for impairment collectively are based on historical loss experience for assets with
                      credit risk characteristics similar to the collective group

                          calculation of recoverable amount

                           the recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs of disposal and value
                           in use in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
                           value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
                           money and the risks specific to the asset where an asset does not generate cash inflows largely
                           independent of those from other assets the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest
                           group of assets that generates cash inflows independently ie a cashgenerating unit

                          recognition of impairment losses

                           an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of an asset or the
                           cashgenerating unit to which it belongs exceeds its recoverable amount impairment losses
                           recognised in respect of cashgenerating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount
                           of any goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating unit or group of units and then to reduce
                           the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit or group of units on a pro rata basis except
                           that the carrying value of an asset will not be reduced below its individual fair value less costs of
                           disposal if measurable or value in use if determinable

                     reversals of impairment losses

                      in respect of assets other than goodwill an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a
                      favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount an impairment
                      loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed

                      a reversal of an impairment loss is limited to the assets carrying amount that would have been
                      determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years reversals of impairment
                      losses are credited to profit or loss in the year in which the reversals are recognised

           iii interim financial reporting and impairment
                under the rules governing the listing of securities on the stock exchange of hong kong limited the
                group is required to prepare an interim financial report in compliance with hkas 34 interim financial
                reporting in respect of the first six months of the financial year at the end of the interim period the
                group applies the same impairment testing recognition and reversal criteria as it would at the end of
                the financial year see notes 2li and 2lii

                impairment losses recognised in an interim period in respect of goodwill and availableforsale equity
                securities carried at cost are not reversed in a subsequent period this is the case even if no loss or
                a smaller loss would have been recognised had the impairment been assessed only at the end of
                the financial year to which the interim period relates consequently if the fair value of an available
                forsale equity security increases in the remainder of the annual period or in any other period
                subsequently the increase is recognised in other comprehensive income and not profit or loss

     m trade and other receivables
           trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost less
           allowance for impairment of doubtful debts see note 2li except where the receivables are interestfree
           loans made to related parties without any fixed repayment terms or the effect of discounting would be
           immaterial in such cases the receivables are stated at cost less allowance for impairment of doubtful debts

     n interestbearing borrowings
           interestbearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs
           subsequent to initial recognition with the exception of fixed interest borrowings that are designated as
           hedged items in fair value hedges see note 2ii interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised
           cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and redemption value being recognised
           in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings together with any interest and fees payable using the
           effective interest method

           for interestbearing borrowings that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges subsequent to
           initial recognition the interestbearing borrowings are stated at fair value with the fair value changes that
           are attributable to the hedged risk recognised in profit or loss see note 2ii




                                                                                                         annual report 2016   77

          o trade and other payables
                trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value except for financial guarantee liabilities
                measured in accordance with note 2si trade and other payables are subsequently stated at amortised
                cost unless the effect of discounting would be immaterial in which case they are stated at cost

          p cash and cash equivalents
                cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand demand deposits with banks and other
                financial institutions and shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known
                amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value having been within three
                months of maturity at acquisition bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part
                of the groups cash management are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the
                purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement

          q	employee benefits

                i   short term employee benefits
                      salaries annual bonuses paid annual leave and the cost of nonmonetary benefits are accrued in the
                      year in which the associated services are rendered by employees where payment or settlement is
                      deferred and the effect would be material these amounts are stated at their present values

                ii defined benefit retirement scheme obligations
                      the groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit retirement schemes is calculated separately
                      for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for
                      their service in the current and prior periods that benefit is discounted to determine the present value
                      and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted the discount rate is the yield at the end of the
                      reporting period on hong kong special administrative region government exchange fund notes that
                      have maturity dates approximating the terms of the groups obligations the calculation is performed
                      by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method

                      where the calculation of the groups net obligation results in a negative amount the asset recognised
                      is limited to the present value of any future refunds from or reductions in future contributions to the
                      defined benefit retirement scheme

                      remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling if
                      applicable and the return on plan assets excluding interest is reflected immediately in the statement
                      of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in
                      which they occur remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately
                      in the revenue reserve and will not be reclassified to profit or loss

                      the group determines the net interest expense or income for the period on the net defined benefit
                      liability or asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the
                      beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability or asset taking into account any
                      changes in the net defined liabilities or assets during the year as a result of contributions and benefit
                      payments

                iii contributions to defined contribution retirement schemes
                      obligations for contributions to defined contribution retirement schemes including contributions
                      payable under the hong kong mandatory provident fund schemes ordinance are recognised as an
                      expense in profit or loss as incurred

     r   income tax
           income tax for the year comprises current tax and movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities current
           tax and movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent
           that they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income in which case the relevant amounts of
           tax are recognised in other comprehensive income

           current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or
           substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
           previous years

           deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from deductible and taxable temporary differences respectively being
           the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
           their tax bases deferred tax assets also arise from unused tax losses and unused tax credits

           all deferred tax liabilities and all deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
           profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised are recognised

           the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured based on the expected manner of realisation or
           settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively
           enacted at the end of the reporting period deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted

           the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and is reduced
           to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow the
           related tax benefit to be utilised any such reduction is reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that
           sufficient taxable profits will be available

           current tax balances and deferred tax balances and movements therein are presented separately from
           each other and are not offset

     s financial guarantees issued provisions and contingent liabilities

           i   financial guarantees issued
                 financial guarantees are contracts that require the issuer ie the guarantor to make specified
                 payments to reimburse the beneficiary of the guarantee the holder for a loss the holder incurs
                 because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt
                 instrument

                 when consideration is received or receivable for the issuance of the guarantee the consideration is
                 recognised in profit or loss

           ii	other provisions and contingent liabilities
                 provisions are recognised for other liabilities of uncertain timing or amount when the group or the
                 company has a legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of a past event it is probable that
                 an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can
                 be made where the time value of money is material provisions are stated at the present value of the
                 expenditure expected to settle the obligation

                 where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required or the amount cannot
                 be estimated reliably the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability unless the probability of
                 outflow of economic benefits is remote possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed
                 by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more future events are also disclosed as contingent
                 liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote

                                                                                                            annual report 2016   79

          u translation of foreign currencies
                foreign currency transactions during the year are translated into hong kong dollars at the foreign exchange
                rates ruling at the transaction dates or at contract rates if foreign currencies are hedged by forward foreign
                exchange contracts monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into

                translated using the foreign exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates nonmonetary assets and
                liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated using the foreign

                income and accumulated separately in equity in the exchange reserve

                on disposal of an operation outside hong kong the cumulative amount of the exchange differences
                relating to that operation is reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the profit or loss on disposal is
                recognised

          v borrowing costs
                borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of an asset
                which necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised
                as part of the cost of that asset other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are
                incurred

                the capitalisation of borrowing costs as part of the cost of a qualifying asset commences when expenditure
                for the asset is being incurred borrowing costs are being incurred and activities that are necessary to
                prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended
                or ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use

     21 employee retirement benefits
          the group offers three retirement schemes which together cover all permanent staff

          one of the schemes the pension scheme provides pension benefits based on the employees final basic salary
          and length of service this scheme is accounted for as a defined benefit retirement scheme

          another scheme is defined contribution in nature and offers its members choices to invest in various investment
          funds one of the investment funds provides a guaranteed return the scheme is accounted for as a defined
          benefit retirement scheme in respect of this investment fund the guaranteed return scheme in respect
          of other investment funds which do not offer a guaranteed return the scheme is accounted for as a defined
          contribution retirement scheme see note 21b

          both these schemes are established under trust and are registered under the hong kong occupational retirement
          schemes ordinance the assets of the schemes are held independently of the groups assets in separate trustee
          administered funds

          the group also participates in a master trust mandatory provident fund scheme mpf scheme operated by
          an independent service provider under the hong kong mandatory provident fund schemes ordinance the mpf
          scheme is a defined contribution retirement scheme with the employer and its employees each contributing
          to the scheme in accordance with the relevant scheme rules the mpf scheme rules provide for voluntary
          contributions to be made by the employer calculated as a percentage of the employees basic salaries

          a defined benefit retirement schemes the schemes
                the funding policy in respect of the pension scheme is based on valuations prepared periodically by
                independent professionally qualified actuaries at willis towers watson hong kong limited the policy for
                employers contributions is to fund the scheme in accordance with the actuarys recommendations on an
                ongoing basis the principal actuarial assumptions used include discount rate and future pension increase
                rate which are disclosed in note 21aviii together with appropriate provisions for mortality rates the most
                recent actuarial valuation of the pension scheme was carried out by the appointed actuary represented by
                ms wing lui fsa as at 31 december 2013 the valuation revealed that the assets of the pension scheme
                were sufficient to cover the aggregate vested liabilities as at the valuation date

                both defined retirement schemes expose the group to investment risk and interest rate risk while the
                pension scheme also exposes the group to risks of longevity and inflation

                the retirement scheme expenseincome recognised in profit or loss for the year ended 31 december 2016
                was determined in accordance with hkas 19 2011 employee benefits

          its interest rate exposure the group also uses cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate
          derivatives to manage the exposure in accordance with its treasury policy at 31 december 2016 the
          group had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 6684 million 2015 7185 million

    iii sensitivity analysis
          at 31 december 2016 it is estimated that a general increasedecrease of 100 basis points in
          interest rates with all other variables held constant would have decreasedincreased the groups
          profit for the year and revenue reserve by approximately 10 million 2015 decreasedincreased by
          approximately 12 million other components of consolidated equity would have decreasedincreased
          by approximately 205 million 2015 decreasedincreased by approximately 263 million in response
          to the general increasedecrease in interest rates

          the sensitivity analysis above has been determined assuming that the change in interest rates had
          occurred at the end of the reporting period and had been applied to the exposure to interest rate risk
          for both derivative and nonderivative financial instruments in existence at that date the analysis has
          been performed on the same basis as for 2015




                                                                                                      annual report 2016   107

           d currency risk
                 the group is exposed to currency risk primarily arising from investments outside hong kong the group
                 is also exposed to foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency transactions which give rise to
                 receivables payable and cash balances that are denominated in a currency other than the functional
                 currency of the operations to which the transactions relate the group manages this risk as follows

                 i   investments outside hong kong
                       currency exposure arising from investments outside hong kong is mitigated in part either by funding
                       a portion of the investment through external borrowings in the same currency as the underlying
                       investment or by hedging with forward foreign exchange contracts the fair value of such borrowings
                       at 31 december 2016 was 8553 million 2015 9426 million the fair value of forward foreign
                       exchange contracts at 31 december 2016 was an asset of 870 million 2015 203 million

         a 10 percent weakening in the above currencies against hong kong dollars at the end of the
         reporting period would have had an equal but opposite effect on the groups profit for the year and
         revenue reserve and other components of consolidated equity

         this sensitivity analysis assumes that the change in foreign exchange rates had been applied to
         remeasure those financial instruments held by the group which expose the group to currency risk
         at the end of the reporting period and that all other variables in particular interest rates remain
         constant in this respect it is assumed that the pegged rate between the hong kong dollar and the
         united states dollar would be materially unaffected by any changes in movement in value of the
         united states dollar against other currencies results of the analysis as presented in the above table
         represent an aggregation of the effects on each of the group entities profit for the year and other
         components of equity measured in their respective functional currencies translated into hong kong
         dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the end of the reporting period for presentation purposes the
         analysis excludes differences that would result from the translation of the financial statements of
         foreign operations into the groups presentation currency the analysis has been performed on the
         same basis as for 2015

e	equity price risk
    the group is exposed to equity price changes arising from unlisted availableforsale equity securities which
    are held for strategic purposes see note 15

    all of the groups unlisted investments are held for long term strategic purposes their performance is
    reviewed regularly based on information available to the group

    these unlisted investments do not have a quoted market price in an active market and are stated at cost
    any increase or decrease in impairment losses in respect of these investments would affect the groups
    net profit as at the end of the reporting period none of these unlisted investments was considered to be
    impaired the review has been performed on the same basis as for 2015

      29 critical accounting judgements and estimates
           the methods estimates and judgements the directors used in applying the groups accounting policies have a
           significant impact on the groups financial position and operating results some of the accounting policies require
           the group to apply estimates and judgements on matters that are inherently uncertain in addition to notes 21
           and 24 which contain information about the assumptions and their risk factors relating to valuation of defined
           benefit retirement scheme assets and liabilities and financial instruments certain critical accounting judgements
           in applying the groups accounting policies are described below

           a impairment
                 in considering the impairment losses that may be required for the groups assets which include unlisted
                 availableforsale securities and property plant and equipment the recoverable amounts of the assets need
                 to be determined the recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs of disposal and the
                 value in use it is difficult to precisely estimate the fair value less costs to disposal because quoted market
                 prices for these assets may not be readily available in determining the value in use expected cash flows
                 generated by the assets are discounted to their present value which requires significant judgement the
                 group uses all readily available information in determining an amount that is a reasonable approximation of
                 the recoverable amount

                 any increase or decrease in impairment losses recognised as set out above would affect the net profit in
                 future years

32 possible impact of amendments and new standards issued but not yet
    effective for the year ended 31 december 2016
   up to the date of issue of these financial statements the hkicpa has issued a few amendments and new
   standards which are not yet effective for the year ended 31 december 2016 and which have not been adopted
   in these financial statements these include the following which may be relevant to the group


                                                                                                     effective for
                                                                                               accounting periods
                                                                                             beginning on or after
       amendments to hkas 7 statement of cash flows disclosure initiative                         1 january 2017
       amendments to hkas 12 income taxes recognition of deferred tax assets
        for unrealized losses                                                                        1 january 2017
       hkfrs 9 financial instruments                                                               1 january 2018
       hkfrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers                                              1 january 2018
       hkfrs 16 leases                                                                             1 january 2019

   the group is in the process of making an assessment of what the impact of these amendments and new
   standards is expected to be in the period of initial application so far it has concluded that the above
   developments are relevant to the groups financial statements but the adoption of them is unlikely to have a
   significant impact on the groups results of operations and financial position except for hkfrs 9

   hkfrs 9 financial instruments
   hkfrs 9 will replace the current standard on accounting for financial instruments hkas 39 financial
   instruments recognition and measurement hkfrs 9 introduces new requirements for classification and
   measurement of financial assets calculation of impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting on the
   other hand hkfrs 9 incorporates without substantive changes the requirements of hkas 39 for recognition and
   derecognition of financial instruments and the classification of financial liabilities

   the group is presently studying the implications of applying hkfrs 9 but it is impracticable to quantify its effect
   as at the date of publication of these consolidated financial statements
