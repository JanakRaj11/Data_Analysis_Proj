letter from our ceo
sustainability is a lasting evolution at texas instruments that
challenges us to think about what were doing today and what
we want to achieve tomorrow it is a journey that goes beyond
our next earnings report and any unforeseen ups and downs
yeartoyear

our progress along this path in 2011 was no different the
devastating earthquake and tsunami in japan global economic
uncertainty and flooding in thailand impacted our production
our supply chain our employees and our local communities im
proud of our response and the strides we made as a company
to put our response plans into action while continuing to adapt

during the year ti also made some significant improvements
and investments toward building a better world including
 134 energyefficiency and water conservation projects that
  saved 86 million in utility costs
 15 billion gallons of water and 92 percent of waste recycled
 full staffing of our motor driver lab as a proving ground for
  more efficient technology an estimated 60 percent of the
  worlds electricity is used by motors
 222 million contributed to education improvement and local
  communities ti and the ti foundation gave 146 million
  for more effective science and math education to grow the
  number of students ready to pursue careers in technology
 almost 1 million contributed to disaster relief in japan by the
  ti foundation and employees
 a new supplier environmental and social responsibility policy
  that requires critical alignment of our expectations for ethics
  labor practices and environmental controls

our aim now is to turn great preparation into great results our
fiveyear sustainability goals to reduce energy water and
greenhouse gas emissions per chip will help keep us on track

i have an unshakable belief that the best is yet to come as
technology makes a better world  one that is more exciting
more interactive more connected and more efficient we
commit to doing our part by helping create problemsolving
technology while continuing to grow responsibly
