several years before the launch of pocari sweat an otsuka
japanese researcher suffered food poisoning while on a business
trip outside japan visiting a local medical clinic that did not have
iv equipment the researcher was advised by a physician to drink
plenty of water and was handed a carbonated beverage this led
the researcher to consider the need for a physiologically based
rehydration beverage that is readily available and easy to ingest
  on a separate occasion the otsuka researcher witnessed a
doctor drinking an iv solution to rehydrate after performing a long
surgery this made the researcher think that a drinkable iv bever

         in 2012 the 11 group companies in japan used the energy equivalent to 301124 tons of co 2 emissions through their business activities
         the 18 group companies outside japan1 used the energy equivalent to 129015 tons of co2 emissions due to the expansion of business
         outside japan and the changes of co2 emission coefficient in japan about 20 percent increased co2 emissions increased 79 year
         onyear a large proportion of this energy use is from the extensive use of heat for sterilization processes in pharmaceuticals iv solutions
         and beverage production group companies have been striving to reduce their energy consumption in production processes in the area of
         logistics energy consumption per tonkilometer2 in japan was reduced by 22 yearonyear through the implementation of transporta

             preventing air pollution

the volume of sulfur oxides sox emissions into the atmosphere for the 11 group companies in japan increased in 2011 and 2012 due to
an increase in the sulfur content of certain fuel purchased on the market reduction of nitrogen oxide nox emissions in those companies
decreased due to the variation of the incinerator operation the group will continue to consolidate boiler facilities switch to cleaner fuels and
continue to improve its energy efficiency in an effort to minimize emissions of nox and sox into the atmosphere
