        activity generating a total of 581 million jobs globally the airlines services generate 87 million
        direct jobs within the air transport industry and contribute usd 606 billion to global gdp in

        automotive or pharmaceuticals and is around half as big as the global chemicals also the air
        transport industry has important multiplier effects which mean that its overall contribution to
        global employment and gdp is much larger than its direct impact alone
      indirect impacts which include employment and activities of suppliers to the air transport industry
        according to the atag over 98 million indirect jobs globally are supported through the purchase
        of goods and services by companies in the air transport industry these indirect jobs contributed
        approximately usd 697 billion to global gdp in 2012
      induced impacts induced by the spending of those directly or indirectly employed in the air
        transport industry around 46 million induced jobs globally are supported through employees in
        the air transport industry the induced contribution to global gdp is estimated at usd 324 billion
        in 2012
      catalytic air transports most farreaching economic contribution is via its contribution to the
        performance of other industries and as a facilitator of their growth by providing connectivity

cleaner quieter and more carbonefficient in 2008 aviation industry agreed to the worlds first set of industry
specific climate change targets the industry is already delivering on the first targetto continue to improve fleet
fuel efficiency by 15 per year until 2020 from 2020 aviation will cap its net carbon emissions while continuing
to grow to meet the needs of passengers and economies by 2050 the industry has committed to reducing its net
carbon footprint to 50 below what it was in 2005

air travel has always relied on advances in efficiency since the beginning of the jet age aircraft have reduced fuel
use per passenger kilometre by well over 70 and these efforts still continue

modern jet aircraft are 75 quieter than the first models that entered into service and each new generation
of aircraft maintains this downward trend not only do aircraft controllers work to provide operational noise
mitigation measures but also airports and air traffic controllers work to provide operational noise mitigation
measures and local governments work with the aviation industry to more appropriate zone areas around airports

the industry is also making significant progress to develop sustainable alternative fuels for aviation it is expected
that carbon reduction from moving to alternative fuels could be up to 80 compared to traditional jet fuel

waste management

as stated in turkish airlines environmental policy we aim to minimize the generation of waste and promote
recycling and recovery initiatives where possible waste management practice involves ensuring identification
of types and sources of the wastes generated within the organization collection and separation of the wastes at
their own sources temporary storage recycling and disposal of the wastes in accordance with the regulations of
the ministry of environment and urbanization

waste management supervisors office reporting to the office of chief human resources officer coordinates the
process for waste management waste management procedures are in place for each different waste category
defined by the applicable national laws



         actions in 2014
      as part of the waste management system we continued to conduct awareness raising trainings for
         our employees in 2014
      turkish airlines allocated waste storages at all locations needed to that end general management
         building waste storage has been established and sortation of such wastes has been ensured based
         on the type of the wastes
      furthermore agreements with waste disposal firms which are licensed by the ministry of
         environment and urbanization were executed to ensure that the most appropriate waste disposal
         method is implemented for each waste category
      industrial waste management plans were developed in accordance with the recent regulations in the
         field of environment and urbanization

noise

as stated in our environmental policy we are committed to reduce the noise emissions acquiring one of the
youngest fleet of the world with an average age of 72 years already makes substantial contributions in our
reduction targets furthermore we have already ordered new generation aircraft to be delivered by 2021 which
will enable us to reduce our noise emissions even further

airworthiness tracking supervisors office executes application processes to obtain noise certificate for each
aircraft in accordance with the applicable national and international aviation requirements it can be seen that
the noise level limitations are complied with during landing and takeoff at airports with this certificate providing
the allowed noise level data for aircraft
