climate change


applied materials recognizes that climate
change is an urgent problem requiring local
regional and international action to reduce
ghg emissions energy consumption and
efficiency are key elements of strategies to
reduce ghg emissions and as described
in this report we believe applied materials
has a positive role to play in providing
solutions our progress over the past three
years in reducing our own carbon dioxide
footprint is described throughout this report
we are now ready to drive further reductions
by adopting a broader corporate goal and by
developing a more comprehensive strategy
around that goal
