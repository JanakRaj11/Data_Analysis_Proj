sustainability at pge




for pge sustainability is more than the sum of caring for our
environment doing right by our employees serving our customers
and communities and delivering for our shareholders sustainability
reflects the reality that pges environmental and business challenges
are increasingly intertwined and that we can optimize our success by
developing integrated and balanced solutions to these challenges it
guides how we approach our decisionmaking across the company


pges sustainability journey
examples of sustainability in action can be found throughout our 100year history
this heritage gives us a solid foundation for much of the work we are doing today
and it inspires us to build on the legacy created by previous generations at pge

protecting watershed lands
in the early 1900s pge began acquiring
watershed lands surrounding our hydro
electric facilities to protect the dams
reservoirs and flumes from increased
sedimentation protecting these lands
has helped pge operate the facilities
costeffectively while enabling property
tax revenues for rural communities and
recreational opportunities for the public

investing in renewable energy
in the late 1950s utilities responded to
the nations growing demand for electric
ity unlike any other us utility at that
time pge began developing a power
plant fueled by a renewable resource
geothermal steam today the geysers
is one of the nations largest geo
thermal energy complexes and we
continue to purchase energy from the
geysers to serve our customers

leveraging a new business model
in the early 1980s california intro
duced decouplinga regulatory
framework that breaks the link
between energy sales and earnings
for the states investorowned utilities
including pge because pge is
not incentivized to sell more in order
to earn more decoupling has helped
spur decades of energy efficiency
programs that help customers use
less energy and save money

investing in a smarter energy grid
today pge is investing billions
of dollars to help build the smart
gridessential infrastructure that
will help america to shift to a low
carbon economy from assisting
customers with managing their
energy use to enabling electric vehicle
smart charging the smart grid is a
central element of a more sustainable
energy system and future

pge is making major investments to power california now and into the
future today we see an abundance of innovationdriven by changing
economics advancing technology and new sensibilities that demand
sustainable energy solutions yet while the future requires bold thinking
and fresh perspectives these must always be rooted in solid values
sound operations sensible governance and strong relationships with
our customers in 2009 we made the following progress
n 		   invested more than 3 billion to improve the reliability of our gas and
       electrical systems and to meet customer needs we also opened a stateof
       theart green grid control center to monitor and control more than 18000
       miles of high voltage conductors
n 		   brought our 600 mw gateway generating station into service which is 35
       percent more fuelefficient and uses 97 percent less water than a traditional
       gasfired plant
n 		   began the multiyear regulatory process to renew the licenses for our diablo
       canyon nuclear power plant to ensure its ongoing safe reliable and virtually
       carbonfree operation

we see a great necessity to find sustainable ways to produce deliver and
use energy in a world of carbon constraints limits on freshwater resources
and the continuing need to protect sensitive habitats and endangered species
these challenges are demanding that we think and work in new waysall
while continuing to fulfill our core compliance obligations we worked to
meet our goal of environmental leadership in many ways last year
n 		   signed new contracts for more than 4160 mw of additional renewable energy
       supplies pge now holds commitments that will enable us to provide more
       than 20 percent of our future power deliveries from renewables
n 		   finalized our second safe harbor agreement with the us fish and wildlife
       service enabling pge crews to safely maintain and operate important
       transmission lines while enhancing habitat for three species found nowhere
       else in the world
n 		   interconnected more than 9200 customerowned solar power systems to
       the electric grid in total pge has connected more than 40000 customer
       owned solar systems far more than any other utility in the nation
n 		   invested in five new greenhouse gas emission reduction projects through the
       climatesmart program a voluntary carbon offset program we offer our customers
n 		   continued to collaborate with suppliers nonprofits and other utilities to
       reduce the environmental impact of our supply chain
