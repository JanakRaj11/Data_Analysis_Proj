this is the second sustainability report of imphala and we at gri consider this a great achievement
this shows impahlas commitment to bring the sustainability agenda in a practical way to the every
day life of the company their management systems were improved and several concrete issues were
addressed because of the way they have implemented the sustainability reporting process already
during the previous reporting cycle in 2007

the gri was pleased to assist in the development of impahlas first sustainability report in 2007
through our transparency in the supply chain initiative throughout the process we were frequently
challenged by the fact that impahla is one of the smallest companies ever to produce a sustainability
report which forced us to consider the appropriateness of our g3 guidelines as well as the relevance
of the process of reporting

through the example set by impahla among other small companies we have become confident that
the g3 guidelines can be effectively applied in a manner that assists smaller companies improve their
sustainability outlook we are delighted that we can once again see how impahla is pressing forward
to become a benchmark for implementation of reporting processes for smaller companies throughout
the world we hope they will keep this path

introduction by the managing director
spring romance properties 34 pty limited trading as impahla clothing
hereafter impahla is a privately owned cape town based clothing
manufacturing company
with more than r5 million but less than r35million in annual turnover we classify
as a qualifying small enterprise qse as per the department of trade and industrys
codes of good practice for broadbased black economic empowerment hereafter
the bbbee codes as such we are a very small company operating without the
luxuries of our larger peers with large marketing communications andor sustainability
departments and thus must rely on ourselves  as a 3person management team  to
operate all aspects of our business

our primary production activity is the manufacturing of apparel items including the
provision of inhouse branding services embroidery screen printing and heat transfers
our garment manufacturing activities are supported by the provision of branding
services for garments produced by other manufacturers

this is our second annual sustainability report following the path that impahla
proudly embarked on in 2007 as a south african supplier of puma ag a worldclass
apparel company operating primarily in the sporting arena with support from puma
the global reporting initiative gri and the german governments international
development agency the gtz impahla underwent a lengthy process of formalising
our understanding of corporate responsibility and the sustainability reporting process
although we always believed that we were an employer of choice a supplier of
choice and a good corporate citizen we hadnt previously invested in developing
systems to measure our sustainability performance nor to produce a report that could
identify our strengths and weaknesses as a member of the global environment in which
we operate

granted our personal interests have always been reflected in our company just as our
company has created a mechanism for each of us to have a significant impact on the
quality of lives of others while we believe that our collective commitment to being
good citizens on a personal basis permeates all that we do as a company we allowed
the lessons learned from our first sustainability reporting process to assist us better
understanding how we can apply the concept of being a good corporate citizen to
improve impahla economically socially and in terms of our impacts on our physical
natural environment

in producing our first sustainability report we learned the following

 that management systems  including basic information management tools such as
  excel  could help us identify and manage issues before they become problems

 that statistical performance and human resource data can be a powerful tool in
  improving our overall efficiency as a supplier to clients with strict timing and quality
  requirements

 that engaging with a variety of key stakeholders can often provide us with tips on
  how to further improve our business operations andor to boost employee morale

 that our ability to demonstrate commitment to key sustainability principles 
  including the use of environmentallyfriendly dyes and improvements in energy
  efficiency  is important not only to us but also to our key clients and

 that monitoring our performance on an ongoing basis  not just at the end of
  the year during the reporting process  saves us money makes us more efficient
  and helps identify employee concerns before they have a negative impact on
  absenteeism andor turnover

moreover the reporting process identified ways in which our management systems
could become more efficient being mindful of the fact that impahla is a small company
that is actively managed by the ownership team in doing so we proved that the
sustainability reporting process  not just the end product  allows us an opportunity
to constantly monitor all of our most material issues thereby creating mechanisms for
ensuring that our service to clients is managed effectively

                                   in 2008 our sustainability reporting process has allowed us an opportunity to

                                   p report a 158 increase in the number of garments manufactured and a 263
                                     increase in the number of nonmanufactured garments that were branded inhouse

                                   p report a 40 decrease in the amount of electricity we consume per garment
                                     manufactured

                                   p report first time export of products outside south africa 22 237 garments or 127
                                     of our total production

                                   p achieve carbon neutrality through our very first carbon footprint assessment

                                   o identify a 1302 increase in late arrivals from 145 in 2007 to 163 in 2008

                                   at impahla each of our directors plays a key hands on operational role in the running
                                   of the business including all aspects of our product design daily production ordering
                                   and shipping processes thus we need to stress that producing a sustainability report
                                   is a relatively expensive venture both in terms of time and cash costs for printing as
                                   such and with the gracious support of our pro bono consultant michael h rea we
                                   have developed a reporting process that is as lean as possible and while we may not
                                   have included all of the information you the reader require we trust that we have
                                   made the best effort possible in our particular circumstances

                                   the primary goal of this report is to offer our many stakeholders an opportunity to better
                                   understand who we are as a company as a team of individuals and as a proudly south

                                   material issues including a discussion of how we believe we have been doing thus far
                                   and how we hope to improve in the future

this is impahlas second report and while the reporting period under question is limited
to the 2008 calendar year cy 2008 we have attempted to include data for the last 3
of the 4 years of our operations as impahla where possible trend analyses have been
conducted for all available data on a monthby month basis

our operations exist only in south africa although our largest clients puma adidas
and new balance are international companies based outside our boundaries prior
to 2008 100 of our sales were directed to the south african subsidiaries of our main
clients however 2008 heralded our first opportunity to export products to austria
chile france germany indonesia japan singapore switzerland turkey the uk and
the us as a proud supplier to pumas involvement in the global peace one day
project all of our other clients are based in south africa as are most of our principle
suppliers of machinery fabric and all other input materials

in developing this report we have once again followed the gris g3 guidelines  opting
this year to seek application level b and have taken into consideration comments and
advice from a variety of stakeholders most importantly our largest client  puma  and
the association of chartered certified accountants acca but also the cape clothing
association our unions our suppliers and our employees each of whom received a
copy of the report moreover we have adopted the accountability principles standard
2008 and have sought moderate level type assurance from trialogue in accordance
with accountabilitys aa1000as 2008

moreover we have raised the reporting bar within impahla by seeking a carbon footprint
assessment from the folks at carbon calculated a cape town based consultancy that
excels in the provision of carbon footprint assessments and offset strategies

through our ongoing process of engagement with puma we sought advice on
a number of key sustainability issues and have done our best to incorporate their
recommendations not least of which is the shift our branding department has made to
using only environmentallyfriendly waterbased cht inks

by participating in the acca awards for sustainability reporting we were able to learn
a number of key lessons both from the judging panel as well as from other companies
who produce their own sustainability reports particularly with respect to ensuring that
we provide a balanced accounting of our social and environmental performance not
just the good news we want to tell people

thus far the feedback from our 2007 sustainability report has been very positive
albeit limited in quantity however the greatest lesson that we learned from our last
report was that the report itself is merely an output of the systems and processes we
have put in place to help manage our business more effectively the value is therefore
not in the report itself but in the positive changes that we have been able to achieve
through paying closer attention to what we thought were noncore business activities

it is important to note that the clothing manufacturing industry in south africa particularly
in the western cape where impahla is located has been under constant threat of collapse
over the past few years as such we believe that in order for impahla to continue to
survive the ongoing turbulence within our industry we must be perpetually vigilant in
ensuring that our sustainability is secure in analysing our company data and developing
this report as well as ensuring that our service to all of our clients regardless of size or
international status continues to exceed their expectations we believe that impahla will
continue to succeed as a wellrespected growing and sustainable business

at this time it is my hope as well as that of my coowners and many team members
that you will find value in the information we have compiled on your behalf and we
hope that you will contact us should you have any questions or comments about this
report as you will see in the coming pages this report tells the story of one small
company that is driven to excellence fuelled by the collective passion and commitment
of a vibrant and talented team we are an african company that is owned by africans
operated by africans able and ready to compete in a global market

sincerely

 results from these audits including
 pumas safe audits right have been a
 helpful benchmark of our performance in
 social environmental and safety areas


                                             on close inspection of our audit results we have found that while we continue to excel
                                             in the social and health  safety aspects of pumas audits we still have significant
                                             room for improvement in our environmental performance these findings are extremely
                                             helpful when comparing our own internal assumptions and conclusions about our
                                             performance with what we consider to be the reality of our progress

                                             although no safe audits or contractor compliance audits from other customers were
                                             conducted in 2008 impahla undertook to further bolster our performance according to
                                             client expectations and it is our hope that through enhanced environmental and safety
                                             processes we will continue to rate very highly during compliance audits

                                             operations to the highest of international standards and has been successfully awarded

                                              entered into an agreement that we hope will sustain longterm support for the puma

decrease in nonpuma sales with puma dominating our orders over 91 we
recognise that we are running the risk of falling into an all eggs in one basket dilemma
however after much internal discussion and debate impahla decided that the increased
risk is manageable based on the assurances puma has offered through the strategic
partner concept guarantees of production orders as well as assurances that decreased
demand will be forecast and communicated to us early enough to control impacts are
deemed sufficient enough to reduce any short andor longterm negative impacts that
one might associate with becoming a sole source supplier to one brand

production efficiency as measured by the time used to complete garments in comparison
to the total time available continued to be extremely high in 2008 although there was
a slight average decrease from 78 in 2007 to 77 in 2008 it is our best guess that
this decrease was due to a number of factors including a significant increase in staff
turnover and a shift to more complicated garment designs

marketing and procurement
as a small manufacturing company we do not have a marketing department
but rely completely on our brandconscious clients to keep us apprised
of their evolving requirements the likes of puma our principal client
accounting for more than 90 of our sales adidas and new balance all
have highly sophisticated market research and analysis teams to assess where
their products should be heading to meet new consumer trends
we are confident in our reliance on our clients and the highly competitive consumer
markets in which they operate to act as a mechanism for marketing our products
where deemed necessary we are pleased to assist our customers with brandspecific                 theres always work and we
marketing activities when called upon                                                             never get short shifted ie
as a proudly south african clothing manufacturer we adhere to a strict safirst policy

for procurement without exception we are committed to purchasing our supplies from               wage due to a lack of work
a local trader unless the quality and quantity of equipment fabric andor accessories
cannot meet our needs as defined by our clients

however our 2008 sales of garments requiring complex fabrics currently unavailable
in south africa led to a sharp increase in our foreign procurement 48 of the polyester
we used in 2008 was purchased from taiwan representing 215 of all fabric used
meanwhile 100 of all of the buttons we used for puma garments were purchased
from hong kong

screen printing inks meet pumas strict environmental standards waterbased pvc
free cht inks that are certified as environmentally friendly meanwhile all of the
plastic bags used for packaging garments 203 716 poly bags and all of the corrugated
cartons used for shipping 1 981 boxes are made from recycled materials

to further improve our efficiencies impahla implemented a just in time jit procurement
system that has been wellsupported by our suppliers this system ensures that we do not
need to retain significant warehouse stocks of fabric and accessories while ensuring that
all materials are readily available from suppliers as and when required

although we are mindful of our size and thus the relative smallness of our orders from
big suppliers we are nonetheless pleased to note that while our influence may not
impact the social andor environmental responsibility of our main suppliers we are
able to report that at least one of our suppliers is also taking the issue of sustainability
very seriously coats our principal thread supplier has supplied the impahla team
with evidence of their social and environmental stewardship through the provision
of documents outlining their worldwide employment standards and worldwide
environmental policy these documents printed on recycled paper encourage us not
only to continue sourcing from coats but also to ensure that our policies are formalised
in similar documents for future display and distribution

both opportunities and challenges             commitments and that our employees remain safe and healthy where possible we

for impahla as an employer is to             allow them to deliver against increasingly challenging targets
strike the most effective balance
between our personal desire to                 as a relatively new company we were also keen to outsource our noncore activities
recruit and compensate lower wage              to more specialised operators until recently this included the outsourcing of most of
employees and the everpresent                our branding activities to third party suppliers unfortunately we were challenged by
pressure to automate processes for             a lack of reliability amongst our suppliers and had to import a mhm automatic screen
                                               printing machine from austria to facilitate our branding processes inhouse

as technology improves and expands
                                               automated since we first started our operations we identified a need to align ourselves

as we can
                                               in 2008 we identified a significant process bottleneck that was limiting our ability
nonetheless we as africans believe
                                               to manufacture garments requiring pockets particularly with respect to track pants
in the fair and ethical treatment of
                                               our production line was slowed by the labourintensive process to cut trim and stitch
all employees and are committed to
                                               pockets into the garments in response impahla purchased a dürkopp adler pocket
ensuring that retrenchments occur only
                                               welt machine which under the skilful guidance of one operator is able to not only
where the sheer will of our human
                                               reduce the number of machine operators from eight to one but is able to ensure that
resources can no longer allow us
                                               the pocket process no longer creates a process bottleneck

our success

unfortunately we believe that the
delicate balance between competitive
pressures toward automation and job
creation places impahla in the unenviable
position of looking for inventive
ways to improve efficiencies without
compromising on our commitment to
the welfare of our staff

sometimes this does not favour our
commitment to job creation but we
believe that our record of expanded
duty rosters is a fair representation of our
values in action

in 2004 when the cape town tshirt company was purchased the company
consisted of approximately 60 employees of which every employee was
given the opportunity to come across to impahla although all 60 employees
initially made the decision to join the new company some decided to move
to new opportunities within the first few months
in the first year of our operations as impahla some of the workers taken over from the
previous owners were clearly unsettled by the transition to new owners in year 1
we observed a net loss of 114 of the total workforce with 20 of the 26 departures
295 resulting from workers leaving the company of their own accord either a
resignation or an abscond where a worker simply fails to return to work for those
that chose to remain with the company rewards have come in many forms of which
secure wages nonstandard benefits and internal promotion opportunities have been
recognised by our current team as reasons to remain within impahla

we are pleased that as of the end of december 2008 our staff compliment of 88
employees still includes 25 of the preimpahla employees at the heart of our current
team including lena who continues to direct our production activities sadly 5 more
members of our original 2004 team left us in 2008 of which one was elizabeth de
wet right who retired as our first retiree the entire impahla team was pleased to
send her off with a farewell party including a microwave oven as a small token of our
appreciation

lena is our greatest success story of someone who has worked hard starting from the
ground level and who is now a partowner of the business and a critical link in the
success of impahla she is a shining example of how with opportunity a competent
and committed individual will succeed without the presence of forced empowerment
policies and procedures although impahla complies fully with the employment equity
act of 1995 in our policies and procedures we sincerely believe that our empowerment
strategy is based solely on aptitude and that this strategy has been proven successful

                                    we are equally proud of the fact that our empowerment credentials dont end with
                                    lena from the very beginning our ownership team has been committed to ensuring
                                    that dedication to the company will be rewarded and that the identification and
                                    placement of supervisors and managers will occur from within the production team
                                    wherever reasonably possible as such we have been able to ensure that lenas entire

                                    one was an embroidery operator and the others were all machinists

                                    our most recent promotion to supervisorintraining level merle was identified from
                                    within the team of embroidery operators we expect that this ongoing demonstration
                                    of commitment to our production staff will help reinforce our assertion that everyone
                                    has a chance to be promoted and that every employee is valued

                                    although these individuals  patricia lydia francis christine joyce merle and
                                    mogamat  are classified in the south african context as previously disadvantaged
                                    each of our promoted staff members has proven that they possess natural leadership
                                    qualities that are helpful to the success of our business

                                    we believe that this approach is the fundamental key to impahlas success and it is
                                    at the heart of our vision and values by empowering every worker we ensure that
                                    while the management team receives orders and ensures delivery on time the actual

                                    there are a lot of negative perceptions about the industry particularly with respect
 when its cold its very cold      to the number of job losses this forces one to be cautious on the one hand but
                                    committed to proving the perceptions wrong over the longer term
and when its hot its very hot
 but this doesnt happen too        we believe that by building a strong base of operations around a core team of
                                    committed employees we will have the opportunity to overcome the challenges that
much we open the doors to          have been facing the clothing manufacturing sector over the past few years our healthy
cool down and put jerseys on        growth from 60 employees in 2004 to a high of 98 in 2007 is a fair indication of the
         to stay warm              strength of our team and we are certain that we will continue to retain and build a
                                    resilient workforce over the coming years although our unfortunate loss of 18 staff
                                    members in 2008 might appear to reflect negative sentiment we have concluded that a
                                    combination of poor transport connections for some workers to get to the new location
                                    and managements heightened attention to good conduct led to the vast majority of
                                    our losses in 2008 in a few cases workers left to pursue more lucrative employment
                                    contracts even though those contracts ultimately led to poorer working conditions
                                    sadly it is impahlas policy to only rehire employees who leave under good terms
                                    thus restricting those who absconded from seeking reemployment only 1 machine

although sick leave continues to present itself as an ongoing management issue our
team was successful in reducing our sick leave rate from 097 in 2007 to 070 in
2008 while our target remains 10 sick leave days taken relative to the total number
of person days worked our hope is to reduce the rate to better than our 2006 sick leave
rate 069

while we continue to respect that workers need and have the right to take days off                                                                nobody really comes to

leave referred to as absenteeism for reasons other than illness including such things                                                          complain about things

going and were stealing things
                                    prior to producing our 2007 sustainability report we assumed that we were effectively
 they had a hearing and some        managing absenteeism by tracking our sick leave ratio primarily because of the need to
  people left we understand        pay employees for sick leave taken however the process of developing our report
 why they left and we believe      opened our eyes to the fact that our total absenteeism rate inclusive of sick leave is
                                    more than double what we perceived it to be an average of 264 per month over the
  that they management did        course of the year up from 217 in 2007
         the right thing
                                    in developing this years report we identified two significant problems with our
                                    measurement and management systems for absenteeism firstly we recognised
                                    that while we recorded absenteeism due to illness ie sick leave for all of our
                                    employees we were only recording absenteeism ie persons absent from work
                                    without illness or special permission for our machine operators as such we identified
                                    that our 2007 absenteeism rate was errantly recorded as 262 instead of 218 for
                                    machine operators total absenteeism neither measured nor reported secondly we
                                    identified that our information management processes needed updating to record all
                                    incidents where employees are absent without permission where all refers to our
                                    entire employee pool not just machine operators

                                    as such it should be duly noted that we might experience a significant change in
                                    absenteeism in 2009 due only to the changes in the way in which we monitor and
                                    manage our absenteeism rate

                                    absenteeism another indicator we identified as a significant problem during the
                                    development of our 2007 sustainability report continues to be somewhat of a
                                    concern while we once assumed that late arrivals did not materially impact our
                                    overall production when we began to analyse the data we had been collecting we
                                    found that more than 1 of our production was lost due to late arrivals

unfortunately and even though we began to make our employees aware of the fact that
late arrivals would be actively monitored and managed our total late arrival rate rose
from 145 in 2007 to 163 in 2008 our worst months were august 213 and
december 201 with only april reaping a rate close to our target of 100 103                  if you want to do

when coupled together to form what we believe is controllable lost time or clt                  it and believe in
our absenteeism 268 and late arrivals 163 sum to a total production loss of
431 over and above the reasonable and uncontrollable sick leave of 070 as such
                                                                                                      yourself you can
we have entered into a number of discussions with our employees through their union                         do it
representative to decrease our clt ratio to less than 300 in 2009 with our ultimate
goal being to decrease both absenteeism and late arrivals to less than 100 each

it should be noted that as a truly african company operating in a tremendously dynamic
multicultural environment impahla does not permit any form of discrimination against
employees we do not tolerate racism sexual harassment or the discrimination of
persons with any form of disability we are very proud of the fact that our team is
made up of 886 females and 955 nonwhites both key performance indicators
within the south african economy however we still have not had an opportunity to
employ persons with disabilities although we would not hesitate to ensure that our
work environment accommodates for special needs wherever reasonably possible

our remuneration packages including salary bonuses and incentives are above average
for our industry and we are registered with industrial councils and all other statutory
bodies wages are established by the national bargaining council but impahla has
actively pursued bonus systems and other forms of nonfinancial reward

for example the entire management team was proud to participate in the south
african clothing and textiles workers union sactwu cape regions spring queen
competition hosting our own internal pageant and then supporting our teams winner 
lydia  through the sactwu pageant process while we initially participated thinking
that this would be a fun thing to do we quickly realised that the development and
upliftment of team spirit that resulted from the pageant process was of significant benefit
to the overall employee satisfaction and productivity rates within the company

for impahla zero harm refers to the creation and maintenance of a work environment that is free from the potential for illness or
injury for our employees our clients and our neighbours within our business complex and the community of maitland in our most
recent review hazard identification and risk assessment hira we identified the following potential risks and hazards

 1   minor     9 minor cuts and abrasions occurred in 2008 mostly resulting from the improper use of newsharp trim scissors
      cuts
                although we insist on the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ppe by all of our cutting room staff the
                risk of injuries still exists as wire mesh gloves cannot be effectively used in other areas where knives and scissors are
                used particularly in our trim section

 2   slips    4 injuries  1 a lost time injury  resulted from slips and falls in 2008
      falls
                although impahla prides itself on providing our team a clean and safe work environment even our best efforts to
                avoid risks has not eliminated certain hazards altogether meldine slipped coming down the steps from the lunch
                room and hurt her foot in january resulting in a slight sprain being diagnosed and resulting in 3 days of lost time

                4 minor slip  fall injuries were recorded mostly due to human error including an incident where dolfie slipped on
                a banana peel in the lunch room and suffered a minor injury to his arm

                the safety team is currently considering ways to mitigate the risks associated with slips  falls and will be embarking
                on a hazards awareness campaign early in 2009

 3   needle    3 needle prick injuries were recorded in 2008 up from 1 in 2007
      pricks
                the greatest risk when operating a sewing machine continues to be the potential to penetrate ones finger with
                the needle

                in the previous 4 years 2004 through 2007 impahla only suffered one such incident with the first injury of its kind
                occurring in 2007 we attributed the low number of injuries to our use of needle guards on all of our machines our
                concerted effort to educate our staff about the danger and the role our supervisors play in ensuring that guards are not
                removed however it is clear that the risk of needle prick injuries continues to exist and that the team must be mindful
                to remind machine operators of their responsibility to work safely

                  the lifting of heavy bundles of fabric the repetitive nature of specific tasks and the need of some employees

                  but we accept that the nature of this risk is more difficult to monitor as such we rely on our weekly staff
                  meetings to remind employees of their responsibility to avoid behaviour that could place them in danger of a
                  sprain as well as to ensure that their work environment remains clean and obstaclefree


5   burns        no such injuries occurred in 2008

                  heated clothes irons used for pressing garments during our finishing process have always been an obvious
                  risk area but no such injuries have been recorded at impahla nonetheless we remain committed to ensuring
                  that all of our employees are aware of the dangers and restricting access to the pressing area to ensure that
                  unnecessary personnel are not exposed to the risk


6   sunlight     no such injuries or complaints occurred in 2008

                  when our new building was being designed we took the decision to reduce our dependency on electrical
                  lighting and heating and installed translucent roof panels to all natural light to illuminate and warm the
                  shop floor

                  while this may have appeared to be a faultfree idea at the design stage we quickly learned that too much
                  light could pose a hazard to our employees

                  aside from the obvious exposure to sunrelated cancers our more immediate concern was eye strain and
                  potential heat stroke among our machinists

                  as such we have made large umbrellas available to any staff member wishing to be shielded from the
                  sunlight and have created a means of allowing outside air into the building to create a form of natural
                  cooling without compromising the overall security aspects of the factory

     of harmful operation in our business
     dust and
     fumes      although no cases of fumerelated illness have thus far been reported at impahla we are mindful of the
                potential to cause harm where solvents dyes and glues might be used

                  as such our new manufacturing facility was designed with specific attention to the provision of adequate
                  ventilation and air quality management where taskspecific higher risks persist we ensure that face masks
                  and other ppe are used by all employees operating in the hazard area


8   inhalation   resulting from a note submitted via our employee complaints and suggestions box we have ensured that
     of second   nonsmoking employees are not subject to the effects of secondhand smoke
     hand
     smoke        smoking in common areas is not permitted and any employee wishing to smoke must exit the building and
                  remain more than 5 metres from pedestrian access points


9   collisions   although we do not own and operate any motorised vehicles within our factory our positioning within a
     with         busy business park continues to present a possible if not probable risk of collisions between vehicles and
     moving       personnel
     vehicles
                  as such we continue to ensure that our entranceexit procedures are maintained and enforced to ensure that
                  all of our employees arrive and leave our premises in a manner that will decrease their risk of collisions

                  when deliveries or collections occur access to motor vehicle pathways is tightly restricted to ensure that
                  unnecessary personnel do not pose a threat to either the vehicle operator or themselves

10   hivaids   hivaids is a massive problem for all of africa particularly for those of us living and working in subsaharan regions

                 the hivaids pandemic will remain a sustainability risk factor to be closely monitored and managed for many
                 years to come and impahla is committed to ensuring that our workforce is perpetually aware of their role in
                 protecting themselves and their family members from the disease

                 to date we are not officially aware of any employees who have been infected by hivaids and to the best of our
                 knowledge our team has not suffered any hivaidsrelated deaths or illnessrelated employment terminations
                 ie medical boardings however the relevant demographics suggest that impahla remains vulnerable to the
                 disease and therefore must remain committed to addressing the risk

                 although impahlas employees come from a region of south africa that has a relatively low hivinfection rate we
                 are of the collective belief that each of us is susceptible to hivaids related risk factors as such and in mitigation
                 of our direct risk impahla has instituted an hivaids programme which comprises of the following elements

                  policy guidelines with regard to recruitment promotion and management of illness in the workplace
                   including explicit mention of nondiscrimination within our code of conduct

                  access to education and voluntary testing campaigns through the local union south african clothing and
                   textile workers union sactwu and the national bargaining council

                  availability of free condoms in our restrooms

                 although we have not conducted our own hivaids awareness campaigns this issue has been addressed in one
                 or more of our monthly health  safety meetings and we are committed to addressing this in the near future
                 one area of particular focus for 2009 will be the reinstatement of poster campaigns that did not transfer across
                 to our new facilities in 2007 impahla is committed to working with the national bargaining council and our
                 unions to ensure an effective partnership in this regard in 2009

monitoring over a number of issues

 1    electricity   particularly during the fist quarter of 2008 the south african economy grew to become critically aware of our
                    collective need to become more efficient consumers of electricity total capacity as supplied by the national
                    electricity provider eskom failed to keep pace with demand and consumers at all levels of the economy
                    were frequently subjected to periods of load shedding ie rolling blackouts although the load shedding
                    process has somewhat abated we remain everaware of our need to ensure that we act in a responsible manner
                    shedding our own demand as much as possible

                    the process of developing our sustainability reports has taught us the value of regularly evaluating our electricity
                    bills to determine if we are managing our electricity consumption in a manner that is both costeffective and
                    environmentally sound as such we now use our monthly municipal rates and taxes bills to evaluate our average
                    electricity consumption per unit of production

                      in analysing our data we were pleasantly surprised to note that after experiencing a respectable 164
                      decrease in electricity consumed per garment produced from 2006 to 2007 we were able to witness a
                      remarkable 403 decrease from 2007 to 2008 of course we are cognisant of the fact that this stunning
                      decrease has not necessarily been something we actively planned but must assume that this is the direct result
                      of improved efficiencies that were reaped through the move to our new premises our challenge now is to
                      attempt to further reduce our electricity consumption per garment produced although we predict that further
                      efficiencies will be very hard to identify andor achieve

2      fuel          although extremely insignificant to most companies impahla decided in 2008 to measure and monitor our
        consumption   total fuel consumption in an effort to get a better handle on the full scope of our greenhouse gas emissions

                      for the full 12month period we consumed 1 6954 litres of petrol in our delivery van and 1 0104 litres of
                      diesel in our management vehicles when used for business purposes

3      business      another way in which impahla has emitted greenhouse gases has been through business travel particularly
        travel        flights in 2008 4 international and 2 domestic flights were taken by william as a result of our participation
                      in the gris transparency in the supply chain project three flights  two to germany and one to the
                      netherlands  were the direct result of the gri project while a fourth trip  to germany  was the result of
                      pumas wish to discuss the project with their stakeholders

                      two trips to johannesburg were taken as a result of impahlas involvement in the association of chartered
                      certified accountants reporting awards for sustainability reports

                      no other business travel was recorded for the year

4      carbon        although we are a relatively small company we believe it is within our scope of responsibility to monitor
        footprint     manage and report on our total carbon footprint the amount of carbon we emit into the atmosphere as a result
                      of our daily operations as such we have determined that our total carbon emissions in terms of carbon dioxide
                      equivalents  or co2e  is 17589 tons including

                             electricity   15964 tons based on our total consumption of 159 641 kwh

                                   fuel 659 tons based on our total consumption of 1 0104 litres of diesel and 1 6954 litres of petrol

                      air conditioning 0 tons as our air conditioners are cfcfree noting that electricity consumption for air
                      		 conditioning is calculated in the total electricity consumption figure above

                       flights 966 tons based on 3 international flights to germany and 1 to the netherlands plus two
                      		 domestic flights to johannesburg from cape town

                                  total    17589 tons of co2e or 100 kilograms of co2e per garment produced

                      while we believe that the process we employed to calculate our footprint is simplistic we believe that is both a
                      fair reflection of our management capabilities at this time as well as a fair reflection of our total carbon footprint
                      with the exception of paper consumption in the patterning process a process improvement for 2009

                      with many thanks our total carbon footprint has been calculated by alex hetherington of carboncalculated
                      a cape town based small consultancy specialising in carbon footprint assessments and offset strategies alex
                      carboncalculatedcoza

                      working in partnership with food and trees for africa carboncalculated assisted us with offsetting our carbon
                      emissions and through the planting of 493 trees has ensured that for the first time in south africa impahla has
                      become a carbon neutral clothing manufacturer

                      our goal now is to identify new and more costeffective offset solutions while continuing to improve our

5     water          south africa is widely considered to be a water scarce economy in that access to reliable supplies of
                      potable water is not a given as such our water consumption although relatively limited is considered to be
                      an ongoing management concern at impahla

                      unfortunately through the process of developing this report we identified that our water data management
                      processes were not as robust as we had previously assumed in fact we identified that the information
                      provided in last years report was no where near as accurate as we had asserted and are without the ability
                      retrace our data systems to identify the full scope of error

                      moreover we have identified that the water consumption figures provided by our landlords in monthly
                      rates and taxes billings appears to be significantly incorrect over the year we have paid for as much
                      as 948 kilolitres kl of water yet can reasonably confirm that our actual consumption  based on an
                      extrapolation of eight months of accurate data  is roughly 5813 kl our hope is that we will be able to
                      rectify the overbilling problem and recover the equivalent of a 63 overpayment for water

                      nonetheless we have used our monthly municipal rates and taxes bills to calculate our total water
                      consumption and have evaluated this information relative to our total monthly production figures

                      of course our production is not waterdependent and therefore trends and anomalies cannot necessarily
                      be correlated to fluctuations in our production efficiencies but we feel that units of production is the most
                      effective tool that we can use to assess our water consumption efficiency in doing so we can compare
                      against one of our peer companies and report that our water efficiency of 331 litres of water per garment
                      produced is 129 higher than suzi products 293 litres per garment

                   water consumed                        units of                  litres per unit of                   peer

6     non           over the past few years we have noticed a significant increase in the amount of garbage that has been
       hazardous      disposed of in landfills however we attribute this informally observed increase in waste disposal as a direct
       waste          result of our significant increase in total garment production

                      todate we do not have formal systems or processes in place to monitor and measure the volume by weight
                      of solid waste sent to landfills via our waste haulage contractors however we are committed to reducing
                      our overall volume of waste being sent for disposal at landfills

                      as of now we are already instituting the following mechanisms for reducing our solid waste disposal

                       using waste sorting bins to identify waste materials that can be sent for recycling rather than disposed of
                        as general waste

                       recycling our waste paper and plastics through a partnership with oasis a wellestablished ngo that
                        employs persons with mental disabilities to sort waste for selling back to paper and plastic recycling
                        companies such as mondi and

                       although we have yet to find a viable partner we intend to forward reasonably large pieces of scrap
                        material to an economic development project or projects that can make use of the fabric to manufacture
                        clothing and other items

7     hazardous      although limited in total volumes consumed andor disposed of hazardous materials are often used in our
       waste          manufacturing facilities particularly in the maintenance and operation of our facilities and equipment

                      because the total volumes are extremely low we do not have formal systems or processes in place to monitor
                      and measure the volume of hazardous materials consumed throughout our operations however we
                      continue to monitor the way which all solvents lubricants and other hazardous materials are handled stored
                      and disposed of


       we commend impahla for their commitment to measuring their carbon footprint and the environmental
        impact of their small business and then choosing to contribute to greening and sustainable community
       development in south africa we hope that more clothing and other companies will follow their lead so
              that we can move towards a lower carbon economy and a healthier planet in the future

lessons learned through stakeholder engagement
                                    although impahla learned a lot about sustainability sustainability
                                    reporting and our business through the process of developing a gribased
                                    sustainability report in 2008 the lessons learned did not end at the point
                                    of publishing our report for us the most important part of our reporting
                                    process was really about what we learned once we started sharing it with
                                    our key stakeholders and with others who are more experienced about
                                    corporate governance issues
                                    through what can only be considered good fortune the physical printing of our 2007
                                    report was marked by a significant production error that the printing supplier took full
                                    responsibility for although the misprinted report was still readable it was not of a
                                    sufficient quality that impahla could share with external stakeholders in kindness the
                                    printer gave impahla the discarded copies 100 and we shared these with each of our
  ive been here 7 years and i      98 employees in doing so we learned the following from our employees
 like it here because im an
                                     our employees take pride in being part of a team whose story is being shared with
   obedient child and theres         our key suppliers and other stakeholders
     nothing wrong with this
                                     our employees were very happy with being able to see their photos in print and
 place its clean everyone is       were sad if their specific photos werent included
friendly its just that lena can
   be tough sometimes when          our employee of month section was a source of great joy for the 11 employees
                                      who were included
 shes pushing for production
                                     our employees were more willing to inform the content of our 2008 report based
                                      on the fact that they could see how the 2007 report was used

                                     our employees told us that they learned a great deal about impahla and its structures
                                      by reading the report

                                     the report also seemed to bring the management and staff closer together as
                                      personal experiences were shared and perceptions narrowed

                                    because of our involvement in the gris transparency in the supply chain project
                                    in partnership with the gtz and puma we had an opportunity to participate in
                                    conferences in the netherlands and germany and learned the following lessons from
                                    conference participants

                                     at a total employee population of 98 people in 2007 impahla was one of the
                                      smallest organisations to ever produce a sustainability report and respect was
                                      offered based on our decision to overcome our limited resource challenges while
                                      producing a meaningful report

                                     as part of team puma south africa at the reporting conferences it was clear that
                                      the example set by all three puma suppliers vimal suzi products and impahla was
                                      one of reasonability such that reporting does not need to be overly complicated
                                      but rather a process that results in a report that is meaningful in the context of
                                      reasonable stakeholder andor operating environment expectations

                                     the conferences illustrated how much effort is going into the sustainability reporting
                                      process but how this does not filter down to small and medium companies in the
                                      likes of south africa

                                     the gri need to make it attractive and cost effective for small and medium sized
                                      companied to become involved

having submitted our report to the association of chartered certified accountants
acca in south africa for consideration of their awards for sustainability reporting
we not only received an award for best newcomer small enterprises but also learned
the following

 in most respects sustainability reporting still appears to be the exclusive domain
  of larger more financially supported listed corporations however the many
  participants and event attendees seemed to appreciate the reporting lessons that            its a pity puma doesnt give
  could be offered by the likes of impahla and cotlands a nongovernmental hiv                us stuff we should have a
  aids charity operating throughout south africa                                              factory shop where we can
 we realised the massive task that lies ahead for the likes of the gri and the acca                  get a discount
  to encourage other small and medium sized companies to report and to see the
  benefits of reporting

 we appreciated how important it is not just to produce a report but to structure your
  business around being sustainable window dressing to green wash stakeholders
  being totally unacceptable

having shared our report with the cape clothing association and the national bargaining
council for the textiles and clothing industry we learned that

 companies in our sector are battling to stay afloat however if they took the time to
  get involved in sustainability reporting they would realise that it is a survival tool
  in itself

having shared our report with our bankers suppliers and competitors we learned that

 they appreciated receiving a report which was so open and transparent

 as with our employees our report had the effect of bringing parties closer together

as stated in last years sustainability report the concept of stakeholder engagement
was somewhat foreign to us prior to the initiation of our sustainability reporting process
while we were confident that we were perpetually in close engagement with our key
stakeholders  employees customers suppliers associations unions and bargaining
councils  we did not have formal systems in place to monitor andor manage our
stakeholder engagement granted we have come to understand that much of what we
do to ensure the ongoing productivity and profitability of our company can be construed
as engagement but we are fundamentally willing to accept that our engagement
processes will remain ad hoc with the exception of our customers suppliers and
employees including their unions and the nbc our formal engagement includes

 our weekly meetings between management and the employees andor their
  representatives to raise and discuss issues of importance to our employees this
  includes their issuesconcerns being presented to management as well as the
  presentation of production results safety briefings and process or policy to the
  employees

 regular meetings with customers to discuss new production trends fabrics designs
  andor orders as well as any issues or concerns that either party might have with
  the other

 regular meetings with suppliers to discuss new materials andor orders as well as
  any issues or concerns that either party might have with the other
                                                                                              people must be happy this

human rights
                                as a small business impahla has not necessarily been called upon to

                                human rights however as a south african company we are both obliged
                                and committed to living up to our national constitution and to respecting
                                all laws including those pertaining to the fair treatment of employees
                                impahla falls under the watchful eye of the national bargaining council for the clothing
                                industry as well as sactwu the south african clothing and textile workers union
                                and we actively encourage and support employee participation in both of these rights
                                bodies all of our nonmanagement employees are members of the union and are
                                paid according to wage packages as defined by their collective bargaining agreements
                                above national and regional minimum wages moreover we aspire to meet or exceed
                                the bargaining councils collective agreement rules recognising that these rules are
                                merely base level guidelines and that exceeding them within reasonable limits has
                                created a work environment that encourages reciprocal trust respect and commitment
                                between management and our employees

                                shop stewards are aware of the rules and they attend union meetings on behalf of
                                impahla if any problems are raised by our workers the stewards have the right and
                                responsibility to address them with the bargaining council or union without being
                                victimised

                                impahla does not hire child andor forced labour nor do we allow any of our suppliers
                                or subcontractors to engage in these practices

                                impahlas security personnel are contracted through the business park in which we are
                                situated and we have not been informed of any incidents of excessive use of force by
                                security personnel nor would we be willing to allow such behaviour to persist in the
                                exercising of their duties on behalf of impahla

dti codes of good practice
south africas department of trade and industry dti has launched the
dti codes of good practice a set of business principles that are expected
to promote and develop corporate behaviour that meets international best
practice standards for corporate responsibility
the codes came into full effect at the end of february 2008 and impahla sought and
obtained our first status assessment according to these codes after a relatively quick
evaluation process facilitated by the department of trade and industrys online self
assessment toolkit httpbeethedtigovzawebapp we were able to determine that
impahla is a level 2 supplier based on the following category scores
 category                                       points
 ownership                                       599
 management control                             1867
 employment equity                              2700
                                                                                           sometimes it gets hot under the

 preferential procurement                       1417                                        windows to let more air in
 enterprise development                          000
 socioeconomic development spend                000

as a level 2 supplier we are able to offer our customers a significant bonus with
respect to their own preferential procurement scoring in that they can weight impahla
purchases by a factor of 125

although we  as a qualifying small enterprise  do not necessarily need to score
well on all seven elements of the dti scorecard and thus do not need to contribute
to enterprise development ed or socioeconomic development sed we feel that it
would be unfair to report that we do not make any effort in these regards on the ed
front we proudly support and encourage oasis through our recycling programme and
purchase many goods from very small local enterprises on the sed front while we
do not make charitable contributions to charities per se our support of oasis as well
as the contributions we make to our employees over and above their negotiated wages
and benefits should constitute a form of sed spend or corporate social investment

impahla is committed to ensuring that we continuously strive to meet the requirements
of the dti codes of good practice wherever possible and to ensuring that we continue
to provide our customers with the relevant certificates and supporting documentation

the way forward
                                     this is the second time impahla has produced a sustainability report and if
                                     not for the support and encouragement of our consultant michael h rea
                                     we highly doubt we would have been able to generate such a comprehensive
                                     overview of our company our most material issues and our opportunities to
                                     improve our social safety environmental and economic performance
                                     one must understand that as a small owneroperated business our efforts have always
  i enjoy working here the          been firmly invested in ensuring that our customers and employees are happy and that
people are all nice the other       our business remains financially strong and healthy although we recognise that our
workers and the management           data management systems still require further improvement to assist us with maximising
                                     our efficiencies we have nonetheless been able to improve our ability to find and
         are all nice               analyse information for the purpose of informing a wide array of key stakeholders

                                     in short the process of developing our sustainability report continues to be a lengthy
                                     learning exercise yet we accept that the process of reporting affords significant benefits
                                     in terms of being able to use statistics to evaluate our performance including the
                                     conducting of comparisons particularly with respect to issues that are directly related
                                     to our employees

                                     this process has once again given us an opportunity to rethink our bonus structures to
                                     encourage full attendance and to motivate the employees to attend work regularly it
                                     has also assisted us with attempting to identify problems within our business as well as
                                     to find ways to address them

                                     in speaking to our staff michael helped us better understand the issues that they have
                                     apparently felt unable to bring to our attention and has helped create mechanisms for
                                     addressing each of their concerns

                                     as a direct result of our reporting procedures we are committed to

independent third party assurance statement
to the board and stakeholders of spring romance properties 34 pty ltd
trading as impahla clothing hereafter impahla
trialogue pty ltd was commissioned by impahla to provide independent third
party assurance over this 2008 sustainability report the report covering the
period 1 january to 31 december 2008 over the past twelve years trialogue has
consulted to companies on their social environmental and broader sustainability
related responsibilities to society has developed considerable experience in social
and environmental performance management and measurement systems and has
conducted a number of sustainabilityrelated assurance engagements for companies
in south africa

independence
trialogue is independent from impahla has an impartial relationship with the
company and did not undertake any commissions for impahla during the reporting
period concerning reporting or data collection trialogue was not responsible for the
preparation of any part of this report and our responsibility in performing our assurance
activities is to the management of impahla alone in accordance with the terms of our
assurance engagement

assurance objectives
to the best of our ability this assurance engagement has been managed in accordance
with accountabilitys aa1000as 2008 assurance standard where the format of the
engagement was structured to meet the aa1000as type 1 moderate requirements
one objective of the assurance process was therefore to provide impahla management
and stakeholders with an independent type 1 moderate level assurance opinion on
whether the report meets the aa1000as 2008 principles of inclusivity materiality
and responsiveness a second objective was to assess the degree to which the report
is consistent with the global reporting initiative gri g3 guidelines with the specific
purpose of establishing whether or not the report has met the b level of reporting
requirements

scope of work performed
aa1000as 2008 compliance
the process used in arriving at this assurance statement was based on accountabilitys
aa1000as 2008 guidance as well as other best practices in sustainability reporting
assurance our approach to assurance included the following                                  i dont like the nosmoking
 a comprehensive desk review of the report                                                    rule especially when its
 a review of impahlas measurement and reporting procedures                                  raining they give you an
 an interview with impahlas managing director about the effectiveness of processes             umbrella when you go
  used to adhere to the aa1000 accountability principles and                               outside but its not nice to be
 observing and inspecting operational and management practices and processes on            in the cold wet weather when
  a sample basis
                                                                                                       you smoke
it should be noted that this report was assessed at the point of data aggregation for
reporting given that this is a type 1 moderate assurance engagement the accuracy
of specific data within the report was not tested back to source the analysis of data
accuracy was therefore limited to trend appraisal and assessments for reasonableness

gri compliance
in determining the gri g3 application level of the report we performed the following
exercises
 a review of the process used to define the content of the report by looking at
  materiality of issues included in the report stakeholder engagement and responses
  to stakeholder issues identified determination of sustainability context and
  coverage of material issues
 a review of the management approach in addressing topics discussed in the report
  and
 a comprehensive desk review of the report to confirm that the requisite number of
  gri performance indicators has been covered in the report

                                   findings
                                   aa1000as 2008  inclusivity materiality and responsiveness
                                   within the parameters of a moderate level type 1 assurance assessment the report
                                   appears to account accurately for impahlas performance and its sustainability reporting
                                   processes appear to be sound based on the aa1000as 2008 principles of inclusivity
                                   materiality and responsiveness it should be noted that
                                    impahlas stakeholder engagement focuses on a number of key stakeholders broadly
                                     defined within the customer employee and supplier groups although the evidence
                                     suggests that impahla engages regularly with these most important stakeholder
                                     groups there might be other groups that warrant more considered engagement
                                    knowledge about sustainabilityrelated management and reporting rest with key
                                     individuals within the organisation and its consultancy however there is sufficient
                                     evidence to suggest that this knowledge is being transferred more broadly within
                                     the organisation and that appropriate systems have been put in place to embed this
                                     knowledge
                                   gri compliance
                                   based on our review of the report as well as the processes used to collect and collate
                                   information covered in the report we conclude that this report meets the gri g3s
                                   requirements for application level b  which requires a number of standard disclosures
                                   relating to corporate profile and management approaches as well as no fewer than
                                   20 core indicator disclosures with at least one from each of economic environment
                                   human rights labour society and product responsibility reported performance per
                                   gri indicator is identified in impahlas gri indicator table note that
                                    a number of the required gri disclosures particularly those relating to management
                                     approach were covered superficially in the report these disclosures require either
                                     data quality improvements or further detail in disclosure
i know weve had a few more        recommendations
 injuries this year but none of   aa1000as 2008
  them have been major just        impahla should find ways to formalise certain aspects of its stakeholder engagement
   one minor incident where          and should consider including a broader range of stakeholder groups in the process
someone slipped on the stairs       impahla should use the stakeholder engagement process to assess whether or not
                                     this report and all future reports adequately addresses the concerns and reporting
      and hurt their ankle          requirements of its key stakeholders
                                    impahla must ensure that it does not become overly reliant on key individuals for
                                     its management of issues relating to inclusivity materiality and responsiveness but
                                     rather that knowledge and practice are transferred within the organisation
                                    there remains scope for impahla to improve its reporting according to the principles
                                     of inclusiveness materiality and responsiveness as guided by aa 1000as 2008
                                     based on continual improvement impahla should ultimately aim for type 2 high
                                     levels of assurance in future reports
                                   gri compliance
                                   impahla should build on the sound foundations and methodology it has established in
                                   respect of its sustainability reporting process and the range of issues it covers to do so
                                   it should focus first on further improvements in the level of detail and the quality of
                                   data provided for conformance with gri g3 application level b before considering
                                   addressing the requirements of application level a
                                   conclusions
                                   based on the information reviewed trialogue is confident that a systematic process has
                                   been used to derive the information and data presented in this report that it meets the
                                   aa1000as 2008 principles of inclusivity materiality and responsiveness and that it
                                   provides a comprehensive and balanced account of the environmental safety and social
                                   performance of impahla for the period under review moreover although the quality
                                   of reported information or data of some of the gri g3 indicators can be improved this
                                   report appears to meet the gri g3s requirements for application level b b with this
