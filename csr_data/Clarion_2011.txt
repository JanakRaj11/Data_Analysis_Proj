           corporate activities at times sway and deviate it is often so when a companys corporate philos
     ophy is only framed and hung on the wall without taking root in its employees it is impossible in these
     days for a company to be a sustainable and growing enterprise if it pursues only the profit as has
     been stated frequently in the report a valuable enterprise does not mean a company that pursues
     only profit it is a company that is trusted and needed by the society clarions efforts in this direction to
     remain being a valuable enterprise are presented in various parts of the report which can be highly

     evaluated that their relevant systems and organizations are further enhanced there is no end to the
     efforts in the compliance management

     vehicle information terminal play are increasingly wide and far reaching they are expected to deal
     with such functions as processing displaying and controlling energy flow and other information which              this report is available on the internet
     have not been asked for in the conventional vehicles in this sense it can be said that central roles in                            url  httpwwwclarioncomjpencompanyeffortindexhtml
     the making of cars are played by these invehicle information terminals
           the scenes of tremendous numbers of vehicles having been washed away by the tsunami in
     march disaster make me feel strongly how big the potential roles of invehicle information terminals
     are what roles do the invehicle information terminals perform not only at normal and peaceful times                      editorial staff                                                              inquiries
