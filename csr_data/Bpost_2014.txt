excluding this one off payment related to the fine
for competition claim operating free cash flow
generated was 23 million eur higher than 2012
the favorable contribution of the operational
performance was offset by a negative evolution

the second stage consists of deriving the belgian
gaap figures from the ifrs figures and is achieved
by reversing all ifrs adjustments made to local gaap
figures these adjustments include but are not limited
to the following
  differences in the treatment of depreciation and
   impairments belgian gaap allows different useful
   lives and hence depreciation rates for fixed assets
   from ifrs goodwill is amortized under belgian
   gaap while ifrs requires impairment testing for
   goodwill ifrs also allows intangible assets to be
   recorded on the balance sheet under different
   conditions from belgian gaap
  recognition of provisions is subject to different
   criteria under belgian gaap and ifrs
  ifrs requires that all future obligations to
   personnel be recorded as a liability under ias 19
   whereas belgian gaap has no such obligation the
   movements in the ifrs liability are reflected on the      outlook

62      change in accounting
the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for
the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective as from january 1 2013

ias 19 revised includes a number of amendments to the accounting for defined benefit plans
including actuarial gains and losses that are now recognized in other comprehensive income oci
and permanently excluded from profit and loss other amendments dont have an impact on bpost
or simply include new disclosures such as quantitative sensitivity disclosures

the transition to ias 19 revised had an impact on the net postemployment benefit obligations of
bpost due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for those which occur as from january
1 2013 and for those unrecognized at december 31 2012 in other comprehensive income bpost
previously recognized only the cumulative actuarial gains and losses which exceeded 10 of the
greater of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets over two years

the effect of the adoption of ias 19 revised is explained in note 625 and requires restatement of
previous financial statements

have any effect on the presentation the financial performance or position of bpost

63       significant accounting judgments and estimates
a series of significant accounting judgments underlie the preparation of ifrs compliant
consolidated financial statements they impact the value of assets and liabilities estimates and
assumptions are made concerning the future they are reassessed on a continuous basis and are
based on historically established patterns and expectations with regards to future events that
appear reasonable under the existing circumstances

employee benefits  ias 19

the key assumptions inherent to the valuation of employee benefit liabilities and the
determination of the pension cost include employee turnover mortality rates and retirement
ages discount rates benefit increases and future wage increases which are updated on an annual
basis given the increase of the reference database with each year of historical data that is
added the data become ever more stable and reliable actual circumstances may vary from these




88

assumptions giving rise to different employee benefit liabilities which would be reflected as an
additional proﬁt or cost in the income statement

regarding the accumulated compensated absences benefit as at december 31 2013 the
consumption pattern of the illness days was derived from the statistics of the consumption
average over the years 2011 to 2013 the number of days of illness depends on the age identified
per segment of the relevant population since 2010 the rate of guaranteed salary has been
set at 75 in case of longterm illness thus the percentage of the guaranteed salary used for
determining the cost of days accumulated in the notional account is 25

under the collective labor agreement for the years 20122013 signed in march 2012 the balance
of the cumulated unused sickness days for civil servants is limited to a maximum of 63 days
instead of 300 days previously

measurement of the group insurance plan is consistent with the socalled d9 approach this
is in line with the progress made on september 10 2013 by the ifric on the measurement
alternatives to be considered in developing a proposal on accounting for contributionbased
plans with a guaranteed return however the ifric is still in an early discussion phase

for most benefits an average cost per inactive member is used for the valuation of the benefits
this average cost has been estimated by dividing the annual cost for inactive members by
the number of inactive beneficiaries based on the reference data received from the pensions
administration

the discount rates have been determined by reference to market yields at the statement of
financial position date since 2010 bpost used the towers watson tool for the determination of
the discount rates considering a mix of financial and non financial aa corporate bonds

fair value measurement of financial instruments

contingent consideration resulting from business combinations is valued at fair value at the
acquisition date as part of the business combination when the contingent consideration meets
the definition of a financial liability it is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting
date the determination of the fair value is based on discounted cash flows the key assumptions
take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount
factor


64      summary of significant accounting policies
the consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors on march 26
2014 and have been prepared using the measurement basis specified by the international financial
reporting standards ifrs the measurement bases are described in detail in the next paragraphs

the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros eur and all values are rounded to
the nearest million except when otherwise indicated

all accounting estimates and assumptions that are used in preparing the financial statements are
consistent with bposts latest approved budget  longterm plan projections where applicable
judgments are based on the information available on each statement of financial position date




                                                                               annual report
                                                                                         2013        89

although these estimates are based on the best information available to the management actual
results may ultimately differ from those estimates

consolidation

the parent company and all the subsidiaries it controls are included in the consolidation no
exception is permitted

subsidiaries

assets and liabilities rights and commitments income and charges of the parent and the
subsidiaries fully controlled are consolidated in full control is the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities control is
assumed to exist when bpost holds at least 50 plus one share of the entitys voting power these
assumptions may be rebutted if there is clear evidence to the contrary the existence and effect of
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing
whether bpost controls an entity

consolidation of a subsidiary takes place from the date of acquisition which is the date on which
control of the net assets and operations of the acquiree is effectively transferred to the acquirer
from the date of acquisition the parent the acquirer incorporates into the consolidated income
statement the financial performance of the acquiree and recognizes in the consolidated statement
of financial position the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value including any goodwill arising
on the acquisition subsidiaries are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases
intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealized gains and losses on transactions
between group companies are eliminated in full

consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like
transactions and other events in similar circumstances

associates

an associate is an entity in which bpost has significant influence but which is neither a subsidiary
nor a joint venture significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating
policy decisions of the investee but not to control those policies it is assumed to exist when
bpost holds at least 20 of the investees voting power but not to exist when less than 20 is
held these assumptions may be rebutted if there is clear evidence to the contrary

consistent accounting policies are applied throughout the whole group including associates

all associates are accounted for using the equity method the participating interests are separately
included in the consolidated statement of financial position under the caption investments in
associates at the closing date at an amount corresponding to the proportion of the associates
equity as restated under ifrs including the result for the period dividends received from an
investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment

the portion of the result of associates attributable to bpost is included separately in the
consolidated income statement under the caption share of result of associates equity method

unrealized profits and losses resulting from transactions between an investor or its consolidated




90

subsidiaries and associates are eliminated to the extent of the investors interest in the associate

bpost bank is an associate and is accounted for using the equity method as bpost has significant
influence but does not control the management of the company

the bond portfolio of bpost bank is classified as availableforsale financial assets the bonds
include
 fixed income securities bonds negotiable debt instruments sovereign loans in the form of
   securities etc
  variable income securities
   fixed andor variable income securities containing embedded derivatives which are accounted
     for separately if necessary

securities classified in availableforsale financial assets are measured at fair value and changes
in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income under a specific heading unrealized or
deferred gains or losses

for fixed income securities interest is recognized in the income statement using the effective
interest rate method for variable income securities revenues are recorded in profit or loss as soon
as the shareholders general meeting confirms the distribution of a dividend

goodwill and negative acquisition differences

where an entity is acquired the difference recorded on the date of acquisition between the
acquisition cost of the investment and the fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and
contingent liabilities acquired is accounted for as goodwill if the difference is positive or directly
as a profit in the income statement if the difference is negative

contingent consideration if any is measured at fair value at the time of the business combination
and included in the consideration transferred ie recognized within goodwill if the amount
of contingent consideration changes as a result of a postacquisition event such as meeting an
earnings target the change in fair value is recognized in profit or loss

goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually

intangible assets

an intangible asset is recognized on the consolidated statement of financial position sheet when
the following conditions are met
i	the asset is identifiable ie either separable if it can be sold transferred licensed or it results
       from contractual or legal rights
ii	it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset
       will flow to bpost
iii	bpost can control the resource and
iv	the cost of the asset can be measured reliably

intangible fixed assets are carried at acquisition cost including the costs directly attributable
to the transaction but not indirect overheads less any accumulated amortization and less any
accumulated impairment loss the expenses in relation to the research phase are charged to the
income statement the expenses in relation to the development phase are capitalized within
bpost internally generated intangible assets represent mainly it projects




                                                                                   annual report
                                                                                             2013         91

intangible assets are amortized on a systematic basis over their useful life using the straightline
method the applicable useful lives are

property plant and equipment

property plant and equipment are carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation
and less any accumulated impairment loss cost includes any directly attributable cost of bringing
the asset to working condition for its intended use

expenditure on repair and maintenance which serve only to maintain but not increase the value
of fixed assets are charged to the income statement however expenditures on major repair and
major maintenance which increases the future economic benefits that will be generated by the
fixed asset are identified as a separate element of the acquisition cost

borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of an asset
that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are
capitalized as part of the cost of the asset

the depreciable amount is allocated on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset using
the straightline method the depreciable amount is the acquisition cost except for vehicles for
vehicles it is the acquisition cost less the residual value of the asset at the end of its useful life
the applicable useful lives are
  property plant and equipment                                                                                 useful life

lease transactions

a finance lease which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership to
the lessee is recognized as an asset and a liability at amounts equal to the present value of the
minimum lease payments  sum of capital and interest portions included in the lease payments
or if lower the fair value of the leased assets lease payments are apportioned between the
finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability in order to obtain a constant rate
of interest on the debt over the lease term the depreciation policy for leased assets is consistent
with that for similar assets owned




92

rentals paidreceived under operating lease ones that do not transfer substantially all the risks
and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are recognized as an expense by the lessee as an
income by the lessor on a straightline basis over the lease term

investment properties

investment property mainly relates to apartments located in buildings used as post offices

investment properties are carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and less
any impairment loss the depreciation amount is allocated on a systematic basis over the useful
life of the asset using the straightline method the applicable useful lives can be found in the
table that is included in section property plant and equipment

assets held for sale

noncurrent assets are classified as assets held for sale under a separate heading in the statement
of financial position if their carrying amount is recovered principally through sale rather than
through continuing use this is demonstrated if certain strict criteria are met active program to
locate a buyer has been initiated property is available for immediate sale in its present condition
sale is highly probable and is expected to occur within one year from the date of classification

noncurrent assets held for sale are no longer depreciated but may be impaired they are stated at
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell

stamp collection

the stamp collection that is owned by bpost and used durably by it is stated at the reevaluated
amount less discount for the lack of liquidity the revalued amounts are determined periodically
on the basis of market prices bpost proceeds to the reevaluation of its collection every five years
the stamp collection is recorded in the caption other property plant and equipment of the
statement of financial position

impairment of assets

an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell corresponding to the cash that
bpost can recover through sale and its value in use corresponding to the cash that bpost can
recover if it continues to use the asset

when possible the tests have been performed on individual assets when however it is determined
that assets do not generate independent cash flows the test is performed at the level of the cash
generating unit cgu to which the asset belongs cgu  the smallest identifiable group of assets
that generates inflows that are largely independent from the cash flows from other cgus

an impairment test is carried out annually for a cgu to which goodwill is allocated for a cgu to
which no goodwill is allocated impairment test is only carried out when there is an indication of
impairment for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination
is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the cashgenerating units or groups of cash
generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination




                                                                             annual report
                                                                                       2013        93

where an impairment is identified it is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the cgu any excess is then allocated to reduce the carrying amount of
other fixed assets of the cgu in proportion to their book values but solely to the extent that the
selling price of the assets in question is lower than their carrying amount

impairment on goodwill may never be reversed at a later date impairment on other fixed assets is
reversed if the initial conditions that prevailed at the time the impairment was recorded cease to
exist and solely to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the amount
that would have been obtained after depreciation had no impairment been recorded

inventories

inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value at the statement of financial
position date

the acquisition price of interchangeable inventories is determined by application of the fifo
method inventories of minor importance whose value and composition remain stable over time
are stated in the statement of financial position at a fixed value

the cost of inventories comprises all costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present
location and condition including indirect production costs the cost price of stamps includes the
direct and indirect costs of production excluding costs of borrowing and overheads that do not
contribute to bringing them to the present location and condition the allocation of fixed costs of
production to the cost price is based on normal production capacity

a writedown is necessary when the net realizable value at the statement of financial position date
is lower than the cost

share based payments

the stock option plan is measured using valuation techniques based on option pricing models
under these models the options are measured at fair value on the grant date the option price
thus calculated is recognized in the income statement under the section payroll costs and spread
over the term of the options

revenue recognition

revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognized when bpost transfers the significant risks and
rewards of ownership to the buyer and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with
the transaction will flow to the entity

revenue from the rendering of services is recognized according to the stage of completion of
the services rendered in application of this principle the revenue relative to the stamp sale and
franking machine activity is recognized in income at the time the mail is delivered

the remuneration of the sgei is based on the contractual provisions of the management contract
and the revenue is recognized when the services are rendered

bpost also receives commissions on sales of partner products through its network of post offices
commission income is recorded at the time the services are provided




94

interest income is recognized using the effective yield method and the revenue related to
dividends is recognized when the groups right to receive the payment is established rental
income arising from operating leases or investment properties is accounted for on a straight line
basis over the lease term

receivables

receivables are initially measured at their fair value and later at their amortized cost ie the
present value of the cash flows to be received unless the impact of discounting is not significant

an individual assessment of the recoverability of the receivables is made impairment is recognized
where cash settlement is wholly or partially doubtful or uncertain

prepayments and accrued income are also presented under this caption

investment securities

financial assets are assigned to the different categories on initial recognition depending on the
characteristics of the instrument and its purpose a financial instruments category is relevant for
the way it is measured and whether any resulting income and expenses is recognized in profit or
loss or directly in equity

there are different categories of financial assets
1	financial assets held for trading include a derivatives and b assets that bpost has voluntarily
   decided to classify in the category at fair value through profit or loss at the time of initial
   recognition these financial assets are measured at their fair value at each statement of financial
   position date changes in fair value being recognized in the income statement
2	heldtomaturity financial assets are financial assets other than derivatives with fixed or
   determinable payments and fixed maturity dates which bpost has the positive intention and
   ability to hold to maturity these assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective
   interest method
3	loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
   that are not quoted in an active market after initial recognition these are measured at
   amortized cost using the effective interest method
4	availableforsale financial assets constitute a residual category that includes all the financial
   assets not classified under one of the previous categories for instance investments in equity
   instruments other than shares in subsidiaries jointly controlled entities and associates
   investments in openended mutual funds and bonds that bpost has neither the intention nor
   the ability to hold to maturity these availableforsale financial assets are measured at fair
   value with changes in fair value recognized directly in equity until the financial assets are
   derecognized at which time the cumulative gains or losses previously recognized in equity are
   recycled in profit or loss

regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized using
settlement date accounting the fair values of the financial assets are determined by reference to
published price quotations in an active market




                                                                              annual report
                                                                                        2013        95

cash and cash equivalents

this caption includes cash in hand at bank values for collection shortterm investments with
maturity date not exceeding three months as from acquisition date that are highly liquid and are
readily convertible into a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of
changes in value

for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows cash and cash equivalents consist of
cash and shortterm deposits as defined above net of outstanding bank overdrafts

share capital

ordinary shares are classified under the caption issued capital

treasury shares are deducted from equity movements of treasury shares do not affect the income
statement

other reserves comprise the results of the previous periods the legal reserve and the consolidated
reserve

retained earnings include the result of the current period as disclosed in the income statement

employee benefits

shortterm benefits

shortterm benefits are recognized as an expense when an employee has rendered the services to
bpost benefits not paid for on the statement of financial position date are included under the
caption payroll and social security payables

postemployment benefits

postemployment benefits are valued using an actuarial valuation method and provisions are set
up for them under deduction of any plan assets in so far as bpost has an obligation to incur
the costs in relation to these benefits this obligation can be a legal contractual or constructive
obligation vested rights on the basis of past practice

in application of these principles a provision calculated according to an actuarial method laid
down by ias 19 is set up in the context of the postemployment benefits to cover
  the future costs relative to current retirees a provision representing 100 of the future
   estimated costs of those retirees
  the future costs of potential retirees estimated on the basis of the employees currently in
   service taking account of the accumulated service of these employees on each statement of
   financial position date and the probability that the personnel will reach the desired age to
   obtain the benefits the provision is constituted progressively as and when members of the
   personnel advance in their careers

remeasurements comprising of actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the statement
of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through oci in the
period in which they occur remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods




96

actuarial assumptions concerning the discount rate mortality factor costs of future benefits inflation
etc are used to assess employee benefit obligations in conformity with ias 19 actuarial gains and
losses inevitably appear resulting 1 from changes in the actuarial assumptions year on year and 2
deviations between actual costs and actuarial assumptions used for the ias 19 valuation until 2012
bpost had opted to recognize actuarial gains and losses in applying the corridor approach

the calculation of the obligation is done using the projected unit credit method each year of
service confers entitlement to an additional credit unit to be taken into account in valuing the
benefits granted and the obligations pertaining thereto the discount rate used is the yield of
highquality corporate bonds or is based on government bonds with a maturity similar to that of
the benefits being valued

service costs comprising current service costs pastservice costs gains and losses on curtailments
and nonroutine settlements

past service costs resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment should be recognized at
the earlier of the date when 1 the plan amendment or curtailment occurs and 2 the entity
recognizes related restructuring costs in accordance with ias 37 past service costs are recognized
in the income statement

net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or
assets net interest costs are also recognized in the income statement

the plan assets related to the postemployment benefits are measured at their fair value at the
end of the period in the same definition used in ifrs 13

longterm benefits

longterm employee benefits are valued using an actuarial valuation method and provisions are
set up for them under deduction of any plan assets in so far as bpost has an obligation to incur
the costs in relation to these benefits this obligation can be a legal contractual or constructive
obligation vested rights on the basis of past practice

a provision is created for longterm benefits to cover benefits that will only be paid in a number
of years but that are already earned by the employee on the basis of the past service here as well
the provision is calculated according to an actuarial method imposed by ias 19

the provision is calculated as follows
    actuarial valuation of the obligation under ias 19
 fair value of the plan assets
 	provision to be constituted or asset to be recognized if the fair value of the plan assets is higher

remeasurements comprising of actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately through
profit or loss in the period in which they occur

actuarial assumptions concerning the discount rate mortality factor costs of future benefits
inflation etc are used to assess employee benefit obligations in conformity with ias 19 actuarial
gains and losses inevitably appear resulting 1 from changes in the actuarial assumptions year
on year and 2 deviations between actual costs and actuarial assumptions used for the ias 19
valuation these actuarial gains and losses are recognized directly in the income statement

the calculation of the obligation is done using the projected unit credit method each year of
service confers entitlement to an additional credit unit to be taken into account in valuing the
benefits granted and the obligations pertaining thereto the discount rate used is the yield of high
quality corporate bonds or alternatively is based on government bonds with a maturity similar to
that of the benefits being valued

service costs comprising current service costs pastservice costs gains and losses on curtailments
and nonroutine settlements

1 bpost has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events
2 it is probable more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
     obligation and
3 a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made

where the impact is likely to be material mainly for longterm provisions the provision is
estimated on a net present value basis the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is
recognized as a financial expense

income taxes

income tax includes current taxation and deferred taxation current taxation is the amount
of taxes to be paid recovered on the taxable income for the current year together with any
adjustment in the taxes paid to be recovered in relation to previous years it is calculated using
the rate of tax on the statement of financial position date

deferred taxation is calculated according to the liability method on the temporary differences
arising between the carrying amount of the statement of financial position items and their tax
base using the rate of tax expected to apply when the asset is recovered or the liability is settled
in practice the rate in force on the statement of financial position date is used

deferred taxes are not recognized in respect of
1 goodwill that is not amortized for tax purposes
2 the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination
     and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit and
3 investments in subsidiaries branches associates and joint ventures if it is likely that dividends
     will not be distributed in the foreseeable future

a deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference
can be utilized the same principles apply to recognition of deferred tax assets for unused tax
losses carried forward this criterion is reassessed on each statement of financial position date

deferred taxes are calculated at the level of each fiscal entity the deferred tax assets and liabilities
of various subsidiaries may not be presented on a net basis

deferred revenue

deferred revenue is the portion of income received during the current or prior financial periods
but which relates to a subsequent financial period

transactions in foreign currencies

transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the entities
concerned using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions realized exchange
rate gains and losses and nonrealized exchange rate gains and losses on monetary assets and
liabilities on the statement of financial position date are recognized in the income statement

on consolidation the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into euros at the
rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their income statements are translated
at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions the exchange differences arising
on translation for consolidation are recognized in other comprehensive income on disposal of
a foreign operation the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular
foreign operation is recognized in profit or loss

derivative financial instruments

derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
the income statement




                                                                               annual report

65     risk management
any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position
results of operation and liquidities the risks described below are not the only risks that the
company is facing there may be additional risks to the ones described below which the company
is currently unaware of there may be also risks that are currently believed to be immaterial but
which may ultimately have a material adverse effect in the long run

risks relating to the regulatory and legislative framework

the company operates in markets which are heavily regulated including by national eu and
global regulatory bodies bpost is therefore subject to significant regulations in belgium and in
other jurisdictions it is uncertain whether belgian or european regulators or third parties will raise
material issues with regard to bposts compliance with applicable laws and regulations or whether
future legislative regulatory or judicial changes or other regulatory developments will have a
material adverse effect on bposts business financial condition results of operations and prospects

changes to the law of march 21 1991 on public autonomous enterprises the 1991 law and the
existing and future regulations implementing the 1991 law could adversely affect bpost it is not
possible to predict any changes to the 1991 law or any of its implementing regulations including
regarding the licensing conditions that a new entrant is required to satisfy to provide letter mail
services falling within the scope of the uso

following the state aid investigation launched by the european commission in 2009 the company
was required to repay alleged state aid in respect of the period from 1992 to 2012 on may 2
2013 the european commission approved the compensation granted to the company under
the terms of the 5th management contract covering the period from 2013 to 2015 no appeal
was initiated against the european commissions decision although the european commissions
decisions on state aid provide the company with a degree of certainty regarding the compatibility
of the compensation it receives for the provision of services of public economic interest sgeis
with state aid rules for the period from 1992 through 2015 it cannot be excluded that the
company could be subject to further state aid allegations and investigations in respect of this
period in relation to sgeis other public services and other services it performs for the belgian
state and various public entities

pursuant to the 5th management contract and the 1991 law the company will continue to be
the provider of certain sgeis through december 31 2015 in respect of the period commencing
january 1 2016 the belgian state may cease to provide or amend the scope and content of
certain public services may conclude that such services do not constitute sgeis and hence do not
warrant compensation or may not entrust these services to the company

the belgian state has committed to the european commission that it will organize a competitive
transparent and nondiscriminatory tendering procedure with a view to awarding by the end
of 2014 a service concession at national level in respect of the distribution of newspapers and
periodicals in belgium the successful candidate in this tender process will be entitled to begin
providing such services as of january 1 2016 the belgian state has also committed to the
european commission that it will reassess the approach for the entrustment of the other sgeis

set forth in the 5th management contract and in the 1991 law for the period after december 31
2015

the company may be required to provide other postal operators with access to specific elements
of its postal infrastructure or certain services such as post boxes information on change of
address redirection and return to sender services it may be required to provide access at
uneconomic price levels or the access conditions imposed upon it may otherwise be onerous in
the event it fails to comply with this requirement it may also be subject to fines andor other
operators may initiate proceedings seeking damages in national courts

the company is required to demonstrate that its pricing for the services falling within the uso
complies with the principles of affordability cost orientation transparency nondiscrimination
and uniformity of tariffs tariff increases for certain single piece mail and uso parcels are subject
to a price cap formula which inter alia depends on bpost reaching defined quality of service
targets and prior control by the ibptbipt and the ibptbipt may refuse to approve such tariffs
or tariff increases if they are not in compliance with the aforementioned principles or price cap
formula in addition in relation to activities for which bpost is deemed to have a dominant market
position its pricing must not constitute an abuse of such dominant position failure to observe
this requirement may result in fines bpost may also be ordered by national courts to discontinue
certain commercial practices or to pay damages to third parties

it cannot be excluded that in the future ex ante price regulations which would further restrict
the commercial freedom of the company will be introduced in mail or parcel markets where the
company would be deemed to have significant market power

the company is also subject to the requirement of no crosssubsidization between public services
on the one hand and commercial services on the other hand in addition according to state aid
rules if the company engages in commercial services the business case for providing such services
must comply with the private investor test that is the company must be able to demonstrate
that a private investor would have made the same investment decision if these principles are not
complied with the european commission could find that commercial services have benefited from
unlawful state aid and order the recovery of this state aid from the company

the company was designated by the belgian state as a uso provider for an eightyear term
commencing in 2011 the obligation to provide the uso may represent a financial burden on the
company although the 1991 law provides that the company is entitled to compensation by the
belgian state in the event the uso has created an unfair burden there can be no assurance that
the entire net cost of the uso will be covered furthermore going forward if the company were
to be designated as a uso provider there is uncertainty regarding the terms and conditions and
financing mechanism that would apply to the provision of the uso

the interaction between the laws applicable to all private limited liability companies and the
specific public law provisions and principles applicable to the company may present difficulties in
interpretation and cause legal uncertainty for instance bpost is subject to certain specific risks in
relation to employment matters deriving from the application of certain public law provisions and
principles in particular bpost is involved in litigation initiated by a number of auxiliary postmen
which include all postmen recruited from january 1 2010 performing certain core functions such
as collection sorting transport and distribution of mail




                                                                             annual report
                                                                                       2013     101

bposts contractual employees could also challenge their employment status and claim damages
to compensate them for being deprived of statutory employment protection and benefits
amendments to or the introduction of new legislation and regulations including legislation and
regulations relating to state pensions could result in additional burdens for bpost there can also
be no assurance that the company will not face challenges regarding certain employment matters
on state aid grounds

bpost is subject to transport regulations at international eu national and regional levels and
failure to comply with such regulations could result in fines or the suspension or revocation of
licenses

regulatory changes may impact the attractiveness of mail and parcels as a communication means
and hence bposts turnover for instance the introduction of vat on most mail products may
reduce turnover earned from customers that are unable to recover vat bpost may become subject
to stricter customs requirements if enacted optin legislation or any similar legislation whether
at national or eu level would contribute to a significant decline in advertising mail volumes the
enactment of legislation promoting electronic communication such as granting registered email
the same legal status as registered mail could also adversely affect bposts business

regulatory changes may also increase bposts cost of operation eg legislation promoting energy
efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions

risks relating to business operations and company environment

the use of mail has declined in recent years primarily as a result of the increased use of email
and the internet and is expected to continue to decline the rate of decline in mail volumes
may also be affected by egovernment initiatives or other measures introduced by the belgian
state or other public authorities or private enterprises that encourage electronic substitution in
administrative mail

adverse economic conditions have a negative impact on mail and parcels volumes in particular
during times of economic distress volumes of advertising mail may be adversely affected as
bposts clients reduce their advertising budgets or shift their spending to media other than paper
volumes of parcels may also be adversely affected due to the effect of economic distress on the
level of business activity and ecommerce

due to the relatively fixed nature of its cost base a decline in mail volumes may translate into a
significant decline in profit unless bpost can reduce its costs accordingly bpost has introduced
a series of productivity enhancement initiatives to reduce its costs there can be no assurance
however that bpost will realize all of the benefits expected from such initiatives

bpost bank the companys associate is subject to certain risks as a result of its status as a
financial institution it may experience losses in respect of its investment portfolio it is also
exposed to interest rate risk and volatility in interests rates may affect its business bpost bank
may also be required to increase its capital in particular as a result of new capital requirements

bposts strategy involves the development of new products and services to partially compensate
for the effects of declines in mail volumes and if it is unable to introduce such products and
services it may encounter difficulties in increasing operating income

financial risks

exchange rate risk

bposts exposure to exchange rate risk is limited it is monitored but is not actively managed

interest rate risk

bposts associate bpost bank is like any bank subject to the interest rate risk which directly
influences its margin interest rates likewise influence valuation of bpost banks bond portfolio
which is measured as an available for sale asset changes in valuation are reflected as fair value
through other comprehensive income since bpost bank is an equityaccounted entity 50 of
the change in its equity directly influences the consolidated equity of bpost the following table
illustrates the impact of a relative change in interest rates of 1 from 1 to 101 for instance
on bpost bank equity and through the equity pick up on bpost
  as per 31 december                                                                                  2013

bpost is also directly exposed to interest rate risks the loan granted by the european investment
bank eib with an outstanding balance of 818 million eur for which the cost amortization is
foreseen in 2022 carries a floating interest rate 3 months euribor rate minus 37 basis points

financial results of bpost are also influenced by the evolution of the discount rates used to
calculate the employee benefits obligation at december 31 2013 an increase by 05 of the
average discount rates would generate a negative financial charges of 158 million eur a decrease
by 05 of the average discount rates would increase financial charges by 183 million eur for

operational activities

the credit risk by definition only concerns that portion of bposts activities that are not paid
upfront in cash bpost actively manages its exposure to credit risk by investigating the solvency
of its customers this translates into a credit rating and a credit limit the credit rating is updated
every day for all belgian customers for foreign customers the credit rating is updated at each




                                                                                        annual report

contract renewal and ad hoc in case of change in the customer solvency status the credit limit
is followed up on a daily basis if the solvency investigation produces a negative result bpost
requests the customers to make upfront cash payments to provide bank guarantees andor to
grant bpost a direct debit

capital management policies and procedures

bpost monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of the carrying amount of equity versus net debt

the elements composing the equity for this ratio are the same as stated in the equity
reconciliation net debt is composed of loans less investment securities and cash and cash
equivalents the ratio is calculated as net debt  capital

currently bpost has not established a formal set of upper and lower limits for this ratio given
the absence of any significant loans except the eib loan the main objectives for the capital
management are to ensure the companys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide
an adequate return to shareholders

revenues attributable to the mrs operating segment decreased by 457 million eur in 2013
mainly driven by the decline in domestic mail volumes 42 excluding the working days and
elections impacts combined with lower compensation for sgei and decreased revenues in banking
and financial products this was partially offset by the price and mix improvement in domestic
mail and the net positive impact of the proceeds of certain activities of certipost

the increase in pi operating segments revenues in 2013 amounting to 688 million eur is mainly
attributable to the consolidation as from january 1 2013 of landmark global the impact of this
scope change amounted to 395 million eur besides this the solid growth in parcels activities
more than compensated the decline in international mail

intersegment sales are immaterial there is no internal operating income

the ebit attributable to the mrs operating segment increased by 1203 million in 2013 excluding
the negative impact of the provision related to sgei overcompensation 1249 million eur the
ebit of the mrs operating segment decreased by 46 million as the decline in revenues was almost
offset by cost reductions

the ebit attributable to the pi operating segment decreased by 19 million eur compared to
2012 to reach 47 million eur the positive impact of the consolidation of landmark global
combined with the positive contribution to the ebit of the volume growth in parcels activities
were compensated by the restructuring provision and the impairment on the goodwill and the
fixed assets related to distribution activities of special logistics total impact of 117 million eur
and the increased costs for the shop  deliver project 19 million eur without those last two
elements ebit of the pi segment would have increased by 117 million eur

profit from operating activities attributable to the corporate reconciliation category improved by
93 million eur in 2012 the reversal of a pending litigation provision of 227 million eur recorded
in the past to cover a risk of litigation relating to offbalance sheet transactions conducted prior
to year 2012 had a positive impact on the ebit of the reconciliation category excluding the
impact of this reversal ebit increased by 320 million eur as a result of costs reduction in central
units the positive impact of the real estate management program and positive evolution in
provisions

no deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries
and associates because bpost has control on the reversal of the temporary difference and it is
probable that they will not be reversed in the foreseeable future


614 earnings per share
in accordance with ias 33 the basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net
profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year

diluted earnings per share amounts have to be calculated by dividing the net profit attributable
to ordinary equity holders of the parent after adjusting for the effects of all dilutive potential
ordinary shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year
plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the
dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares




                                                                           annual report

in case of bpost no effects of dilution affect the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders
and the weighted average number of ordinary shares the changes in the weighted average number
of shares for the years 20112012 and 2013 is due to a timing difference between the acquisition
of shares by alteris a 100 bpost subsidiary from the beneficiaries of the stock option plan
in 2011 and 2012 and the repurchase in december 2012 of those shares by pie shareholder
from alteris as a result of this timing difference treasury shares were recorded at alteris
as a consequence for both 2011 and 2012 the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the year is impacted by the alterisowned shares for the fraction of the year
they are owned by alteris

in may 2013 the shareholders meeting decided to split the shares the total number of shares
amounts to 200000944 shares post stock split before stock split it amounted to 409838 shares

intangible assets decreased from 955 million eur to 89 million eur by 65 million eur which was
caused by the following reasons
  investments in software and licenses 123 million eur development costs capitalized 58
   million eur and other intangible assets 03 million eur
  amortization  impairments 273 million eur of which an impairment on goodwill of 69
   million eur related to special logistics activities
  transfers from other categories for 24 million eur

all amortization and impairment charges are included in the section depreciation amortization
of the income statement

as a result of the impairment on the goodwill related to special logistics activities the carrying
amount of the goodwill arising from cashgenerating units has decreased from 484 million eur to
415 million eur this impairment is the consequence of the decision of the board of eurosprinters
nv on december 24 2013 to announce its intention to stop its distribution activities and to focus
on its sprinter activities

an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of an asset or cash
generating units exceeds the recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher of net
realizable value and value in use the amount of the goodwill is fully owned to acquisitions of the
cashgenerating units which took mainly place in 2011 and 2012

the carrying value of these cashgenerating units excluding interest bearing and tax related assets
and liabilities represents on average a multiple of 47 on operating profit before exceptional items
the net realizable value of these cashgenerating units for purposes of impairment review ie the fair
value less costs to sell has been assessed with reference to earnings multiples for recently acquired
business combinations on this basis the net realizable value has been assessed to be in excess of the
carrying value for none of the remaining cashgenerating units impairment had to be recognized




                                                                                           annual report

the earnings multiples referenced would need to reduce by about 22 to reduce the net realizable
value below the carrying value of all cashgenerating units

besides the goodwill there are no other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives

and rent contracts

group insurance benefit valued in accordance with ias 19 in 2012 the service cost included the
costs relating to the parttime plan 140 million eur

of a number of sickdays for some specific civil servants in exchange for the payment of a
compensation as a result the defined benefit obligation decreased and generated an operating
gain of this part settlement of 211 million eur in 2012 this income was considered as non
recurring

interest costs and financial actuarial gains or losses have been recorded as financial costs all other
expenses summarized above were included in the income statement caption payroll costs

until 2012 bpost recognized all actuarial gains and losses of postemployment benefits in
accordance with the corridor approach through profit and loss as from financial year 2010
bpost adopted a systematic method for faster recognition of actuarial gains and losses for post
employments benefits by an amortization over two years or average remaining service period for
the active population if shorter than two years the expense amounted to 61 million eur in 2012
and to 19 million eur in 2011 all net actuarial gains or losses amortized in the yearly expense
were recognized as operating costs

this sensitivity analysis has been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on
defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the
end of the reporting period

in november 2011 the belgian government has adopted new measures concerning the adaptation
of the legal retirement age and the new conditions of parttime career interruption the intention
of bpost is to do everything possible to minimize their potential impact at this moment it is
not possible to estimate the potential financial impact of the new law and its application on the
defined obligation benefits of bpost

postemployment benefits

postemployment benefits include family allowances transport costs bank costs funerary costs
retirement gifts and group insurance

family allowances

the civil servants of bpost both active and pensioners with children at their charge youths and
disabled receive a family allowance from office national dallocations familiales pour travailleurs
salariés onafts  rijksdienst voor kinderbijslag voor werknemers rkw these costs are then
reinvoiced to bpost

transportation

inactive civil servants as well as their family members are entitled to personal vouchers that
can be exchanged for a transport ticket for a trip in belgium or for a price reduction on other
transport tickets when an affiliated worker or retired worker dies the spouse and children
continue to receive this benefit under some conditions

in 2012 an amount of 22 million eur was recognized in the income statement due to a change in
the population eligible to this benefit

bank

all active members prepensioners and pensioners that have a postcheque account in which their
salarypension is paid benefit from a reduction of the fees charged on the current account as well
as favorable interest rates on savings accounts savings certificates investment funds and loans

group insurance

bpost offers to its active contractual employees a group insurance benefit since the introduction
of the waplpc legislation in belgium these plans have the characteristics of a defined benefit
plan under ias 19 however until 2013 the legal minimum return for employer contributions was
matched by the guaranteed interest from the insurer

according to the legislation the employer has to guarantee a certain return on the plan assets
bpost should provide the legal minimum return of 325 on employer contributions after costs
on premiums and 375 on employee contributions the legal minimum return on employer
contributions is a career average return and not a year by year return where the legal minimum
on the employee contributions should be granted on a year by year basis

due to the change since 2013 in the tariff structure guaranteed by the insurance company there
is potentially a gap between the legal minimum return and the return guaranteed by the insurance
company

until now ias 19 was never clear on how to value such plans and ias 19 rev 2011 did not
bring any clarification however in its meeting on september 10 2013 ifric progressed on
the measurement alternatives to be considered in developing a proposal on accounting for
contributionbased plans with a guaranteed return measurement approaches under consideration
are consistent with the socalled d9 approach as a result this plan was included in the ias 19
calculation as at december 31 2013

longterm employee benefits

longterm employee benefits include accumulated compensated absences pension saving days and
parttime benefits

accumulated compensated absences

civil servants are entitled to 21 sickdays per year during these 21 days and if they have received
the appropriate note from a doctor they receive 100 of their salary if any given year a civil
servant is absent less than 21 days the balance of the unused sickness days is carried over to the
following years up to a maximum of 63 days as from april 2012 instead of 300 days previously
employees who are ill for more than 21 days during a year will first use up the years allotment
and then use the days carried over from previous years as per their individual account during this
period they will receive their full salary once the allotment of the year and the days carried over
are used up they receive reduced payments

both the full salary paid under the sick days scheme and the reduced payments beyond that are
costs incurred by bpost

there have been no modifications to the calculation methodology comparatively to 2012 the
valuation is based on the future projected payments  cash outflows the cash outflows are
calculated for the totality of the population considered based on a certain consumption pattern
derived from the statistics over the 12 months of 2013 the individual notional accounts are
projected for the future and decreased by the actual number of days of illness

the annual payment is the number of days used and limited by the number of days in the savings
account multiplied by the difference between the projected salary increased with social charges
at 100 and the reduced payments the relevant withdrawal and mortality rates have been applied
together with the discount rate applicable to the duration of the benefit

the collective labor agreements negotiated in march 2012 has triggered in 2012 the elimination
of a number of sickdays for some specific civil servants in exchange for the payment of a
compensation

pension saving days

civil servants have the possibility to convert the unused sick days above the 63 days in their
notional account see above accumulated compensated absences  benefit in pension saving
days 7 sick days per 1 pension saving day and to convert each year a maximum of 3 days of
extralegal holidays contractual employees with a permanent contract are entitled to a maximum




132

of 2 pension saving days per year and have the possibility to convert each year a maximum of 3
days of extralegal holidays the pension saving days are accumulated year over year and can be
used as from the age of 50

the methodology of valuation is based on the same approach as the benefit accumulated
compensated absences the valuation is based on the future projected payments  cash
outflows these are calculated for the totality of the population considered based on a certain
consumption pattern derived from the statistics over the 12 months of 2013 as provided by
the human resource department the individual pension saving days accounts are projected per
person and decreased by the actual number of used pension saving days

the annual payment is the number of pension saving days used multiplied by the projected
daily salary increased with social charges holiday pay end of year premium management and
integration premium the relevant withdrawal and mortality rates have been applied together
with the discount rate applicable to the duration of the benefit

parttime regime 50

under the collective labor agreements covering respectively the years 20092010 and 2011
statutory employees aged between 50 and 59  are entitled to enter into a system of partial
50 career interruption bpost makes contributions equal to 75 of the gross annual salary for a
period of a maximum of 48 months

the framework agreement of december 20 2012 approved a new plan of specific partial 50
career interruption accessible to the distributors aged as from 54 years old and to the other
employees aged as from 55 years old bpost makes contributions equal to 75 of the gross annual
salary for a period of a maximum of 72 months for the distributor agents and 48 months for the
other beneficiaries of the plan the joint committee of december 19 2013 has agreed to extend
the measure to the non distributor agents until the next collective labor agreement

termination benefits

early retirement scheme

at the end of 2013 the following previous earlyretirement plans are included in this benefit
 the plan covered by the collective labor agreement for 2011 accessible to the civil servants
  meeting certain age and service organization conditions as at 31122012 at the latest and
 a new plan accessible only in 2011 to the civil servants of one specific department subject to
  age and seniority conditions as described in the joint committee convention of october 6
  2011




134

in these earlyretirement schemes bpost continues to pay to the beneficiaries a portion 75 of
their salary at departure and until they reach retirement age furthermore the earlyretirement
period is treated as a service period

the framework agreement of july 1 2012 approved a new earlyretirement plan accessible to the
civil servants meeting certain age seniority and service organization conditions as at december
31 2013 at the latest bpost continues to pay to the beneficiaries a portion between 60 and
75 depending on the duration of the earlyretirement of their salary at departure and until
they reach retirement age furthermore the earlyretirement period is treated as a service period
the joint committee of december 19 2013 has approved to extend this measure until the next
collective labor agreement

the employee benefit related to the early retirement schemes arises because of the fact that the
employment is terminated before the normal retirement and the fact that it is the employees
decision to accept the offer made by bpost in exchange

the provision for litigation amounts to 395 million eur it represents the expected financial
outflow relating to many different litigations or potential litigations between bpost and third
parties none of the individual provisions is material in itself

the period anticipated for the cash outflows pertaining thereto is dependent on developments in
the length of the underlying proceedings for which the timing remains uncertain

a reversal from the provision for litigation of 85 million eur was recorded in 2013 as some payroll
related issues were definitively resolved

the reversal in 2012 amounts to 332 million eur and is mainly due to a reversal of a pending
litigation provision for 227 million eur recorded in the past to cover a risk of litigation relating
to offbalance sheet transactions conducted prior to 2010 as the matter was definitively resolved




                                                                                        annual report
                                                                                                  2013    139

in the course of 2012 the provision was no longer necessary and was reversed this reversal
is considered to be a nonrecurring item nonrecurring items represent significant income or
expense items that due to their nonrecurring character are excluded from internal reporting and
performance analyses a nonrecurring item is deemed to be significant if it amounts to eur 20
million or more reversals of provisions whose addition had been considered as nonrecurring are
also considered as nonrecurring

reversal from the provision for litigation of 96 million eur was recorded in 2011 as some payroll
related risks were definitively resolved the reversals were considered as non recurring as the
addition to the provision had also been reported as nonrecurring

the amount of the provision for sgei related litigation is mainly explained by the decision of the
european commission an amount of 299 million eur was provisioned in 2011 this provision was
used in 2012 as the recovery amount was paid to the belgian state a second provision of 1249
million eur was created in 2012 for the risk related to a possible overcompensation of the 2011
and 2012 periods on may 2 2013 the european commission approved the compensation granted
to the company under the terms of the 5th management contract covering the period from 2013
to 2015 the european commissions decision was not appealed which settled this litigation in
2013 all amounts are considered as nonrecurring

the provision related to environment issues covers among others soil sanitation the reduction
in 2012 is explained by the sale of two specific sites while in 2013 an additional provision of 02
million eur was recorded relating to one specific site

the provision on onerous contracts concerns the best estimate of the costs relating to the closing
down of mail and retail offices and the restructuring of the special logistics distribution activities
the majority of these settlements are expected within the next 5 years the additional provisions
which were recognized in 2013 are related to the vision 2020 project and the restructuring within
special logistics

other provisions amount to 103 million eur the increase in 2013 is mainly due to a provision
which was recognized to cover the end of contract damage related costs for vehicles

bpost is currently involved in the following legal proceedings initiated by intermediaries
 a claim for damages in an alleged provisional amount of approximately 199 million eur
  exclusive of late payment interest in the context of legal proceedings initiated by publimail nv
  sa and pending before the brussels commercial court
 a claim for damages in an alleged provisional amount of approximately 28 million eur
  exclusive of late payment interest in the context of legal proceedings initiated by link2biz
  international nv and pending before the brussels commercial court certain aspects of the
  contractual relationship between link2biz and bpost are also the subject of a cease and desist
  order adopted on june 21 2010 which bpost has appealed in august 2010 and which is
  currently pending before the brussels court of appeal

all claims and allegations are contested by bpost

moreover on july 20 2011 the belgian postal regulator biptibpt concluded that certain
aspects of the companys 2010 pricing policy infringed the belgian postal act and imposed a fine
of 23 million eur while bpost paid the fine in 2012 it contests the biptibpts findings and
appealed the decision the appeal is pending before the brussels court of appeal




140

finally on december 10 2012 the belgian competition authority concluded that certain aspects
of the companys pricing policy over the january 2010july 2011 period infringed belgian and
european competition law and imposed a fine of approximately 374 million eur while bpost
paid the fine in 2013 it contests the belgian competition authoritys findings and appealed the
decision the appeal is currently pending before the brussels court of appeal


628 contingent liabilities and contingent assets
as of december 31 2013 bpost had 4911 auxiliary postmen in 2013 45 auxiliary postmen
initiated a lawsuit against the company in the brussels and charleroi labor courts claiming equal
salary and benefits by reference to baremic contractual employees performing the same work
mainly under the nondiscrimination provisions set forth in articles 10 and 11 of the belgian
constitution all claims and allegations are contested by bpost

however if the courts were to find that this principle is applicable and bpost is found to have
violated it the labor courts will most likely order bpost to increase the compensation of the
auxiliary postmen to the level of relevant baremic contractual employees and it cannot be
excluded that other employees could bring similar claims


629 rights and commitments
