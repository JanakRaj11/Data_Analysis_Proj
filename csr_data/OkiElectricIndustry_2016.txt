and medical equipment we will go further in developing                          to develop new markets such as energy and aviation and

  responsibility for peoples safety infuses our monozukuri culture
  for medical equipment adherence to extremely high task process standards is necessary because
  malfunctions could result in incidents that put peoples lives at risk there is considerable pride that
  goes into a monozukuri culture that prizes high quality and medical equipment requires a different
  sort of monozukuri approach than what is commonly accepted for infotelecom systems it was a
  culture shock for me but i have gained an appreciation for the safetyfirst values and sense of mis
  sion necessary to manufacture medical equipment where peoples lives could be at stake morale

  every day such as coming up with our own ideas for tools

  a major strength of the optical fiber sensing technology is that it can comprehensively grasp the status of structures without using
  a large number of sensors capitalizing fully on this strength of this technology we are working to develop data mining and reliable
  sensing technologies that can accurately grasp the status of large structures such as bridges and tunnels that are seen as an aging
  risk given their long service record

     corporate governance




     two outside directors with a high level of independence on okis board of directors use their expertise to
     support strong and effective governance



     strong and effective governance that is
     positive and forwardlooking
     i have endeavored over the past six years as an outside director to contribute to strong
     and effective governance using my knowledge as a legal specialist with the addition in
     2015 of mr minoru morio who has extensive experience as a corporate executive the
     board has two outside directors who can each draw on their fields of expertise to voice
     their objective viewpoints my impression is debate at board meetings has become
     much livelier there were times soon after i joined the board when i felt perplexed
     because i could not grasp insider terms unique to oki used in debates now agenda
     items are explained to us in advance much more thoroughly and i can come to meet
     ings well prepared for debates
         the word governance tends to be seen as imposing constraints or topdown
     controls but the sort of governance we should aspire to is one that cultivates a cor
     porate culture where executive officers do not fear failure and boldly seek to address
     challenges with confidence with a new president at the helm the oki group will need
     to reinforce the groups management system so it can fly even further if in doing so
     it restrains or rejects free speech in the workplace and value creation by those offer
     ing a rich variety of ideas this would put the methods cart before the value cre
     ation horse i would like to check steadfastly from an objective viewpoint whether
     decisionmaking by management is carried out properly while always keeping in mind
     the notions of positive and forwardlooking

                                                  this is my second tenure as an outside director at oki i began my career at a company
                                                  that was in many ways a pioneer in japanese corporate governance such as its decision
                                                  to seat an outside director on its board so when i joined okis board for the first time in
                                                  2001 my first impression was that its culture was quite traditional even when i voiced
                                                  my views as an outside director at board meetings this more often than not did not
                                                  provoke discussion so i felt more than a few times there were missed opportunities
                                                      okis current management team feels a strong sense of urgency on the need for
                                                  change and has put into place a framework for change the operation of the board of
                                                  directors has improved as executive officers provide us with detailed explanations of
                                                  agenda items in advance so board members can openly debate them based on the

         these fair values are presented at amount recorded in balance sheets since they are settled in a short period of time and their fair value

         reasonably approximates the amount recorded in the balance sheets
     4 longterm debt
         the fair value is based primarily on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest amounts is discounted by an as
         sumed interest rate to be applied for newly borrowed longterm loans some longterm borrowings with floating interest rates and related
         interest rate swaps are accounted for using special accounting treatment applicable to interest rate swaps hence the fair value of a
         longterm borrowing is based on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest treated in combination with the said
         interest rate swap is discounted by a reasonably estimable interest rate to be applied for newly borrowed longterm loans under similar
         borrowing terms
     derivative transactions
         described in note13

     unlisted equity securities 9612 million 85821 thousand and 9690 million at march 31 2016 and 2015 respectively are not included in
     3 securities and investments in securities because they have no market price and it is deemed extremely difficult to assess their fair values
