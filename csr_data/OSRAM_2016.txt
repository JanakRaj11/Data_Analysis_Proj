describe the organizations supply chain
osram purchases a broad range of products from partners worldwide in general our suppliers are separated
into direct material suppliers for raw semifinished and packaging material finished product suppliers and
indirect material and service suppliers our procurement function is organized regionally according to raw
materials groups and managed globally it is responsible for the complete purchasing volume
around twothirds of our purchasing volume is attributable to direct materials and finished products sourcing is to
a large extent directly impacted by market conditions for commodities such as nickel copper tin or derivatives
eg plastic resins or paper products in glass and lamp production energy is also an important part of sourcing
the main finished products manufactured by third parties include certain compact fluorescent lamps led lamps
luminaires and conventional as well as electronic control gears which are acquired as part of different business
models such as contract manufacturing or as merchandise depending on the strategy for the product in question
we also source services such as transportation of all kinds via suppliers with their own operating networks
in fiscal 2015 the purchasing volume ie the goods and services acquired from third parties amounted to around
29 billion the most significant countries in terms of purchasing volumes in fiscal year 2015 were germany
china malaysia and the united states of america approximately one third of the total purchasing volume is
sourced in emerging markets
additionally our own manufacturing activities are a mainstay of our business activity our production expertise is
based on longstanding experience and consistent development of our footprint important locations and additional

the shift towards semiconductor technology continued to radically alter our business environment and we
continued to counter this in fiscal 2015 primarily using the measures forming part of our osram push
improvement program beyond the technologyrelated shifts changes are increasingly becoming apparent in the
business models pursued by companies active in the lighting market the past fiscal year saw osram react to
the transformation of the lighting market which is proceeding at different speeds and posing a variety of
challenges by departing from its previous strategy in which it positioned itself as a provider of diversified product
portfolios along the entire value chain
osrams basic shareholder structure changed only slightly compared with the previous year as of september
30 2015 around 68 of the shares were held by institutional investors an increase of around five percentage
points compared with the 2014 closing rate retail investors held around 14 of the companys shares and

organizationally the interdisciplinary and companywide topic of sustainability is directly anchored at senior
management level via the chief sustainability officer the tasks to be performed and focus issues are developed
and prepared by the corporate sustainability office together with the content owners concerned they are then
presented and discussed at the sustainability council which is made up of representatives of the regions and
business units as well as the heads of the corporate functions relevant to sustainability the council approves
the proposed resolutions on sustainability to be submitted to the managing board the corporate sustainability
office is responsible for preparing sustainability council meetings and manages the process of implementing
decisions the sustainability council meets twice per fiscal year the focus in the last fiscal year was on the
materiality analysis and the resulting consequences for the corresponding business areas
the corporate sustainability office used stakeholder engagement to expand the materiality analysis identification
and assessment of key sustainability topics during fiscal 2015 after the council had taken osrams and
stakeholders viewpoints into account and assessed sustainability topics from both an internal and external
perspective we incorporated external stakeholders in the materiality analysis for the first time particularly in
relation to the perspective from outside the company representative members of each stakeholder group
assessed preselected sustainability topics and the results were discussed and confirmed by the sustainability
council in the economic dimension the key topics are operational  brand excellence innovation management
corporate governance and in the environmental dimension the key topics are product responsibility operational
ecoefficiency and climate strategy from the social perspective they are labor practices occupational health
and safety and human capital management

indicators added by osram
as mentioned before innovation management and quality are key drivers in safeguarding osrams economic
sustainability our brand promise for fiscal 2015 was innovation  quality we believe that the ability to innovate
is an opportunity and that our combined knowhow in the areas of traditional and led technology together with
our deep understanding of lighting applications will be important success factors in our transition to led products

innovation management research and development rd
osrams innovative strength is a core foundation for its medium and longterm economic sustainability as a
leading provider in the global lighting industry we occupy a strong position in research and development rd
particularly in the fastgrowing led business the shift in the lighting market means that this business is constantly
growing in significance we responded to this by further increasing the proportion of rd expenditure for led
related topics in the past fiscal year this moderate increase is only apparent on an adjusted basis since rd
transformation costs had an increased effect in the traditional business in fiscal 2015 on a reported basis the
ratio of rd expenditure for led products to total rd expenditure remained stable please find the related
numbers and information in our  annual report 2015 table on p 69 and section research and development

quality
in line with our brand promise innovation  quality we aim to ensure that our products meet the highest quality
standards and perform reliably at osram a series of quality first measures accompany products across their
whole life cycles irrespective of whether the value is created in our own production facilities or beforehand at our
suppliers internationally recognized quality management systems are used to monitor every stage efficiently and
to make any necessary adjustments consistently and transparently we are only able to ensure very high constant
product quality by systematically implementing our own requirements in this way

all manufacturing sites have iso 9001 certification underlining our efforts towards achieving high standards
in addition those sites that supply automotive customers meet the strict requirements of the iso ts 16949 quality

disclosures on management approach for environmental
for osram environmental protection includes a sustainable approach to energy saving water conservation
waste disposal and chemicals as well as monitoring emissions in addition great importance is placed on
environmentally friendly design and product recycling these objectives are anchored in our ehs environmental
protection health management and safety policy which is binding on all operating sites worldwide it defines our
environmental policy guidelines and targets for the company in order to monitor ongoing compliance with our
environmental targets we have introduced clear areas of responsibility with corresponding management powers
in line with the international iso 14001 standard we regularly receive a matrix certificate for this for all of our

aspect materials
aspectspecific dma guidance for materials
as a producing company we use materials for our products for packaging and to facilitate processes we assume
product responsibility and develop manufacture and market our products in accordance with principles that ensure
customer safety and do not endanger the environment

we avoid waste wherever possible our lamps only contain a minimum amount of environmentally damaging
substances and we do not use unnecessary packaging materials we continuously work on improving our products
to make them as recyclable as possible when developing new products we reduce the amount of harmful
substances or if possible completely replace them with harmless substances

we aim to reduce the mercury content in all our products to the lowest amount technically possible therefore we
are constantly improving our product and production technology and we are continually upgrading our existing
production facilities to implement such technologies we are actively championing the introduction of globally
harmonized substance restrictions for example we are supporting the goal of uniformly introducing the stricter
mandatory european mercury limits continued in the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in
lighting industry products worldwide including via the minimata convention on mercury please find details in our
 annual report 2015 product responsibility p 75

we use environmental product declaration as a transparent method to communicate our committment to
sustainability for business customers understanding the environmental impact of sourced inputs enables the
overall environmental footprint of products or processes to be measured and for a thorough lifecycle assessment
to be conducted

please see our  annual report 2015 section packaging product responsibility recycling on p 7576 as

percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials
the design process which includes packaging makes a significant contribution to waste prevention early on
osram has clear guidelines for the design and procurement of packaging packaging should be made from
environmentally sustainable materials that can be easily recycled or disposed of in addition its volume and weight
should be limited to the amount required to protect the contents this means that for the majority of our products
folding boxes are used for primary packaging and corrugated cardboard boxes for shipment packaging the
cardboard and paper used to produce these packaging components currently have a recycled content of more
than 80

we implemented a packondemand process in the past fiscal year initially at the molsheim site this is aimed at
meeting specific customer requirements achieving higher packing densities and as a result reducing costs and
the number of transports it means that the majority of lamps are only packed and stamped with the customer or
osram brand once a corresponding order has been received

the aim of product recycling is to recover as many sorted materials as possible in order to conserve limited
resources and to protect the environment through the professional disposal of hazardous substances anticipating
the concept of recycling at an early product development stage means that a large proportion of osrams lamp
components are recyclable as a result osram ensures that over 90 of its lamp components can be recycled
osram meets its obligation as a manufacturer to take back products eg under the european weee waste
electrical and electronic equipment directive by participating in organizations companies and foundations that
were specially set up for this purpose fluorescent lamps and discharge lamps contain small amounts of mercury
and valuable raw materials led lamps and luminaires also contain valuable raw materials along with electronic
components this is why it is important that the products are collected and recycled or disposed of safely

aspect energy
aspectspecific dma guidance for energy
within our production processes primary energy use still plays a significant role that again leads to direct co 2
emissions in order to comprehensively address the issue of energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg
emissions in our own production facilities we use our ehs policy set internal targets and monitor the
achievements by our environmental management system

within the osram group energy efficiency is how we measure both our products and lighting solutions and our
production facilities on a daytoday basis one example is our energy efficiency project under which a global
active team has been devoted to implementing energysaving and efficiency measures at all plants since 2013
the team continued to devote itself to energysaving measures with the same high level of commitment in fiscal
2015 enabling a roughly 3 increase in global energy productivity at the end of the fiscal year this relates to
both primary and secondary energy consumption further reducing the companys worldwide co 2 emissions

at the beginning of 2015 we commissioned a further combined heat and power chp plant in eichstätt which in
january 2016 has been granted as bhkw of the year by the german association of cogeneration of heat and
power it joins the existing chp plants in regensburg herbrechtingen and schwabmünchen this enables us to
achieve sizeable savings that are not only welcome from an environmental perspective but also cut costs these
chp plants not only use directly produced waste heat for heating and providing process heat  they also use
absorption refrigeration systems to transform this thermal energy into process cooling further chp plants are
currently being planned for example for schwabmünchen to support our plants with electricity heat and process
cooling generated onsite

iso 50001 matrix certification was issued to all plants in germany in the past fiscal year it was resolved to
introduce iso 50001 energy management at all other european plants in order to achieve further increases in
energy efficiency through systematic management

gj this directly impacted co2 emissions which amounted to 203559 tons previous year 233891 tons for
primary energy consumption and 369019 tons previous year 386271 tons for electricity

aspect water
aspectspecific dma guidance for water
in the production of lighting products water is mainly needed for cooling processes and thus hardly polluted but
for osram it is still of great importance to use water responsibly we commit ourselves to manage water and
other precious resources sustainably in our guidelines thus we make sure to either clean polluted water ourselves
or redirect it to local sewage plants furthermore we consider the scarcity of this precious resource in all our
production processes and monitor our water usage

we keep an extra eye on those production sites that are located in areas of water stress or scarcity there we
place a special focus on continuously monitoring and improving our production processes to make them ever more
waterefficient and thus more economical as well as ecological many osram production sites have taken steps
to use the most environmentally advanced production techniques that reduce the usage of water to a minimum
you can find examples on our website wwwosramcomfactories

aspect products and services
aspectspecific dma guidance for products and services
our products affect the environment in a variety of ways obviously they are made in factories that have an
environmental footprint and they significantly impact on the environment during their use however in order to
evaluate lighting products and services and how they actually deal with energy and resources it is not enough
just to consider single stages of their life cycle in order to assess the environmental performance of osram
products life cycle analyses of several specific products were conducted representing different lighting
technologies
we work to reduce the use of critical substances wherever technically and economically viable a process that
also goes beyond the legal requirements we are actively championing the introduction of globally harmonized
substance restrictions for example we are supporting the goal of uniformly introducing the stricter mandatory
european mercury limits continued in the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive in lighting
industry products worldwide including via the minimata convention on mercury osram fully complies with these
limits
osram meets its obligation as a manufacturer to take back products eg under the european weee waste
electrical and electronic equipment directive by participating in organizations companies and foundations that
were specially set up for this purpose fluorescent lamps and discharge lamps contain small amounts of mercury
and valuable raw materials led lamps and luminaires also contain valuable raw materials along with electronic
components this is why it is important that the products are collected and recycled or disposed of safely

g4en27
extent of impact mitigation of environmental impacts of products and services
the rohs directive which also imposes mercury limits for lamps serves as a model for comparable legislation
in other countries and regions four further phthalates plasticizers used in plastics were added to the list of
restricted substances in june 2015 they must be withdrawn from use by mid2019 at the latest we do not use
phthalates in our own production processes but are also required to ensure that this is the case throughout our
supply chain we have developed and implemented a dedicated sap tool that enables us to monitor the use of
critical substances at the component level and to ensure longterm legal compliance given the constantly
increasing requirements
in the past we conducted life cycle analyses for certain typical products in order to evaluate the overall impact of
osram products on the environment the methodology used for these analyses was based on the international
iso 14040 and iso 14044 standards

the aim of product recycling is to recover as many sorted materials as possible in order to conserve limited
resources and to protect the environment through the professional disposal of hazardous substances anticipating
the concept of recycling at an early product development stage means that a large proportion of osrams lamp
components are recyclable as a result osram ensures that over 90 of its lamp components can be recycled

aspect supplier environmental assessment
aspectspecific dma guidance for supplier environmental assessment
the supply chain plays a key role for us in sustainability it requires a high degree of flexibility particularly in view
of the technology shift our procurement function is managed globally but is organized regionally with regard to
certain raw materials groups on the one hand this type of organization enables us to optimally supply the
production and sales units and to stay in close contact with suppliers across all of the business units on the
other global pooling enables us to achieve economies of scale that make a substantial contribution to the
companys productivity
for us sustainability in the supply chain means implementing our high environmental social and ethical
standards in our business relationships with our suppliers a key part of this is our code of conduct for suppliers
like our own business conduct guidelines it incorporates the most important international standards and
conventions and addresses significant topics such as compliance the environment human rights and conflict
minerals it covers areas such human rights labour environment anticorruption combines important
international standards eg universal declaration of human rights ilo declaration on fundamental principles
and rights at work agenda 21 on sustainable development un convention against corruption and clearly
summarizes our basic values in addition to their acceptance of our code of conduct we require our suppliers to
provide relevant selfdisclosures and compliance audits are performed to check these in addition we hold supplier
days in various regions to exchange information with our suppliers another cornerstone of our supplier
management is the expertise of our employees which we expand by providing specialized training
one of the aspects of a sustainable supply chain that has recently gained special relevance is the issue of conflict
minerals we addressed this by introducing a corresponding policy and expanding our code of conduct for
suppliers to include this issue in 2013 we ensure the necessary transparency in our supply chain through
appropriate systems and processes which we constantly adapt and expand our policy on conflict minerals can

strict management and the orderly documentation and monitoring of processes equipment methods and
procedures together with appropriate training programs are essential to implementing osrams commitment to
providing a safe healthy working environment for all employees and to minimizing the risk of accidents at work or
of employment related illnesses all osram employees have an obligation and responsibility to be mindful of
safety at all times wherever they are in order to monitor ongoing compliance with our occupational safety targets
we have introduced a management system that meets the requirements of the internationally recognized ohsas
18001 standard

risk assessment has to be carried out for all areas of operation by the responsible line managers supported by
trained safety representatives they assess the potential risks that may arise in each activity and propose
countermeasures to reduce them the measures are systematically announced and implemented and regularly
monitored in addition we have established occupational health and safety committees at all relevant sites in
accordance with local legal requirements or on a voluntary basis

additionally to the health and safety of our employees diversity is an important factor for osram for us diversity
is creating the opportunity for employees from different cultures and with different backgrounds religions
genders in addition we are convinced that diversity is a prerequisite for generating competitive advantage in a
competitive global environment we use and offer a range of channels to ensure that the benefits brought by this
diversity are developed in a sustainable manner for example different employee groups can exchange
information and ideas in various groupwide networks in fiscal 2015 we invited undergraduate and postgraduate
students to light spectrum an event providing information on new technical developments and attractive career
opportunities at workshops in munich shenzhen and hillsboro

competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is intense
the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees required for
the operation transition and expansion of our business could limit our ability to conduct research successfully
and to develop and sell marketable products competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the
areas of rd engineering and the project business qualified led sales people we could also lose senior
managers who are important to our business and for the structural changes required we see challenges in
retaining key employees in asia and the usa in particular
succession planning identifying and developing talent and dedicated employee development programs are
therefore a global focus among other things we have a concept for developing talent and our open mentoring
program we have also expanded our social media presence and are using these channels to recruit new
employees in order to sustainably secure our position as an attractive employer failure to implement these
measures may have a clear adverse effect on our business and on our net assets financial position and results
of operations

highly qualified specialists and managers are crucial to osrams success among other things we use 360
degree feedback to develop these employees we also aim to foster a sense of loyalty to osram and do so by
conducting global employee surveys for example based on the results specific action plans and measures have
been or are being developed to shape and take forward the change process within the company we want the
surveys to tell us how successful we have been so far at the same time it is important for us to identify subjects
and areas where we still need to make adjustments or improvements this feedback helps us to manage the
current change process sustainably and in a focused manner our corporate human resources department
analyzes the results and keeps close track of the progress made in implementing the measures if this opportunity
materializes it may have a positive impact on our business activities as well as on our net assets financial position
and results of operations

comparison to previous years the numbers of occupational accidents are relatively constant within osram gmbh
with less than eight accidents per 1000 employees in 2015 we are way below the industry average not only can
this be explained by the intensive training that has been conducted by superiors and health and safety officers
but also by an increasing awareness of the importance of safety throughout the workforce improved machine
safety already during the planning and construction phase of machines also helped to decrease incidents over
the last years
accidents like stumbling falling or tripping as well as commuting accidents accidents related to transportation on
