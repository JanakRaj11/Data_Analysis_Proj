the companies who supply us with our packaging materials and the communities surrounding
our factories these people rely on our business for their wellbeing and likewise we rely on
them so its crucial that we work together towards longterm and shared rewards

our products
the greatest source of our footprint comes from the ingredients we use to make
our products so its critical that we are continuously exploring the impact these
ingredients have on the environment and creating products with environmental
considerations in mind

in 2011 we completed an indepth carbon analysis of our top five raw ingredients
                                                                                                                    40

       improving mint farming and processing
       most wrigley gum contains mint oil which is derived from raw mint in fact
       we use mint in more than 80 percent of our gum formulas including fruit
       flavored gum as such a significant buyer its our responsibility to improve
       the environmental aspects of its production and work to sustain a healthy
       industry for the benefit of growers and surrounding communities

       as a founding member of the mint industry research council mirc we
       have worked together to help mint farmers reduce their environmental
       impacts through continued soil conservation reduced water use energy
       management and fertilization methods since 2007 these efforts have
