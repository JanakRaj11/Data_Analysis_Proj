 looking back on deutsche telekoms cr reporting

 since 2003 deutsche telekom has been reporting on its sustainability activities from 2003 up to and including
 2006 the group published a combined hr and sustainability report every year which enabled us to satisfy our
 stakeholders increased need for information on economic ecological and social issues an interim report issued
 in 2007 formed the transition to our current cr reporting since 2008 the telekom group has been publishing a
 comprehensive cr report each year


 online reporting since 2010

 just like last year we are publishing the current cr report exclusively online to better meet the requirements
 and user preferences of our stakeholders the online cr report 2011 has been available since may 29 2012 in
 german and english service functions such as the download section search and dialog functions as well as

kpi views facilitate individual use a recent addition has been the element find out more here a dropdown
menu can be used to call up background information on many topics that go beyond the presentation of the
current developments

together with this online report we are also publishing an epaper with a summary of the key developments in
the reporting period the subsidiaries can add a summary of their respective cr activities and then use the
report for their own cr communication not issuing a printed version means that we are saving resources

the next cr report will be published in q2 of 2013


selection of the main topics for the cr report 2011

to select the main report topics we conducted a multiplephase materiality process in q4 of 2011 this is an
integral part of our annual cr reporting the process is a tool to help identify the topics with maximum relevance
for our internal and external stakeholders


structure of the current online report

the online cr report 2011 has been designed as a progress report that focuses on the key developments of
the reporting period using the vertical navigation bar the reader can access the six main sections of the report

   networks
   customers
   society
   employees
   suppliers
   climate and environment

in contrast to the previous year the cr report 2011 includes a separate section on networks which covers the
topics of network and infrastructure expansion mobile communications and health as well as environmentally
friendly network infrastructure in the previous year these topics were dealt with in different sections by bundling
these topics in a separate section of the report we are doing justice to the increased importance of the topics
identified in the materiality analysis

each introductory page shows three materiality matrices referring to our three cr categories the topics that are
relevant for the respective section are highlighted in color the graphic depiction font size and position within
the matrix reflects the relevance of the respective topic as assessed by our stakeholders


the six sections mentioned above are supplemented by three others

   the strategy  management section describes the management of cr processes and the groupwide
    integration of telekoms cr strategy
   the majority of the subsidiaries whose cr activities are described in this report are presented on profile
    pages these pages can be found under the national companies menu item
   in the facts  figures section consolidated and commented indicators provide information about our progress
    in the past few years


assurance engagement

usa and tmobile netherlands were audited by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers pwc as part of an
assurance engagement

also applies to the gri telecommunications sector supplement in the 2003 pilot version that is applicable to
companies in the telecommunication industry compliance with both catalogs of requirements was reviewed by
the gri which awarded the highest application level a

this cr report also serves as a cop      communication on progress from telekom as part of the united
nations global compact  the global compact communication on progress provides an overview of the
specific measures required to implement the global compact       principle




new cr app we care

in addition to the online cr report by telekom we developed the cr app we care for the smartphone
operating systems google android      and apple ios     and for tablets during the reporting period  with an
interactive presentation of our cr commitment the app      provides an introduction to this complex topic  in a
simple and entertaining yet also selfcritical way the app includes handy links to the cr report with this
innovative addition we intend to raise awareness among a broad target audience for the topic of corporate
responsibility

 employees paint for climate protection

 telekom are doing to protect the climate and the environment the aim of the campaign was to actively involve
 employees in reporting and raise awareness of climate and environmental issues in total 55 works of art were

dear readers

many decisions in the worlds of politics and business have to be made quickly and they are aimed at the near
future but we should never lose sight of longrange challengessuch as the transition to renewable sources of
energy as approved by the german government we still have a long way to go before we meet this goal not all of
the requirements for a successful turnaround are in placefar from it in fact although many german companies
are ready with good solutions

deutsche telekom offers an intelligent control system for advanced electrical grids it connects consumers and
producers so that electricity producers can deliver power exactly when and where it is needed smart electricity
meters help link together large numbers of decentralized energy producers to create a central virtual power plant
this means it is economically viable for electricity producers to shift to decentralized production and renewable
energy sources

we also need to tackle challenges in society lets take demographic change as an example major firms like
deutsche telekom need to have the right mix of employees proven colleagues with experience and younger
workers who move freely and comfortably in the digital world but to us as a business demographic change also
means developing new products and solutions for the healthcare segment and getting them ready for the market
we are ramping up our commitment to helping patients live independently as long as possiblethanks in part to
innovative new telekom products

the way we live and work is undergoing huge changes due to increasing networking for companies mobile
working can increase costeffectiveness even as employees enjoy enhanced quality of life in view of this
increasing networking however we want to make sure that as many people as possible benefit from it for that
reason we will continue to promote media skills the use of filters to protect children and young people surfing on

the internet and internet seminars for seniors and immigrants

ever since the global compact      was founded in 2000 we have championed the principles laid out in this united
nations initiative in areas including human rights climate protection and combating corruption since january
2011 we have been the only german company active in the lead steering committee of the un global compact
 

our cr report provides information on the progress of our corporate commitment and involvement our new
application we care also provides a good overview of our corporate responsibility activities in a very playful
intuitive way the application showcases the full breadth of our commitment and involvement

we hope you enjoy reading it

bonn may 2012

sincerely

rené obermann

      segment fell by 44 percent to eur 240 billion
     europe the europe operational segment covers the fixednetwork and mobile operations of the subsidiaries

      international carrier sales  solutions unit which mainly provides wholesale telecommunications services for
      the groups other operating segments is also part of the europe segment intense competition continuously
      falling retail prices and strong government and regulatory impact had a negative effect on business in the
      countries of the europe segment and put pressure on total revenue there was a slight increase in revenue
      from the fixednetwork business and especially the broadbandtv area in addition strong mobile data
      revenue growth had a positive impact

      challenging market situation including impacts from the formerly proposed deal with att and increased
      competitive intensity total revenues declined by only 33 percent the decrease in revenue caused by the

above all with the broadband rollout and invested in expanding the capacities of existing networks and in faster
mobile networks

adjusted ebitda

 to the prior year ebitda was impacted by negative exchange rate effects as well as the nonrecurrence of the
 contribution of tmobile uk which had been deconsolidated in the prior year our performance corresponded to
 our guidance published at the beginning of the year

 with a volume of almost eur 2 billion around 11 percent of the goods and services that we procure via direct

 in germany telekom has agreed most of the conditions of employment for its employees with its employee
 representatives on the basis of collective bargaining there are exceptions for senior executives and a few small
 companies not covered by collective agreements internationally telekom aligns itself to the participatory culture
 of the relevant country this means there is a diverse landscape of collective bargaining agreements in the
 various international group companies the responsibility for the negotiating and signing collective agreements
 lies with the management of the relevant national company

 agreements in 2011 this is a share of 66 percent

la5 minimum notice periods regarding operational changes

human resources report p 61 p 32 f


in the case of significant operational changes the relevant works councils are informed and involved according
to the legally applicable provisions such as the german works constitution act
in addition there is a regular exchange with the employee representatives both on the national and international
level we established a global employee relations management erm unit at group level in 2010 it provides
guidance and promotes an exchange of experiences for building the diverse employee relationships in various
countries it is also a central contact for all international employee and employer committees and the labor
unions

 annual report 2011  risk and opportunities management

telekom employs an integrated risk and opportunity management system to systematically leverage its
opportunities without losing sight of the related risks this system not only considers legal and financial aspects
but also social and environmental risks
as part of its risk management telekom aims to allay concerns in the general public by means of an objective
scientifically sound and transparent information policy both at the beginning and at the end of a business
initiative
telekom is the only company in the world for example that has an international policy on electromagnetic fields
emf for its mobile communications segment which sets out minimum standards for information campaigns
transparency participation and the promotion of research


so2 corruption risks

the systematic prevention of whitecollar crime is a top priority at telekom compliance with legislation in this
area is a requirement that applies to the entire group in all countries and to every member of staff any
emerging fraud risks are systematically analyzed and any cases are documented
we conducted compliance risk assessments with a special view to corruption risks for 97 of 238 fully
consolidated companies during the reporting period this corresponds to a rate of 4076 percent it should be
noted that this rate is based on the number of all companies however many of the companies that were not
assessed are not operational or are very small companies so that the rate based on revenue or the number of
employees is much higher


so3 anticorruption training

the compliance department kicked off 2008 with an extensive anticorruption campaign which was also rolled
out internationally in 2009


the target groups include all members of the group board of management and their direct reports upper
management levels in all group companies and departments and functional units selected on the basis of risk
exposure
the training covers laws and regulations applicable in the individual countries in some countries we have
already trained trainers who can handle the transfer of knowledge within the group companies


data collection has not yet been implemented groupwide so that the percentage of employees trained in
anticorruption policies and processes cannot be stated for the time being


so4 actions taken in response to incidents of corruption

strategy and management


in order to be able to intervene quickly when corruption is suspected we have set up contacts in all
organizational units and publicize these in a suitable manner
potential breaches of internal guidelines laws or codes of conduct can be reported via the entry portal tell me
all stakeholder groups  employees business partners customers shareholders and other stakeholders  can
approach us via this portal anonymously if preferred


so5 lobbying

 party with donations

 our commitment to protecting our consumers is based on our code of conduct which was adopted in 2007 it

 standards for advertising are devised at the national level in particular by means of selfregulation by the
 advertising industry and therefore vary greatly from country to country telekom complies fully with all the legal
 and selfregulatory rules in the telecommunications industry in all company units this concerns in particular the
 protection of children and young people and compliance with data protection telekom and its international
 subsidiaries have made major contributions to the development of two global voluntary commitments by the
 industry a the gsma code of conduct against mobile spam of 2006 and b the gsma mobile advertising

key findings and conclusions


findings with regard to the aa1000       accountability principle of inclusivity

   at group level stakeholder management is managed by the central function stakeholder           engagement 
    stakeholder    dialog which is part of the corporate responsibility department the stakeholder      involvement
    strategy project was set up in this area with the aim of designing focused relationships with the companys
    stakeholders and of systematically implementing a stakeholder management system and stakeholder involvement
    groupwide
   the principles of stakeholder involvement at deutsche telekom ag have been defined in accordance with the aa

    1000      accountability principles
   it was found that deutsche telekom has established processes that facilitate the exchange with stakeholders and
    support the involvement of stakeholders in decisionmaking processes at the level of selected departments
    stakeholders are actively involved in projects
   internationally the involvement of stakeholders is organized at international subsidiary level this takes place in
    coordination with the central functions at group level it was found that stakeholders are regularly involved eg
    through stakeholder dialog days at the level of selected subsidiaries as of the time of the audit the international
    rollout of the stakeholder involvement strategy had not been completed but began while the audit was ongoing

findings with regard to the aa1000         accountability principle of materiality

   as part of the materiality process key cr topics are systematically identified with the input of internal and external
    stakeholders and shown in the materiality matrices within deutsche telekom ags cr report within the
    materiality process issues relating to deutsche telekom ags three cr categories were evaluated the three cr
    categories are key pillars of the cr strategy with direct relevance to deutsche telekoms core business
   as part of central stakeholder involvement the expectations of individual stakeholder groups are determined in a
    targeted way evaluated and can then be taken into account in cr reporting further cr communication and the
    strategic alignment of the cr department
   internationalizing the materiality process was the first step in standardizing the identification of key cr issues in
    the different international subsidiaries

findings with regard to the aa1000         accountability principle of responsiveness

   our random sample inquiries and the evidence we have acquired show that the processes for responding to
    stakeholder queries are running correctly
   it was found that with the principles of the gri global reporting initiative suitable guidelines on cr reporting
    are used
   communication with stakeholder groups uses a number of communication channels and has a balance of topics

based on our moderate assurance engagement nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that in
all material respects the systems and processes established by the company are unsuitable for fulfilling the aa
1000        accountability principles of inclusivity materiality and responsiveness

furthermore nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that in all material respects the
disclosures and pages of the cr report for calendar year 2010 marked with the symbol               have not been prepared
in accordance with the criteria of the sustainability reporting guidelines vol 31 pp 7 to 17 of the gri

additional informationrecommendations

without qualifying the conclusions of our engagement set out above we make the following recommendations for
the further development of sustainability management and cr reporting

   further development of stakeholder management in particular
        continuation of the international rollout of the stakeholder involvement strategy at international level which
         began at the start of 2012
        formalization of the processes for responding to stakeholder queries and greater standardization of the
         processes for responding and documentation at international level
        continuation of the international standardization of processes for identifying key stakeholders and issues for
         international subsidiaries which have their own materiality process
   expansion of the groupwide management function for sustainability eg
        there should be increased standardization and documentation of processes for recording and determining data

values  guiding principles
deutsche telekom is continually working on establishing a valueoriented corporate culture
throughout the group that is characterized by responsible and sustainable behavior our
guiding principles and the code of conduct based on them form the foundation of our
corporate activitiesboth in our cooperation with external stakeholders as well as within the
company itself

 guiding principles for the entire group

 our corporate culture is based on the guiding principles that were introduced groupwide
 in january 2009 these principles represent our values and convictions and guide our
 actions

 tekekoms five guiding principles

    customer delight drives our action
    respect and integrity guide our behavior
    team together  team apart
    best place to perform and grow
    i am t  count on me

 we implemented the guiding principles throughout the entire group in 2010 they are
 available in 19 languages and apply in 34 countries and 50 international subsidiaries

 we regularly conduct brief groupwide pulse surveys on our employees satisfaction and
 their understanding of the group strategy november 2011 marked the third time that we
 asked employees about their experience when implementing the guiding principles in
 their daily work some 63 percent of employees answered that they not only know and
 understand the guiding principles but also implement them in their everyday work
 activities


 guiding principles day to promote corporate values

 in order to fill the guiding principles with life in everyday work a groupwide guiding
 principles day is held every year all employees are encouraged to share their views on
 the guiding principles and how to implement them in their daily work

 on september 28 2011 numerous activities took place to this end including games
 competitions messages to employees and team breakfasts subsequently a slide show
 was posted on the intranet to present the activities that took place throughout the group
 here are just a few examples of the wide range of activities

    rené obermann and his team discussed the impact of the guiding principles on the

    work at group headquarters
   executives in the czech republic organized a breakfast on guiding principles day and
    used the opportunity for the team to share information and experience
   romanian employees who do not typically come into contact with customers in their
    everyday activities spent guiding principles day at stores or call centers as a way to
    strengthen the service culture
   customer service employees in brühl germany sold fortune cookies containing the
    guiding principles proceeds went to the bild hilft ev ein herz für kinder charity
    organization
   austrian employees had a caricaturist do a sketch of the guiding principles and could
    pick out their guiding principle
   employees from tmobile in seattle usa were greeted with a rap version of the
    guiding principles and other activities in honor of values day
   employees in frankfurt developed a guiding principles digit game and held a
    workshop on how to fill the guiding principles with life

cr report from the previous year


groupwide implementation of the code of conduct

our code of conduct puts the five guiding principles into more specific terms and has
served as a reference for clear rules of conduct for our daily work since 2006 the code
of conduct applies to all telekom employees worldwide it connects compliance with laws
and regulations with our requirements for ethical behavior and the guiding principles
due to the increased aspiration of society for compliant and legally unimpeachable
behavior and the launch of the guiding principles at the beginning of 2009 we revised
our code of conduct in 2010

code of conduct

in june 2011 we successfully completed the implementation of the revised code of
conduct in germany for this purpose a multimedia training package was given to

 managers whereas the online interactive code of conduct tool was made available to
 support the telekom employees in germany the tool was used 35000 times in the first
 month after its introduction in germany in may 2011 international implementation was
 successfully completed by the end of december 2011 and considered local legal and
 data protection requirements

cr strategy
deutsche telekom aims to position itself as a global leader for connected life and work at
the same time we are striving to become an international leader in our industry when it
comes to assuming social and ecological responsibility we are expecting to achieve this
goal by 2015

we have entrenched our commitment to sustainable corporate governance in our
groupwide cr strategy the cr strategy has been derived from the group strategy and
also provides a framework for international subsidiaries when it comes to implementing cr
in their areas of responsibility in order to monitor and drive strategy implementation and our
progress toward international leadership we regularly measure our cr performance using
cr key performance indicators

 leading the way project defines criteria for success

 with our project leading the way we are aiming to strengthen and expand our role as a
 cr pioneer our first step was to develop a criteria catalog in order to determine our
 position within the international ict sector we verified our position based on this catalog
 in 2011 accordingly some of the targets and measures had to be modified or
 supplemented by the end of 2011 we had adapted the catalog of criteria to enable us to
 achieve our strategic goals


 the central cr department launched the leading the way project to help us pursue our
 objective of becoming a cr leader more systematically and monitor our progress in this
 area
 we developed a catalog of criteria by conducting extensive competitor and trend
 analyses as well as an internal analysis in which the integration status of cr into key
 business processes was measured

 this catalog covers the entire range of corporate responsibility topics and focuses on
 industryspecific challenges the criteria catalog is in line with existing corporate goals
 and the cr strategy it significantly contributes to permanently entrenching cr in our
 core business and establishing the sustainability principles throughout the entire group

 we derived concrete action packages on the basis of these progress criteria we will
 monitor each recommended measure until 2015 we will also review the existing cr kpis
 by 2015 based on the results of the leading the way project

cr key performance indicators
in order to steer its cr performance telekom uses seven key performance indicators cr
key performance indicators or cr kpis that apply throughout the group these help us to
systematically and transparently optimize our services on an ongoing basis

the cr kpis are divided into two categories

   kpis with targets standardized groupwide and
   kpis with specific targets per international subsidiary

    cr kpis mandatory as of 2012

    since january 1 2012 all international subsidiaries are obliged to determine their cr
    kpis the indicators that were still voluntary in the previous year are now of a
    mandatory nature

    for the first time we also included selected cr kpis in the annual report 2011 the
    energy consumption cr kpi and the co2 emissions cr kpi were included in the report
    as kpis for telekoms ecological performance this is the first step on the way to a closer
    link between the annual report and the cr report which shows that sustainability is a
    fixed element of deutsche telekoms core business


    cr kpis with groupwide targets

    we collect consolidated data for the entire group for the following three cr kpis

       the socially responsible investment sri cr kpi is used to measure our progress in
        the area of sustainable investment this kpi indicates the share of deutsche telekom
        ag stock that is owned by investors who show concern for environmental social and
        governance criteria in their investment strategies
       the employee satisfaction cr kpi determines our employees satisfaction it is based
        on the employee survey which we conduct every two years for each individual
        company
       the sustainable procurement cr kpi measures the share of our overall procurement
        volume that we receive from suppliers who have been assessed for risk through audits
        andor by using etasc

    we are planning to measure the sustainability of our product portfolio based on the
    sustainable products cr kpi in the future the indicator should also become mandatory
    for all international subsidiaries


    cr kpis with countryspecific targets

 four of the seven cr kpis are based on individual regional targets the targets take into
 account the regional situation as well as specific developments at the respective
 international subsidiaries

    based on the co2 emissions cr kpi we determine the co2 reduction achieved
     compared to the reference year 2008 we aim to achieve a reduction of co2 emissions
     by up to 40 percent compared to 1995 values
    the energy consumption cr kpi with which we measure our electricity usage is
     based on the monetary power efficiency indicator mpei it shows the amount of
     electricity consumed compared to net revenue
    we use the social commitment cr kpi to measure the perception of telekoms cr
     activities in the public arena as an indicator of our social commitment
    the used cell phone collection cr kpi compares the collected used cell phones
     measured in numbers of items or the equivalent value in kilograms to the number of a
     subsidiarys customers

home  employees  competitive workforce  internationalization



internationalization
under one company deutsche telekom is increasingly fusing into a global corporation just like other international
groups deutsche telekom is also required to define uniform standards for their global hr policy without ignoring
local characteristics

 global employee relations managementtaking a multifaceted approach
 to employee relations

 the global employee relations management unit offers guidance and encourages the exchange of experiences
 on structuring employee relations in different countries at the employee relations in a connected world
 conference in early may 2011 70 leading executives from international businesses discussed the challenges
 presented by employee relations this formed the basis for deutsche telekoms ongoing consultation with other
 employers to formulate forwardlooking employee relations moreover in a globally applicable employee
 relations policy the group commits itself to a high level of uniform minimum standards worldwide in dealing with
 its employees taking account of different cultures laws and needs a monitoring system will be used to
 guarantee policy compliance as soon as the policy has been rolled out throughout the group our policy is
 based on our guiding principles as well as on national regulations and internationally recognized rules such as
 the united nations global compact  the oecd guidelines and the core labor standards issued by the
 international labour organization ilo


 social charter complying with minimum standards

 we passed our social charter in 2003 the charter is also based on the principles of the global compact 
 oecd and ilo the social charter              contains policies on human rights and working conditions the ban on child
 labor environmental protection equal opportunity occupational health and safety and the right to set up or join a
 trade union these policies apply throughout the group our suppliers are obligated to comply with these
 policies as well


 cooperation with employee representatives on both a german and
 international level

 again in 2011 we successfully continued to pursue intensive dialog with the bodies representing employees
 within the group in germany the implementation of numerous measures and projects would not have been
 possible without the participation of elected employee representatives this is where we are seeing the fruits of
 our commitment to cooperation based on trust as outlined in the group policy on employee relations a key
 role falls to the group works council our contact point for all codetermination issues within the group in
 germany in the european works council ewc too deutsche telekom nurtures an active relationship with
 the employee representatives of our european subsidiaries and affiliated companies

strategic management and operational implementation throughout the group by
incorporating cr into the ceos department telekom has made sure that sustainability
issues become an integral part of all of telekoms business activities

crgovernance




 cr board groupwide management of the cr strategy

 the cr board develops recommendations for the board of management regarding the
 implementation and future focus of the cr strategy targets and key performance
 indicators cr kpis for the groupwide cr program are also discussed during the
 boards meetings

 the cr board generally meets three times a year to discuss the latest developments at
 the group in society at large and in the markets in which telekom is active additional
 meetings are called as needed in 2011 the cr board debated the following topics

    in march the board dealt with the climate protection strategy sustainable procurement
     and our appearance on the website of the sustainability portal utopia
    in september the perspectives of integrated esg     and financial reporting the
     sustainability drive and our health safety and environmental management were on the
     agenda
    in december the board discussed the topics of stakeholder dialog day in china
     socially responsible investments and the program of the telekom foundation for 2012


 the cr board is comprised of the heads of those corporate areas that play a key role in
 steering and implementing cr throughout the group

   corporate communications
   human resources
   procurement
   public and regulatory affairs
   brand management
   chairmans office
   technology
   deutsche telekom foundation
   europe board department
   corporate responsibility

the broadbased organizational positioning ensures that the cr strategy is in line with
the group and brand strategy as well as with the corporate values


the cr department as a central interface

the central cr department is responsible for strategic cr management and cr
communication it coordinates and manages the implementation of the cr strategy in
daytoday business operations throughout all business areas and international
subsidiaries at group level the cr department acts as an interface in collaboration with
all relevant departments it plans and implements projects in the areas of climate and
environment sustainable products and services supply chain management social
commitment as well as stakeholder involvement


development of groupwide cr controlling

in order to support the management of the cr department in relevant decisionmaking
processes we are developing groupwide cr controlling cr controlling can be used for
early identification and management of opportunities and risks regarding the companys
reputation costs and revenue

the controlling unit will be established on the basis of the strategic cr kpis defined by
us and the associated parameters we determined specific target values for several cr
kpis during the reporting period thereby creating the basis for central cr controlling

in order to collect cr data and to be able to calculate the cr kpis based on this data we
introduced the cr database in 2009 as the database is the foundation for reporting and
for groupwide cr management we are continually upgrading it to this end we hold
regular feedback rounds and are making management aware of the necessity of
collecting data for example at the meeting of the cr manager network in bratislava in
october 2011


webbased software for data collection enables a transparent cr reporting process
throughout the group the database ensures standardized mandatory processes at the
group and subsidiary levels all crrelevant data and cr kpis are validated in a
multiplephase process and consolidated centrally this gives us a better understanding
of the quantitative developments of strategic and operational cr topics and makes it
easier to monitor deviations from set targets the software also enables groupinternal

 benchmarks


 international cr manager network

 networking is a central strategic topic at telekom and also a key issue within our cr
 organization the international cr manager network plays an important role in this
 regard


 climate change group

 telekom founded the climate change group in order to contribute to an environmentally
 friendly society the group is comprised of internal energy and climate experts and
 consults with external specialists as the occasion demands its task is to effectively
 reduce the groups energy consumption and co2 emissions

 over the course of the reporting period the climate change group focused on taking the
 climate protection strategy to an international level and developing the associated
 countryspecific targets it supported both the international subsidiaries as well as
 tsystems local business units in recording their greenhouse gas emissions and
 adopting measures for reducing these emissions

stakeholder involvement
the targeted involvement of our stakeholders helps us build longterm trustbased
relationships and increase understanding for our concerns and activities last but not least
dialog with our stakeholders is also a source of inspiration for innovation processes and a
basis for new cooperations or strategic partnerships this is especially important in regard to
our sustainability goals which we will only be able to achieve together with partners from
politics society science and industry

 development of stakeholder involvement strategy

 in order to systematically manage stakeholder involvement throughout the group and live
 up to our aspiration to lead the way in cr we developed a stakeholder involvement
 strategy in 2011 this strategy demonstrates that we take our stakeholders concerns
 seriously and get them involved based on highquality standards the strategy is based
 on the three aa1000 principles of materiality inclusivity and responsiveness developed
 by ngo accountability

 we organized the development of our stakeholder involvement strategy as a participatory
 process interviews with 17 external stakeholders were conducted during which we
 asked both about our stakeholders experiences with telekom and the expectations they
 have in regard to optimal cooperation the goal was to consider both aspects in the early
 stages of strategy development in order to obtain a comprehensive view of our
 stakeholders interests we also surveyed telekom employees conducting more than 20
 interviews with employees who will be implementing the strategy in the group


 threepillar model of the stakeholder involvement strategy

 the views and expectations voiced by our internal and external stakeholders had a
 considerable influence on the design of the strategy as a result the strategy adopted by
 deutsche telekom in december 2011 is based on the following three pillars

 1 our strategic profile the strategic profile designates relevant stakeholder groups
 and defines how the group wants to fashion its relationship to these stakeholders in
 addition to providing information and engaging in dialog we are increasingly focused on
 participatory formats which customers employees ngos and other stakeholders can
 use to get involved and make contributions to this end we are offering options to
 participate in discussing topics and finding solutions in the different categories of our cr
 strategy

 2 internal skills development and service we are developing an infrastructure that
 will help our employees implement the strategy in practice internal networking meetings
 help to exchange experiences in dealing with stakeholders to discuss practical examples
 and to plan and implement joint activities in addition we plan to develop a guideline in

 2012 that will give employees guidance when implementing stakeholder formats

 3 development of a stakeholder management system we are creating transparency
 in all corporate processes relevant to stakeholder relationships in this vein we are
 documenting our stakeholder activities and monitoring the development of relevant
 stakeholder topics in addition in 2011 we employed our materiality process to test a
 system for handling our stakeholders feedback and will gradually integrate it into the
 evaluation process


 aa1000 as a guidance

 we looked to the aa1000         standard as a reference when developing our strategy this
 is an internationally recognized body of rules and regulations for auditing sustainability
 management and cr reporting at the end of 2011 accounting firm
 pricewaterhousecoopers pwc issued a moderate assurance report which confirms that
 deutsche telekom heeds the aa1000             account ability principles in its cr processes
 and systems type 1 audit the assurance engagement also took into account the
 stakeholder involvement strategy the present report was also the subject of a moderate
 assurance engagement by pwc based on the aa1000                   principles this means that we
 achieved our target of a type 2 audit in 2012

stakeholder expectations
precise knowledge of our stakeholders interests and views is a basic prerequisite for an
informed design of stakeholder relationships this concerns the topics that our stakeholders
consider important on the one hand and their expectations of successful communication
with us on the other hand




 cr commitment recognized by experts and the general public

 to be able to focus our cr activities properly it is important to determine how these are
 perceived and assessed by our stakeholders to this end we conduct regular
 measurements we commissioned tns infratest to carry out a representative random
 sampling of the population and around 300 cr experts in august 2011 in november
 2011 the survey of the general population was repeated

 telekom was able to slightly increase its rating in the perception of its cr commitment
 compared to 2010 it received the highest ratings from the general public among the ict
 companies surveyed telekom also improved in the corporate responsibility and social
 commitment aspects telekoms commitment is clearly rated higher by cr experts than
 by the general population

in an aided recall survey the experts listed the promotion of women the deutsche
telekom foundation or telekomschool for example the subsequent second survey of
the general population confirmed the increasing popularity of the yes i can initiative
the cooperation with the nummer gegen kummer youth counseling line as well as the cell
phone collection program

the 2011 results provided us with an important starting point for establishing the content
for our cr activities and for enhancing our cr communication in addition the data were
used to update the social commitment and corporate responsibility leadership
indicators whose values increased considerably over the course of 2011 the first also
forms the basis for our social commitment cr kpi details on the cr kpis can be found
in the strategy and management section


the topics of our stakeholders

in order to find out which topics are important to our stakeholders we surveyed our
internal and external stakeholders for the fifth time in february 2012 the survey revealed
parallels as well as some differences between the two stakeholder groups in the three
cr categories the relevance ratings of telekom employees and external stakeholders
did not differ greatly same as in 2011 however there are topics that are ranked as more
important by external stakeholders than by internal stakeholders these include mobile
communications and health active participation in shaping social change in a digitalized
world corporate volunteering barrierfree products and services and smart logistics
overall internal and external assessments differ most for the topic of active participation
in shaping social change in a digitalized world telekom employees rate topics that affect
them directly such as worklife balance and responsible employer higher than external
stakeholders for further details please refer to the following matrices




deutsche telekom has committed itself to pay particular attention to those topics that
received the most votes the highestranking concerns were included in our cr roadmap
it is with the roadmap that we monitorbased on monthly reportsto what extent we
have achieved our cr objectives we will keep you updated on the success of these
measures on the intranet as well as on the group website


social concerns of our stakeholders

along with the topics related to our cr categories the participants of our stakeholder
survey were asked to rate all the concerns that had been submitted to telekom by

stakeholders in 2011 these ranged from setting up co2 accounts for employees to
improving customer information to clearer explanation of our initiatives

employees and external stakeholders largely agreed on the following five most important
topics

   setting up specific incentive systems to advance sustainable corporate governance for
    management
   embedding sustainability more strongly in corporate processes for example in product
    marketing and design
   more understandable presentation of our sustainability activities and avoidance of
    anglicisms
   avoidance of plane trips through increased use of phone web and video conferences
    throughout the group
   increased promotion of employee commitment in the community

we also received numerous valuable suggestions and comments to our open questions
on the survey which we integrated into the analysis of stakeholder topics and which we
will take into account in our further strategy development


stakeholder expectations regarding dialog with us

we need to know our stakeholders expectations regarding mutual communication to be
able to design our stakeholder relationships properly therefore we systematically asked
about the requirements for successful mutually satisfying communication during the
interviews that we conducted for our strategy development our main finding was that we
need to modify our stakeholder involvement approach to achieve the quality leadership
to which we aspire

the interviews confirmed that many companies are now initiating stakeholder dialog
however this seems to be sporadic in many cases and the results appear to have little
influence on corporate activities the stakeholders involved are increasingly wondering
whether this dialog really has an impact on corporate actions in addition it should be
defined as clearly as possible from the beginning what the dialog is intended to achieve
and the rules of the game should be binding our stakeholders also expect to be
informed about the implementation of the results

the expectations voiced in this respect had a considerable influence on the design of our
strategic profile the evaluation also showed that our involvement principles largely fulfill
our stakeholders expectations it has been confirmed that stakeholder involvement can
only be successful when dialog is on an equal footing that is why we replaced the term
stakeholder management which was still used up to last year and which does not
entirely define the true concept with the term stakeholder involvement


objectives and outlook for 2012

in 2012 we will expand topic monitoring on the basis of our stakeholder involvement
strategy we have developed new surveying tools for this for example we intend to
measure the impact of individual projects and measures with fast survey cycles

 in 2012 we plan to use our cr barometer which is based on these surveying tools with
 customers and employees we are also planning to introduce a new monitoring tool to
 collect and assess topics addressed by ngos thanks to the new tool we will have
 another systematic process for identifying stakeholder positions thereby fulfilling an
 important requirement of the aa1000 standard

formats of involvement
the type and extent of our stakeholder involvement is based on the results of a caserelated
relevance analysis the more relevant a stakeholder group is to the topic or project
concerned the more intense the stakeholder involvement will be depending on the intensity
we make a distinction between three types of involvement information dialog and
participation

green ict as a focus in 2011

we further developed our dialog approach as part of strategy development in 2011 this
includes yearly changing focal points for our various dialog formats in this reporting
period the focus was on the topic of green ict we debated this topic in a dialog event in
october and in a telegraph_lunch in december 2011


broadbased involvement memberships and collaborations

through our memberships with different organizations we get involved in discussion
processes and collaborate on international committees collaborations allow us to
approach topics on which we as an individual company would only have a limited impact

compliance
telekoms business is based on the principles of integrity and respect compliance which is
understood as the lawfulness of corporate activities therefore plays a significant role at our
company telekom is clearly committed to the ethical principles set out in the guiding
principles and in the code of conduct

all compliance management activities are in line with legal regulations and with telekoms
privacy code of conduct a policy on handling personal data at the deutsche telekom
group

download  privacy code of conduct

 compliance management certified

 the key elements of the compliance management system are as follows

    establishment of a compliance organization in all major group units
    riskbased derivation of a compliance program and its consistent implementation
     through policies training and consulting offers
    appropriate response to breaches of compliance

 the groups compliance organization was certified by independent auditors on december
 31 2010 in terms of adequate implementation of minimum requirements and
 implementation specifications defined by deutsche telekom recertification is planned by
 2013


 central responsibility for compliance organization

 responsibility for the compliance management system has top priority at telekom in line
 with the high relevance of the topic a separate board of management department for
 data privacy legal affairs and compliance was created in 2008


 groupwide structures have been making efficient compliance management possible
 since 2005 the compliance organization consists of the chief compliance officer the
 compliance committee and the central and local compliance units the compliance
 organization develops groupwide standards tools and processes to guarantee
 compliant conduct at the company

 compliance committee provides internal consulting
 the compliance committee consists of executives from the following areas

    compliance
    legal

   data privacy
   internal audit
   human resources

the purpose of the committee is to establish and monitor structures for a functional
compliance management system and to advise the board of management on all relevant
questions about compliance the chief compliance officer is the chairman of the
compliance committee

compliance officer plays key role in compliance management
the chief compliance officer reports to the group board of management member for
data privacy legal affairs and compliance he plays a key role in setting up the
compliance management system and maintaining its functionalities in the long term the
chief compliance officer informs the board of management and the audit           committee
of the deutsche telekom supervisory board about current compliance activities at the
group according to the german corporate governance code the audit             committee is
responsible for compliance issues the chief compliance officer has the right to contact
the audit     committee directly and can also be directly commissioned by it


international collaboration improved

the group board of management and the respective bodies of the affiliated companies
must ensure an appropriate compliance organization the group compliance
management gcm unit supports these bodies in this task the legal basis for this are
contracts between the telekom group and its direct subsidiaries the intra group
compliance agreements which define the rights and obligations of both parties

different legal practices and cultural values in the various countries where deutsche
telekom is active represent a significant compliance challenge in line with the groups
international structure strategic issues are discussed with an international compliance
advisory team and a shared vision is defined the international compliance advisory
team is a trendsetter of sorts as it provides incentives for designing and implementing
balanced compliance structures at the deutsche telekom group

we have been promoting groupwide cooperation for years with the international
compliance days an annual meeting of the representatives of all compliance
organizations of the international subsidiaries 115 representatives from 24 countries
followed the invitation by the central compliance department to come to bonn on
september 89 2011 this was the seventh meeting of this kind and this time the future
focus of compliance activities and possibilities to optimize international cooperation were
on the agenda the next international compliance days will take place in bonn in april
2012


compliance policies revised and implemented

the group policy on avoiding corruption and other conflicts of interest or
anticorruption policy and the group policy on the acceptance and granting of benefits
or benefits policy were revised during the reporting period

the anticorruption policy serves as an overarching policy and a link between the code

of conduct and the detailed rules of the more specific policies which regulate the
acceptance and granting of undue benefits sponsoring donations benefits extended in
the political sphere dealing with consultants the ban on insider trading and
anticompetitive agreements in addition it defines the organizational obligations and
measures to prevent corruption and other conflicts of interest the benefits policy
governs how to handle gifts entertainment and invitations to events in business
relationships

these policies are now becoming effective and mandatory throughout the group we first
obtained the resolutions of the executive bodies in the national group units and then
made the policies known to employees at the national level at the international level the
process will involve greater outlay because we must first check whether the policies
comply with relevant national laws the introduction is being accompanied by
communication and training campaigns


employee training for strengthening compliance

the group compliance management area conducted elearning sessions as well as
individual attendance courses for managers and employees on issues such as the code
of conduct general and riskspecific compliance topics and accepting and granting
benefits

additional webbased training courses on the principles of ethical business conduct will
be completed in 2012 for example in may 2012 we will start an anticorruption
elearning course where employees can learn about the anticorruption policy and
refresh their knowledge from earlier training courses this elearning course will
subsequently be adapted as necessary and introduced at the international subsidiaries

new elearning module raises awareness of antitrust risks
antitrust compliance requirements are on the rise in order to reduce the risks we are
making our employees aware of the possible consequences of noncompliance with
antitrust laws the plan is to provide a new elearning module on this topic for telekom
employees in germany in q2 2012 this will also be launched internationally in the
course of 2012

elearning module on compliance basics
we will launch an elearning module designed to raise awareness of compliance in april
2012 it will deal with the basics and requirements in the most important fields of
compliance and will introduce users to our guiding principles our code of conduct
applicable legal regulations as well as internal policies the training offer will be available
to all employees in germany and also internationally where necessary


internet portals for prevention and advice

ask me
in order to prevent compliance risks we set up the ask me portal in 2008 here
employees can ask compliancerelevant questions for example regarding the code of
conduct or laws and internal policies ask me offers reliable information that
employees can use in their daily work

tell me
we are dependent on the input of our employees business partners customers and
other stakeholders when it comes to investigating violations of internal policies laws or
codes of conduct tell me is a portal that is also accessible to external parties which
can be used to report misconduct via email phone and fax despite the fact that we
delisted from the new york stock exchange in 2010 we will continue to operate this
portaleven though we are no longer obligated by law to provide a public reporting
system


promoting compliance in customer contact

promotion of integrity and legally correct conduct in customer contact supports deutsche
telekoms goal of being perceived as the most highly regarded service company in the
industry that is why we initiated the customer contact compliance program for the
promotion of integrity in customer contact in 2010 the focus is needbased advice and
effective implementation of measures tailored to different distribution channels and
countries we initially started the program at telekom deutschland and then at magyar
telekom

after successful implementation in these two countries the initiative was rolled out at
other international subsidiaries in 2011 suitable action plans have been integrated into
deutsche telekoms annual compliance program sustainable implementation is
consistently monitored


investigations of suspected corruption

telekom employs a zero tolerance policy when it comes to corruption violations are
systematically investigated and prosecuted in order to create maximum transparency

review of contracts in the fyro macedonia and montenegro
the audit of the financial statements of magyar telekom for the 2005 financial year
identified contracts for which it was not possible at the time to fully ascertain an
appropriate business background the audit        committee of magyar telekom then
commissioned an independent law firm to investigate the lawfulness of these contracts
magyar telekom and deutsche telekom reached an agreement with the us securities
and exchange commission sec and the us department of justice doj in 2011 to
resolve investigations into alleged breaches of the us foreign corrupt practices act
fcpa additional information can be found in the 2011 annual report

review of irregularities in tsystems internationals sponsorship activities
an internal investigation that was triggered by an anonymous tip gave rise to the
suspicion that an arrangement violating compliance regulations had been made in the
context of the business relationship between tsystems international gmbh and a major
car manufacturer to reward sponsorship involvement by awarding future contracts for it
services due to this tsystems international gmbh immediately terminated employment
of its former cso the responsible sales manager and an external consultant and sent the
internal report to the prosecutors office responsible for further review on the basis of the
report the public prosecutor initiated a preliminary criminal investigation which resulted
in charges being brought to the regional court in stuttgart the regional court is now

ruling on opening the trial


major ongoing litigation

deutsche telekom is party to several proceedings both in and out of court with
government agencies competitors and other parties the proceedings mentioned in the
2011 annual report are of particular importance from deutsche telekoms point of view


respect for human rights as an ingrained practice

respecting human rights is a matter of course at telekom and is a principle that is
entrenched and practiced worldwide our code of conduct which applies groupwide
stipulates our requirements for ethical conduct the social charter      adopted in 2003
defines groupwide regulations regarding how to deal with employees and suppliers the
charter is based on the principles of the united nations global compact  the
conventions of the international labour organization ilo and the organization for
economic cooperation and development oecd we check compliance with the
charters regulations in an annual survey

beyond compliance with human rights we also heed labor rights in all of the markets
where we are active and in some cases even set higher standards minimum standards
for dealing with our employees are also defined by the telekom diversity policy whose
aim is to prevent discrimination based on gender age disabilities ethnic origin religious
beliefs and sexual orientation


employee relationships

as deutsche telekom is represented in over 50 countries of the world it is not possible to
name a generally applicable example of our high standards labor legislation is too
different in the individual countries nevertheless deutsche telekom offers its diverse
international staff worldwide a general framework and a global cultural structure with its
employee relations policy this means that the group is committed to minimum
standards applicable to employee relations worldwide and at the same time takes
account of national legislation different cultural backgrounds and needs the employee
relations policy defines the core elements of deutsche telekoms human resources
policy and describes what we stand for in our relationships to our employees around the
globe these relationships are characterized by our shared values and are derived from
our five guiding principles as well as from additional group policies the employee
relations policy also includes statements regarding hr development responsible
change management health and sustainability fair pay work and life balance leadership
diversity the ban on discrimination communication and relations with employee
representatives

one example is tmobile usa the international subsidiary complies with us labor law
without any exception including the policies and legally specified processes regarding the
right to set up and join a trade union these policies reflect the right to freedom of
association tmobile usa does not prevent any of its employees from setting up or
joining a union and does not discriminate against those who do to date however a

 large majority of staff at tmobile usa have chosen not to be represented by a union
 voting on union recognition has only taken place at two facilities in the north eastern
 united states each of which has less than 20 employees employees in connecticut
 decided in favor of union representation whereas employees at another facility in long
 island ny voted against it both voting processes were conducted in strict compliance
 with us law and results were confirmed by the national labor relations board

 in addition individual subsidiaries have introduced activities that go above and beyond
 local standards and legislation at tsystems south africa for example regular
 interchange takes place between management and employees although no labor union is
 represented at the company this is known as employee consensus seeking approach
 and helps take account of employee interests in the corporate decisionmaking process at
 an early stage

 in addition our health and safety management system is deployed in 17 countries and we
 have coordinated its introduction at a total of 30 international subsidiaries the next step
 will be to develop joint standards together with universities institutes employers liability
 insurance organizations and partner companies that go beyond current labor rights and
 will be effective for the entire telekom group worldwide

risk  opportunities management
telekoms corporate environment is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic
technological developments state regulation and intensifying competition require a
systematic anticipatory management approach to risks and opportunities

the groupwide risk and opportunities management system is a central strategic tool of
corporate management it helps us identify and evaluate negative effects and the potential of
current and future trends at an early stage and control their consequences

the annual report 2011 of deutsche telekom provides extensive information on current
opportunities and risks that are also relevant in terms of corporate responsibility

data privacy
millions of customers entrust telekom with their data in order to live up to this responsibility
careful handling of personal data has top priority for us we developed an extensive catalog
of measures and created a separate board of management department for data privacy
legal affairs and compliance to handle the topic at the highest management level of our
company we undergo regular audits conducted by an external data privacy advisory council
as well as independent certification procedures

we place great emphasis on transparency therefore we are the first dax 30 company to
publish an annual data privacy report which documents all of the groups processes in this
field in 2011 we published a joint report on data privacy and data security for the first time

download      the data privacy and data security report 2011

in addition at httpwwwtelekomcomdataprotection we report on all internal incidents
pertaining to data theft and data misuse that were reported to the public prosecutors office
present current measures for improving data privacy and provide information on how to
handle personal data properly

government relations  regulatory issues
as a globally active company with a strong presence in europe deutsche telekom acts as a
discussion partner for governments parliaments authorities and ngos on all issues related
to ict and innovation headquartered in germany we receive special attention from
german domestic institutions we also have a representative office in brussels where we
engage in dialog with the institutions of the european union as well as with other
associations and organizations we also engage in active dialog with similar institutions in
countries in which deutsche telekom is active particularly in the european markets and in
the united states

politicians and government authorities influence the development and availability of the
network infrastructure technologies and services that are required for future ict solutions
such as cloud computing not only does this directly impact the competitiveness of
telecommunications companies it also impacts business in general which relies on having a
fast network infrastructure as well as stateoftheart telecommunications services in
addition to economic factors networks and services are considerably important for
maintaining a sense of community in society decisionmakers from parliaments authorities
and governments need the exchange of ideas with representatives of society and companies
to help them tackle these challenges both the bundestag the lower house of the german
parliament and the german federal government sought dialog on the revision of the german
telecommunications act during the reporting period that is why deutsche telekom
engages in active constant dialog with interested stakeholders from politics and the general
public

our partners from parliaments governments and other organizations need to uphold their
independence and integrity this principle is codified in telekoms employee guidelines
which were revised in early 2011 for example they prohibit donations to political institutions
in germany as well as nontransparent influential practices by adhering to these guidelines
we are able to base our political communication on facts expertise credibility and integrity
deutsche telekom also ensures transparency by having registered in the public lobbyist
register in brussels with all the required information this is the basis for recipients to
experience our political communication as authentic and trustworthy so that it can be taken
into account in opinionbuilding processes in the political arena and society

 more investmentfriendly broadband network regulation needed

 deutsche telekom advocates futureminded regulation which encourages investment in
 broadband networks of the next generation more strongly this can only be achieved by
 introducing more investment incentives and increasing planning security for the industry
 the new eu legal framework for telecommunications already takes these requirements
 into account and is sending out a vital impetus it is of key importance to telekom that
 after having been implemented in all eu member states this framework provides the
 necessary incentives to invest in network expansion in the daily practice of national

regulatory authorities these include

   increasing planning and legal security for investors before network expansion begins
   giving market solutions priority above regulation
   establishing regionally differentiated regulation that takes the competitive situation in
    the various regions into account
   better opportunities to distribute risk fairly between investors and competitors who
    require access to their infrastructure
   tapping into synergies by facilitating the shared use of existing infrastructure in all
    network sectors


protecting the open internet

there was much discussion about the topic of network neutrality in the current reporting
period more specifically there are concerns that todays internet might be restricted in
the future services which can now be accessed freely would then be available at extra
cost only or not at all however deutsche telekom is committed to the open internet
content and services will remain accessible online according to the best effort principle in
the future

deutsche telekom will continuously expand its transmission capacities and infrastructure
in order to be able to cope with our customers growing data traffic and to enable
innovations in the network only in this way will we be able to meet growing customer
demands and enable providers of online content and applications to offer their services at
the required quality levels network management is indispensable for operating
telecommunications networks

based on the best effort internet deutsche telekom is developing business models that
the internet sector can use to offer innovative services that require a certain level of
transmission quality

deutsche telekom will be able to market different nondiscriminating quality standards in
competition with other network providers in the future as well this will support medium
and longterm financing of broadband network expansion and enable providers to offer a
wider range of services and guaranteed high quality levels to consumers

deutsche telekom supports mandatory transparency and provision of information on
service quality these obligations are specified in the european directives of 2009 and
have been translated into national law they have enabled national regulatory authorities
to define minimum requirements on service quality in combination with general
competition law these legal provisions are sufficient to guarantee the open internet for
the long term without having to introduce any new laws or regulations


encouraging consumer dialog

deutsche telekom aims to become the most highly regarded service company in the
industry which is why we focused heavily on consumer topics in 2011 we also
strengthened internal functions dealing with consumer relations in order to improve
exchange between our product and service development and external stakeholders from

 the political arena and the general public we are involved in the following key topics
 regarding legislation and stakeholder dialog as well as efforts to create voluntary
 regulations for the industry

    safeguarding customer data
    at the european level creating new youth protection initiatives together with
     competitors along the entire value chain
    improving standards in customer service
    protecting consumers eg when moving or switching providers

 in all these areas telekom adopts a constructive and solutionoriented approach that is
 geared to both the consumers interests and the interests of our company

added value and social stability at our company sites in fiscal year 2011 our 235132
employees worldwide as of dec 31 2011 generated revenues of eur 587 billion with
more than half of this coming from outside germany deutsche telekom awarded contracts
totaling eur 184 billion in 2011 these figures show that economic development at our
company sites is closely connected to longterm business success

 telekom net added value

 telekom publishes the net added value generated for the group each year these figures
 show how different stakeholders benefit from corporate performance by paying wages
 and salaries and contributions to pension schemes for example we contributed
 substantially to regional purchasing power and a secure future at our locations net
 added value decreased to eur 311 billion in 2011 from eur 333 billion in the previous
 year


 participation in the information and knowledge society

 in the past couple of years including during the reporting period our focus was placed on
 investments to expand fast and stable networks our cash capex  a kpi that
 summarizes our investment in equipment and systems came to eur 3644 million for
 germany in 2011 of this we invested eur 1028 million in intangible assets without
 goodwill and eur 2616 million in property plant and equipment

 both in germany and at the international subsidiaries we also support initiatives and are
 offering needsbased solutions to give disadvantaged people access to new
 communications technologies and media these include

    special rates for lowincome and disabled people
    wideranging involvement in promoting media skills
    facilitating the integration of disadvantage people

 telekom helps close the digital divide by supporting equal opportunities for all to
 participate in education knowledge and communications in doing so the group helps to
 strengthen the economic standing and quality of life as well as competitiveness at its

home  networks  network  infrastructure expansion



network  infrastructure expansion
digital networking is one of the main trends in the modern information society full broadband coverage is
becoming a key requirement for participating in society however many people have no or only limited access to
this technology especially in rural areas there is a digital divide in our society our efforts in the cr category
connect the unconnected are therefore focused on using new technologies to cover new regions

today as a result of highperformance standards top data transmission speeds are provided even in remote areas

   adsl and adsl2
   vdsl
   gprsumts and hsdpahsupa
   lte

the network infrastructure is at the heart of our business telekom builds and operates networks that meet the high
requirements of the gigabit society the groups extensive network expansion strategy which was approved in july
2010 discusses the steps telekom is planning to take in the medium term on its way to creating the network of the
future the main objectives are growth efficiency and quality

    network expansion in line with political goals

    telekom supports the network expansion goals of the eu commission and the german government we plan to
    provide highspeed internet access to as many households as possible mainly in rural areas of germany that do
    not yet have coverage we are primarily relying on the long term evolution lte standard to help us achieve
    this goal together with the fixedline standards adsl adsl2 and vdsl lte will be a key component in
    future ict solutions we are pushing the development and expansion of fast networks in all the markets where
    we are active


    the european commission passed a digital agenda in may 2010 as part of its europe 2020 strategy in order to
    create the necessary conditions for economic growth in europe this agenda specifies that all europeans will be
    able to surf online at speeds of at least 30 mbits by the year 2020 connections enabling at least 100 mbits
    should be available to half of all european households by that year

    in line with the eus digital agenda the german government decided to pursue a similar goal with its broadband
    strategy which it passed in 2009 it requires network access with speeds of at least 50 mbits for all households
    by 2014 giving priority to infrastructure expansion in rural areas deutsche telekom is one of the most important
    partners of this broadband strategy and contributes significantly to fulfilling the german federal governments
    broadband objectives


    more than eur 10 billion in investments in broadband expansion

    telekoms total investments in broadband expansion in germany from 2010 to 2012 will come to around eur 10
    billion including those made for fiber optic networks new mobile communications technology and it processes

that makes telekom in germany the largest investor when it comes to providing broadband access

in 2010 we invested an additional eur 13 billion in lte frequencies and are now able to use the digital dividend
to provide broadband services


the group will be able to tap significant growth opportunities with the network expansion strategy in order to
take advantage of these opportunities telekom needs to rethink its current business model which consists of
the following

1 the network factory
our business is based on the network infrastructure and this will remain so to update the infrastructure we are
planning to change entirely over to allip   technology in the next few years fixed and mobile networks will be
fully integrated the aim will not only be to provide high bandwidths but also top quality and the best possible
service experience to our customers

2 toolkit of standard services
the second component consists of modern highly efficient and standardized it systems telekom currently
operates thousands of it systems the plan is to reduce simplify and update these systems this will save
money while improving the quality flexibility and speed of our services

3 content and services for customers
the third element of our strategy is our enabling services which with the help of ict enable providers from
areas such as healthcare energy or media distribution to expand their services or make them more customized
by doing so we enable our customers to become more efficient as well as more growth and customeroriented

our network and it capabilities will be combined to create a toolkit of standard services this will apply to our
products as well as to the option of integrating our services into thirdparty services such as those provided by
companies and software developers by using standardized interfaces this toolkit will be a springboard for new
business models and sales opportunities with it we will enable our partners to develop innovative solutions
while participating in the process at the same time

telekom helps business customers bring their content and services to the customer for example telekom
provides its partners with stateoftheart billing models installs modern access management systems and
guarantees high service quality


more broadband for germany project

telekom also continued its cooperation with local communities in the more broadband for germany project in
2011 within the scope of bid processes in those areas where broadband expansion may not be economically
feasible support from public funding is a viable option for example communities could provide existing
conduits that are not in use perform the civil engineering work required or participate in a network expansion
project by making a financial contribution more than 3000 communities have been receiving broadband
infrastructure through these means since 2008

in 2011 we entered into more than 1100 collaborations for broadband expansion following some 800 in 2010

each project generally involved a town or village the most popular technology of choice was fixedline dsl we
have been relying more heavily on a mix of fixedline mobile and radio relay system communications in our
network expansion activities since 2010

we will continue to make investments in broadband expansion in 2012 as well and expect to be involved in
collaborations of around the same scope as those in 2011 we will now rely more heavily on a technology which

offers higher bandwidths namely vdsl  telekom has been using vdsl                technology with bandwidths of up to
50 mbits in rural areas as well since 2011 this expansion will continue throughout 2012

cr report from the previous year


the fundamental part of broadbandbased highspeed internet is a fiber optic network expanding the fiberoptic
infrastructure to achieve blanket coverage goes hand in hand with tremendous financial expense experts
estimate eur 40 to 50 billion in germany alone the more remote the communities the higher the costs
reasons for this include the necessary civil engineering works which can cost up to eur 70000 per kilometer

blanket coverage calls for cooperation
telekom will not be able to afford to finance blanket coverage under financially viable conditions by itself even
in germany where we have a share of around fifty percent of the broadband market we will only be able to
manage this task in collaboration with our competitors that is why we encourage german and european
government offices to provide sufficient incentive to secure the necessary industrywide participation of all ict
network operators

cooperating with communities
broadband expansion in many rural communities is not financially viable due to the low number of potential
customers and high investment costs in these cases telekom has been working in partnershipssince late
2007 in dsl network expansion and since 2011 by setting up a vdsl network the company informs the
communities about the costs and offers them various collaborative options

   use of the communities existing cable duct systems or unused conduits to reduce civil engineering costs
   local authorities taking on tasks such as conducting civil engineering works
   providing advice in applying for possible subsidies

highspeed internet access is an important factor in making a location attractive the german association of
towns and municipalities dstgb published a guideline entitled more broadband for germany to inform
decisionmakers at local authorities of the possibilities and potential of broadband expansion deutsche telekom
contributed a series of expert articles to this publication in doing so the company is fulfilling its obligation to
keep people informed and provide them with access to the information society

fiberoptic expansion in germany

deutsche telekom intends to continue to expand its highspeed network over the next few years laying the
foundation for the gigabit society this network of the future will give our customers in germany highspeed
access to the internet entertain offerings and multimedia applications in unheardof speed variety and quality
we are specifically looking to cooperate with the housing industry in our expansion activities homeowners who
agree to the expansion can expect the value of their property to increase considerably as a result of ftth cable
provision

deutsche telekom embarked on a trendsetting collaboration in the area of ict infrastructure with deutsche
annington immobilien ag daig the two partners gave the goahead for a fiber optic connection of around
171000 homes managed by the daig nationwide in march 2011 in several steps deutsche telekom will
provide daigmanaged buildings at approximately 600 locations with highspeed broadband connection at
competitive prices in a first step 42000 daig homes in northrhine westphalia will be given access to the new
network

cr report from the previous year


deutsche telekom employs the fiber       to the home ftth concept when expanding its fiber optic network
that means we will be laying fiber optic cables all the way to the customers home in this way by using gpon
gigabit passive optical networks technology it is now possible to use the highspeed potential of fiber optic
technology to its fullest access of up to 25 gbits of download speed and up to 1 gbits of upload speed have
now become feasible

fiber   optics is the fastest data transmission medium one of our goals therefore is to directly connect a large
number of households to the fiber optic network in 2012


using synergy effects for ftth expansion

costs reduction potential and synergy effects can be realized and risks can be dispersed when installing new
fiber optic networks based on network expansion collaborations that is why we are open to collaboration and
are reviewing all forms of cooperation in both the fixedline and mobile communications areas

the range of possibilities covers options such as marketing collaboration renting complete passive access
networks and joint ventures joint regional companies founded with local utilities companies special purpose
associations or other partners telekom also launched the more fiber       optics for germany initiative the goal
is to further local fiber optic expansion in collaboration with communities and local utilities companies using a
standardized expansion and business model

agreements with local competitors regarding mutual guarantee of network access open access play a role here
as well because such agreements can prevent double investment we also offer special terms and conditions
packages to enable pure service providers resellers that do not have their own network to participate in the
expansion costs and risks involved in new networks


migration to allip

we are planning to change our entire network over to an allip     infrastructure in the next few years with this
step fixed network and mobile communications will be comprehensively integrated in a next generation network
based on the internet protocol ip  numerous it systems will be simplified and updated for this purpose

many people already use ipbased solutions to organize their daytoday lives conveniently and individually we
are constantly improving our offer of fast mobile communications and fixedline connections to lay the foundation
for this change the voice and data service platforms which are currently separate will be integrated onto a
standardized platform over the course of the allip    migration this should help reduce energy consumption
considerably

a functional internet infrastructure is based on a number of innovative technologies whose development is
influenced by our planning processes the allip      migration and the demand for increasingly faster bandwidths
provide impetus for the provision of new efficient technologies when it comes to data transport or individual
network access together with changing customer demands and new ways of using technology they are the
force behind our efforts to restructure and update the network

in 2012 we started with the preparations for the implementation of the new broadband network gateway bng
technology approach the bng allows us to reduce network complexity through a more streamlined architecture

it enables us to reduce the number of network elements creating savings potential in network operation and

 reducing investment costs as well as energy requirements


 award for mobile communications network in germany

 in 2011 we received significant awards for telekom deutschlands mobile communications network the
 german consumer organization stiftung warentest recognized our excellent network availability said that we
 had the highest data rates and rated our service as good a score of 24 with 1 being the highest

 this was followed by a test involving extensive measurements conducted by the trade portal chip online in
 which we received first place we also came in first in the test conducted by the trade magazine connect we
 were ranked far ahead of the competition in both tests

 the judges particularly praised the quality of the network expansion which is based on innovative technologies
 the 2nd carrier and dual cell function was activated at all sites by september 2011 that means that data rates
 of up to 42 mbits are now possible thanks to blanket coverage provision of a second carrier frequency in the
 umts network


 mobile network operator of the year for the twelfth time

 readers of the connect trade journal voted telekom mobile network operator of the year for the twelfth time
 in a row in may 2011 furthermore services in the areas of iptv entertain internet and phone as well as
 virtual pabxs telekom deutschlandlan were especially praised we came in first in all of these areas

 the tests evaluated a total of 25 categories the results for telekom entertain were particularly impressive
 telekoms iptvoffer with phone internet and digital tv was voted the best tv offer by 60 percent of test
 participants connect readers also expressed their satisfaction with telekoms combined phone and internet
 offers such as telekoms call  surf rate 279 voted for telekom as the best provider in the internet  phone
 category deutschlandlan an integrated solution for it services was voted best virtual pbx system in the

home  networks  network  infrastructure expansion  fixedline  broadband technologies



fixedline  broadband technologies
data transport within the internet infrastructure and individual use of the internet both rely on a number of innovative
technologies many people already use networkbased solutions to organize their daytoday lives conveniently and
individually that is why we are continuously striving to improve our offer of highspeed connections both for
fixedline and mobile communications

the dslbased transmission protocols adsl adsl2 and vdsl and the expansion of the fiber optic network all
the way to the customers home fiber            to the home ftth increase the speed of data transfer in the fixedline
area

we are able to achieve similar increases in performance in the mobile communications area by switching from 2nd
generation networks 2g  with gsm and edge to third generation networks 3g  with the umtsbased
standards hsdpahsupa and hspa with the switch to the long term evolution lte transmission standard of
the future also referred to as 4g data rates will increase many times over and reach broadband speeds

customers need more mobile bandwidth to be able to conveniently access complex online applications quickly
when they are on the go that is why telekom is increasing its use of 3rd and 4th generation broadband mobile
communications technologies

 the maximum values listed here are based on theoretical assumptions upstream  downstream and data
rates often fall below these values during actual use


adsl2 expansion

adsl2 asymmetric digital subscriber line 2 is the dsl standard currently used by deutsche telekom for
fixedline connections it allows for the fast transmission of large amounts of data at speeds of up to 16 mbits

between 2006 and early 2012 228 million lines in more than 1000 cities were migrated over to adsl2 in
germany alone

we began introducing msan multi service access node a device class for access nodes on august 15 2011
msan integrates earlier technology into the allip     network it replaces the splitters that were previously used
for network connection to separate voice and data and consequently enables the use of dsl lines with fully
ipbased services as well as traditional phone services without the necessity to replace existing devices we will
continue the migration process in 2012


vdsl expansion

with vdsl     very high bit rate digital subscriber line telekom once again increased the speed of its dsl lines
several times over more than three times compared to adsl and twice as fast as adsl2 the new technology
allows for data rates of up to 50 mbits a hybrid network is needed to realize these speeds in a hybrid network
the fiber optic cables extend all the way into the subscribers neighborhood conventional copper lines are used
to cover the last 300 to 500 meters to the customer

telekom expanded the highspeed vdsl           network in close proximity to each subscriber in 50 german cities in
2009 that means 116 million households have access to bandwidths of up to 50 mbits bandwidths of up to 16
mbits are available in 7800 out of 7900 exchange areas almost 20 million households in germany can receive
tripleplay products phone internet and tv based on bandwidths of between 16 mbits and 50 mbits

with the vdsl        vectoring technology which was developed in 2011 speeds of 90 mbits can be achieved with
vdsl  the new technology neutralizes interference that results from having several vdsl           lines in one cable
by precoding or equalizing the signals this requires a standardized control mechanism for all vdsl        lines in
the cable including those used by competitors we will begin initial pilot operations with the new technology in
2012


ftth expansion in germany

when it comes to fiberoptic expansion deutsche telekom does not only rely on fiber         to the cabinet fttc
which refers to expansion in the proximity of the subscriber but also on the fiber     to the home ftth solution
in which fiber optic cables extend into the customers home ftth expansion was launched in 2010

investments by telekom in new fiber optic networks will be based on demand two requirements need to be met
in the expansion areas before civil engineering works can start

   at least 80 percent of residents need to give their permission to have their building connected or for cables to
    be laid in their building and
   at least ten percent of customers need to have preordered the service

if these conditions are not met the expansion will have to be postponed at the same time we will evaluate the
feasibility of using other technologies for example fttc with vdsl 

a total of 168000 homes homes passed in ten german cities were enabled to receive connection to the
deutsche telekom fiber optic network through the installation of new infrastructure in 2011

the networks in these cities are scheduled to go into operation in august 2012 customers will then be able to
access download rates of up to 200 mbits and upload rates of up to 100 mbits  non blocking that means that
speeds will generally be higher than those provided by cable tv network operators

expansion is planned for up to ten additional cities in 2012 the number of cities that will actually be served
depends on the achievement of a defined minimum profitability whilst taking into account future developments
over the course of 2012 we will decide which cities will be included in the expansion process in 2013 expansion
in the years to come will depend on the investment resources available on whether we have achieved our
costeffectiveness thresholds as well as on regulatory decisions

 hook up more than 1500 rural dead cell zones to the lte 800 network another 1000 will follow in 2012 we
 began lte expansion in 100 large cities in the second half of 2011 including cologne where we were able to
 provide lte infrastructure coverage to an area of around 150 square kilometers cologne became germanys
 first lte city in june 2011 after investments of approximately 5 million euros it took some 80 deutsche telekom
 employees around 5000 hours to install 100 lte stations we also installed approximately 120 kilometers of
 fiber optic cables in cologne districts to connect the base stations with stateoftheart transmission technology

 lte is the successor of the umts mobile communications standard and rings in a new generation of mobile
 communications technology 4g that is still being developed telekom is playing a key role in this development
 lte enables even greater acceleration of data transmission in mobile as well as fixedline internet to up to 100
 mbits lte offers transmission speeds that are 20 times faster than in previous mobile networks

 lte can be used in a wide frequency range from 700 mhz to 2600 mhz the lower frequencies around 800
 mhz are particularly effective for providing service to rural areas they have a much greater range in open
 spaces than higher frequencies they also help provide better service inside buildings

 another advantage is network coverage even in areas where mobile communications and dsl coverage had not
 been possible before the radio technology enables a reliable network for calls and internet access lte creates

 a stable network both inside buildings and in cars or on the train


 expansion of lte coverage in austria

 tmobile austria also invested heavily in the expansion and advancement of lte network technology in
 october 2010 innsbruck became the first city in austria to be connected to the network of the future tmobile
 austria put additional lte mobile base stations into operation in vienna in may 2011 and in linz and graz in
 june 2011 some 600000 austrians have been able to use the new broadband technology in these four cities
 ever since

 tmobile austria invested a total of eur 116 million in expanding its mobile broadband network in 2011 in
 addition to lte the company further expanded the high speed packet access hspa standards hspa 21 and
 hspa 42 these transmission standards reach downlink speeds of up to 21 or 42 mbits through these efforts
 the company plans to be able to provide at least one fourth of the austrian population with access to the new
 mobile communications standard by the end of 2013

home  networks  mobile communications  health



mobile communications  health
at telekom we are convinced that using mobile communications technology is safe if international limit values and
standards are complied with they are based on current findings of independent german and international experts
that continue to evaluate all relevant studies and research results recognized expert organizations such as the
world health organization who and the international commission on nonionizing radiation protection icnirp
have repeatedly verified the current limit values for mobile communications over the past few years thereby
confirming the safe usage of this technology

nevertheless mobile communications continues to be a source of concern among the general public when it comes
to possible health risks we hope to ease these fears by providing scientifically sound transparent information we
will only be able to run a successful business and systematically drive network expansion if our technology is widely
accepted by the people that is why telekom engages in open dialog with all stakeholders involved in network
expansion including communities skeptical organizations interested residents and customers

our principles on how to handle mobile communications and health responsibly are specified in deutsche
telekoms emf policy

 emf policy

 emf stands for electromagnetic fields which are the physical basis of mobile communications with our emf
 policy we are committing ourselves to more transparency information participation and financial support of
 independent research on mobile communications far beyond that which is stipulated by legal requirements

 by now all management boards from all of telekoms european mobile subsidiaries have signed the emf policy
 two more international subsidiaries signed the policy during the reporting period
 slovak telekom approved the emf policy in april 2011 and introduced different measures the company
 provided information on its website and developed internal workflows for processing queries on mobile
 communications and health from the general public
 the montenegrin subsidiary crnogorski telekom signed the policy in october 2011 and published it on its own
 website


 telekom approved its emf policy addressing a responsible approach to mobile communications and health in
 march 2004 the policy contains mandatory recommendations for telekoms european mobile communications
 subsidiaries these are implemented in different markets in line with local circumstances and requirements

 telekoms emf policy contains ten recommendations regarding the following four principles

    transparency
    information
    participation
    supporting scientific research  partnerships

 download  background document on the emf policy


 evaluation of emf policy implementation

 deutsche telekom worked together with all of its mobile subsidiaries to define standardized minimum
 requirements for mobile communications and health in march 2011 we conducted an evaluation of all mobile
 subsidiaries in the summer of 2011 based on these requirements

 the analysis showed that deutsche telekoms subsidiaries are well positioned when it comes to transparency
 the individual subsidiaries have adjusted their internal structures to be able to further implement the emf policy
 in a responsible way one focal point is the systematic publication of the international limit values and safety
 standards as well as antenna locations all subsidiaries also created a comprehensive information offer about
 mobile communications and health via internal sales channels and their collaboration with operator associations
 ways for the public to get involved have been continuously expanded over the past few years internal structures
 have been designed so that we can inform the public and local governments of our activities and involve them in
 the process at an early stage eg during network expansion


 our goal is for the emf policy to be effectively implemented at all the mobile subsidiaries to contribute to a
 constructive discourse on mobile communications and health in society and to contribute to effective risk
 management in the respective market to this end our international mobile subsidiaries are continuously
 implementing the ten recommendations set forth in the emf policy telekom supports its mobile subsidiaries in
 this process by regularly evaluating their progress and jointly exploring possibilities for improvement


 sharing best practices as part of emf topic management

 group headquarters and the mobile subsidiaries are sharing best practices in various working groups such as
 the emf core team and the emf technical working group which was founded in march 2011 new initiatives
 are developed and experiences gained in pursuing various strategies are discussed in this context


 deutsche telekom founded the emf core team and the emf technical working group to act as crossarea
 coordination groups with members from all of telekoms mobile communications subsidiaries both serve as
 platforms for the mobile subsidiaries to share their experience internationally and to encourage mutual learning
 in the sense of a systematic exchange of best practices

 the emf core team accompanies and coordinates strategy processes and makes suggestions for
 improvement on how to address the topic of mobile communications and health responsibly it also supports
 national implementation of the emf policy

 in the emf technical working group experts from various international mobile subsidiaries work out technical
 assessments of the new technologies and develop internal health and safety policies on mobile communications
 and health

home  networks  mobile communications  health  transparency



transparency
telekom has specified three focal points to promote transparency in the area of mobile communications and health
these are reflected in three recommendations made in the emf policy

   telekom requires its mobile subsidiaries to clarify and establish internal responsibilities and processes regarding
    technology safety and health issues
   they are encouraged to facilitate public access to information on existing electromagnetic fields this includes
    conducting emf measurement campaigns and supporting national emf databases
   proof of compliance with the icnirp limits for each individual mobile communications antenna must be made
    available upon request

suitable measures were established and further expanded at all telekom mobile subsidiaries during the reporting
period

    management structures in montenegro and fyro macedonia

    after approving the emf policy in october 2011 our montenegrin subsidiary crnogorski telekom introduced
    various measures for addressing the topic of mobile communications and health the company designated an
    emf manager and founded an emf working group crnogorski telekom also developed processes for
    crossarea cooperation between technology departments human resources and public relations to help them
    process external inquiries without delay

    prompt processing of inquiries at fyro macedonia
    the internal processes developed by tmobile macedonia in 2010 for managing customer inquiries about emf
    were put to the test in 2011 the assessment particularly focused on fast response being a key requirement for
    customer satisfaction the results showed that all areas collaborated to process customer inquiries about emf
    immediately after receipt and answered them within five workdays


    emf measurement campaign in croatia

    authorized measurement institutes conducted emf measurements at some 100 tht hrvatski telekom sites
    over the course of 2011 in cooperation with the ministry of health and social welfare in croatia the results
    confirmed once again that electromagnetic field levels are significantly lower than the national and international
    limit values the measurements also enabled tht hrvatski telekom to comply with the new obligation of
    september 2011 to provide information on actual electromagnetic field levels at selected sites


    establishing emf monitoring in montenegro

    crnogorski telekom is giving financial support to the measurement campaigns scheduled for 2012 by the
    montenegrin environmental protection authorities as well as the emf monitoring program to inform the public
    about actual electromagnetic field levels the electrotechnical department at the university of montenegro has
    been commissioned to conduct the measurements the results are scheduled to be released in 2012

 greece measurements every six minutes

 cosmote greece installed a total of 28 new measurement stations featuring the pedion24 measuring system 7
 141000 measurements one measurement every six minutes were conducted throughout the year and the
 results were published on wwwpedion24gr to provide interested citizens with transparent information about
 electromagnetic field levels existing at selected sites


 pedion24 is a constant 24hour emf measuring system for frequency ranges of 100 khz to 3 ghz cosmote
 greece developed pedion24 in close cooperation with research institutes such as the national technical
 university of athens aristotle university of thessaloniki and the university of the aegean

 pedion24 is an autonomous monitoring system that measures the electromagnetic fields at selected sites around
 the clock and transmits measurement data to a central storage database the information is then evaluated and
 immediately published online typical measurement sites include schools hospitals community centers and
 other public buildings cosmote greeces experience shows that the public sees these 24hour measurements
 as highly credible which means these measurements are making a considerable contribution to helping the
 public emf debate focus on the facts


 albanian measurement campaign almost complete

 the albanian subsidiary amc supported an independent measurement campaign conducted by the polytechnic
 university of tirana in 2011 with the goal of creating more transparency regarding actual emf emissions in the
 country electromagnetic fields were measured at sensitive sites such as schools hospitals and residential
 areas the results and the final report are scheduled for 2012 and will be published on the amc and polytechnic
 university of tirana websites


 compliance with international limit values

 the purpose of limit values is to protect peoples health they are based on the current state of scientific
 knowledge and indicate the permitted amount of exposure there are limit values for drinking water and noise
 levels for example limit values have also been specified for mobile communications compliance with these
 values guarantees safe use of mobile communications technology on most markets on which telekom is active
 legally specified limit values apply that are based on recommendations made by the international commission
 on nonionizing radiation protection icnirp for mobile communications technology for frequency ranges
 between 100 khz and 300 ghz all of the mobile subsidiaries base stations have been built in accordance with
 the valid regulations of that country and comply with the guidelines of the international commission on
 nonionizing radiation protection icnirp for the sake of transparency our international subsidiaries have
 issued statements of compliance with limit values for each individual base station

information
another principle specified in telekoms emf policy involves active provision of information on technology and
health research and requires the mobile subsidiaries to promote communication about technology safety research
and health this includes educational measures and consumer information as well as raising employee awareness

 industrywide communication initiatives

 telekoms international mobile communications subsidiaries are involved in numerous national operator
 initiatives to improve public communication about mobile communications and health the operator initiatives act
 as the central goto place for residents the media and public and private institutions when it comes to the topic
 of mobile communications they work to promote transparency regarding all aspects of mobile communications
 in particular health and consumer protection network expansion and how to deal with site conflicts

consumer information on emf provided by international subsidiaries

several international subsidiaries continued to improve their consumer information on mobile communications
and health during the reporting period

the montenegrobased subsidiary crnogorski telekom implemented a series of information measures on the
topic of mobile communications and health and in particular on sar levels more are scheduled for 2012
information on the sar levels of mobile devices has been a standard component in product information since
2011 and will soon be accessible at sales outlets and online as well

slovak telekom also recently began including information on the sar levels of its devices online

in order to further expand its usercentered information offer cosmote romania conducted four representative
surveysin february 2011 may 2011 september 2011 and january 2012about public perception of mobile
communications emf emissions and health cosmote romania is currently developing a communication
strategy based on the results the strategy is scheduled to be implemented in the spring 2012


training and raising employee awareness

telekom employees are important ambassadors to the public they help increase the knowledge of mobile
communications and health among the population and by doing so enhance the acceptance of mobile
communications technology training programs were conducted at several international subsidiaries during the
reporting period

the bulgarian subsidiary globul conducted training for its employees on mobile communications and health and
was able to bring a representative of the world health organization who on board as a speaker the goal of
the training was to intensify the employees knowledge of physical and technical fundamentals current state of
scientific knowledge in the area of mobile communications and health as well as to communicate the results of
measurement campaigns globul also offered emf training in 2011 to contractors and subcontractors involved in
site acquisition and antenna installation in order to guarantee that everyone participating in network setup and
expansion would be able to answer any questions asked by those interested

the croatian subsidiary tht hrvatski telekom trained around 260 employees on the topic of emf in 2011
providing them with extensive information on technical background as well as safety and healthrelated aspects
involved in mobile communications tht hrvatski telekom also hosted online training for an additional 800
employees these internal training programs were complemented by special workshops for employees who
particularly need information about emf in their areas of responsibility

the czech subsidiary tmobile czech republic introduced an expert training program in 2011 as a standard
component of the companys orientation days for new employees in addition to communicating knowledge the

 purpose of the training was to raise awareness of the public debate

home  networks  mobile communications  health  participation



participation
the basis for successful network expansion is active participation of everyone involved right from the start this is
made possible by initiating dialog with stakeholders such as municipalities residents and people who live near
mobile base stations as well as skeptical organizations and ngos that is why we incorporated the idea of
participation in the emf policy we developed three essential recommendations that are based on this principle

   we require our mobile subsidiaries to work closely with municipalities and to support them with their expertise
    when it comes to answering the questions of residents regarding network development and site selection for
    mobile base stations
   conflicts arising in connection with site selection should be resolved by finding solutions that are acceptable to all
    parties assigning local contacts as a liaison with those involved at the regional level makes it possible to resolve
    conflicts or answer questions quickly easily and competently
   we try to keep interference with the landscape and cityscape to a minimum we also try to prevent mobile
    communications masts from becoming eyesores when selecting locations

our mobile subsidiaries have been conducting appropriate measures to encourage participation for several years
in germany for example our approach is based in particular on the voluntary commitment by mobile network
operators as well as on the agreement with the national associations of local authorities telekom deutschland
signed both in 2001

    voluntary commitment of mobile providers in germany

    on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the voluntary commitment of mobile communications providers in
    germany in late 2011 telekom deutschland and the other german mobile providers informed the german
    federal government that they would continue to honor their voluntary commitment
    in december 2001 the four mobile providers in germany voluntarily committed themselves to engage in
    trustbuilding activities when expanding their mobile networks the main objectives of the agreement include
    improving transparency during network expansion providing more information to consumers and sponsoring
    independent research one specific example of how the agreement is being implemented is that we provide
    information to cities and municipalities and get them involved in mobile network expansion the implementation
    of this voluntary commitment has laid the foundation for deutsche telekoms current network expansion plans
    including the rollout of a stateoftheart broadband network

    the network providers also announced that they would support the german federal ministry of the
    environments plans regarding risk communication in the next two years with a total of eur 600000 the goal is
    to provide people with even more comprehensive targeted information about the possible impact of mobile
    communications technology on humans and the environment

    implementation of the voluntary commitment contributed considerably to minimizing conflicts regarding sites for
    mobile base stations and to improving peoples acceptance of mobile communications this is confirmed by
    independent expert reports an integral part of this voluntary commitment is having the measures regularly
    reviewed by a consortium of experts comprised of representatives of deutsches institut für urbanistik difu the
    german institute for urban affairs and the german consumer organization verbraucherzentrale

nordrheinwestfalen every two years the results of the review are summarized in an independent expert report
that is submitted to the german federal government results of the 2011 expert report will be published in the
second quarter 2012

the continued positive feedback from the ministries involved and the chancellors office regarding successful
implementation of the voluntary commitment encourages us to continue to promote a responsible approach to
the topic of mobile communications and health


the voluntary commitment of mobile network operators in germany is an excellent example of how effective
dialog and participation can be in 2001 telekom deutschland teamed up with the other german network
providers to submit a voluntary commitment to the german federal government this commitment involves
measures to improve safety and consumer environment and health protection and to provide information and
conduct trustbuilding activities when expanding mobile communications networks

the objective of the agreement is to improve consumer protection and health safety when expanding mobile
networks in germany network providers have been conducting a series of measures and activities to achieve
this goal since 2001 mobile providers in germany once again reinforced their voluntary commitment in 2008 and
announced additional measures by reaffirming its voluntary commitment in 2008 telekom deutschland once
again expressed its willingness to engage in dialog with municipalities and residents that also includes
continuing to comply with the mobile communications agreement concluded with national associations of local
authorities

this agreement agreement on sharing information and municipality participation in mobile communications
network expansion activities was also signed in 2001 by all mobile network providers in germany and the
national associations of local authorities  the german association of cities the german association of district
councils and the german association of towns and municipalities its objective is to involve cities and
municipalities in the network expansion process mobile communications companies and municipalities work
together in cooperative constructive dialog to come up with amicable solutions for new sites for mobile base
stations in this way we have been able to permanently improve the flow of information between municipalities
and network providers

other components of the voluntary commitment are to improve consumer information particularly on the use of
cell phones and to sponsor independent research on mobile communications conducted by the german federal
government


dialog on network setup and expansion

when introducing new technology it is important to inform residents about the technology being used at an early
stage our experience with setting up networks shows that engaging in dialog directly with municipalities and the
people contributes considerably to how well our technology is accepted and to easing the publics concerns

during expansion of the lte network infrastructure in germany telekom deutschland implemented a dialog
with municipalities and residents in 2011 to address critical questions asked by local decisionmakers give them
the opportunity to participate and work together with them to develop solutions
residents can address any questions they may have to local contacts that are familiar with local conditions and
are involved in continuous dialog with residents and municipalities people with questions on mobile
communications and health can also call our expert hotline 08000852606 or send an email to telekoms
email address emvutelekomde

as part of lte expansion in austria tmobile austria hosted informative events in all federal states for

 representatives of state and local authorities from may to october 2011 the representatives had the opportunity
 to learn extensively about lte technology and safetyrelated aspects tmobile austria was also able to bring
 renowned mobile communications and health experts from the university of innsbruck on board

 alongside the current network expansion in montenegro crnogorski telekom also initiated dialog with
 municipalities during the reporting period helping make public discussion of the topic more factual


 participating in expert discussions on emf

 representatives of the bulgarian mobile communications subsidiary globul actively participated in the 6th
 international cema communication electromagnetics and medical applications held in the countrys capital of
 sofia in october 2011 the cema is one of the most important conferences in the balkans on the fields of
 engineering sciences and medicine under the headline emf exposure and mobile telephony globul discussed
 the problems involved in addressing the public debate about mobile communications and health and presented
 its strategy for handling the topic responsibly

 in germany the third meeting of the electromagnetic fields round table rtemf was held in november 2011
 experts on health the environment and consumer protection as well as scientists were invited to attend an emf
 expert from telekom deutschland also attended the meeting and discussed current safety research and
 technologyrelated mobile communications issues


 the electromagnetic fields round table rtemf is a key instrument for telekom deutschland when it comes
 to open dialog with all stakeholders involved in the public emf discussion the original round table was initiated
 as part of the german mobile communications research program dmf since 2010 it has been held under the
 name electromagnetic fields round table rtemf

home  networks  mobile communications  health  research  partnership



research  partnership
the effects of electromagnetic fields on human beings have been researched thoroughly over the last few decades
all recognized expert committees confirm on the basis of sound research results that current limit values guarantee
that mobile communications can be used safely

however in light of new technological developments it is important that we continue to update the information
available on possible effects of mobile communications that is why supporting independent scientific research and
partnerships is a key element in our emf policy this is reflected by two recommendations for interacting with the
research and scientific community

   as a leading mobile network provider telekom supports scientific independent research  such as independent
    national research programs  on possible health effects of emf
   limit values for mobile communications technology need to be defined on the basis of sound research results and
    to undergo constant review

    developing expertise at the emf science forum

    the kickoff event of the emf science forum wfemf was held at the berlinbrandenburg academy of
    sciences and humanities in april 2011 the forums main objective is to develop new methods for approaching
    the conflicts that exist in the scientific community regarding the possible impact that electromagnetic fields have
    on health the organization running the project is the institute for technology assessment and systems analysis
    itas at the karlsruhe institute of technology kit a member of the helmholtz association of german
    research centers

    almost 60 researchers from the fields of biology epidemiology decision research communication research
    human medicine public health sociology and statistics attended the science forums kickoff event

    the emf science forum held several meetings on selected research and risk assessment topics in the mobile
    communications and health area in 2011 all stakeholders including those from science politics business
    ngos and resident initiatives were welcome to attend a network meeting on risk communication took place at
    the fraunhofer societys offices in berlin in august 2011 a network meeting on neurodegenerative diseases
    and elf  rf emf exposure followed in september 2011 in collaboration with the charité competence center
    of sleep research in berlin representatives from the scientific community committees governmental agencies
    and ngos as well as from politics and industry met in december 2011 at the helmholtz associations
    spreepalais in berlin to discuss the international agency for research on cancers iarc decision to rank
    electromagnetic fields as a possible carcinogenic

    a summary of the results of the meetings is expected to be published in 2012 at
    httpwwwwfemforgenset_languageen


    telekom financially supported the preparation and foundation of the emf science forum in 2010 the emf
    science forum was officially founded on january 1 2011 the objective of the science forum is to research
    how scientific conflicts arise and which scientific rules and standards can be used to deal with controversial

situations another goal is to explore how scientific studies can be weighted and interpreted fairly in order to
promote scientifically substantiated risk assessment

the emf science forum is run by the institute for technology assessment and systems analysis itas of the
karlsruhe institute of technology kit which is part of the helmholtz association of german research centers
the forum is advised by a board of internationally recognized researchers from the areas of biology
epidemiology decision research electrical engineering communication sociology and statistics the aim is to
develop research expertise in the area of mobile communications and health and to make extensive clear and
current information available to professional circles

promoting independent research

together with the other german network providers telekom deutschland supports projects on mobile
communications and health conducted by the german federal governments environmental research plan
collectively the network providers contributed eur 1 million several projects were conducted by renowned
research groups under the program from 2008 to 2012 the research projects focused on possible longterm
effects of using mobile communications technology and the possibly higher susceptibility of children to emfs
generated by mobile communications


supporting independent research financially is part of the voluntary commitment made to the german federal
government by german network providers this also includes telekoms financial sponsorship of the german
mobile communications research program dmf from 2001 to 2008 the german federal ministry for the
environment conducted the dmf program from 2002 to 2008 with a total budget of eur 17 million the ministry
sponsored more than 50 studies on the effects of emfs in mobile communications mobile network providers
supported the project with eur 85 million the german federal office for radiation protection bfs was
responsible for program administration and content the results were published in june 2008 according to the
bfs earlier indications of possible healthrelated effects of highfrequency fields could not be confirmed no new
indications of possible healthrelated effects were found in particular no nonthermal effects were identified
the studies therefore did not find reason to adjust the current limit values


user data provided to researchers

researchers from ludwigmaximiliansuniversität in munich lmu munich have been looking into the
correlation between frequent use of cell phones and the occurrence of tumors in young people in their mobikids
study in compliance with current data privacy regulations telekom deutschland is providing the researchers
with all necessary data on the frequency with which those participating in the study are using their cell phones
this lets researchers analyze possible diseases in relation to actual cell phone use forms the basis for an
improved research methodology and leads to more reliable results researchers from 13 countries are
participating in the study by collecting medical data and data on cellphone users in their countries the study
will be completed by 2014 and will provide valuable information on any effects that using cell phones may have
on young peoples health


emf study database available to the public

 the availability of scientifically substantiated information and studies on the topic of mobile communications and
 health is fundamental to constructive social dialog during the reporting period deutsche telekom financially
 sponsored the database of the german research center for bioelectromagnetic interaction femu which is
 run by rwth aachen university

 femu collects all scientific studies that have been published on the topic of mobile communications and health
 and makes them available to the public those interested can access the data at no charge by visiting
 httpwwwemfportaldeindexphple the database contains more than 15000 scientific articles and reports
 and has established itself in the past few years in germany and abroad as a reliable source for scientific studies
 on mobile communications and health the world health organization who recommends the emf portal and
 numerous german government agencies refer to it on their websites


 research on radio technologies and measurement techniques

 telekom deutschland and the other network providers in germany are supporting the german federal office for
 radiation protection bfs in a study on determining the general populations exposure levels as a result of new
 mobile communications technology this research project which started in august 2011 is being conducted by
 the institute for mobile and satellite communication technology imst and the eminstitut gmbh the aim is to
 improve the amount of data available on the electromagnetic fields generated by new services such as lte
 telekom is providing all of the necessary information on network configuration to imst which is in charge of the
 project study results are expected to be available by late 2012

 the new mobile communications technology lte raises new questions for example we need to find out how
 lte interacts with other technical systems telekom deutschland commissioned imst to research the interplay
 between lte 800 and other technologies with the same frequency such as wireless microphone equipment
 the results will be used to support municipalities in addressing possible problems with lte 800 and work with
 them to develop solutions

environmentally friendly network infrastructure
stateoftheart information and communications technology ict increasingly helps replace energy and
resourceintensive products and services with more efficient ones at the same time however the amount of data
that needs to be saved and transmitted is growing due to ever more sophisticated applications according to the
smart 2020 study published by the climate group of the global esustainability initiative gesi the ict industry
was responsible for around two percent of global emissions in 2007 the equivalent of around 830 metric megatons
of co2 estimates foresee an increase to up to six percent each year until 2020

that is why it is now even more important than ever to not only improve the performance of networks and data
centers but to make them more energy efficient as well in the interest of climate protection

telekom deutschland switches off replaces and recycles any old systems that have been made redundant we
choose the most energyefficient and environmentally friendly technology currently available when making new
purchases we also motivate our customers to save energy and reduce co2 emissions by providing them with
efficient solutions for this purpose we published the klima schützen kosten senken protecting the climate
cutting costs brochure based on the smart 2020 study

 code of conduct on energy consumption of broadband equipment

 by signing the european code of conduct on energy consumption of broadband equipment cocbb
 deutsche telekom has pledged to optimize the energy requirements of its broadband networks

 we incorporated the third version of the code into the environmental regulations of our procurement policies in
 2011 deutsche telekom complies with the maximum energy consumption levels for new technology as
 specified in the code in collaboration with our suppliers


 in september 2010 20 european telecommunications companies all members of gesi signed the code of
 conduct on energy consumption of broadband equipment cocbb those who signed the code including
 telekom and our greek subsidiary ote also pledged to optimize energy requirements in the broadband sector

 the cocbb specifies standards for devices and network components and places a number of requirements on
 systems manufacturers

    permissible maximum consumption levels for network components eg dslam down to customer
     enddevices eg routers
    placing all participants under the obligation to produce select and use devices in compliance with
     energyefficient criteria
    providing information on improvements in energy efficiency regarding end devices and equipment used in the
     network infrastructure chain


 low power mode on the road to a green dsl

 in line with the cocbb telekom is identifying ways to optimize the energy consumption of its adsl2 network
 whereas previously all connections were operated in a switchedon mode ie in fullpower mode l0 mode
 by using the lowpower mode l2 mode it will be possible in the future to reduce the electric power usage when
 using data services with a lower bandwidth analysis revealed that the use of the l2 mode in the adsl2
 network creates energy savings of up to 20 percent

 so far the lowpower mode has not been used in the network due to poor quality stability and interoperability
 meanwhile due to additional enhanced features of the l2 mode which have been achieved within the framework
 of standardization through the international telecommunications union itu it is possible to increase both the
 quality of service in l2 mode and the stability telekom contributed significantly to the itu standardization
 committees development of the new standard during the reporting period

 in the future it will be possible to implement the improved modes with a modem generation based on msan
 technology which is currently used in the adsl2 access nodes

network upgrading
energy efficiency is not only an important goal for telekom in planning new networks it is also important when
optimizing existing ones better performance and less energy consumption go hand in hand

 replacing outdated 2g network technology

 the largest system technology swap in the history of deutsche telekoms mobile business began on september
 4 2011 the replacement of alcatellucents outdated 2ggsm technology with stateoftheart huawei
 technology the plan is to replace the technology at a total of some 12000 mobile communications sites and
 replace more than half of the outdated 2ggsm systems the number of controller sites for base stations will be
 reduced from 256 to 13 over the course of the swap

 by modernizing the technology we are laying the foundation for a futureproof technology platform which is not
 only suitable for lte expansion but will also ensure that the same hardware can be used for all mobile
 communication generations 2g  3g                 and 4glte in the long term the aim is to avoid future investments
 and reduce operating costs in addition the 2g              network technology will be ipenabled thus meeting the future
 requirements of the fixed network allip 


 updating 3g base stations

 we were able to successfully complete the ultrasite swap upgrade project in september 2011 we replaced the
 outdated 1st generation 3g           technology at around 3100 base stations with the latest generation of efficient
 system technology in addition to improving data transmission which made it possible to activate hspa with a
 bandwidth of 42 mbits throughout germany we were able to save around 8000 kwh of power each year per
 base station the project resulted in overall savings of 248 gwhyear


 best power project

 the highspeed vdsl            network is based on fiber optic cables individual network components are bundled in
 cabinets recognizable as the gray boxes found throughout the city in order to further increase the energy
 efficiency of the technology contained in the cabinets and to minimize performance loss we initiated the best
 power project in 2011

 the focal point of the pilot project is selecting the most effective network devices and increasing the energy
 efficiency of our system technology we plan to reduce our co2 emissions as well as our operating costs with
 the energy reduction the project is expected to generate official results will not be available until a field test has
 been conducted in late 2013 since a subproject of best power is being conducted in connection with the desi
 project


 power off task force

 in 2011 we were able to shut down unnecessary technical systems with a wattage of overall 4286 kw due to

 measures implemented by the power off task force the energy savings realized as a result are the equivalent
 of 16564 metric tons of co2 per year


 the power off task force at telekom deutschland analyzes which residual modules can be removed from the
 network with a reasonable effort and organizes the systematic dismantling of outdated systems

 the prompt dismantling of technical systems that are no longer needed helps to cut energy consumption
 considerably by dismantling these systems in 2011 telekom can save around 37 gwh in electrical energy
 consumption as well as other costs amounting to eur 8 million for electricity cooling and uninterrupted power
 supply each year in addition the measures freed up onetime investment resources in areas such as cooling
 and uninterrupted power supply totaling at around eur 84 million these will be used to accelerate the
 installation of new more energyefficient networks


 upgrading the mobile communications infrastructure at crnogorski telekom

 the montenegrin subsidiary crnogorski telekom began a program to upgrade its entire mobile communications
 infrastructure in mid2011 a pilot project in the city of bar in which all services were migrated over to a single
 platform yielded improvements to the network quality

home  networks  environmentally friendly network infrastructure  climate technology  energy use



climate technology  energy use
data centers produce a lot of heat and need to be cooled some 40 percent of the energy used by data centers is
used for cooling energyefficient climate technology offers significant reduction potential deutsche
telekomparticularly tsystemsconducts intensive research and development in order to optimize data center
infrastructures in consideration of financial and ecological aspects the group subsidiary power and air condition
solution management gmbh  co kg pasm is our partner in many of these projects

in terms of climate protection energy generation from renewable sources such as wind sun and water is an
important topic when it comes to data center operation that is why we develop and use smart solutions for the
employment of renewable energy

 heat power business project

 in collaboration with telekoms group facility management pasm launched the heat power business
 innovation project in december 2010 we operate ten minicogenerators with capacities ranging from 45 to 50
 kw at network nodes that are used by different parties the waste heat they produce is used to heat the
 buildings so that total usage of employed primary power is over 80 percent

 it was confirmed over the course of 2011 that the equipment can be operated in a way that is both efficient and
 environmentally friendly as was shown in a previous feasibility study after a startup phase the
 minicogenerators had generated around 1300 mwh of electricity and around 2000 mwh of heat by the end of
 the year we were able to reduce co2 emissions by around 310 metric tons in 2011 thanks to the
 minicogenerators after numerous adjustments of parameters had been made in the first quarter of 2011 the
 results of monitoring runtimes energy generation efficiency and cycle frequency confirmed the findings in the
 feasibility reports that had been conducted previously

 we were able to save even more by reducing the standby times of installed largescale heating systems
 thanks to the new minicogenerators we can now provide heat efficiently during periods of moderate heating
 requirements thereby improving overall efficiency minicogeneration enabled us to save natural gas equivalent
 to120 mwh at our heating station in regensburg alone

 as part of the project we are planning to analyze all of the network nodes used by several mobile
 communications providers to review the possible use of cogenerator technology in 2012


 the development and use of energyefficient air conditioning systems for data centers is a central element of the
 pasm power and air condition solution management gmbh  co kg product portfolio pasm a telekom
 subsidiary manufactures and markets complete energybased solutions for technical systems for corporate
 customers especially for companies from the information and telecommunications industry pasm considers it
 its responsibility to constantly improve the energy efficiency of availability products comprised of uninterruptible
 power supply and cooling for network nodes
 its energybased products are used by telekom deutschland and tsystems deutschland in the fixed network
 and data centers pasm also provides its products to around 20000 base station control systems and mobile
 switching centers of telekom deutschlands mobile network

kpi review cooperation with strabag

pasm defined various kpis from august to november 2011 in consultation with our group facility management
the kpis will be used to measure the energy consumption of facilities used by several parties in relation to the
amount of occupied office space we reviewed these kpis on test facilities in collaboration with experts from
strabag property and facility services in 2011 we plan to develop strategies in 2012 to introduce energy
management systems once the tests have been evaluated


energy efficiency means climate protection pasm uses efficiency indicators to monitor efficiency improvements
at around 8000 network nodes and data centers in germany pasm commissioned the property and facility
services pfs unit of the construction company strabag to conduct onsite analyses of its production
systems as part of its top 100 program each year the 100 most energyinefficient buildings are identified and
analyzed under the program strabag pfs engineers analyze energy efficiency potential and develop
solutions as to how to effectively exploit this potential pasm has been able to significantly increase energy
efficiency in the past few years by replacing inefficient fans installing innovative control units or adjusting the
systems to current demand the energy efficiency indicator pue for telekom deutschlands fixed network not
including data centers was down to 153 in 2009 from over 175 in 2005 that is the equivalent of a reduction in
greenhouse gas emissions of around 92000 metric tons of co2 equivalents per year


desi projectendtoend energysensitive ict

pasm has been working together with telekom innovation laboratories tlabs  and deutsche telekom to
test solutions for new smart energy sources since middecember 2011 the purpose of the project is to develop
a system for load adaptive control and to test concepts for generating and storing energy this is one of the key
foundations for smart grids

we are testing ways to manage peak loads and optimize purchases within this context we took the first steps
during the reporting period by using outdated backup supply systems as interim storage for excess solar energy
in the past these systems were kept constantly charged but almost never used to feed energy back into the
network in the smart grid project at tcity friedrichshafen we were able to achieve load adaptive control at least
to a certain extent the batteries were not only used as backup for power outages but also to operate the
systems the batteries were charged during electricity generation peaks and used during times when power
supply in the public grid was scarce which reduced costs and helped maintain network stability buffering
energy and the resulting increase in network stability is an important contribution that telekom is making toward
establishing renewable energy sources because storing energy is an essential factor in being able to utilize
solar and wind energy which are subject to heavy fluctuation additional equipment such as emergency power
supply systems cooling equipment and lithiumion batteries will be incorporated into the system analyzed and
then tested in reallife situations in 2012 in order to realize additional advancements in saving costs and
increased availability we will be using a selfoptimizing tlab software for this


solutions for implementing smart grids have been one of the big technology goals for the past few years in the
project desi end toend energysensitive ict which is sponsored by the german federal ministry for
economics and technology as part of the it2green research focus pasm has been working on developing an
overall approach in collaboration with telekom innovation laboratories tlabs and telekom deutschland that
integrates the entire ict supply chain the project was initiated by tlabs      and telekom deutschland and is
scheduled to be carried out between 2011 and 2013

the desi approach focuses on three core areas

   creating ict component connectability in smart grids
   integrating ict components into the entire energy supply chain
   control of variable energy supply for ict networks

participants in the desi project are also looking at how the ict network power supply can meet the main
requirements of a smart grid such as load shifts and supply stabilization by controlling energy storage finding a
solution to this problem is basically the first stage in developing a smart grid control system

initial smart grid solutions are being employed at tcity friedrichshafen


lola project for loadadaptive networks

loadadaptive smart grid control holds reduction potential of around 30 percent when it comes to energy
consumption and co2 emissions this applies to the network infrastructure as well as customer use of ict
products which we were able to prove in test beds during the reporting period

many of todays ict devices and systems require a consistent power supply as long as they are switched on
regardless of what they are actually being used for in the lola load adaptive networks  lans project
participants are identifying and studying usage case examples in which energy consumption can be adjusted to
fit actual use both for access networks as well as customer home networks for example energy consumption in
our business customers corporate networks can be reduced by up to 30 percent with the right features telekom
deutschlands and tsystems business customer sales departments teamed up to pilot these products and
offered them at cebit        2012

other results in the area of access networks show that it is possible to reduce energy consumption by up to 30
percent there as well that would mean reductions of 30 gwh per year we will be continuing to advance and
pilot the project in 2012

we have been working in collaboration with international system manufacturers since 2010 to develop the
technology and to standardize loadadaptive systems internationally in order to create energyefficient global
market products that anyone can purchase

as a member of the international telecommunication union itu telekom was instrumental in developing the
new standardization of low power mode l2 mode in 2011


unlike traditional systems which require a basically constant supply of energy throughout the day loadadaptive
ict networks adjust their energy needs to actual use which is subject to extreme fluctuations load adaptation
means that parts of the production systems can be shut down gradually or all at once during lowusage times
such as at night or in the early morning hours that reduces energy consumption considerably the lola
project explores how smart control systems can reduce energy consumption in networks and end devices the
project is initially focusing on customer networks and the access network the longterm goal is smart
endtoend control along the entire network architecture initial model analyses and lab measurements indicate
an estimated total energy and co2 reduction potential of around 30 percent another goal is to promote
international standardization the project is scheduled to run from october 2010 to december 2012 we already
have initial results for corporate networks and broadband access networks


comgreen loadadaptive optimization of radio access networks

the energy consumption in radio access networks is steadily increasing this is due to the network expansion
and also to the increasing capacity demands of mobile users telekom operates tens of thousands of base
stations and wifi hotspots in germany which have a total annual energy consumption in the threedigit
gigawatt hours range until now these networks have been operated regardless of their usage the same
amount of energy has been used no matter whether the load is high or low

the purpose of the comgreen project is to ensure contextbased network adjustment that provides users of
telecommunications networks with exactly the right amount of transmission capacity needed rather than the
maximum capacity that was previously supplied in order to achieve this an architecture for the selforganized
and contextbased adaptation alignment of the network parameters will be developed so that network
resources can be switched on and off depending on the load

initial results from the project show that loadadaptive intelligent network control holds a saving potential of
around 30 percent when it comes to energy consumption and co2 emissions in addition the project will serve to
develop concepts that will be submitted to international standardization committees the mediumterm aim is to
integrate the concepts and mechanisms in the network nodes via the manufacturers


pasm in clean power net

during the reporting period pasm continued to be a committed member of the clean power net competence
network and was actively involved in drafting user requirements and technical specifications in 2012


getting a new technology ready for the market often requires the joint efforts of many players from business
politics and science as a cofounder and partner of the german clean power net competence network the
group subsidiary pasm is driving the development of marketable fuel cells the clean power net initiative was
founded in october 2010 by the bavarian state government in cooperation with now national organization for
fuel cells and hydrogen systems as well as fuel cell users and manufacturers


program for hydrogen and fuel cell technology in germany

pasm had planned to set up a selfsufficient energy mobile base station at the hanover trade fair grounds in
2011 under the german federal governments national innovation program for hydrogen and fuel cell
technology the project could not be put into practice because of extensive delays in getting permits and
because one project partner withdrew completely

in the meantime we have already begun operating five fuel cell systems we will continue to test the efficiency of
these fuel cells within the context of the german innovation project we will be focusing in particular on using the
fuel cells as a backup system and to manage peak loads and on identifying ways to incorporate the fuel cells into
a virtual power plant


energyefficient systems for cold aisle containment

we began using the particularly energyefficient cold aisle containment system for telekoms allip       platform in
july 2011 the system prevents the mixing of cool fresh air and warm waste air at data centers and network
nodes cold air is used directly to cool the equipment planners from telekom deutschland pasm and the
strabag construction group contributed their experience to the project the results of the datacenter 2020
project were also assessed in terms of controlling airflow volumes as well as air intake and outlet we installed

 temperature sensors in the cold aisle based on the results and successfully integrated the system into the
 current infrastructure at two hamburg pilot sites between june 2011 and july 2011 we will be using this solution
 in future plans for our ip       platform

 datacenter 2020

 we have been operating the datacenter 2020 test data center together with intel since september 2009

 datacenter 2020 is based on the open source principle the results of our joint efforts will be published and can
 then be used by all interested parties we conducted some 200 events with around 10 participants each during
 the reporting period where we presented and discussed ways to optimize energy consumption at data centers

 in an initial project phase which was conducted from 2008 to 2010 researchers reduced energy consumption
 using relatively simple solutions they optimized the airflow by sealing leaks in the raised floor and insulating the
 cold air areas cold aisle containment to prevent the mixture of cold and warm air as a result the fan speed of
 the circulating air coolers could be reduced to 30 percent and energy consumption of the fans was down to 10
 percent the researchers increased the temperature in the system and the difference between intake and outlet
 temperatures they also raised the water intake temperature of the cooling unit these measures make the
 cooling unit considerably more energyefficient and reduce its operation times

 reliable operation requires an uninterrupted power supply the studies showed that this is needed less than
 previously expected thanks to the separation of cold and warm air measurements from 2011 show that the
 energy density or electric power per module or rack can be increased three times over from 55 kw to up to
 175 kw computer availability and reliability remained as high as before despite the power increase the
 researchers achieved a pue power usage effectiveness value of 123 as a result of the optimization measures

 we initiated additional tests in 2012 test results show that higher energy densities of over 20 kw per rack are
 manageable as well we are also looking into the use of hot aisle containment it load control and the energy
 density this requires is another option to optimize data center operations as a whole which is currently explored
 by researchers


 tsystems is operating the datacenter 2020 jointly with intel at euroindustriepark in munich at datacenter
 2020 we are testing solutions that enable more energy and costefficient data center operation to benefit the

environment and the climate the two partners work on developing pioneering business models and new
costefficient ict solutions for users and customers

one of the project partners milestones is to achieve a pue power usage effectiveness value of 13
the pue value is the most important indicator of data center energy efficiency it compares the entire amount of
energy used for data center operation with the amount of energy consumed by the computers the average pue
value at tsystems international and pasm data centers is 175 that means that 175 kw of power needs to be
supplied to the data center for every kilowatt of power the servers need telekoms goal is to decrease this value
for new fixed network data centers to 14 and for existing data centers to 16 by 2020 we have already achieved
a pue value of 123 at datacenter 2020

experts found a number of surprisingly simple solutions when looking for optimal energy efficiency in data center
setup and operation for example the pue value can be significantly improved by strictly separating hot and
cold air additionally experts found that it was not necessary to cool the room temperature down to 22c as is
common temperatures of up to 27c do not have a negative effect on computing performance however the
right location the type of energy supply and the distance to the customers who order computing capacities are
important factors tsystems plans to take these results into account when building or restructuring data centers


data center optimization project

we launched the data center optimization project in collaboration with pasm in august 2011 to optimize the
infrastructure of our data centers in germany the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012 the
first step will be to analyze planned reductions in a second step we will check whether the project can be
technically implemented at three pilot sites

the data center optimization project includes around 16 measures per data center to reduce energy costs and
will be conducted at 15 data centers


consolidating data centers at tht hrvatski telekom

in 2011 tht hrvatski telekom migrated all applications and data to new standardized data centers within the
scope of the data center consolidation project processes used at the former tmobile data centers in zagreb
were introduced at tht hrvatski telekoms new data center which went into operation in 2001 and two older
sites were closed

the croatian subsidiary also built a new next generation data center based on the technology concepts of
dynamic data centers and cloud computing in addition the company consolidated the server infrastructure
which is based on the unix and x86 operating systems and the local area and storage area networks
lansan

thanks to the new flexible infrastructure tht hrvatski telekom can distribute resources dynamically and
reduce energy consumption by allocating resources to designated subsystems such as oracle for example
the company was also able to migrate applications and data and consolidate all of the systems onto shared
platforms without limiting system operation

basics for product development  product design
changing consumer behavior is an important stepping stone in creating a sustainable society according to the
german federal environment agency private households are responsible for around 40 percent of greenhouse gas
emissions in germany this means that responsible consumer decisions can make a big difference when it comes
to protecting the climate and the environment

telekom considers it its responsibility to make it easier for its customers to practice sustainable consumption by
providing them with as many environmentallyfriendly products as possible we are increasingly compensating for
unavoidable co2 emissions by neutralizing our carbon footprint

 sustainable product portfolio program

 the systematic creation and expansion of our climatefriendly product and service offerings is a decisive step
 toward achieving our goal of becoming a cr leader by 2015 in 2010 we initiated the sustainable product
 portfolio program which is scheduled to run until 2012 we work to help our customers lead a sustainable
 lifestyle with attractive products of high ethical and environmental quality we also want to increase customer
 satisfaction and minimize the social and environmental impact of our products

 we conducted an extensive customer survey during the reporting period to find out what customers think about
 the sustainability of telekoms offers we also evaluated consumer tests results will be used in product
 development

 cr report from the previous year


 the cr department collaborates with other departments such as product  innovation sales and procurement
 within the scope of the sustainable product portfolio program the program plays a key role in the achievement
 of our cr goal leading the way because it integrates sustainability into our core corporate processes

 we plan to achieve the following results with the program by the end of 2012

    defining criteria that determine the sustainability of products
    incorporating sustainability into productrelevant core processes and objectives
    preparing employees for resulting changes
    implementing an evaluation process
    creating a cr key performance indicator kpi for sustainable products
    improving customer communication on the topic of sustainability

 that involves the strategic goal of increasing customer trust in the brand so that our customers perceive
 deutsche telekom as a sustainable company this will help us set ourselves apart from our competitors and
 position ourselves as a premium brand

climate and environmentally friendly products  services
we are helping millions of consumers and business customers effectively lower their energy consumption and
reduce co2 emissions with our growing offer of green products and innovative ict solutions

 trend sustainable mobile online services

 whether you use them to do online banking buy tickets online or check your electricity and heating costs on the
 go there are many ways to use smartphones to consume intelligently and improve the sustainability of your
 lifestyle people below the age of 30 are particularly attracted to these services as shown in a survey conducted
 by the german market research company tns infratest and commissioned by telekom in 2011 48 percent of
 those surveyed welcomed the chance to buy tickets online and 44 percent said they would like to be able to use
 their smartphone to check their electricity and heating costs 44 percent would also like to be able to access
 green product information using the product barcode 2000 households with internet access were surveyed


 platform for climate compatible consumption in germany

 deutsche telekom has been participating in the product carbon footprint pcf project since 2008 the
 projects online platform was revamped as a dialog platform for climatefriendly consumption and carbon
 footprinting methods during the reporting period in order to promote climatefriendly consumption beyond the
 idea of limiting consumption altogether the platform for climate compatible consumption in germany pkkd
 is available to companies and stakeholders from all industries both in germany and internationally it provides
 extensive information and advice on reducing emissions along the supply chain based on the experiences of
 participating companies it also gives other companies and stakeholders the chance to communicate their own
 progress in this area activities to further develop the pkkd are scheduled to continue until 2013 workshops
 and dialog forums on key topics such as using renewable energy in the production process and how they affect
 the pcf are offered as well on a regular basis the aim is to encourage discussion throughout the society and
 make a contribution to pursuing climatefriendly consumption together in a coordinated manner

 cr report from the previous year


 products and services generate co2 emissions throughout their entire life cycle from production and use to
 disposal these emissions can be illustrated using the co2 footprint product carbon footprint  pcf
 information about this can help our customers make more sustainable purchase decisions

 pcf project creating co2 calculation standards
 until now there is no generally recognized method for calculating productrelated co2 footprints that is why
 deutsche telekom has been participating with eight other companies in the product carbon footprint project
 since 2008 the project was founded by the thema 1 initiative and is being conducted in collaboration with
 ökoinstitut ev the world wide fund for nature wwf and the potsdam institute for climate impact
 research telekom is also involved in other initiatives to develop industrywide standards such as the
 greenhouse gas ghg protocol initiative

product carbon footprint policy

in 2008 deutsche telekom began developing a method for pcf calculation based on international standards in
cooperation with ökoinstitut ev the iso 1404044 life cycle standard the greenhouse gas protocol and the
international telecommunication union itu guidelines are being taken into account in this process we initially
calculated the co2 footprint of our products call  surf comfort in 2010 and entertain in 2011 to test the
methods effectiveness
the goal is to increase internal competence when it comes to comprehensively assessing the sustainability of
our product portfolio we are also developing internal standards for a method to expand our emissions reporting
to include scope 3


improving router carbon footprints

telekom deutschland and telekom innovation laboratories tlabs  are constantly working to reduce co2
emissions throughout the network infrastructures entire life cycle this also includes realizing reduction potential
in the customers infrastructure we are for example working on the development of a load adaptive operation
mode in order to make operation of routers more energy efficient and reduce co2 emissions feasibility tests are
scheduled for completion in 2013 and will then be standardized


the load adaptive mode makes sure that full power is only available to routers when they are actually being
used thereby making them more energy efficient this mode can be used by the customer onsite as well as in
the telekom network infrastructure by developing this innovation we are taking steps to fulfill our voluntary
commitment to gradually reducing network infrastructure energy consumption which we made when we signed
the european code of conduct on energy consumption of broadband equipment


lowenergy speedphones

the phones from our speedphone series which has been available at stores since 2012 help our customers
reduce energy use the phones communicate directly with a router without needing their own base station in
addition to improved voice quality doing away with a base station as is the case with the speedphone 50 for
example reduces energy consumption by more than one third this effect is somewhat reduced however due to
the higher performance of models with a touchscreen or wlan such as the speedphone 700


new download portals in germany and croatia

the pageplace online kiosk has been providing a broad user group with a way to conveniently read digital books
magazines and newspapers on tablets smartphones and computers since june 2011

with its planet9 service which was launched in july 2011 the hungarian subsidiary tht hrvatski telekom has
made it possible for its customers to buy ebooks the books can be downloaded on computers ereaders and
smartphones


climatefriendly download portals

telekom neutralized the carbon footprint of another download portal pageplace in march 2011 thereby

increasing the amount of co2 emissions compensated for by the end of the year to a total of 855 metric tons

according to calculations telekoms load offers  gamesload musicload softwareload videoload and
pageplace  will generate an estimated 592 metric tons of co2 by the end of 2012 we offset these emissions
by investing in the biomass energy in brazil project

cr report from the previous year


telekoms download portals generate around 80 percent less co2 emissions than retail stores however new
co2 emissions are also generated by providing these portals by neutralizing the carbon footprint of our
download portals stepbystep we help our customers to opt for green consumption we provide information on
the topic at wwwgruenerdownloadde


online billingenvironmentally friendly and convenient

more than 15 million customer bills from the telekom in germany are sent every month for this reason the
number of electronically sent bills came to more than 50 percent for the first time alternatively customers can
also access their data on the online customer portal because online billing comes as a standard service for new
accounts and new customers can only switch to paper invoices on request the number of people using online
billing is constantly growing

online billing in poland
the polish subsidiary ptc has been offering online billing to consumers since 2007 the company is advertising
online billing with free minutes and attractive prize draws the number of users rose to several hundred
thousand within just a few months the number of online bills sent out exceeded the 10million mark in
november 2011 customers can either download their bills themselves or receive them via email

tmobile netherlands and slovak telekom
around 85 percent of the customers at tmobile netherlands were using online billing at the end of december
2011 online billing has been a standard service feature for fixedline and mobile customers at slovak telekom
since august 2011 and most customers activate it when they sign up for service by the end of december 2011
some 30 percent of customers were using online billing the company advertised the feature during the reporting
period with a number of activities such as placing posters in stores
slovak telekom also keeps tabs on how many trees were saved by using online billing and then posts these
figures online as of december 2011 the calculated number of trees saved had already come to 5956

ad campaigns in croatia greece and montenegro
at the moment few tht hrvatski telekom customers use online billing the croatian subsidiary is planning to
offer their customers advantages such as discounts and service offers as of mid2012 and expects the number
of users to grow as a result

the bulgarian company globul a subsidiary of the cosmote group has already taken this approach every new
customer who opts for paperfree billing receives a discount of 2 percent off their monthly fee for the first six
months the paperfree billing procedure was first introduced in 2009 an average 344 percent of postpaid
customers took advantage of this service in 2011

the montenegrin subsidiary crnogorski telekom is also advertising online billing and plans to continue these
activities in 2012 13 percent of the companys customers were using online billing by the end of 2011

cr report from the previous year

switching to online billing saves a lot of paper as well as water energy and other resources needed to produce
paper

whats more using online billing does away with the transportation involved in delivering paper bills thereby
considerably reducing co2emissions according to a study by ökoinstitut ev the institute for applied ecology
paper bills are five times more harmful to the environment than online bills

life cycle assessment of online billing compared to paper billing


more than 4 million customers use the device rental service

telekom deutschland offers its customers a device rental service once the rental period ends the devices are
serviced professionally or recycled this service was expanded in 2011 to include our current router and media
receiver models and in early 2012 our new speedphones more than 4 million customers had decided to use
the rental service by the end of 2011

cr report from the previous year


telekom deutschlands device rental service which was offered for the first time in 2009 helps reduce
electronic waste customers can lease devices such as dsl routers and media receivers for the time period of
their choice with no minimum term of contract customers return the devices once the rental period is over
necessary repairs are made and some of the devices can then be reused as replacement devices
thanks to the device service package customers no longer throw away their devices at home or just keep them
laying around in the basement for years instead those devices are reused immediately or properly disposed of
this makes valuable raw materials available to the raw materials market


demail helps to save up to 50000 metric tons of co2 each year

a study conducted in 2010 and 2012 shows that deutsche telekoms electronic demail service can reduce co2
emissions by up to 50000 metric tons each year compared to traditional postal mail services we have been
testing demail since october 2009 at tcity friedrichshafen the germanywide launch began at cebit             in
march 2012 since this date operation of the technical platform for demail has been carbonneutral which
means it is not generating any additional co2 emissions


electronic communication between private individuals companies and government agencies is increasingly
rapidly that means increased risk when it comes to data privacy telekoms demailsystem for encrypting
electronic data provides the highest level of security and confidentiality for email correspondence with the
corresponding law passed at the end of february 2011 demail became legally valid and was given the same
legal status as postal deliveries that means that not only does telekoms service help customers save
considerably when it comes to time and costs it also provides them with an environmentally friendly alternative
to paperbased mail


videomeet video conferencing without investment

video conferencing can replace business trips and therefore has the potential to reduce a considerable amount
of co2 emissions telekom presented the first crossplatform video conferencing solution with its videomeet
product in november 2011 the solution allows participants to dial in using various services and devices the

online service bridges the gap between costintensive corporate applications and mass market services and can
also be used with any videocompatible devices such as smartphones without the user having to download
additional software users can also dial into conferences using their cell phone or fixedline phone the service
which was developed in collaboration with the californiabased startup blue jeans network complies with high
security standards it will initially be sold in germany austria and the united kingdom and then throughout
europe

we have been compensating for the co2 emissions generated by using telekoms traditional video conferencing
solutions since 2009 in this way we compensated for 970 metric tons of co2 from january 1 to december 31
2010

cr report from the previous year


according to a study conducted by idc a leading provider of market data for the ict industry video
conferences already replace one business trip out of ten the world wide fund for nature wwf estimates
that the emission of an additional 28 million metric tons of co2 could be avoided if every fourth business meeting
was done via video conferencing

green conferencing systems
for several years telekom has enabled its customers to reduce co2 emissions and costs by using telephone
web and video conferencing technology all web conferences are easy to book and manage online via the
conference portal our customers can use an online efficiency calculator to calculate their co2 reduction
potential


progress in telepresence rollout

in 2011 we continued to roll out our telepresence video conferencing system which we launched in 2010 with
20 new systems the service is now available at over 75 locations in germany at around a third of which the
service can be booked in public spaces such as at hotels and conference centers we introduced an online
booking system for the service during the reporting period
we were not able to achieve our goal of providing the video conferencing system at over 1000 locations
worldwide by the end of 2011 the delay was partly caused by technical problems that should be remedied by
mid2012 international collaboration agreements will have to be signed with other network providers

cr report from the previous year


we launched the sale of the new telepresence service in germany in september 2010 the service offers top
video and audio quality and creates a personal meeting atmosphere despite the distance between the
participants by providing the service telekom gives customers one more reason to cut back on business trips
and thereby reduce co2 emissions


cloud computing

cloud computing     is based on the principle of outsourcing it applications and infrastructure to a virtual cloud
software and data are no longer processed on the office computer but in an external infrastructure such as the
tsystems data centers deutsche telekoms corporate customers arm offers its customers software and
computing services online and on demand for example with deutschlandlan deutschlandlan won first place
in the category of virtual pabxs in a vote by readers of the specialist magazine connect in 2011

cloud computing       for consumers as of 2011
telekom in germany has been giving consumers access to cloud computing since september 2011 by bundling
different services such as email music download video on demand and storage under telekom cloud which is
managed centrally on the companys servers the launch was accompanied by an information and promotional
campaign central data processing uses much less energy than processing data on customers home computers

the telekomcloud media center once again received the tüv certified online service seal in july 2011 data
privacy and security are at the heart of the certification process the media center has received the certification
which must be renewed each year for two years in a row the telekom cloud was also named test champion
among the various cloud systems in the 22012 issue of computerbild german computer magazine

tht hrvatski telekom as a cloud computing pioneer
in late june 2011 tht hrvatski telekom became the first provider in croatia to offer a version of cloud
computing that was unique in europe at that time customers can use the tcloud computer product to access all
of their services and applications from any device from anywhere and via any network the service was
developed primarily for business customers who now no longer need to buy their own hardware such as storage
media or workstations enabling them to save on costs and resources

in 2010 tht hrvatski telekom acquired combis the leading provider of systems integration in croatia and
converted the workplaces of more than 10000 customers throughout the country to cloud computing that
makes tht hrvatski telekom the largest provider of these types of services in croatia and the surrounding
region cloud computing     gives customers the advantage of higher computer capacity and data security at
lower operating costs and over a longer device life cycle


data centers of the future efficient and environmentally friendly
bundling computer services at central data centers for cloud computing places high demands on tsystems
infrastructure the data center of the future needs to be energyefficient secure and fast as well as costefficient
in every way

tsystems and intel have been jointly researching the energy savings potential of data centers in the
datacenter 2020 project since 2009 innovative technologies are being used at a test center in munich to reduce
the energy consumption of servers for example datacenter 2020 also provides important information on how to
manage highperforming computers so that they produce less co2


managed document services

with managed document services tsystems customers can reduce their consumption of paper and energy by
transferring all or part of their processes into a digital workflow all documents are not only fed into the
customers digital workflow but also saved to a tamperproof archive


in germany companies run more than 800000 metric tons of paper through their printers each year and the
number is growing but with sustainable business on the agenda we should notice a downward trend with
regard to paper consumption

with its managed document services tsystems handles the entire document process from digitalizing and
archiving documents to sending them on as an email letter or webpage all documents are also archived in
compliance with regulatory requirements for this managed document services use a certified electronic
signature and meet statutory requirements including the german federal ministry of finances grundsätze zum
datenzugriff und zur prüfbarkeit digitaler unterlagen principles of data access and auditing of digital documents

 gdpdu

 the archiving solution encompasses sap various document management systems billing archives and digital
 personnel files at the end of the process the outgoing mail can be distributed in any desired output format for
 example invoices are sent on to customers in printed form or as an email attachment or they are made
 available on an online portal by managed document services here customers can view their invoices and
 download them as required in most cases the documents are automatically printed and dispatched for all
 outgoing letters faxes and emails managed document services uses customized layout standards in
 accordance with the individual customers requirements


 new highly efficient products and services

 telekom continued to expand its offer of energyefficient dect phones during the reporting period many of
 todays fixedline devices come with an extraefficient power supply unit that reduces the customers energy
 consumption considerably

 we incorporated environmental criteria into the design of our new entertain boxes and integrated access
 devices iad as well we lowered the amount of harmful substances in the materials used to below the legally
 required thresholds by placing the respective requirements on our suppliers we only use the most
 environmentally friendly plastics and coatings power consumption did not increase considerably despite a
 significant increase in performance levels and we plan to reduce it to far below the already low consumption
 levels stipulated by the european ecodesign directive


 carbonneutral shipment via gogreen

 in germany we started to use gogreen the carbonneutral shipping offering of deutsche post to ship all of our
 standard parcels in 2008 we were able to offset a total of 121 metric tons of co2 in 2011 for the shipment of
 tonline shop parcels alone

cr report from the previous year


around twothirds of all german residents have a total of 83 million old or unused cell phones in their homes a
15 percent increase compared with 2010 this figure is based on a study that was carried out by the german
industry association bitkom in december 2011 these old cell phones could be used in other areas they also
contain valuable raw materials including metals such as gold silver and copper that could be recycled

metals and ores are often extracted under conditions that are problematic for people and the environment
because of this it is very important to collect reuse and recycle old communications devices some of the cell
phones returned by customers can be reused after making a few repairs and deleting all personal data people
in asia or africa for example are then able to purchase fully functioning cell phones at lower prices defective
devices and cell phones that require extensive repairs or data deletion are recycled

child safety product package at slovak telekom

in response to the results of a study published by the organization eslovensko in 2009 slovak telekom
launched a new range of child safety products in 2011 the study showed that 27 percent of parents in slovakia
did not care what their kids were doing online 64 percent of the children said that their family did not have any
rules for using the internet

based on the study slovak telekom became the first slovakian telephone company in march 2011 to offer a
prepaid sim card giving parents control over how their children use smartphones parents can use the card to
block all inappropriate content and services on the slovak telekom portal and the websites of partner platforms
in august 2011 slovak telekom launched child safety software for online access via fixedline connections and
mobile broadband connections in october the company integrated additional applications into prepaid cards

mobile payment without subscription or cost traps

to protect our customers and increase customer trust in mobile payment the four german mobile network
providers established the valueadded services competence center in august 2011 the purpose of the center
is to guarantee high standards when it comes to the security and transparency of digital mobile valueadded
services a new quality standard for the online billing of paid subscription services such as ring tones games
and sweepstakes was introduced in january 2012

as of mid2012 customers will also be able to check speed dial numbers and get information on the relevant
provider at httpwwwmehrwertdienstekompetenzde20html this will give them more transparency regarding
the services they use we are currently working on other measures for mobile use of the internet


again and again customers unintentionally sign up for subscriptions online that are then invoiced in their cell
phone bill providers do not always list prices and subsequent costs with enough clarity


that is why the valueadded services competence center focuses primarily on developing and establishing
standardized payment templates it requires all providers of webbased services to provide important information
such as prices possible subscription durations and cancellation periods users must twice confirm that they
have read this information the participating companies have been praised by politicians and consumer
protection authorities alike for their collaboration which is being fully rolled out in the first half of 2011


phone and internet use throughout the eu for a flat rate

mobile surfing abroad often leads to unexpectedly high costs for customers that is why we introduced a

completely new data roaming model travelsurf on july 1 2011 at almost all european subsidiaries it
provides standardized reasonable rates throughout the eu for mobile phone and internet services beyond
country borders and can be conveniently booked via text message or online as soon as they enter their country
of destination customers are sent a text message informing them of the offer and inviting them to book it this
information also pops up on the landing page when they open their browser customers can then keep track of
the costs they accrue either online or via text message

protecting minors
the internet has become part of everyday life for children and young people according to a study that was
conducted by medienpädagogischer forschungsverband südwest media education association in southwest
germany mpfs in 2010 minors spend an average of 140 minutes online every day teenagers tend to be a little
bit too carefree when they are online

one of our highest priorities is to show children and teenagers how to use new media responsibly and to be safe
online deutsche telekoms approach is based on three pillars

   providing attractive and ageappropriate content with our ageappropriate websites and content such as the
    fragfinnde search engine and with our kidsportal which was launched in 2004 we are offering exciting and
    attractive content to children and teenagers
   promoting media skills we are promoting competent and selfconfident usage of the internet and mobile
    communications devices this is the only way for children and young people to learn how to recognize risks and
    stay within boundaries telekom is working with different groups and initiatives in this area as well
   offering customizable protection tools one essential element is offering appropriate protection measures
    with our childprotection software which was officially approved by the german commission for the protection of
    minors from unsuitable media content kjm in february 2012 telekom deutschland has been offering a reliable
    solution since 2003 during the reporting period we made significant technical changes to the software to make it
    even more reliable the software is now able to read the age rating details supplied on websites




    industrywide protection of minors initiative

    telekom developed the principles for the safer use of connected devices and online services by children and
    young people in the eu in collaboration with 25 european internet companies the principles were developed
    by the ict coalition for a safer internet for children and young people whose members include telcos device
    manufacturers and online service providers the members voluntarily commit themselves to adhere to the
    principles this was the first time that such an extensive coalition of companies that are active at all levels of the
    internet industry agreed to jointly make a longterm commitment to improving the protection of minors

    by the end of this year telekom will decide on a number of concrete measures in six different areas to support
    the companies commitment these should include

       providing safe content
       providing services to support parental control
       taking measures to promote safer internet use
       fighting the depiction of child abuse
       protecting user privacy
       providing training and education

    principles for the safer use of connected devices and online services by children and young people in the eu

extensive initiatives to protect minors in germany

close cooperation of all parties involved is crucial to pushing forward the protection of minors that is why
telekom relies on collaborations with partners from the worlds of business politics and society

dialog with federal and state governments in germany
since 2009 we have been participating in the multistakeholder dialog between the federal and state
administrations to enhance youth protection in germany the aim is to establish uniform standards and
guidelines and to initiate measures to communicate the topic and raise awareness deutsche telekom helped
develop the fsm selfclassification tool in 2011

media protection for minors integrated into product development process

protecting children and young people from damaging influences presented by the media is an important aspect
of product development at deutsche telekom the design principles which are mandatory throughout the group
have been in effect since 2009 these are based on the be responsible principle and specify that criteria for
protecting minors have to be taken into consideration even as early as in the product development phase


standards and ratings established by selfregulation institutions such as the freiwillige selbstkontrolle der
filmwirtschaft fsk the voluntary selfmonitoring association of the movie industry or unterhaltungssoftware
selbstkontrolle usk entertainment software selfregulation body are of particular importance these give
guidance to children young people and adults that is why deutsche telekom makes sure that all of its
distribution channels and internetpages comply with the age recommendations published by the selfmonitoring
institutions

we are currently looking at categorizing the content of our websites according to the new classification standard
of the freiwilligen selbstkontrolle multimediadiensteanbieter fsm the german association for the voluntary
selfmonitoring of multimedia service providers


online safety with child protection software

in february 2012 telekoms child protection software became one of the first two initiatives for the protection of

minors in germany to be recognized by the commission for the protection of minors from unsuitable media
content kjm almost nine years after the interstate treaty on the protection of human dignity and the
protection of minors in broadcasting and in telemedia went into effect the recognized version of the software is
expected to be available as a free download for all telekom fixedline customers by late march 2012

child and youth protection at ote
the greek subsidiary ote has been providing different child safety offers since 2009 as part of its extensive
online safety campaign these include a security packet with a firewall antivirus antispam and parental control
functions along with an advice column on the customer website
it also offered information events for children as of the end of 2010 on how to use the internet as well as events
for minors focusing on safety topics these events take place every two months in the ote museum for
telecommunications the company put on a play on the topic together with the young people

cr report from the previous year


telekoms child protection software helps parents regulate their childrens use of the internet by providing
features such as agebased filters for page content and time limits depending on the age they have selected
parents can block websites that have been programmed with a special age identification feature this gives
parents a reliable tool that they can use to keep their children safe

we have also been offering our own service forum on child protection software to promote online safety since
2008 the forum is hosted by the telekom team and offers a platform for discussion on current problems and
suggestions for improvement


initiatives and collaborations to protect young users

we work throughout the group toward promoting safe media use by minors and support numerous projects and
youth protection initiatives in our markets our basic approach takes national laws and specific local needs into
account the group subsidiaries individually decide where they want to focus their efforts for improving the
protection of young people online

effective protection of minors requires that we closely cooperate with stakeholders we worked to improve the
protection of young people in numerous initiatives and cooperation projects during the reporting period

 as a responsible company deutsche telekom considers it its obligation to take rigorous action against child
 pornography ie child abuse and its documentation

 deutsche telekom has been working with criminal prosecution authorities and ngos active in this area in
 germany and in other countries for some time now to ban such content from the internet

 deutsche telekom has been committing itself at an international level since 2007 to fighting the depiction of child
 abuse throughout europe within the scope of the european framework for safer mobile use by younger
 teenagers and children deutsche telekom has also been participating in the global mobile alliance against this
 type of content since 2008

customer satisfaction
as one of the worlds leading ict service providers we have the potential  and bear the responsibility  to enable
our customers to become sustainable consumers as a serviceoriented responsible company we feel obliged to
respond to their needs and expectations we have incorporated this commitment in our guiding principles which
apply throughout the group customer delight drives our action we develop innovative sustainable products that
are extremely reliable and easy to use thanks to intuitive interfaces

we have commissioned the independent external service provider tnsinfratest to use the trim method to
gauge customer satisfaction with systematic polls at all of our locations the findings are then integrated into our
management processes systematic complaints management activities also show us areas where further
improvement is needed

 trim results in 2011 increase in customer loyalty

 compared to the previous year the 2011 findings of the trim customer loyalty study showed an increase in
 customer loyalty of almost 6 percent we plan to improve these results in germany by 36 percent annually until
 the end of 2015

 cr report from the previous year


 the satisfaction of our customers is an indicator for our business success and is monitored by systematic
 surveys and management processes at all our sites around the world the standardized trim index is used to
 measure customer loyalty four times a year and provides us with data that is comparable throughout the group
 the index analyzes

    how our customers rate our performance
    the intention to remain with us and recommend us and
    our cutting edge over the competition

 the results are expressed as an indicator trim index


 trim 2010 customer loyalty program

 we established the loyalty forum at the beginning of 2010 as part of the trim 2010 program this
 crossfunctional committees goal is to develop and implement different types of customer loyalty measures and
 evaluate the results for example the corporate it department named the service orientation project one of its
 top 5 projects in 2011 to improve cooperation with our customers as well as service quality we held service
 workshops on this topic with around 100 employees midyear in collaboration with an external consulting firm

complaints management  customer care
dialog with our customers provides us with important feedback on our services critical feedback is particularly
valuable in showing us where we need to improve systematically evaluating customer queries and complaints
gives us the chance to identify and eliminate the causes and to achieve our aim of significantly reducing the number
of complaints

in order to encourage dialog we want our customers to be able to contact us quickly and easily via different
communication channels online inquiries are playing an increasingly important role more than 40 percent of all
service inquiries made to telekom deutschland can already be resolved online we were able to increase the use
of our online services considerably via social networks our customers can get advice quickly at no charge and
with no red tape on both twitter and facebook

 complaint figures for 2011 reduction of 18 percent

 compared to late 2010 we recorded 18 percent less complaints and repeat calls in the areas of fixedline and
 mobile communications at the end of 2011

 cr report from the previous year


 in 2009 the contact reduction project was launched in germany its original goal was to reduce complaints and
 repeat calls in the area of fixedline services for consumers by 20 percent the initial target is being constantly
 expanded in 2010 mobile services were included and in 2011 the project was expanded to include business
 customers as well we are planning on decreasing the number of complaints and repeat calls by 20 percent in
 each area
 all organizational units that have a direct or indirect influence on complaints are being included from sales and
 marketing to product management process management finance and technology


 improving business customer satisfaction

 telekom deutschland places much importance on improving the satisfaction of its business customers a focal
 point in 2011 was improving complaints management processes

 the reasons for this were insufficient satisfaction ratings in the fourth quarter of 2010 to improve these results
 we launched the vse complaints management initiative in early 2011 the goal of the initiative is to improve
 complaint services and prevent customers from having to contact the company unnecessarily thereby
 permanently improving customer satisfaction the satisfaction ratings from sme customers were a central focal
 point

 customer satisfaction with the complaint service has constantly improved since the initiative was launched in
 january 2011 compared to the previous year it was up to 15 acci after call customer interview points higher
 at the start of 2012 than at the end of 2010 however there is still much room for improvement when it comes to
 processing complaints that is why we are planning to introduce additional measures in 2012 within the scope of
 the initiative for example we introduced a new market research tool in january 2012 the tool will constantly

monitor relevant business processes at all of telekom deutschlands business customer areas and evaluate
these using standardized kpis


communication training for our service staff

our sales and technical service both use the wins information system it gives all employees who have
customer contact the opportunity to learn about the status of the service processes by having the information
available in the system for the customer it reduces the number of inquires and complaints over 10000 service
staff were trained in wins in 2011 customer communication plays a central role in this
wins provides our employees with a variety of processed information that can be be provided to the different
target groups it creates a uniform level of knowledge and provides a general sales approach which is
irrespective of the communication channel used by using wins employees have access to all the information
they need to complete their daily tasks it is divided into categories such as selling devices tariffs services iv
technology and other technical topics the content is structured uniformly which gives it a recognition value and
means that each task can be completed with just a few simple clicks


bundling customer service multimedia expertise

the growing spectrum of communication and entertainment products means increasing demands on the
customer service staffs ability to advise our customers telekom deutschland established a crossarea
multimedia service team of several hundred employees for this purpose in november 2011

the new structure combines online and fixedline service so that teams are able to rely on a broad range of
expert knowledge when helping customers decisive advantages of the new structure include a reduction in the
number of forwarded calls better availability and more flexibility when it comes to responding to fluctuating
workloads we are now also able to more effectively position new products and monitor product launches

research  innovation
innovation and the consistent enhancement of products and services are key elements for telekom in becoming a
global leader in connected life and work we are not content with just being stateoftheart we want to anticipate
new developments and help shape the future that is why we invest in wideranging research and development
activities in particular in the work of telekom innovation laboratories tlabs  formerly known as deutsche
telekom laboratories we are also committed to financing professorships and creating pioneering ideas in
cooperation with universities

health during the reporting period together these three new business areas are expected to generate around one
billion euros in revenue by the year 2015 we intend to become the number one partner of the health industry by
providing innovative health services

video video networking is the future




 expenditure in research and development

 research and development expenditure in the narrower sense relates to preproduction research and
 development such as the search for alternative products processes systems and services by contrast we do
 not class as research and development expenditure the costs of developing system and user software with the
 aim of increasing productivity

 in 2011 research and development expenditure of the group amounted to eur 121 million which is less than in
 the previous year as the parent company deutsche telekom ag bears part of the groups research and
 development expenditure at eur 48 million its expenditure was again lower than in the previous year down
 eur 17 million deutsche telekoms investments in internally generated intangible assets to be capitalized
 decreased by eur 398 million compared with the previous year these investments predominantly relate to
 internally developed software mainly for our germany operating segment as in the previous year over 2200
 employees were involved in projects and activities to create new products and market them more efficiently to
 customers the majority of employees working for tlabs  the unit responsible for resultsoriented research
 and innovation are researchers from a wide variety of disciplines

 during the reporting period telekom innovation laboratories tlabs  were reorganized into five areas the

home  customers  research  innovation  smart grids  smart metering



smart grids  smart metering
the use and decentralized generation of wind and solar energy pose a huge challenge to utility companies the
fluctuation of wind and sun power has an impact on electricity generation while voltage in the mains has to remain
stable what is more an increasing number of private households produce their own electricity for example by
using small cogeneration plants or photovoltaic systems the energy created has to be managed intelligently with
the help of stateoftheart ict in order to see the overall picture of this decentralized distribution network both in
technological and financial terms this requires a smart grid

smart grids help electricity providers to balance supply and demand and to keep voltage at a stable level in these
smart grids consumers represent virtual power plants of sorts that can be regulated up or down at short notice

in order for a smart grid to work properly a huge amount of data needs to be evaluated in real time for operators to
see when and where how much electricity is being generated and how much needs to be supplied smart metering
  provides the transparency necessary for this at tcity friedrichshafen we launched a smart metering service as
a pilot project in collaboration with utilities provider technische werke friedrichshafen in 2008 in this project we
have also been testing smart grid solutions for the ictbased integration of renewable energies we have also been
working with other municipal utilities providers and major energy suppliers on different projects dealing with smart
metering and smart grids one example is our collaboration with the technology group abb the joint project deals
with securing stability when feeding solar power into the grid

 smart grids and green ict at tlabs

 telekom innovation laboratories tlabs  is the central research and innovation unit of deutsche telekom
 several research and development projects explore the possibilities of how energy can be saved through the
 use of ict along with improving the energy efficiency of ict smart interaction between the ict network and the
 power grid are key in the development of smart grids

 flexible energy control through ict
 storage elements in ict networks make it possible to adjust energy supply flexibly depending on the load
 loaddependent control of network components offers additional flexibility for this the performance of different
 network areas needs to be adjusted to the required data transfer volume this is only possible if individual
 components can be shut down as needed without reducing overall performance of the network

 flexible control not only means less energy consumption but ictsupported modeling of electricity demand may
 also help to keep power grids stable in the future

 the lola loadadaptive networks  lans and desi endtoend energysensitive ict production projects
 are pursuing this goal with different focal points


 smart metering systems for your home

 pursuant to the third eu goods package from 2009 at least 80 percent of all utilities customers should be able
 to check their energy consumption on smart meters by 2020 the 2011 amendment to the german energy
 industry act energiewirtschaftsgesetz specifies that smart meters must be installed if consumption levels
 exceed 6000 kwh a year

 the act also sets forth strict data privacy and data security requirements in order to make smart metering more
 attractive for customers and to protect the critical energy supply infrastructure the deutsche telekom smart
 metering platform already meets these standards enabling connection of more than 90 meter types
 manufactured by some 20 different manufacturers telekom ensures maximum efficiency when it comes to
 system integration thereby reducing the overall cost of the smart meters


 at tcity friedrichshafen we have joined forces with the utilities provider technische werke friedrichshafen and
 have been offering a smart metering service in a pilot project since 2008 which we are continuously expanding
 the smart metering platform enables home owners meter operators sales companies and distribution network
 operators to offer this service to their customers at a reasonable rate it also allows end customers to check and
 control consumption levels more effectively in cooperation with energy companies such as eon and enbw
 deutsche telekom also offers solutions for a smart energyefficient home deutsche telekom provides a basic
 platform that enables energy providers to offer innovative services to their end customers

 intelligent use of decentralized energy sources
 smart metering      systems are a crucial element for climatefriendly energy supply for other reasons as well
 they provide utilities companies with important consumption data so that energy providers are able to adjust
 voltage to the actual demand and to use decentralized energy sources including private solar or cogeneration
 systems in order to compensate for co2 emissions generated by operating the smart metering platform
 deutsche telekom has been investing in a biomass project in brazil since november 2009


 smart meters at tmobile netherlands stores

 tmobile netherlands began equipping its stores and its mobile communications network with smart meters in
 december 2011 to enable the company to regularly measure consumption and better control its energy use the
 project is scheduled for completion in 2012

 was to standardize the sapbased data basis we are now able to determine how many employees with which
 skills we need by simulating and analyzing various estimates relating to factors such as demographic
 developments and future business demands this will help us make sure that we have the experts we need at
 the right time it also means that we can find alternative work options for our specialists as needed and total
 workforce management helps us meet our responsibility of providing longterm employment and creating
 interesting development opportunities for our employees we can make decisions regarding hr development
 the vocational training structure and the number of trainees and direct hires we will need in upcoming years as
 well as whether and how we can best realize new business models moreover we also incorporate services
 procured from freelancers or external service providers through offshoring for instance of course we involve
 employee representatives when making all of these decisions


 ongoing internationalization of the total workforce management approach

 we began working with the total workforce management approach in 20082009 in pilot areas at telekom for
 example for hr planning activities in germany one of our main aims was to look at the current skills profiles of
 the workforce and to compare it with future business demands we expanded the method in 2010 and 2011 by
 adding planning tools for the demographic and skillspecific workforce structure for example in order to optimize
 our continuing education budget and training policy we also introduced groupwide labor cost management 
 at the same time we embraced the twm approach in the entire group worldwide most international
 subsidiariesfor example in brazil malaysia mexico poland slovakia south africa the czech republic and
 hungarynow rely on defined twm procedures for strategic integrated hr planning we have introduced twm
 at more units since the beginning of 2012 eg in the ote group greece tht hrvatski telekom croatia
 and at our central innovation unit products  innovation

germany and under the group umbrella the same change has already been completed in croatia slovakia and
hungary

 streamlining business customer sales

 bundling accounting functions

 we are combining our accounting operations for europe and south africa in bratislava this is a successful
 example of constructive employee relations on a european level the european works council ewc received
 early notification and made comprehensive use of its consultation rights


 restructuring at ote group

 the crisis in greece means that the ote transformation is taking place in a very difficult economic and political
 atmosphere in spite of this situation and despite the restrictions of labor law and collective agreements dating
 from the time when ote was a nationalized company we have been able to make some important progress
 through a range of measuresincluding overtime reductions shorter working weeks with lower salaries as well
 as the training and transfer of employees from nonprofitable workplaces to new roleswe have been able to
 make substantial reductions to the high personnel costs


 tsystems act4service project

 tsystems has been working within the framework of a new business structure in germany since july 1 2011

 resultsbased focus


 tmobile usa adopts total workforce management approach

 on march 20 2011 deutsche telekom ag and att signed a contract for the sale of tmobile usa following
 the us authorities decisive stance against the transaction the sales agreement was canceled on december 19
 2011 in 2012 we will embark on qualitative hr planning for tmobile usa on the basis of total workforce
 management and initiate the necessary demandbased restructuring


 staff restructuring tools

 in order to make the necessary businessdriven personnel restructuring as fair and socially considerate as
 possible we use triedandtested tools that encourage employees to leave the company voluntarily in germany
 some of the most notable examples include early retirement for civil servants and the new provisions issued in
 the fall of 2011 on phased retirement for older employees employees outside collective agreements and senior
 executives the benefits granted by these provisions substantially surpass statutory norms we also assist
 employees who are interested in professional reorientation

 in recent years the measures promoting voluntary exits and the businesscentered reorganization of deutsche
 telekom have helped us improve productivity effectiveness and age structures in numerous areas particularly
 at tsystems and telekom deutschland at the same time we have reorganized sections within our shared
 services for example in human resources accounting and viventoand further improved quality and
 efficiency as a result we will be continuing this process in other administrative areas in the years to come


 viventosuccessful work in 2011

 one of viventos most urgent tasks as a service provider for socially acceptable workforce downsizing is to offer
 employees alternative employment prospects in good timein the public as well as the private sector in 2011
 we provided around 6900 employees in germany with alternative employmentexternally and internally more
 than 3100 of them are working temporarily in the public sector and over 200 employees have found a new
 permanent position in the public sector we secured new publicsector partners for interamt the employment
 portal we launched for the public sector and made the portal even more attractive for employers and applicants

home  employees  competitive workforce  health management



health management
requirements on our employees and executives are increasing in many areas of the company as a caring
employer we want to be proactive in countering any possible physical and mental overload we have already
attained a recognized high standard in health and safety at work and environmental protection and we are
constantly working to improve further this is shown by awards such as the corporate health award 2010 and
certificates granted in 2011 to business areas responsible for the international groupwide health safety 
environmental management system

 international health safety and environmental management with high
 standards

 we support the groupwide concept of occupational safety and health with a standardized international health
 safety and environmental management system hse ms by the end of 2011 we had introduced it in 13
 german and international group companies its introduction in other national companies has already begun or is
 being planned with this step we have laid the foundation for defining consistent global standards for
 occupational health and safety the system is based on the international ohsas 18001  iso 14001             and
 iso 9001       standards for occupational safety and health environmental protection and quality plans include
 minimum standards for hygiene first aid and medical activities in a crisis we have also defined standard
 indicators such as the number of days absent from work by defining minimum standards and the corresponding
 indicators we intend to create not only greater transparency and better comparability at an international level
 but also use these as the basis for our longterm pandemic care plan with this plan we specifically intend to
 protect our employees to the greatest extent possible this will also allow us to maintain the global
 telecommunications infrastructure in a crisis


 components of health management

 the most important components of telekoms health safety and environmental management system include

    early warning cockpits for critical health areas
    comprehensive employee survey on health and work pressures
    occupational and fire safety we have an occupational safety program for all employees in germany in
     accordance with legal provisions occupational safety is practiced internationally in accordance with local
     provisions this is monitored with spot check audits the international subsidiaries create their own
     occupational safety programs within the framework of the hse ms
    prevention and good health initiatives
    employee and executive advisory service 50 experts available for psychosocial counseling
    free telephone counseling for professional and personal problems 9100 calls in 2011


 employee survey on health

 as part of our healthy working program we have drawn conclusions from the employee survey which takes

 place every two years that was carried out in octobernovember 2010 with 124000 participants the survey is
 one of the best and most detailed investigations into mental stress in the workplace the results serve as an
 early warning signal of overall patterns of mental illnesses and general health risks and as an impetus for
 measures at corporate area team and individual level


 promoting health competence and health awareness

 our health measures range from specific offers for junior staff and seminars on stress management to flu shots
 and health checks outside the realm of the employee survey we use our health management system and
 preventive offers to promote health literacy and health awareness among the entire workforcefor example
 through the frequently used personal and telephonebased counseling service for executives and employees
 one fact is absolutely clear even without these programs and offers the key prerequisite for a healthy corporate
 culture is that management staff reflect on their leadership behavior reduce highintensity change and improve
 the quality of their planning


 health communication

 in 2011 we developed webbased training programs as one way of providing executives with better information
 on their role in workplace health and safety and to make them aware of their responsibilities this goal is shared
 by the health communication campaign for all employees the campaign will continue throughout 2012 focusing
 on sportfitness diet and mental health in addition since march 2011 the intranet has hosted an international
 information forum on health and safety at work

remuneration
fair and marketoriented pay and benefits are a key tool to steer telekom in times of change and high competitive
pressure

 deutsche telekom is committed to fair pay

 group diversity management conducted a salary survey to compare the salaries of female and male employees
 in march 2009 the analysis revealed that there are no genderspecific pay differences for employees outside
 the collective bargaining system in germany among employees covered by the collective bargaining system
 we can exclude the possibility of genderspecific disadvantages since pay is determined solely by an
 employees assignment to a function group these results prove that deutsche telekom practices fair pay for
 women and men and is opposed to all forms of salary discrimination the analysis was based on random
 sampling and will be expanded in future


 groupwide standardized remuneration system for executives

 remuneration for executives has been standardized throughout the group under the global compensation
 guideline the guideline ensures that remuneration packages for executives in the group are harmonized and
 marketoriented they can also be evaluated comprehensively in the respective market environment and
 analyzed and assessed systematically throughout the group


 company pension plan

 capital account plan telekom offers its employees an attractive employerfinanced company pension scheme
 on the basis of voluntary commitments the capital account plan is a modern defined contribution system in
 addition to the capital account plan telekom also offers its employees an optional company pension scheme
 which is exclusively financed by the employee this enables employees to close any retirement income gaps
 and if desired to protect themselves against occupational disability andor secure financial support for relatives
 in case of death

home  employees  competitive workforce  internationalization



internationalization
under one company deutsche telekom is increasingly fusing into a global corporation just like other international
groups deutsche telekom is also required to define uniform standards for their global hr policy without ignoring
local characteristics

 global employee relations managementtaking a multifaceted approach
 to employee relations

 the global employee relations management unit offers guidance and encourages the exchange of experiences
 on structuring employee relations in different countries at the employee relations in a connected world
 conference in early may 2011 70 leading executives from international businesses discussed the challenges
 presented by employee relations this formed the basis for deutsche telekoms ongoing consultation with other
 employers to formulate forwardlooking employee relations moreover in a globally applicable employee
 relations policy the group commits itself to a high level of uniform minimum standards worldwide in dealing with
 its employees taking account of different cultures laws and needs a monitoring system will be used to
 guarantee policy compliance as soon as the policy has been rolled out throughout the group our policy is
 based on our guiding principles as well as on national regulations and internationally recognized rules such as
 the united nations global compact  the oecd guidelines and the core labor standards issued by the
 international labour organization ilo


 social charter complying with minimum standards

 we passed our social charter in 2003 the charter is also based on the principles of the global compact 
 oecd and ilo the social charter              contains policies on human rights and working conditions the ban on child
 labor environmental protection equal opportunity occupational health and safety and the right to set up or join a
 trade union these policies apply throughout the group our suppliers are obligated to comply with these
 policies as well


 cooperation with employee representatives on both a german and
 international level

 again in 2011 we successfully continued to pursue intensive dialog with the bodies representing employees
 within the group in germany the implementation of numerous measures and projects would not have been
 possible without the participation of elected employee representatives this is where we are seeing the fruits of
 our commitment to cooperation based on trust as outlined in the group policy on employee relations a key
 role falls to the group works council our contact point for all codetermination issues within the group in
 germany in the european works council ewc too deutsche telekom nurtures an active relationship with
 the employee representatives of our european subsidiaries and affiliated companies

the way to outstanding employee services for hr customers
telekom needs a common global corporate structure to come out on top as a service company and innovation
engine on its markets we have already established the fundamental values on which such a corporate structure is
based with our guiding principles we particularly focus our efforts on making sure our executives exhibit effective
leadership and exemplary service conduct and that our employees participate and assume shared entrepreneurial
responsibility in order to make sure that our new corporate culture becomes ingrained at the company and can grow

guiding principles
guiding principles and code of conduct rolled out worldwide
in 2010 we updated our code of conduct coc which is mandatory throughout the group this is where our
guiding principles are substantiated and defined the code of conduct helps to illustrate what the guiding
principles mean for employees and executives in their everyday working lives we call on our executive staff to set
an example of the conduct we expect from our employees we are expecting all employees of the deutsche
telekom group to strictly comply with the guiding principles and report any violations of legal or ethical principles

in 2011 we began rolling out the coc at 40 out of 42 international subsidiaries and completed the majority of these
projects we also finalized the rollout at tmobile netherlands in early 2012 the rollout at ote in greece and at
its affiliates will follow gradually

the guiding principles and code of conduct are central pillars of the one company strategy
rolling out the guiding principles and code of conduct in our europe segment is a cornerstone of our one
company strategy it enables us to link the fixed and mobile network businesses in our european companies and
offer our customers products and services from a single source this structural change has already been completed
in germany as well as in croatia slovakia and hungary makedonski telekom fyro macedonia began to
prepare for restructuring in 2011

 guiding principles day anchoring corporate culture in daily working life

 the guiding principles the corporate vision we all share are very much alive this is made clear not only by the
 second annual guiding principles day which took place on september 28 2011 with a large number of
 participants the results of our regular employee surveys confirm it too our employees and executives are not
 only familiar with the guiding principles but are also making them more a matter of course in their daily working
 lives

initiatives
the shift over to the one company structure in germany and europe calls for changes in the way we think and act
as well as how we perceive service we are promoting these changes in many ways such as offering skills
development schemes such as the service academy and the opportunity provided by service careers

  service initiatives provide training for 1800 executives at the service
  academy alone

  our executives are service role models ambassadors and purveyors of our corporate culture to take our
  service culture forward we have been enrolling executives across germany in the service academy since 2008
  some 1800 executives took part in phase 3 of the service academy in 2011 each year the program consists of
  a twoday workshop complemented by a oneday service experience and a halfday learning module of the
  participants choice

  some of our subsidiaries have extended or introduced their own service initiatives here are just three examples

     the management workshoptsg at telekom shop vertriebsgesellschaft targets a common understanding of
      the best instore sales and service experience the workshops took place in 2011 and achieved high
      participation levels and positive approval ratings
     in 2011 we also introduced magenta t in our polish subsidiary ptc to consolidate the loyalty and high
      commitment levels of 6800 employees our polish colleagues have worked with 80 change experts to run 200
      halfday or fullday workshops
     tmobile netherlands won awards for good service the best customer performance award 2010 and for the
      online shop the best web performance score 2009 2010 2011

  employees in sales and service for telekom deutschland alone


  service careers for over 3600 employees since 2009

  since 2009 we have furthered the development of over 3600 employees under the service career model in this
  way we are securing and improving the quality of our customer service along a wide front


  the service career is a career path that has been tailored to the service companies in germany it offers
  highperforming employees a highcaliber opportunity to develop professionally the training phase takes no
  more than ten months and qualifies employees for a range of activities in sales and service in germany for
  instance as a customer service representative or team leader with this initiative we want to improve both our
  employees personal development opportunities and their solution and service competency for our customers
  the service career also offers financial rewards

 service stars recognized for excellent service

 one way in which our employees are recognized for excellence in internal and external service is through
 personal awards in 2011 we selected 20 service stars and honored them with a place on the walk of service at
 group headquarters we hope this will encourage all our employees to follow their example


 walk of service similar to the concept of the walk of fame on which film stars receive a star in los angeles
 telekom employees are recognized on the walk of service by getting their own floor tile placed in the foyer at
 group headquarters

cultural change
change management to support change
telekom wants and needs to provide its customers with excellent service at competitive prices both on our
domestic market as well as at our european subsidiaries and affiliates this is why we continue to reorganize our
group so that the structure of our company is as efficient as possible and at the same time as flexible as possible
for our customers the ongoing evolution of our business demands that our employees be ready to embrace
change to support and accompany it we introduced groupwide change management in 2009 this is the only
way to get employees involved in radical change processes on our way to becoming the new telekom and to
integrate the corporate culture and new structures in the everyday work routine

 onsite change managers global tools and expertise

 support for uniform change awareness throughout the group comes in the shape of the globally available
 change navigatora kit of tools and methodsas well as certified training courses for change managers
 change managers are the hr business partners          and executives at the local business units


 change community creates networks
 in addition to providing continuing education offers as well as access to tools and best practices we also
 encourage regular communication among our change experts we use a shared social media platform
 international teleconferences and the international change community conference as forums where people can
 share knowledge and collaborate in the change community in a projectoriented way and at an international
 level

home  employees  service culture  employee involvement



employee involvement
our employees need to be enabled to play an active role so that they can devote their energies to the success of
the company and identify with it for instance by inviting each and every employee to contribute ideas and
suggestions more streamlined hierarchical structures new forms of work and communication channels and regular
surveys also promote open dialog and the productive exchange of ideas our focal point in 2011 was translating the
extensive feedback we received from our employees in the 2010 employee survey into numerous improvements
for the first time the employee survey also included detailed questions about mental and physical health

 employee survey and pulse check feedback tools widely accepted and
 used

 the employee survey held every two years and the sixmonthly pulse check are our most important groupwide
 feedback tools acceptance levels are high and still rising the next employee survey will be carried out globally
 once again in fall 2012 it gives all employees the chance to give detailed feedback and provides managers with
 valuable information about potential for improvement and necessary changes within their teams telekom was
 the first daxlisted company to include detailed questions on mental and physical wellbeing in the 2010
 employee survey the 22 questions in our concise sixmonthly pulse check help us ascertain which
 improvements resulting from the employee survey have actually been seen to have been made


 followup measures focused on health

 2011 was characterized by the followup measures derived from the 2010 employee survey topics such as
 trust in senior management workload and understanding the strategy have been directly addressed by
 the improvements introduced by our executives the followup process focused on the topic of health as

 gender more women at the top

 more women in management positions
 in 2010 telekom was the first dax 30 company to introduce a womens quota for new appointments and
 participation in management programs with this move we have established diversity in germany as a top social
 issue we set the bar for the dax 30 companies in october 2011 all member companies followed telekoms
 lead and voluntarily introduced targets for increasing the number of women in management by the end of 2015
 30 percent of upper and middle management positions at deutsche telekom are to be held by women this rule
 applies to all of telekoms international subsidiaries in order to achieve this target we are implementing our
 program for the womens quota right along the entire talent pipelinein our training courses cooperative and
 parttime study programs in our development programs for junior staff and in our programs for executives right
 through to filling top positions by controlling and monitoring our appointment and selection processes we create
 transparency and aim to make sure that at least 30 percent of women are included in applicant shortlists

 womens quota target for 2011 surpassed
 we have made considerable progress in the last two years

    since the womens quota took effect at the start of 2010 the percentage of female executives worldwide has
     increased from 19 percent to 247 percent
    there are now seven women in the 66strong management team below the group board of management the
     business leader team
    since may 3 2012 two of telekoms seven board of management positions have been held by women
    31 women previous year 13 now hold mandates on supervisory boards of telekom subsidiaries and
     subsubsidiaries in germany 205 percent at international subsidiaries 17 women hold a position on
     supervisory boards 132 percent

   dialog forums the events focused on the reconciliation of work and private life
   firmly embedding diversity internationally at tsystems alone some 60 diversity projects were launched in
    the local business units in europe best practices are being exchanged mainly on flexible worktime and
    projects on gender and generation management
   strengthening female networks our womens networks are enjoying large memberships and are supported by
    the group almost 1000 women currently take part in the networks

gender collaboration trainings leadership in mixed teams
the fact that mixed teams are more creative and innovative has been shown by countless studies in order to
exploit this potential and turn diversity into a success factor telekom has launched groupwide gender
collaboration training here we prepare our managers for leading increasingly diverse teams the main aim of
the mandatory training is to firmly embed diversity in the company we launched the training at european
telekom companies in december 2010 and rolled it out across europe we are currently carrying it out at all
major locations in germany

    in 2011 we made it clear in germany that there is no obligation to answer cell phones or email messages for
    work purposes outside of working hours since announced and introduced this voluntary commitment has
    increasingly been discussed internationally as well take for example the adapted voluntary commitment at
    tsystems in china where workrelated email communication is avoided from friday 6 pm to monday 8 am
    through new ways of working we want to create a mix that combines excellent performance with attractive
    employment opportunities and establishes a winwin scenario for company and workforce alike one example
    of this is mobile working  a working model we first introduced at tmobile austria
   more than 14500 employees take advantage of parttime work in germany alone
    the voluntary commitment on parttime for executives is beginning to take effect the number of male and
    female german executives working part time has increased to 27 overall in germany alone more than
    14500 employees work part time
   new models for taking time out under preparation
    in 2012 telekom is also creating new tailored offers and financing models for taking a defined period of time
    away from work we offer timeout or parttime models financed in advance by the company taken for
    personal reasonsincluding parttime models for family family care leave with a special salary model offered
    since january 2012 continuing education or social commitment in addition a savings model offers the
    opportunity of taking flexible timeout or tailoring the structure of parttime work
   standardized parental leave process
    we further pursued our stay in contact parental leave scheme for all employee groups in 2011 the goal is
    for employees to stay in touch with the company colleagues and their department via systematic contact
    management we help them by offering planning consultation at the start of and during parental leave as well
    as reentry consultation among other offers

mobile working
employees can use this work option if their position allows if they personally qualify for the option and if the
option is approved by their superior qualified employees can spend a maximum of 20 percent of their work time
working on a trust basis at locations of their choice

employees and at the same time ensure a balanced age mix in the company through the targeted recruitment of
younger staff with generationtelekom we plan to make telekom fit to meet these challenges and promote
mutual understanding between the generations the measures of our hr policy across all phases of life include

the sustainable procurement cr kpi decreased from 55 to 38 percent compared to the previous year this can be
attributed to a significant reduction in procurement volumes from suppliers who were audited or who are registered
in etasc

    data checked by pwc based on procurement volumes at central procurement values cannot be directly compared to the previous year
altogether the number of audited suppliers remained the same compared to the previous year the order volume
with suppliers who were relevant in the previous year as well decreased in part however and some suppliers with
lower order volumes were also documented in etasc compared with the previous year however a reduction in
deutsche telekoms overall procurement volume by 12 percent minimized the effect in the decrease of the

 risk management for supplier relationships at the deutsche telekom group

 the reduction can be attributed to a significant reduction in procurement volumes from suppliers who were
 audited or who are registered in etasc in contrast the number of registered or audited suppliers remained
 stable however procurement volume by suppliers who were also relevant in the previous year decreased
 other suppliers with lower order volumes were recorded in etasc compared with the previous year therefore

sustainability strategy for procurement
under its cr strategy telekom is also working toward becoming the industry leader in terms
of sustainability in procurement and supply chain management the fact that we were once
again at the top this year in renowned sustainability rankings is proof that we are well on
track in this respect

compared to our competitors we hold a leading position when it comes to the sustainable
management of our supply chain we intend to solidify this position and expand it further
the basis for this is the strategic integration of sustainability into our procurement activities

 procurement volumes and regions

 we work with suppliers in over 50 countries we procured a total of eur 2 billion in
 goods and services from emerging and developing countries in 2011 that is the
 equivalent of some 11 percent of telekoms total procurement volume in contrast 19
 percent of telekoms procurement volume came from emerging and developing countries
 in the previous yeargoods in the amount of eur 398 million this increase can
 primarily be attributed to an increase in order volumes in eastern european countries

 close collaboration with stakeholders in these countries plays a significant role in making
 sure the production conditions meet telekoms environmental and social standards we
 consider it our duty to ensure basic social and environmental standards particularly in
 emerging and developing countries

 cr report from the previous year


 sustainable procurement cr kpi

 we use the sustainable procurement cr kpi to identify how much of our procurement
 volume throughout the group comes from suppliers who are audited or who provide
 voluntary information on etascthe sustainable procurement cr kpi has applied
 throughout the group since early 2011 the kpi will be calculated and managed centrally
 at company level the audited volume identified via this channel came to 38 percent
 groupwide during the reporting period

 a detailed description of the cr kpi can be found under strategy  management


 procurement joint venture with france télécomorange

 the partners deutsche telekom and france télécom have pooled their procurement
 activities in the areas of devices mobile communications networks large parts of their
 fixednetwork equipment and service platforms in a 5050 joint venture

in addition the two companies intend to launch pilot projects to explore other areas for
inclusion in the joint venture at a later stage including it infrastructure and further it
areas the inclusion of additional fixednetwork components remains to be reviewed by
the german federal cartel office the joint venture which has been named buyin is
expected to generate an annual run rate of eur 13 billion through procurement savings
after three years of implementation

deutsche telekom and france télécom have agreed on joint sustainability criteria to be
met by suppliers the companies plan to draft a joint supplier code of conduct for buyin
in 2012 based on these criteria


positioning within the organization

the corporate procurement strategy department has been responsible for developing
concepts and methods for achieving sustainability in our procurement practices since
2010 the sustainable procurement working group continues to provide assistance
when it comes to realizing sustainability in our procurement activities throughout the
group experts from the cr area work together with representatives from telekoms
major procurement areas on this international committee

we are driving groupwide implementation of the sustainable procurement strategy with
increased assistance from the cr manager network as part of our international
implementation of the cr strategy


sustainable procurement strategy

telekom places importance on more than just financial aspects when it comes to
procurement ecological and social criteria need to be taken into consideration as well
this has been laid down in our groupwide sustainable procurement strategy designed
to implement sustainability in our procurement activities which was approved in 2007 and
revised in 2010 all guidelines and processes dealing with improving sustainability in the
supply chain are based on this strategy for example the entire life cycle of products and
services is analyzed for potential environmental impact before any sourcing decisions are
made telekom also acknowledges its social responsibility with this strategy ie
regarding fair payment and the observance of basic human rights


guidelines for a sustainable supply chain

the group global procurement policy plays a significant role among the various
sustainable procurement regulations it was approved for deutsche telekom in
november 2010 and rolled out at numerous international subsidiaries from march 2011 to
early 2012 out of 71 german and international subsidiaries that are planning to
implement the policy 59 had done so with an official decision being passed by their
managing boards by late january 2012 we will be continuing to roll out the global
procurement policy at the remaining twelve international subsidiaries throughout the
remainder of this year

our procurement practices are a detailed guideline for our purchasers in germany and

serve to further specify the general policies contained in the global procurement policy a
fully revised version of these was published in august 2011 besides numerous additions
and further details such as provisions for selecting new suppliers the procurement
practices have also been restructured to harmonize more effectively with the global
procurement policy we will continue to update the guideline in accordance with
changing conditions at procurement

tsystems slovakia approved its own procurement policy in november 2011 to help
support local suppliers these measures will supplement existing groupwide telekom
guidelines and policies and form the basis for a procurement policy that is in line with
local conditions

cr report from the previous year


binding rules of conduct

deutsche telekom requires all of its suppliers to comply with the code of conduct and
the policies contained in the social charter 

our fraud policy      is designed to fight corruption and also applies to all supplier
relationships we demand that our suppliers for their part apply these standards to their
own subsuppliers we conduct regular social audits to make sure that our suppliers
comply with the mandatory minimum standards specified in the code of conduct the
fraud policy      and the social charter 

download  code of conduct
download  fraud policy
download  social charter

in 2011 tmobile netherlands completely integrated compliance with the social charter
    and environmental criteria into onesource its contract management system thereby
making this a mandatory requirement for cooperation




deutsche telekom adopted its social charter         in 2003 as an integral element of
deutsche telekoms code of conduct the social charter          is based on the values of the
un global compact         and the policies passed by the international labour organization
ilo and the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises

it contains groupwide guidelines on

   human rights and working conditions
   environmental protection
   equal opportunities
   health and safety at work
   the right to set up and join a trade union

the principles described in the charter apply to all telekom business units worldwide in
the charter which is an integral part of our general purchasing terms and conditions we

require all suppliers to comply with these basic principles as far as possible


groupwide rules for procuring raw materials

sustainable procurement of raw materials in the ict industry comes with considerable
challenges many valuable metals are used in making phones cell phones computers
and other ict products these valuable raw materials are often extracted in emerging
and developing countries under problematic conditions

one example of this is the metal tantalum which is extracted from coltan and is present
in many products that are sold or used by telekom we do not directly purchase raw
materials or the metals extracted from them nevertheless we consider it our duty to
minimize the harm caused to people and the environment in connection with extracting
these substances and to completely put a stop to these consequences in the long term
we work on this in close collaboration with our suppliers

we approved the statement on extractives        in 2009 as an addition to our coltan
statement which we published in 2005 the statement on extractives          requires that all
supply chain participants comply with the minimum standards specified in the social
charter the purpose of this decision is to make sure that both our direct suppliers as well
as their subsuppliers minimize the social risks that come with extracting raw materials
we require our suppliers to officially state that they will comply with the deutsche
telekom statement on extractives 

in addition we actively support the efforts of the industry association global
esustainability initiative gesi one of the initiatives goals is to increase transparency in
the raw materials extraction process and minimize the negative social and environmental
impact of raw material extraction

participation in the german global compact network

telekom also contributes to improving social conditions along the supply chain through its
participation in the german global compact network dgcn in 2011 telekom
participated in selected dgcn meetings and discussed the issue of balancing business
and human rights with other companies

in order to be able to effectively assess whether a company has implemented the guiding
principles on business and human rights which were drafted by un special
representative john ruggie dgcn developed the human rights due
diligenceorganizational capacity assessment this tool was the focal point of the
dgcn meeting that we hosted in may 2011 we will be using the tool throughout the
course of 2012 to analyze to what extent the guiding principles on business and human
rights have been implemented at telekom the results are expected to reflect a general
assessment of the situation at a corporate level and help us determine our further course

 of action

 cr report from the previous year


 dgcn has offered three training courses for companies on human rights since 2008 an
 informal workgroup on business and human rights was founded based on these courses
 in the workgroup eleven multinational companies get together to discuss the progress
 being made and the challenges involved in human rights protection in the supply chain
 the workgroup meets at least twice a year telekom also makes a significant contribution
 in supporting dgcns activities with its expertise and recognized cr performance

supplier selection
telekom lays the foundation for a sustainable supply chain even when selecting its suppliers
suppliers and subsuppliers that are interested in doing business with telekom first need to
undergo a prequalification process

with the help of an online questionnaire on our supplier portal we are also able to collect
information on compliance as well as conformity with sustainability criteria and then take
these factors into consideration during the further selection process

stricter requirements on selected supplier groups
not only do our strategic suppliers and suppliers from highrisk industries have to pass
prequalification they are also asked to provide additional information on the topic of
sustainability using the electronics tool for accountable supply chains the term strategic
suppliers refers to suppliers that are significant for procurement activities at telekom due to
the extent of the supply relationship their position on the market or their potential for
innovation

 central supplier portal online

 in 2011 we focused on continuing to improve transparency and efficiency in our supplier
 selection process through measures such as the supplier management portal smp with
 its seamless prequalification process including transparent voluntary information provided
 by suppliers via targeted questionnaires the smp acts as the central gateway for
 suppliers to deutsche telekoms procurement department

 launched on january 17 2011 the smp was initially run parallel to the corporate
 procurement portal which was being used at the time we have been registering new
 and regular suppliers exclusively via the smp since july 4 2011 resulting in one
 standardized communication channel between deutsche telekom and its business
 partners

 we can use the new portal to make communication between suppliers and our
 procurement department more transparent and to structure our business processes to be
 more sustainable for example the portal makes it possible to share information and
 documents for order processing and billing transactions for materials and services
 digitally thereby doing away with the need for paper documents we have also been able
 to improve data quality by simplifying our procedures

 we continue to develop ways to make the smp more userfriendly and to add new
 innovative features in order to support our suppliers and simplify their daily business
 processes when doing business with deutsche telekom for example we are planning to
 introduce new tools for supplier evaluation starting in the third quarter of 2012
 subsequently we intend to implement the supplier file as a new way to transparently
 share and manage documents

optimizing the prequalification process

we comprehensively optimized the prequalification process in 2011 based on our revised
guidelines the prequalification process helps the procurement department develop and
shape the supplier portfolio in this process suppliers fill out a questionnaire and their
responses are then used to evaluate that supplier

main focal points in improving the prequalification process particularly included limiting
potential supplierrelated risks and systematically expanding our sustainability
requirements to the supply chain the optimized prequalification process enables more
effective supplier evaluation and helps the procurement department select the best
business partners the key optimization measures include

   convenient userfriendly invitation to participate in the prequalification process for
    potential suppliers
   risk minimization through automated checking of black lists during the invitation
    process
   inclusion of sustainability criteria in the supplier questionnaire
   use of supplier information in any followup processes invitations to bid and auctions
    vendor master data purchasetopay process reporting
   support for buyers with softwaresupported evaluation processes

additional improvements are planned for 2012

prequalification process in hungary spain and slovakia

the hungarian subsidiary magyar telekom expanded the supplier prequalification
program that it introduced in december 2010 and evaluated additional suppliers during
the reporting period the subsidiary evaluated the sustainability risks of its top 38
suppliers based on the gesi questionnaire and conducted an even more thorough
sustainability assessment of its top 10 suppliers using the supplier scorecard ssc in
2011 the company informs suppliers of the results to encourage them to improve their
performance magyar telekom also plans to introduce a comprehensive process to
guarantee a sustainable supply chain in the context of its new sustainability strategy

tsystems iberia integrated its supplier selection process into tsystems internationals
global processes which also require suppliers to undergo sustainability prequalification
during the reporting period slovak telekom also began reviewing its top 100 suppliers for
compliance with cr policies the subsidiary reviewed 40 companies in december 2011
and january 2012 and plans to continue the process over the course of the year in order

to help establish cr and sustainability criteria at its suppliers companies


sustainability criteria during the bidding process

after developing various criteria for assessing the sustainability of proposals in 2009 and
2010 we have been actively encouraging compliance with these criteria during bid
processes since 2011 our goal is to systematically establish sustainability criteria as a
permanent component of our bid processes by 2013

during the reporting process we took an initial step in this direction by standardizing the
questionnaires and evaluation systems for bid processes thereby making them
considerably easier to use for buyers and suppliers we will develop additional
productspecific criteria in 2012 and 2013 which we intend to make a permanent
component of the bidding process as well

sustainability criteria have been systematically included in the award notice for major
orders since 2010

online cr training tool for buyers

we revised the content and method of our internal corporate responsibility online training
tool in cooperation with humboldt universität in berlin in 2010 and will introduce it in the
second quarter of 2012 we made the application more efficient and easier to use by
shortening training time and reducing the amount of content these changes should
make the tool easier to use


we established an internal online training tool on the topic of corporate responsibility for
our buyers in 2008 the purpose of the tool is to help harmonize sustainable procurement
processes throughout the group by using the tool employees are trained to recognize
risks in the supply chain they become familiar with tools and techniques for sustainable
procurement and learn about the advantages of being able to steer the supply chain
they also get tips on how to best include their suppliers in the process of developing
sustainable solutions

supply chain management
processes and tools for evaluating suppliers are key aspects of supply chain management at
telekom these are for example valuable in identifying financial improvement potential and
in controlling supplier progress in social and environmental areas

by practicing systematic supply chain management telekom is able to quickly identify
potential risks in the supply chain and respond to them

we also rely on dialog with regard to sustainability in cooperation with our suppliers for us
at telekom it is important to know that our business partners are supporting new ways of
achieving sustainable business practices this is the only way to effectively improve the
supply chain in addition to our suppliers who are our most important external procurement
stakeholders our collaboration partners institutions and ngos are important stakeholders
when it comes to making the supply chain more sustainable we also work to improve ethical
social and environmental standards as a member of industry initiatives such as the global
esustainability initiative gesi and the joint audit cooperation

 advancing etasc

 etasc or the electronics tool for accountable supply chains is an online information
 system used throughout the industry for assessing the sustainabilityrelated risks involved
 in supplier activities as a member of the global esustainability initiative gesi
 telekom played a key role in the development of this system and is also involved in its
 further development

 we collaborated actively on the development of version 20 of the information system in
 2011 updates included revising the etasc questionnaire and the supplier risk
 assessment the design was improved and the system restructured for increased user
 friendliness as well plans for 2012 include adding a supplier and facility comparison
 feature to the system this feature will make it possible to compare registered suppliers
 new questions on topics such as fighting corruption and the extraction of raw materials
 from regions that are experiencing conflict will be incorporated as well there are also
 plans to expand the system to include a management feature for corrective measures
 and audit results


 the online information system etasc or electronicstool for accountable supply
 chains which is used throughout the industry helps us quickly identify current or
 potential cr risks in the supply chain and respond to them appropriately

 suppliers use the system to provide detailed information on their social and
 environmental production conditions and their management systems they also benefit
 from using the crossindustry system because this helps them to demonstrate their cr
 status to other business partners and skeptical members of the public

if a supplier is not able to provide the requested information an internal multiple phase
process is initiated to encourage the supplier to use etasc in many cases a few
conversations are often enough multiple escalation phases are initiated if discrepancy
persists


using etasc at telekom

we use particularly strict criteria to evaluate strategically important suppliers for possible
sustainability risks that is why we require them to use etasc even during the selection
process

we asked 33 additional suppliers to provide information in etasc between january and
december 2011 18 of these had responded to this request by the end of the year even
so the share of our procurement volume from suppliers that have provided information on
etasc fell from 55 percent to 38 percent this reduction of 17 percent is reflected in a
reduction of the order volume which is around 12 percent the number of registered
suppliers in the system is stable and the reduction of the order volume through etasc is
as much due to costcutting measures as it is to an altered list of suppliers in the etasc
system

supplier scorecard for strategic suppliers
in addition to the etasc tool which is used throughout the industry our supplier
scorecard ssc is another element for evaluating selected suppliers the ssc is
generated every six months in addition to evaluating key financial performance indicators
it also provides a groupwide overview of the sustainability performance of our strategic
suppliers

supplier workshops for a more sustainable supply chain

telekom deutschland organizes workshops with important suppliers in order to more
firmly integrate sustainable elements into the supply chain

during the reporting period we conducted two sustainability workshops on co2
management in the supply chain we worked with participants to develop a method that
can be used to included the co2 emissions generated by our suppliers and their
subsuppliers into our co2 calculation as precisely as possible establishing the required
trust within the process posed a particular challenge that challenge was particularly a
factor when it came to our suppliers trust in their subsuppliers once we have approved
the procedure for calculating our co2 emissions from the supply chain in collaboration
with our strategic suppliers we plan to draft mandatory target agreements to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions

the project was originally scheduled for completion in 2010 a deadline that we were
unable to meet due to delays in the international standardization process with the new
ghg protocol for calculating scope 3 emissions however which was passed in october
2011 the foundation has now been laid for extensive recording of scope 3 emissions
that means we will be able to effectively continue our subproject and complete it in 2012
we are also developing a procedure to calculate the co2 that our customers generate

when using our products and services

we are actively participating in the creation of an industry supplement to the ghg
protocol for the ict sector with these efforts we are pursuing the industryspecific
specification of policies for recording and publishing greenhouse gas emissions in the ict
industry

sustainable procurement stakeholder dialog day

the fourth sustainable procurement stakeholder        dialog day was held on november 10
and 11 2011 in the chinese city of shenzhen it was the first time we hosted the event in
china this was telekoms first dialog event outside of europe and the first time ever this
type of event was held in china

by deciding to host a dialog event in china we acknowledged the important role that the
chinese market plays in our global supply chain and were also able to gain valuable
knowledge of local conditions and expectations

a total of 97 participants including telekom employees suppliers from china and
representatives of governments ngos and research institutes used the event to share
information on different aspects of sustainable procurement in the ict sector the
question of how to improve the various stakeholders collaboration in order to comply with
established environmental and social standards was the focal point of the event this
gave us the ideal opportunity to demonstrate the significance of cr for the success of our
company and the resulting requirements for our suppliers and to offer assistance in
better meeting these requirements

by working together companies and their suppliers can resolve problems identified in the
global supply chain such as working hours occupational health and safety and fair pay
as well challenges such as the conservation of natural resources and climate change
compliance with ecological and social standards in the global supply chain is a
fundamental aspect of our cr risk management that involves creating transparency
throughout the entire supply chain something that still needs improvement we will
demand greater cooperation from our suppliers in this respect in future

sustainable sourcing excellence research project

we saw initial results within the scope of the sustainable sourcing excellence research
project during the reporting period telekom is a participant in three of the projects five
work packets

   developing a procedure for measuring environmental impact caused by purchasing and
    procurement logistics this included analyzing requirements on standardized measuring
    methods and reviewing earlier approaches taken by industry partners
   developing an international mandatory guideline for purchasing and procurement
    logistics we finalized an initial working version of the sourcing governance code in the

    third quarter of 2011
   establishing a procurement platform to help calculate the costs resulting from co2
    emissions generated by purchasing and procurement logistics processes in order to
    make these a quantitative factor in procurement decisions we will then begin
    developing strategies to prevent co2 emissions within the scope of this work packet
    we analyzed current procurement platforms and compiled industry partner requirements
    into a specifications sheet

in addition to this research project telekom teamed up with the ebs university ebs
universität für wirtschaft und recht to initiate another research project entitled
sustainability  tco the aim of the project is to make it possible to quantify and
evaluate the costs and savings associated with sustainable activities with the results we
hope to be able to provide our buyers with an effective tool for pricebased evaluation of
sustainability effects

we began the first pilot projects to calculate costs generated by sustainability activities in
october 2011 within the scope of the projects we plan to test the applicability of
scientific methods and user acceptance of those methods we will then decide whether to
make further adjustments for systematic implementation based on the results


since december 1 2010 telekoms corporate procurement  procurement excellence 
vendor management department has been participating in the sustainable sourcing
excellence project within the scope of the effizienzcluster logistikruhr program which
is being conducted by the ebs university and the supply chain management institute in
wiesbaden germany

the project is focused on the following

   developing a procedure for the integrated measurement of environmental impact
    caused by purchasing and procurement logistics
   creating a sourcing governance code
   creating guidelines for sustainable purchasing and procurement logistics
   establishing a co2 efficient sourcing platform
   developing an itbased sustainability risk management system for purchasing and
    procurement logistics

telekom decided to participate in this project which is sponsored by the german federal
ministry of education and research bmbf for a period of two years to begin with

social audits
we continued and further expanded our social audit activities in 2011 in general the
auditors looked at areas in which telekom generates the highest procurement volume and
which involve the highest risk potential based on what we learned over the course of the
reporting period we decided not only to audit our direct suppliers but their suppliers as well
we were also able to further improve the efficiency of the social audit processes in the joint
audit    cooperation jac

 27 social audits in 2011

 during 2011 15 of our suppliers and subsuppliers were audited as part of the joint audit
 cooperation jac telekom also commissioned external auditors to conduct twelve
 additional social audits with this efficient comprehensive audit system we are able to
 create more transparency in our supply chain and minimize risks

 with this number we were able to maintain our good supply chain results in important
 sustainability ratings and even mildly improve our sam rating with 94 out of 100 points
 compared to the previous year 90 points as a result telekom received the best rating
 in the supply chain management category of all the companies in the mobile
 communications sector in 2011

 some of our international subsidiaries conducted audits as well tht hrvatski telekom
 in croatia audited five suppliers that carry out work on the network infrastructure in 2011

 a total of 23 audits have been conducted on behalf of tht hrvatski telekom since 2003

 cr report from the previous year


 a social audit at telekom comprises the following essential elements

    a general risk assessment of suppliers conducted by telekom
    an evaluation of the supplier selfassessment conducted by telekom
    personal communication with the suppliers and
    the onsite audit

 finally the auditors write up an audit report including an audit rating instead of ending
 our business relationship with suppliers who violate our policies telekom works together
 with these suppliers to permanently improve conditions we address any problems in an
 action plan and work together with the supplier to remedy these within a predefined
 period of time we will continue to focus our social audit activities on asia we are also
 reviewing suppliers from other highrisk regions such as latin america and eastern
 europe

audit program for 2012

we conducted 53 audits at group level between early 2010 and late 2011 they were
carried out by experts from deutsche telekom and qualified external auditing companies
in 2011 we reviewed our target of conducting a total of 200 social audits of strategically
important direct suppliers in the period from 2010 to late 2012

we decided to expand the scope of our audit candidates to cover downstream levels of
the supply chain in order to create more transparency in our supply chain and to increase
our knowledge of potential cr risks that way we are focusing on areas that we feel need
the most improvement by late april 2012 we will decide which companies to audit and
begin conducting audits of second and thirdlevel suppliers via our direct suppliers we
expect to reach our target of auditing a total of 200 suppliers by late 2012 with these
measures

in addition to the social audits our china office in shenzhen conducts supplier
performance visits at direct and indirect suppliers five supplier performance visits were
conducted in 2011 in addition to general topics regarding improving business
relationships sustainability issues were also discussed

in 2012 we want to make the supplier performance visits more effective and also analyze
different corporate areas more systematically with the help of a specific checklist one of
the main focal points of the visits is sustainability if potential problems are identified
during the visits they are reported to us immediately the suppliers involved then
become potential candidates for a social audit we plan to intensify supplier performance
visits and make sustainability audits a permanent element in our quality management
audits of current and potential network infrastructure suppliers


audit collaboration in the telecommunications industry

our activities in 2011 as part of the joint audit    cooperation jac were focused on
expanding the collaboration network experience gained in previous audits was also used
to finetune audit parameters and revise the audit question catalog due to these
measures only 15 audits were conducted in 2011 within the scope of the jac instead of
the 16 originally planned the majority of these were followup audits to verify the
corrective action taken for suppliers that had already been audited

more members and new collaborations
in 2011 four additional telecommunications companies joined the jac  belgacom kpn
swisscom and vodafone this will considerably increase the efficiency of the social audit
processes

a collaboration that extends beyond the social audits is being planned the collaboration
should make it possible to exploit synergy effects with other organizations such as the
global esustainability initiative gesi

meeting to take stock and make plans
the joint audit    cooperation jac holds a meeting of its steering committee twice a
year which is attended by highranking representatives from jac member companies
the first meeting in 2012 took place on january 11 in the chinese city of shenzhen the

 agenda included taking stock and discussing the 2011 audit activities as well as selecting
 additional activities for 2012 another central topic was the integration of new members
 as a decisive factor in being able to realize sustainability criteria throughout the supply
 chain participants also discussed making jac membership available to noneuropean
 telecommunications companies the next steering committee meeting is scheduled for
 late june 2012 in the netherlands

 the jac also held its international corporate social responsibility forum on january 12
 2012 in shenzhen with the slogan cooperation beyond competition more than 150
 representatives of suppliers ngos the press and ict companies as well as
 sustainability experts participated the participants all agreed on the necessity for
 increasing supply chain transparency through intensified collaboration this is essential
 in particular to submit the downstream delivery levels to a comprehensive risk analysis
 and thus achieve adequate and prompt improvements the jac members assured the
 suppliers and subsuppliers that they would help them implement improvements


 as part of an industrywide cooperation telekom and its competitors orangefrance
 telecom and telecom italia announced a joint decision to improve the sustainability of
 their supply chain in asia in december 2009 in october 2010 this decision resulted in
 the founding of an initiative the joint audit       cooperation jac

 jac comprises a strategy that enables the three companies to audit their shared
 suppliers globally on the basis of standardized criteria the collaboration partners are
 also striving to establish social ethical and environmental standards amongst their
 suppliers the processes used for accomplishing this goal are based on the international
 social and environmental standards sa 8000 and iso 14001  audits are conducted by
 internationally recognized auditing firms

 jac improves the efficiency of social auditing processes since only one audit needs to be
 conducted of shared suppliers the three companies then provide the results to each
 other

the ict industry plays a key role when it comes to curbing climate change deutsche telekom discussed this fact
at the united nations cop     17 climate protection conference which was held in december 2011 in durban
emphasizing the necessity of setting specific mandatory targets

germanyand therefore telekomneeds to take on a pioneering role in doing so we are developing our products
and services in line with these criteria making it possible for our customers to engage in green consumption with
our innovative ict services and solutions we are also investing heavily in the expansion of a climate and
environmentally friendly network infrastructure

whats more we take a host of measures to continuously reduce the impacts that our own business activities have
on the climate and environment reducing the groups co2 emissions in germany is a focal point of our climate
protection strategy during the reporting period we concentrated on implementing our climate protection strategy
throughout europe

climate protection calls for fundamental rethinking of approaches in the worlds of business and society
we think that we already know how to fight climate change are we right or do we need a much broader vision
what is telekoms vision what measurable contribution is telekom making to the fight against climate change

climate protection
digital technology and innovative ict solutions can contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions
worldwide companies from the ict sector are not the only ones that can make a contribution to the reduction of
co2 emissions intelligent use of information technology can reduce emissions considerably in other industries as
well this primarily applies to all aspects of smart buildings smart logistics smart grids smart motors and
dematerialization these were the findings of two studies that were supported by telekom over the last few years

   the smart 2020 global study which was conducted by the global esustainability initiative in 2008 and
   smart 2020 germany addendum which was published in 2009

based on these findings we have integrated the promotion of a climate friendly society into our cr strategy we
are involved in different initiatives outside our company walls as well to promote climate protection at a national
european and global level additionally our innovative products and services are already making an important
contribution to creating a climateconscious society one example of these are our phone and web conference
offers which reduce co2 emissions considerably compared to reallife meetings the telekom group is also
constantly working to reduce its own co2 emissions

    climate protection goal 40 percent less co2 by 2020

    telekom in germany plans to make a contribution to creating a low carbon society by 2020 our goal is to
    reduce co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020 compared to 2008 levels that will be the equivalent of more than
    40 percent compared to emissions recorded in 1995

    co2 reductions at the telekom group will primarily result from the transition to the more energyefficient internet
    protocol allip over the next couple of years the new green car policy and reductions in the area of facility
    management will also make a major contribution to achieving this goal emissions reductions are measured
    using the co2 emissions key performance indicator kpi telekom generated emissions totaling 2138039
    metric tons of co2 throughout the group in 2011


    internationalization of the climate protection strategy

    40 percent fewer co2 emissions than in 1995 telekom in germany has set itself this ambitious climate
    protection goal to help create a low carbon society

we started to expand our climate protection strategy to include 13 european subsidiaries and 11 tsystems
lbus in 2011 the goal is for these units to approve their own climate protection strategies by may 2012 these
strategies will include specific targets and measures to be realized by 2020 we determined the base values
from 2008 for all units and identified specific measures during the reporting period the plan is to specify and
approve reduction targets for the individual units in 2012

these will be expanded to cover our noneuropean subsidiaries once the climate protection strategy has been
implemented at the european units


team of experts supports further reduction of co2

an internal group of experts the climate change group is developing and initiating specific measures that we
can use to curb our co2 emissions in the time period between 2011 and 2015 these include

   climate friendly network infrastructure solutions
   the lola load adaptive networks project
   planned introduction of green dsl
   the green car policy
   teleconferencing and web conferencing

additional measures are being developed at our energy camps employees from our subsidiary power and air
condition solution management gmbh pasm dfmg deutsche funkturm gmbh experts from different
telekom areas and representatives of the climate change group attend these camps which are held annually
the following activities were decided upon for 2012 and 2013 at the energy camps in september 2011

   continuing to dismantle old network technology
   optimizing the temperature in equipment rooms
   increasing the energy efficiency of office buildings


12126 metric tons of co2 compensated for by certificates

telekom compensated for the co2 footprint left behind by events products and services totaling at 12126
metric tons of co2 during the reporting period

we reworked our event policy in september 2011 in consideration of climate protection climate certificates must
now be purchased for all events that generate more than 10 metric tons of co2 in order to eliminate their co2
footprint co2 compensation for events with emissions below this limit is voluntary project managers responsible
for events need to take climate protectionrelated issues into account even during the planning phase they can
use an emissions calculator to calculate values such as the emissions that will be generated by participant travel
to and from the event

we also compensate for co2 generated by products and services such as teleconferencing technology or
software for downloading videos and music

cr report from the previous year


we are also increasingly making up for unavoidable co2 emissions by investing in certified climate protection
projects such as a biomass energy project in brazil and a small water power plant project in costa rica 30
percent of the climate certificates comply with the gold standard the strictest requirements for emission

reduction projects worldwide and 70 percent comply with the voluntary carbon standard which is recognized
internationally as well


greenpeace telekom is climate leader

at the annual meeting of the european business association business europe which was held in brussels in
may 2011 the environmental protection organization asked companies to support euwide legislation calling for
a 30 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 at the event greenpeace selected telekom to be
one of ten european climate leaders thereby recognizing them as a role model when it comes to supporting
the ambitious eu climate policy


measuring emissions along the value chain

we have introduced the measurement of our scope 1 and 2 emissions at international level over the past few
years to do this we use the data provided by our international units in the groupwide cr database in which
each company records the number of kilometers driven consumption of fossil fuels and electricity consumption
based on this data we calculate the scope 1 and 2 co2 emissions using a coefficient

we are aware that this only reflects part of our impact on the climate additional emissions are generated in
particular during the production and transport of the goods that we purchase from our suppliers as well as when
customers use our services in the past we have only recorded part of these emissions which are referred to as
scope 3 emissions we intend to record them in their entirety in the future

we will continue to work on a new ict greenhouse gas standard for scope 3 emissions along with suitable
measurement methods in collaboration with other companies in 2012 we conducted workshops with two
selected strategic suppliers during the reporting period in order to learn more about the emissions generated by
our suppliers initial measures for estimating emissions generated by customers are scheduled for 2012


employees paint for climate protection

at the end of january 2012 telekom challenged its employees to get artistic to show what they themselves or
telekom are doing to protect the climate and the environment the aim of the campaign was to actively involve
employees in reporting and raise awareness of climate and environmental issues in total 55 works of art were
submitted by 40 employees all contributions are exhibited in a digital picture gallery as part of the cr report

climate protection initiatives
fighting global warming will be one of the main issues in our future close collaboration between the worlds of
business politics and society is very important in developing effective approaches to climate protection that is why
telekom is involved in numerous initiatives to protect the climate and the environment

we made efforts to drive the topic during our participation in the united nations cop             17 climate protection
conference which was held in december 2011 in durban at the conference we emphasized the central role of the
ict industry in realizing co2 reduction targets as well as the necessity of developing specific mandatory objectives

   public policy gesi used the united nations cop       17 climate conference which was held in durban in
    december 2011 as an opportunity to engage in numerous activities in which telekom also participated as a
    member of gesi for example gesi hosted an ict day in collaboration with the international
    telecommunication association and launched the transformative step of the day initiative with the objective of
    initiating measures for reducing co2 at a local level gesi presented an award to three governmental initiatives
    within this context a danishkoreanmexican publicprivate partnership as well as two chinese environmental
    initiatives the activities reflected gesi and telekoms dedication to climate protection and demonstrated
    solution options for the ict industry

positioning at the cop         17 climate protection conference
in addition to actively participating in the gesi events telekom representatives also took part in numerous other
panel discussions at cop        17 we teamed up with partners to effectively position ict as a key technology to
support co2 reduction in industry and business

standardization process for universal chargers
gesi worked to develop a standard for universal chargers in the reporting period under the leadership of luis
neves head of corporate responsibility at deutsche telekom the standard defines a comprehensive norm for
chargers for cell phones tablet computers cameras navigation devices wireless headphones as well as mp3
and mp4 players the chargers are comprised of a power pack with a removable cable which means that users
can use a single cable to transmit data and charge their device their universal application makes them
compliant with policies for electronic scrap prevention transport costs for new devices are also reduced as
specific chargers are no longer necessary the international telecommunication union a special organization of
the united nations approved the standard in may 2011 the most important cellphone manufacturers and
mobile network providers including deutsche telekom have already agreed to introduce the standard

majority of eu commission broadband code of conduct requirements met
the european code of conduct on energy consumption of broadband equipment specifies limits for the energy
consumption of broadband equipment in 2011 telekom informed the european commission that its dsl
modems had already fulfilled the requirements specified in version 3 of the code of conduct which had been
signed the previous year in 2010 as to xdsl equipment telekom complied with the relevant limits in 2011 in
2012 we will be reviewing the more ambitious version 4 of the code of conduct for signing

cr report from the previous year


telekom has been involved in the global esustainability initiative gesi since 2001 as a founding member
this industry initiative is dedicated to fully exploiting the global co2 reduction potential that stateoftheart
information technology offers society gesi also works to make the extraction of raw materials more transparent

and to improve social and environmental conditions in raw material extraction

as a member of gesi telekom participated in drafting the guadalajara ict declaration at the cop        16 climate
conference which was held in cancún in december 2010 the goal of the declaration is to more heavily use the
potential that ict offers for reducing co2 in close collaboration between the private and public sectors

an additional ten companies signed the european code of conduct on energy consumption of broadband
equipment in 2011 that means that already 72 percent of broadband connections throughout the eu are
subject to the code of conduct


platform for climatefriendly consumption

as a member of the product carbon footprint pcf project telekom has been helping set up a crossindustry
platform to promote lowemissions consumption since 2008 this platform was developed into a dialog forum
known as platform for climate compatible consumption in germany during the reporting period


supporting the ghg protocol initiative

as a member of the global esustainability initiative deutsche telekom actively participated in 2011 in drafting
the ict sector supplement to the greenhouse gas ghg protocol which is scheduled for publication in 2012
the supplement explains how to calculate co2 emissions in the ict industry and how to define relevant kpis
with the supplement we are making a considerable contribution to the international standardization of these
calculations other participants included organizations such as carbon trust the world resource institute wri
and the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd

in 2010 we participated in reviewing the standards developed by the ghg protocol initiative to calculate
greenhouse gas emissions generated by products and companies based on this the wri and the wbcsd
published standards for calculating product carbon footprints and recording scope 3 emissions in october 2011
companies can use these two standards to improve their co2 efficiency along the entire value chain to reduce
risks and to thereby create competitive advantages

 recscertified renewable energy certificates system scandinavian water and wind power plants we
 purchased certificates for roughly 3000 gwh in 2011 these certificates are reviewed and reissued annually by
 the technical services provider tüvsüd

 we test other technological options for generating renewable energy in various pilot projects for example we
 installed another photovoltaic system in bonn to test the use of solar energy for mobile base stations during the
 reporting period the results should be available in 2012 we also conducted a study to research conditions
 such as feedin rates for electricity supplied to the grid and local grant requirements for using power from
 renewable energy sources at 14 international subsidiaries this data will be used in the international
 subsidiaries sustainability programs


 pasm develops telekom 2020 energy concept

 experts from power and air condition solution management gmbh pasm reviewed energy use and
 procurement at telekom for efficiency environmental friendliness and supply reliability in the reporting period
 the company looked at different factors and potential components of energy management from the allip
 networks energy consumption patterns and the green power privilege under the german renewable energy
 sources act eeg to introducing a groupwide smart grid the review also took external factors such as legal
 requirements and technological developments into consideration the initial results were presented in the
 telekom 2020 energy concept in august 2011 we will be discussing the different energy concepts and their
 possible impacts on telekoms cr strategy with the responsible corporate units in 2012

 based on the results of the review pasm and deutsche telekom teamed up with deutsche funkturm deutsche
 telekom technik gmbh and group facility management to develop comprehensive measures to significantly
 reduce energy consumption from 2012 to 2014 these include

    using energyefficient technologies in the network infrastructure
    using highly efficient fresh air cooling systems for smaller network nodes
    using waste heat generated by telecommunications technology to heat buildings
    generating electricity heat and cooling locally

   using lowenergy lighting in offices

the energy concept indicates that it may take several years to successfully implement these measures
generating electricity cooling and heat using waste heat generated by technical systems to heat buildings and
increasing the energy efficiency of our equipment will positively impact costs and the environment we will be
installing additional systems to locally generate electricity and heat as early as 2012 however the review also
indicated that the direct procurement of energy from renewable sources as defined in the german renewable
energy sources act is not possible on a costefficient scale under current legal conditions that is why we may
initially be targeting highergrade certifications instead of the current recs certificates


pasm power and air condition solution management gmbh is a subsidiary of deutsche telekom ag pasm
is responsible for procuring provisioning and delivering power including the associated support services within
the deutsche telekom group


pasm energy management certified

pasms managing board designated an energy manager in 2011 and approved targets measures and
implementation plans for the companys energy strategy they also introduced an energy management system
for the production area pasm was certified in accordance with the din en 16001 energy standard in november
2011 as in the previous year pasm was also recognized as an energyefficient company pursuant to  41 of
the german renewable energy sources act by the german federal office of economics and export control


energyefficient facility management

effective facility management is a key component in telekoms efforts to achieve its ambitious climate protection
goals that is why we conduct an energyrelated inspection of heating and ventilation systems as part of all
facility renovation work and are constantly working to make our facility management practices even more
energy efficient we increased the energy efficiency of our facilities during the reporting period by conducting
various measures including

energy analysis we recorded the energy consumption of our largest buildings and conducted additional
microanalyses for three properties on the basis of different consumption measurements for areas such as heat
water and electricity we then came up with specific recommendations for further action the purpose of these
activities is to evaluate the facilities in terms of energy efficiency in accordance with the new energy performance
certificate in germany we are planning to assess six additional buildings in 2012 we have also begun including
investments for energy savings measures at buildings in our budget

efficiency kpi power and air condition solution management pasm developed an efficiency kpi for
assessing energy consumption at office buildings we commissioned the onsite analysis of ten properties based
on the results the analyses included heating and cooling equipment lighting ventilation systems and tools the
analyses also looked at how meters could be retrofitted to improve invoicing accuracy and positively influence
user behavior the microanalyses indicated savings potential for energy consumption of up to 15 percent we
have begun implementing the measures recommended by the analyses

introduction of led lighting we began switching over to led lighting for general areas such as stairwells
corridors and basements at several office buildings in december 2011 we are planning to conduct these
measures at other sites as well in 2011 we also initiated the ledoffice project with the goal of equipping all
telekom offices in germany with led lighting we already made the switch in some offices and assessed our
experiences in cooperation with group facility management procurement telekom deutschland and

tsystems we then commissioned the technical services provider tüv rheinland to analyze the results and
switched over to led lighting at other test sites we plan to evaluate operations at those sites in late 2012

in addition to six further microanalyses in 2012 we are also planning to conduct more waste heat projects for
example we plan to generate heat from central cooling equipment and using large heat pump systems located
in ventilation ducts this will enable us to tap the energy used to operate the telekom networks to heat our
offices a similar project in frankfurtmain is currently in the bid phase


croatia energy management at the company level

tht hrvatski telekom is aiming for clear synergies and cost effects with the launch of an energy efficiency

savings in the greek fixed and mobile communications segment

the greek subsidiary ote completed the evaluation of its second largest and most energyintensive
administration building in 2011 as part of its program launched in 2008 to calculate the carbon footprint of
buildings an annual savings potential of around 2500 mwh was calculated for the entire buildingrequiring an
investment of eur 700000

in addition the company is planning to increase the highest permissible temperature in office buildings by 2c to
26c this measure would enable some 750 mwh of power for air conditioning to be saved every year

ote also intends to improve its carbon footprint by switching to alternative energy production an application
was submitted in october 2011 to mount a 350 kw photovoltaic system on the roofs of commercial buildings in
attica in april 2011 a program for evaluating the potential of wind energy including a feasibility study for three
wind turbines was started in crete

efficiency programs in mobile communications segment a success
cosmote otes mobile communications arm also achieved high savings potentials through energy efficiency
measures during the reporting period these include the installation of systems for outdoor cooling or wind
turbines or the use of energyefficient communications technology overall the measures in 2011 meant that
some 3700 metric tons of co2 ie 28 percent of the previous total emission figures were avoided
furthermore the energy consumption at the base stations was decreased by 37 percent

in 2011 cosmote covered 11 percent of its energy consumption with renewable energy sources


hungary 51 gwh of energy from renewable sources

hungarys magyar telekom is increasingly using power from renewable resources for operating its facilities in
the 5year strategy the goal is to purchase 46 gwh of green energy by 2015 already in 2011 51gwh were
achieved this accounts for almost 23 of the total volume used by magyar telekom plc

in order to achieve its climate protection goals magyar telekom also launched a research and development
project during the reporting period at a base station in iszkahegy the plan is to power the station with wind and

 solar energy the technical equipment should be installed by late march 2012the generation of renewable
 energy should be continuously monitored and analyzed for potential of a possible extension

    previous car procurement strategy to include environmental aspects the policy sets forth a co2based selection
    procedure when purchasing new company cars these include vehicles provided by telekom to employees on
    account of their position or function that can also be used privately

    the intention is to reduce standard emission levels of all new fleet vehicles to an average of 110 gkm by 2015
    an objective that is also supported by purchasing energyefficient service vehicles this corresponds to an
    average consumption of 42 liters of diesel per 100 kilometers this fuel consumption rate will put us well within
    the eu climate protection target limit of 120 gkm for new cars applicable from 2015 even today
    detefleetservices only provides cars with a maximum co2 emission level of 190 gkm


    bonuspenalty program for company cars adjusted

    we introduced a bonuspenalty program on april 1 2010 as part of the green car policy       in order to motivate

employees to choose lowemission cars employees share the costs of both increased mobility and greater
strain on the environment in the form of a penalty if they choose a car with a high co2 emission level users who
choose a lowemission car receive a bonus in relation to the savings in fuel costs in the reporting period we
increased our bonuspenalty amounts for company cars by 10 bonus and 20 penalty cents per gram of co2
because of rising fuel costs

proceeds go to environmental organizations
in 2011 our employees who chose highemission cars made penalty payments in the amount of eur 300000
this amount was donated to nine environmental organizations deutsche telekom employees were invited to
decide how much money would be given to which organization more than 4000 employees participated in an
internal vote and decided to give eur 45000 to one earth  one ocean e v which was the highest donation
amount given to an individual organization one earth  one ocean develops technological solutions for cleaning
up plastic waste in oceans the organization naturparadies grünhaus came in second place eur 42500 and
co2freie schule third eur 40000


telekom fleet tüvapproved

the telekom fleet in germany received the bluefleet certification from the technical inspection agency tüv
rheinland for their lowemission fleet at the end of 2010 this certification is based on tüv rheinlands grpd
bluefleet standard and the companys co2 reductions of 19 kilotons in 2010 due to the fleets decreasing
co2 reductions telekom expects to receive tüv rheinlands certification for 2011 as well

cr report from the previous year


critical assessment by deutsche umwelthilfe

the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe duh checked the co2 emissions of different
vehicle fleets in germany and presented them with a red yellow or green card in 2011 together with nine other
companies deutsche telekom was presented with a yellow card despite its exceptional car fleet according to
duh this assessment was due to telekoms recognizable but still insufficient efforts to protect the environment
the high emissions produced by the company cars used by telekom board members which in some cases
clearly exceed 230 gkm are inconsistent with a lowemission fleet company cars for board members have
gradually been replaced with more efficient cars that boast an average of 183 gkm which is below the company
emissions cap


7600 employees receive driver training

the ecodrive program a training course designed to teach participants to adopt a more efficient and safe
driving style was extended significantly in coordination with the group units in germany a total of 7600 users
of company and service cars from deutsche telekom technik the technical service and tsystems
international participated in the program we were able to exceed our original goal of 6000 participants by more
than 25 percent

we will continue to offer the ecodrive program the training program is an important and effective tool to reduce
our fleets fuel consumption and a significant contribution by detefleetservices to achieving telekoms climate
protection objectives


using alternative drive systems

the number of detefleetservices vehicles powered by natural gas has been significantly reduced over the last
few years because manufacturers have not been offering suitable cars telekom still uses 150 natural
gaspowered cars which emit less co2 and other pollutants than other vehicles

we have also been testing the use of alternative drives for years we advanced various projects and explored
new opportunities during the reporting period

   since spring 2011 we have been conducting a test run with two electric cars from renault we will be
    collecting and evaluating the results at least until mid2012 based on our current knowledge electric cars can
    only be used to a limited extent as service vehicles user feedback has been positive if the driving distance per
    day did not exceed 100 kilometers and if they were able to charge them during the night
   deutsche telekom has been supporting the emobilityberlin project which is one of the most extensive field
    tests with electric cars worldwide since 2010 in this project detefleetservices and other group units have
    been testing the use of four electric smart cars
   since september 2010 our employees at group headquarters in bonn have been able to rent two electric
    smart cars for short periods of time in 2011 we added an electric car by volkswagen in berlin as a test car


green business trips

we are trying to make employee business trips within germany as green as possible in cooperation with
deutsche bahn in february 2010 we signed an agreement with deutsche bahn ag to eliminate the carbon
footprint caused by employees traveling by train

in january 2011 we introduced a flight ban for trips between frankfurt and munich exceptions to this ban are
only made under special circumstances with this and other restrictive measures we were able to reduce the
number of flights on this route by 935 percent the co2 emissions associated with such trips in 2011 decreased
from 735 extrapolated to 48 metric tons


23700 employees choose a climatefriendly way to commute

some 23700 employees in germany used a discount season ticket to get to work in 2011 the number of users
increased by 500 compared to the previous year

a regional season ticket offer is available at all telekom offices located in large conurbations in germany we
signed new contracts with regional public transportation providers in 2011 these new contracts make it possible
for employees in three additional citiesaachen magdeburg and chemnitzto get discount season tickets
some 155 employees took advantage of the new offers in 2011

we are planning to introduce discount season tickets in the german cities of hamm erfurt trier and kassel as
well as of 2012 we are also planning to compensate for co2 emissions generated by our employees use of
public transportation with emissions certificates

cr report from the previous year

award for discount season tickets
deutsche telekom received an award from the aachener initiative für saubere luft aachen clean air initiative
for its commitment to lowemissions mobility in 2011 the jury was particularly impressed by the introduction of
the discount season ticket for employees from the telekom and tsystems branch offices in aachen the mayor
of aachen marcel philipp presented the certificate on november 22

the city presents the award each year in collaboration with the chamber of industry and commerce the aachen
chamber of trade handwerkskammer aachen and the trade association einzelhandels und
dienstleistungsverband aachendüren ev


gps guidance system saves over 90000 liters of fuel

after a threemonth installation phase 300 slovak telekom company cars have been connected to a gps
monitoring system since april 2011 the intelligent route planning and control enabled by this system should
decrease fuel consumption by 10 percent thereby saving some 50000 liters of fuel per year slovak telekom
also participated in the european mobility week in september 2011the company introduced an internal tool for
using carpools and called on all employees to carpool or use public transport a total of 400 employees
participated in the initiative

systems in 380 cars in company fleets during the reporting period that enabled the companies to save 41500
liters of fuel compared to the previous year the companies also provided their employees with information on
fuelsaving driving practices which are also included in the user guidelines


efficient fleet management at greek subsidiary ote

the greek subsidiary ote developed and piloted a realtime guidance system for driving routes in 2010 the
system should be fully operational by 2012 and is part of a program to significantly reduce transportrelated
emissions the fleet management department has been iso 14001             certified since 2007


electric cars at several international subsidiaries

ptc was the first telecommunications company in poland to include three electric cars into its vehicle fleet in
august 2011 they are used by employees for service calls in warsaw a charging station was installed at the
entrance to the corporate headquarters

the hungarian subsidiary magyar telekom also integrated two electric cars into its fleet in 2011 the cars have
been in operation since january 2012 one in the technical customer service area and the other as a key car
for employees besides a five percent reduction of fuel consumption the sustainability strategy for the 2011
2015 period defines two basic objectives by the end of 2015 the average co2 emission of the vehicles must
not exceed 1577 gkm and the ratio of hybrid and electronic cars among all vehicles of personal use should be
increased to 20 percent in order to promote the achievement of the above objectives in july 2011 magyar
telekom issued a new group directive on benefit cars and subsidizes the procurement of hybrid benefit cars by a
special allocated budget and has elaborated a system of incentives bonusmalus aimed at encouraging people
to opt for lowco2 cars

the subsidiary globul in bulgaria launched a pilot project to promote sustainable mobility by purchasing an
electric car in april 2011 as one of the first electric cars in the country it has already been presented at several
green transport forums in a profitability calculation globul also describes the conditions under which switching

 the majority of the company fleet over to electric cars would pay off financially

reasons for the increase include constantly growing data volumes as well as the expansion of the data base at
some international subsidiaries such as tsystems uk and tsystems iberia nevertheless our considerable
efforts to save energy and to increase energy efficiency prevented the increase in energy consumption from being

 total energy consumption

 overall energy consumption increased slightly by 3 percent compared to the previous year this can be
 attributed primarily to heavier use of electricity and fossil fuels as well as to a change in calculation criteria at
 some international subsidiaries reasons for increased energy consumption include the constantly growing data
 volumes in our networks the increase in heating energy consumption fossil fuels is particularly the result of
 the long hard winter experienced by many international subsidiaries in 2011 eg tmobile usa which led to
 an increased use of heating see individual subsidiaries in the interactive subsidiary benchmarking tool for

 around 2 percent this corresponds with the reduction in emissions that result from the generation of electricity
 purchased by us for the entire group under our climate protection strategy deutsche telekom in germany is
 aiming to reduce co2 emissions by up to 30 percent by 2020 compared to the 2008 values that will be the

   data verified by pwc for detailed audit comments see dt group in germany and tmobile usa
 this reduction is counterbalanced by an increase of around 6 percent in direct emissions which result from the
 increased consumption of fossil fuels this trend is due in part to the long cold winters that affected some of our
 international subsidiaries such as tmobile usa we were able to reduce vehiclerelated direct emissions by
 around 9 percent by decreasing mileage and improving driving behavior

 emissions are calculated in co2 based on the different energy and fuel consumption values calculation
 complies with the greenhouse gas ghg protocol and is based on emission factors set forth by the

 energy sources either directly or indirectly in 2011 we purchased recs renewable energy certificate
 system certificates in the amount of around 3000 gwh as proof of the amount of renewable energy taken from

  deutsche telekom replaced gaspowered vehicles with more efficient dieselpowered vehicles in germany
  telekom pointed the way to the future by increasing its stock of electric cars to 137 however the number of
  vehicles powered by natural gas was reduced compared to previous years because we forewent purchasing

cr kpi used cell phone collection
we achieved outstanding results for the used cell phone collection cr kpi during the reporting period despite the
fact that the number of customers remained relatively constant we were able to almost triple the number of
collected cell phones this figure indicates the ratio between the number of collected cell phones in thousands to
the number of customers in millions

 cr kpi used cell phone collection deutsche telekom group in germany




    data verified by pwc calculation of collected cell phones is partly based on projections
during the reporting period telekom collected a total of around 762000 cell phones in germany thus we
contributed to the recovery of valuable raw materials ensuring that a proportion of the phones that still work are
reused and the others are recycled and recovered telekom made a donation to a nonprofit organization for each
cell phone returned we increased the number of used cell phones collected by more than 500000 compared with
2010 with proceeds benefiting the childrens charity bild hilft ev ein herz für kinder

the amount of waste reduced throughout the group indicates that a groupwide strategy to minimize waste
amounts is being effectively implemented despite increases here and there in the amount of waste produced

 water consumption

 groupwide water consumption increased slightly by 2 percent during the reporting period this trend can be
 primarily attributed to increased consumption volumes by the tmobile usa subsidiary approx  30 due to
 increased irrigation in the dry summer of 2011 the trend at tmobile usa is mitigated by a significant decrease
 in water consumption at deutsche telekom in germany ote in greece and tmobile netherlands the
 generally low consumption values of tsystems mexico tsystems iberia and tsystems uk increased due to
 extended data recording and partly due to rising staff numbers see individual subsidiaries in the interactive
 subsidiary benchmarking tool for details

tools for socially acceptable staff restructuring

we continued our efforts to engage in socially acceptable staff restructuring at telekom companies in 2011 we
use internationally proven tools giving employees the option to voluntarily leave the company as part of this
process in germany some of the most notable examples include early retirement for civil servants and the new
provisions issued in the fall of 2011 on phased retirement for older employees employees outside collective
agreements and senior executives whose responsibilities clearly extend beyond legal standards source 2011
