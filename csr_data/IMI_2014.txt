our growth agenda and provide our employees with the most
relevant training and learning opportunities in 2014 we will
continue to develop and enhance our core framework of
people processes including elements such as performance

development
in terms of ongoing development and in addition to the imi academy
which is focused on our graduate employees we operate a wide range
of training and learning initiatives across the group at all levels to ensure
we have motivated people with worldclass skills and a pool of potential
leadership talent
at the most senior level we run an annual imi leaders boot camp
for our senior business leaders this took place in may 2013 and is
designed to help our managers and directors achieve excellence in both
their current and future roles it also creates a network through which 80
business leaders can develop and share best practice
each year we also run our management fundamentals programme
which is focused on our high potential middle managers and aims to
prepare them for senior management roles in total around 210 managers
participated in this programme which runs across europe asia and
the americas in addition over 100 employees attended our emerging
managers programme designed for more junior managers which took
place across the group




        employee engagement and
        communication
        in 2013 we commissioned our third employee engagement
        survey and over twothirds of our employees participated 		
        while the feedback suggested that there are a number of factors
        that contribute to making imi a great place to work including our
        approach to health and safety and our clear business strategy
        it also indicated that more could be done to strengthen our
        performance management framework and boost support around
        career and personal development these will be key areas of
        focus this year furthermore later this year we plan to introduce
        a groupwide intranet to help with collaboration knowledge
        sharing and teamwork and to greatly improve communications
        across imi
