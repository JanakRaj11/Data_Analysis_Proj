energy and efficiency
because of the high level of hand crafting at naturepedic electricity
consumption is relatively low with many of the powered tools running
on compressed air the companys entire electrical usage at its facility
for example was only 23680 kw in november 2016 up from 22400
kw in november 2015

the compressed air power tools are powered by a kaeser twin screw
compressor optimized for naturepedics use to maximize energy
efficiency

to contribute to savings in electricity naturepedic uses

     renewable energy credits recs naturepedic offsets 100
    of its electricity use by recs purchased from greene certified
    provider nativeenergy naturepedic is recognized as an epa green
    power partner
     skylights the use of 13 installed skylights throughout the
    naturepedic facility both in the office area and manufacturing area
    use natural light to offset electricity usage
     energyefficient bulbs all workstations in the factory use energy
    efficient light bulbs
     drop lighting the majority of overhead factory lighting uses
    chainsupported energyefficient fluorescent lights by dropping
    the physical lights lower from the ceiling fewer lights are needed
    to illuminate an area
     hand crafting the handcrafted nature of naturepedic products
    means more traditional tools powered both by hand and by
    compressed air push carts and peoplepowered tools means a
    reduced carbon footprint and craftspeople more engaged with
    their work



heating  cooling
     air curtain a mars airsystems air curtain installed in the
    factorys speed door dock bay blasts air down when the bay door is
    opened allowing quick access by personnel and tow motors while
    conserving natural resources by keeping warm air from escaping
    the system prevents dirt dust fumes and insects from entering the
    facility providing a cleaner more sanitary environment
     radiant heat in 2013 naturepedic replaced an inefficient
    forcedair heating system in the factory with efficient ceiling
    mounted vantage radiant heaters

     increased insulation in 2013 naturepedic redesigned its roof
    for increased efficiency insulation value was increased to r65 per
    inch of thickness and a reflective white coating delivers an 85
    reflectivity rate this added reflectivity means the roof keeps the
    building cooler in summer and warmer in winter reducing roofing
    surface temperatures by around 80 degrees fahrenheit
     factory cooling the handcrafted nature of naturepedic
    products means fewer heatproducing machines than in traditional
    operations this allows the factory to be comfortably cooled in
    summer with fans



food  drinking water
naturepedic uses energy efficient filtration stations the move
saves the fossil fuel and co2 emissions associated with the plastic
bottles and associated transportation resulting in the elimination of
approximately 12 to 13 tons of truckedin bottled water per year the
filtration stations promote health and discourage the use of wasteful
individual plastic bottled water each system is energy star compliant
and the provider is iso 14001 certified

catered food for company events uses locally sourced and organic
foods and beverages when available



commuting  telecommuting
nearly 75 of naturepedics employee base in 2016 was amish van
transportation is offered to factory employees with a 100 optin rate
from our amish workforce reducing carbon emissions

senior staffers in design sales and management frequently use
telecommuting and teleconferencing to reduce commuting by working
from home



american made
naturepedic manufactures all of its mattresses at a single ohio
based manufacturing facility when possible materials are sourced
domestically for example organic cotton batting is grown by texas
farmers and some fabrics are also made in the us other materials
are purchased globally due to a lack of domestic supply latex foam
is made overseas as latex is made from rubber trees not grown in the
us additionally organic cotton ticking fabric is imported due to the

3    naturepedic sustainability report                                      2016

relative unavailability of certified organic cotton fabrics made in the
us fabric is finished by talented seamstresses at naturepedics ohio
facility the philosophy at naturepedic has been if it can be done here
then lets do it

even items such as shelves and foundations are produced in america
either at an inhouse woodshop at naturepedic or by local amish
craftspeople

in 2016 naturepedic installed a new encased coil making machine
allowing the company to produce the encased coils inhouse reducing
both production and shipping costs



recycling
naturepedic recycles refuse cardboard and plastic recycling capacity
increased in terms of volume in 2015 shifting from a single 8yd
dumpster onsite picked up once a week to two 8yd dumpsters and
again in 2016 to three 8yd dumpsters

naturepedic recycles polyethylene foam attained both from scrap
produced during the production phase of mattresses and from scrap
recycled from damaged product  abadger foam densifier from
avangard innovation reduces the material volume of the polyethylene
foam by a 901 ratio and produces a polyethylene brick then sold as
recycled material in the market

products that are returned and undamaged may be donated to
employees or institutions miscellaneous materials such as scrap
cotton are frequently donated to employees and nonprofit
organizations for repurposing



material use
cotton
naturepedics commitment to organic cotton contributes to healthier
soils decreased pesticides use and other environmental benefits
naturepedic exclusively uses organic cotton fiber and fabrics instead
of conventionally processed cotton in fact the companys certification
to the global organic textile standard gots expressively forbids the
use of conventionally produced cotton




4   naturepedic sustainability report                                      2016

the benefits of organic cotton over conventional cotton are numerous
the rodale institute 2008 estimates that organic farming removes
co2 from the atmosphere by as much as three times the rate of
conventional farming practices a 2008 report by the organic trade
association estimates that conventionally grown cotton consumes 25
of the insecticides and more than 10 of the pesticides used globally
a life cycle assessment of organic cotton published on behalf of
the textile exchange in 2014 found additional environmental benefits
to farming organic cotton the report estimates that organic cotton
compared to conventional cotton delivers a 46 reduction in global
warming potential 70 less acidification potential and most notably
a 91 reduction in the use of blue water ie water withdrawn from
groundwater or surface water bodies the report also found organic
cotton fiber was responsible for a 62 reduction in primary energy
demand vs conventional cotton fiber

naturepedic sources raw organic cotton from a collective of organic
growers in texas approximately 65 to 70 of the land on which
these members grow organic cotton uses only rainfed water and
no irrigation at all when irrigation is used these farms focus on
more efficient irrigation techniques primarily center pivot irrigation
systems equipped for low energy precision application lepa a more
efficient process over the more traditional furrow irrigation most
of the systems that are not lepa are equipped with lowpressure
drop nozzles that apply water just above the crop in large droplets
to minimize losses due to wind and evaporation a small number of
irrigated acres have underground drip irrigation

conventional cotton fabric is often processed with chlorine bleach and
formaldehyde many of the dyes contain heavy metals and azo dyes
all with potential health and environmental risks the cotton fabrics
used by naturepedic are certified organic

hybrid and modular designs
throughout 2016 naturepedic expanded sales of its eos organic
modular sleep system rolled out in 2014 the eos is designed to
decrease waste yet maximize comfort the modular design allows
consumers to replace only select components while keeping the
majority of the mattress this design means when a consumer desires a
change or needs to replace a damaged part they only need to replace
the component they need diverting huge amounts of discarded
mattresses from landfills

a related design is now used for naturepedic luxury mattresses
allowing a zipout top comfort layer that can later be replaced

forestry stewardship council fsc wood cardboard and paper
all paper cardboard and printing used by naturepedic are evaluated
for lifecycle concerns the majority of naturepedics packaging
materials are printed locally in ohio to reduce the carbon footprint
associated with shipping package printing is largely done with soy
inks with and the commercial printer we use maintains a valid fsc
chain of custody certification labels are fsc certified and cardboard
packaging contains the highest possible amounts of recycled content
virtually all of naturepedics cardboard packaging is 100 recycled

naturepedic supports local vendors and businesses in 2016
naturepedic began assisting a local lumber yard and manufacturer
in working toward fsc certification because initially earning
fsc certification can be a lengthy and time consuming process
naturepedic volunteered their expertise in certifications to help
this business write design and institute policies supporting forest
stewardship council and their mission of responsible forestry their
fsc certification will be complete by mid2017

latex
naturepedic only uses natural organic latex sourced from rubber trees
grown in verified sustainable methods the company does not use
synthetic latex or polyurethane foam or memory foam

naturepedic is one of the few mattress manufacturers to be granted
an fsc forest stewardship council chain of custody certification
for its latex fsc license code c123979 this certification issued by
rainforest alliance demonstrates that naturepedic has instituted a
validated internal audit system that allows the company to accurately
track and verify latex to the individual product level

when possible in regards to supply naturepedic uses fsccertified
latex

foodgrade polyethylene
in 2016 working closely with vendors naturepedic began sourcing
biopreferred polyethylene made from nongmo sugar cane this
polyethylene is used for naturepedics waterproofing methods
covered by us patent no 9259096 and other patents pending and
also used for inner cores in its lightweight mattresses

environmental stewardship and seeks businesses with demonstrated
commitments to the environment and social justice naturepedic
vendors collectively hold an impressive collection of certifications
for both environmental and social standards including fair trade
standards certification flo global organic textile standard gots
and ecocert



overall office  facility efforts
naturepedic works in its daytoday operations to promote its values
and live out its mission sometimes it is the small symbolic moves that
showcase this philosophy some of the gestures one can see around
the naturepedic office include

     drip coffee makers rather than individual cup machines using
    plastic pods
     paperless payroll system saving thousands of pages of wasted
    paper per year
     efficient water filtration drink stations throughout the facility
     use of organic and less toxic cleaning supplies
     use of 100 recycled copier paper
     installation of light timer in bathrooms to prevent wasted
    electricity

certifications organizations  memberships
naturepedic recognizes the confusion in the marketplace created by
vague and often misleading green claims found on everything from
cleaning products to office products naturepedic takes a strong
stance against greenwashing and carefully reviews all language it
uses on marketing and other written materials in an attempt to both
provide consumers with a clear understanding of the claims and when
appropriate show how such claims are measured and validated                organic certified
                                                                             by oregon tilth
                                                                               ot007086
to that end naturepedic uses reputable thirdparty certifications
and validations to provide consumers with a better understanding

by using certified organic cotton grown without pesticides
naturepedic has built bee health into its operations organic farming
allows for greater biodiversity while not using synthetic pesticides
and the combination of increased food variety increased habitat
and decreased pesticide exposure particularly the avoidance of
neonicotinoids created by organic farming can lead to an overall
healthier bee better equipped to fight off naturally occurring
pathogens and parasites additionally organic farming practices that
allow for noncrop plants to grow can mean more nutritious honey for
the hive this support of organic farming also supports butterflies and
bird life directly naturepedic maintains a butterfly and bee habitat on
premises moving into its third year

the future

naturepedic sincerely strives to make the world a better place and we take a long view of
what the word world means certified organic cotton fabrics and batting certainly mean
fewer toxic chemicals in the bedroom but they also mean a reduction in toxic pesticides
on croplands the creation of healthier soils and the support of safer conditions for
workers our certifications inspect for worker welfare organic latex provides supportive
comfort for restful sleep but also means a sustainable agricultural crop that removes
thousands upon thousands of metric tons of co2 from the environment each year our
goal as a company is to make products that support human health that also support the
health of the planet its all interconnected


we know there are costs to conducting business and we also know there are always ways
of improving for 2017 we are auditing and reviewing our logistical and warehousing
structure to reduce overtheroad emissions by streamlining shipments we continue
to seek out innovative ways to reduce production waste and when produced reuse
and recycle that waste we even continually look at ways to ensure our packaging is
more environmentally friendly sustainability is never an end point but a goal while we
know we lead the pack in healthier mattresses we dont measure our business against
the competition but against our own potential we will continue to push ourselves to
become even more sustainable in our business in the years ahead
