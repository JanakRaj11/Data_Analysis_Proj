efficiency programs we continue to operate on the principle that sustainability and our stakeholders form the backbone
of our performance and identity as a company although an evolving energy environment will demand a new approach to
areas of our business our commitment to this principle will remain unchanged
our vision for sustainable growth is reflected in our continued investment in natural gas infrastructure modernization
plans throughout our service territory to ensure safe and reliable energy delivery and our multiyear investment plan
for grid modernization which will further improve safety and reliability reduce the frequency and duration of electric
outages and enhance customer experience vectren strongly believes these investments in infrastructure modernization
contribute to the economic sustainability of our communities through income and job growth since their inception in

average of 1097 jobs per year
in our continuing commitment of environmental stewardship and strong economic performance vectren completed a
comprehensive integrated resource planning process in 2016 which included multiple opportunities for stakeholder
input and culminated in a transformative preferred future generation portfolio which calls for the retirement of three
aging coalfired units replacement with a new highlyefficient natural gasfired generation and a significant investment

g4dma economic performance
vectrens utility business remains the core of the company and is the key driver of achieving consistent earnings growth
by focusing on the execution of infrastructure programs and cost control strategies the company considers these
next several years as a time of transformation for the utility this transformation involves three components the first
component is the continuation of vectrens successful gas infrastructure investment programs to further improve the
companys ability to deliver safe and reliable service to its gas customers in indiana and ohio the company earns
current returns on a large percentage of the new infrastructure investments as provided in indiana and ohio legislation
regulation the second component is a new infrastructure investment program to modernize and upgrade vectrens
electric transmission and distribution grid that will improve the reliability of the electric system reduce the frequency
and duration of service outages and enhance the overall customer experience the company filed its 7year electric
infrastructure improvement plan in spring 2017 the third component is the expected diversification of vectrens
generation fleet that would improve our overall fuelsource flexibility further reduce emissions and enhance the utilitys
ability to adapt to new technologies and changing customer needs the execution of this third component is tied to the
indiana commissions resolution of the companys integrated resource plan irp the irp and electric infrastructure
plans combined with our ongoing gas investments will transform and prepare the utility business for a smart energy
future
in addition to these strategic longterm investments the utility is aggressively managing costs through performance
management and strategic sourcing activities together these initiatives allow the utility companies to earn at or near
vectrens allowed rate of return approximately 11 percent in 2016 which is key to achieving the companys financial
targets
in the nonutility business organic growth is expected to be the principal driver of earnings growth with the completion
of commodity business divestitures and key acquisitions between 2011 and 2015 infrastructure services is well
positioned in this strong demand environment infrastructure services distribution business is focused on utility pipeline
replacement and modernization work while maintenanceintegrity work remains the focus in the transmission business
infrastructure services organic growth strategy is focused on adding high quality highly skilled field personnel to serve
existing and new customers exceptionally well in addition to identifying strategic investments in equipment
energy services platform for energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure growth is now in place with
the acquisition of chevrons federal business unit in 2014 this acquisition positions energy services to compete in all
market segments federal public sector and sustainable infrastructure and meet the longterm demands as the national
focus on energy conservation and security renewable energy and sustainability continues to grow given the expected
rise in power prices across the country and customer focus on efficiency
the combination of business mix and focused strategies will enable vectren to continue achieving its established
financial targets and provide excellent shareholder returns
financial targets
over the past several years vectren has developed a utility growth strategy focused on gas infrastructure replacement
throughout its service territories while narrowing its nonutility business mix by exiting commoditybased businesses and
making key acquisitions within the infrastructure and energy services business sectors the goal of these initiatives is to
achieve consistent and higher earnings growth while simplifying the business structure and reducing risk the company
also recently communicated its plan for a smart energy future reflecting increased capital investment needs at our
electric utility coupled with our continuing gas infrastructure investments and supplemented by a strong nonutility group
outlook as a result of this focus vectren communicated increased financial targets in february 2017

initial higher costs for efficient products home energy reports that utilize behavioral science to influence energy usage
and commercial equipment upgrades and maintenance in 2016 the vectren ee portfolio achieved more than 46000
mwh electric savings and approximately 49 million therms for measures implemented or installed in that year most of
these measures will continue to reap savings for many years to come since their inception in 2010 vectrens electric ee
programs have saved nearly 980 million kwh vectrens natural gas ee programs have saved approximately 140 million
therms since their inception in 2006
vectrens ee programs are generally separated into two groups residential and commercial in 2016 the residential
electric programs achieved over 25 million kwh of savings and the natural gas residential programs achieved
approximately 4 million therms of savings the commercial electric programs achieved almost 21 million kwh of savings
and the natural gas business programs achieved an estimated 828 thousand therms of savings
vectrens demand side management dsm program implementers are actively seeking and researching which
methodologies will most accurately estimate savings potentials and in turn allow vectren to offer the most cost
effective ee programs to its customers expanding upon prior 2014 vectren thermostat research a smart thermostat
demand response pilot was offered for the 2016 summer two thousand smart thermostat units were installed in eligible
homes for with the intent of conducting a billing analysis for comparison to traditional summer cycler switches demand
response capable smart thermostats will not only be a viable option for savings but will serve as an avenue of customer
engagement
the energy efficiency department has also altered its primary mix of light bulb offerings due to the energy independence
and security act eisa policies larger amounts of led bulbs were incented in 2016 and leds became approximately
49 percent of all bulbs purchased in the 2016 residential lighting program led bulbs will become the only bulb
incented by vectren in 2017 due to these bulb standards
vectren continues to offer integrated ee programs meaning that its electric and natural gas programs are jointly
delivered to best penetrate customer markets with combined efforts the same home or business may be given deeper
savings in the same retrofit rather than having to participate in separate programs
demand response
vectrens demand response program referred to as summer cycler is a voluntary energy management program which
briefly cycles air conditioning and water heating units in customer homes during periods of peak electricity demand
summer cycler participants earn 5 monthly bill credits during the cooling season of june through september by cycling
off major electric appliances for short periods of time peak power demand can be trimmed with little or no customer
discomfort or inconvenience as of 2016 about 23000 residential customers have switches installed in their homes
over the next decade vectren plans to replace direct load control switches with smart thermostats today our direct
load control program is able to curtail 192 mw in peak demand savings during times of high use

g4en33 significant negative environmental impacts in the supply chain
vectren strives to reduce the consumption of new materials and the waste streams resulting from its extensive supply
chain our robust reuse and recycle program for hazardous and nonhazardous waste has diverted more than a half
million tons of waste from the landfill each year reducing the need to purchase new materials and generating new
revenue streams which help offset disposal costs this program has been effective in reducing environmental impacts
while utilizing materials already in our supply chain

vectren continues to seek commercial opportunities to recycle and reuse its waste products wherever possible and has a
robust recycling program in place across all business units
in the energy delivery business the gas distribution operations collect unused and expired natural gas pipeline for
plastic recycling in the power supply business the generating facilities have recycled nearly 90 percent of the fly ash
they have generated since 2009 for use by a cement kiln as a replacement for virgin materials in addition our f b culley
plant has recycled nearly 100 percent of the synthetic gypsum it has produced since 1996 construction routing for new
gas or electric transmission lines is planned to avoid or minimize disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas vectren
has engaged in these partnerships with an understanding that a focus on recycling and conservation during the planning
and design phase of a project can yield significant savings by limiting the longterm environmental impact
additional waste streams diverted from the landfill include paper aluminum plastic cardboard lamps batteries ballasts
electronic waste scrap metal oil wood debris and other items recycled reused and donated to local charities

safety
we have gained considerable momentum in terms of safety culture improvement and injury prevention in recent years
by increasing collaboration communication and engagement with employees at all levels of the organization
safety  collaboration
vectren continues to empower our safety culture teams at the grassroots level and provide twoway communication
between the local teams and the jointlyled safety culture advisory team the advisory team which is a mix of executive
operations and union leadership meets quarterly to review any overarching concerns that surface from guidance teams
and provides guidance and support of the strategic vision to improve culture and keep our employees contractors and
the public safe
to help the local teams improve processes and solve problems autonomously the advisory team has been working with
vectrens performance management and continuous improvement department to provide formal training and continuous
improvement events that enable crossfunctional process mapping root cause analysis and structured problem solving
so issues can be addressed by those involved with the work these tools are inspiring and enabling our workforce to
promote changes necessary to enhance safety
safety  communication
based on feedback from the safety culture advisory team and a safety culture assessment completed in 2013 we
decided to focus our attention on improving communication we send routine and formal communication including
weekly near misses and lessons learned safety reports the safety buzz newsletter as well as monthly motor vehicle
incident summary with preventative measures and an injury prevention update we communicate less content more
frequently and leverage technology to its fullest potential since all field employees now have email and mobile devices
safety  engagement
the growth of our safety management system continues to help employees protect our workforce assets and the public
from risk while aligning us with future regulation the safety management system vision is to empower others to live
safely by actively reducing risks aligning priorities throughout the organization and focusing on the everyday journey to
zero incidents
our longterm vision for colleague engagement includes continued growth of current safety initiatives relative to
collaboration communication and continuous improvement we believe by involving our workforce in activities that
support the mission and vision of our organization we can learn from the past and work together toward a more
effective safe and efficient future for all
