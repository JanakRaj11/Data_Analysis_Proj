    kogas will create a better energy world through
    sustainability management


    dear distinguished stakeholders

    i would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for showing your generous interest and support for kogas at all
    times as a result of our endeavors to promote energy welfare for the past 33 years we have positioned ourselves as
    an ecofriendly energy corporation for the public by installing pipeline infrastructure network of 4572 and 69 storage
    tanks of 1066 million achieving the natural gas distribution rate of 908 to local governments nationwide we also
    conduct 24 gas and crude oil projects in 13 countries worldwide such efforts enable us to acquire overseas resources
    contribute to stable supply and demand of energy and create added values with higher technological values as such
    we raise our prestige as a global energy corporation

    and yet stagnant demand higher volatility and accelerated competitions at home and abroad as the domestic natural
    gas industry enters a maturity stage requires us to transform our fundamentals we are committed internally to rising
    higher again as a trusted corporation by stakeholders by establishing a culture of ethics and integrity and reshuffling
    our corporate culture to this end respect for human rights is reflected in our corporate management to befit the
    global standard based on the charter on human rights respect we have formulated

    we diversify partnership models with suppliers by jointly advancing into overseas projects without being confined to
    the scope of the existing gas business in korea our cooperation with the shipbuilding industry for a long period of
    time in particular has contributed to the development of the korean shipbuilding industry driven by the spillover
    effects of related industries ranging from lng carriers to flngs to lng bunkering business at the same time we
    strive to reduce sustainability risks in the supply chain with diverse suppliers by formulating and operating the code of
    conduct for suppliers

    seeking to take the initiative in fulfilling corporate social responsibilities we provide natural gas infrastructure in a
    broader scale in islands and mountain areas with little access to energy including jeongseongun goseonggun and
    jeju island we also keep our eyes on projects that improve the quality of life for local residents in countries with the
    presence of kogas providing a playground for children in uzbekistan and sponsoring the construction of a technical
    training class for youths in mozambique

    we will take the lead in achieving growth in the gas industry in the future and creating new values specifically we will
    expand our roles in the new era of the ecofriendly hydrogenpowered transport fuel and establish a fuel cellbased
    distributed power network in order to address environmental problems such as micro dust under the new climate
    scheme of post 2020 we will also launch new energy projects in a selfdriven manner including lng bunkering and
    lng cold energy business to respond to stronger regulations in the maritime environment

    distinguished stakeholders

    driven by our cherished mission of creating a better world through better energy we will do our utmost to make the
    next 100 years for a world with new excellent and genuine future energy under the new vision of next energy with
    kogas

    thank you

     business of natural gas procurement

     management of lng supply and demand
     achieving shortterm supply and demand balance in response to a rapid rise in demand
     it has been required for kogas to devise strategies for stabilizing shortterm supply and demand because
     the demand for lng used for power generation to cater to the peak power depends upon tapping on the
     base load nuclear power coal breakout of unpredictable factors including climate abnormalities and
     earthquakes are also external influencers kgoas responds to the shortterm fluctuation in demand by
     planning for a shortterm and wintertime demand volume in april and october respectively and figuring
     out a volume to stabilize supply and demand based on the routine forecast of demand by organizing six
     meetings by the supply and demand measure team and two by the advisory council

     ensuring midterm stability in supply and demand through multifaceted efforts
     fluctuation in demand has been picking up as the level of demand for electricity is slowing down and
     baseload power plants are expanded kogas has further sophisticated the midterm demand prediction
     using a predictive model reflecting the recent records in demand and policy variables we aim to secure
     stability in supply and demand for the next five years reviewing the related situations post to the 12th
     longterm plan for supply and demand and considering market changes furthermore stability in supply
     and demand has been driven by higher reliability in demand prediction based on multilevel consultations
     among the government korea power exchange kepco and power generation companies etc

     initiating longterm optimization of supply and demand through stronger competencies in proactive
     supply and demand
     kogas seeks for measures to optimize supply and demand by specifying business strategies for lng
     trading because the global lng market continues to witness an excessive supply of lng and the short
     term trading volume grows from 19 in 2010 to 27 in 2016 using a subsidiary in trading can help
     maintain a supplydemand balance by enabling kogas  the parent corporation  to procure lng through
     the subsidiary if necessary and save procurement cost thanks to optimized transport that is why
     kogas plans to establish a trading subsidiary in the second half of 2017 its flexibility in handling volumes
     and function as a supplydemand buffer is expected to fundamentally ease potential supplydemand
     imbalances resulting from changes in the domestic demand in the future

     ensuring stable transport of lng
     kogas induces stability in transport by systematically managing flagregistered lng carriers a difference
     in the amount of a fare paid and a normal fare upon operating flagregistered carriers might lead to a
     dispute on the fare with the shipping company thereof kogas minimizes possibilities of such disputes by
     managing the error rate in the transport fare by minimizing it in addition we maintain safe performance
     of carriers by conducting ondock repair 10 times due to higher possibilities of safety accidents upon
     operating obsolete flagregistered carriers kogas error rate in transport fare in 2016 improved by 03p
     to 03 compared to the previous year and achieved zero dispute on fares and 255 accidentfree ship
     operations


     conducting sales management business
     as the roles of natural gases increase to improve the level of micro dust and achieve ghg reduction goals
     along with the needs for them kogas achieves management goals by disseminating and selling natural
     gases to cater to national energy policies we facilitate the sales of natural gases for cooling as a way to
     ease the power peak in summer time we have established longterm strategies for cooling to come up with
     effective measures to boost sales and expanded institutional support including payment of allowances
     for gas cooling and stringent measures for the obligatory ration for gas cooling in public institutions etc
     as a consequence the sales volume for natural gases for cooling reached 260000 tons up 18 from the
     previous year contributing to the growth of 2 in the power reserve rate during the peak time meanwhile
     we seek for and initiate ways to expand the sales of compressed natural gas cng for transport as a
     countermeasure against micro dust ways to increase the cng sales are payment of subsidies for cng
     expansion of cngpowered widearea express buses pilot business of cngpowered chartered bus and
     expansion of recharging stations for longdistance vehicles etc we have devised a scheme to obligate the
     usage of cng to new routes of metropolitan widearea buses while securing applicable laws based on
     which we plan to raise the future sales of cngpowered vehicles

                   been made more stringent from 35 by 05 by 2020 to be applicable to all oceans which spotlights
                   attention to lng as a new fuel for ships which can replace the existing fuel for ships accordingly the
                   global demand for lng bunkering is expected to increase up to 3 million tons in 2020 and 22 million tons
                   by 2030 we pave the way to establish related systems and infrastructure so that we could create a new
                   demand for natural gases through the development of lng bunkering business
                   kogas laid the foundation for installing gas storage facilities within ports by improving related laws and
                   regulations including the port act and the enforcement rules of the urban gas business act we strive to
                   facilitate lng bunkering by establishing the basic facility for ship bunkering in tongyoneg lng terminal
                   and installing the lng bunkering function on one carrier for jeju from september 2019
                   in addition we have strengthened business activities for lngpowered ships for major ship owners to
                   facilitate the dissemination of lng fuelpowered ships and also strive to exchange information and
                   conduct joint business with advanced companies abroad plans are underway to continuously establish
                   infrastructure to make preemptive responses to lng bunkering business by devising related laws on ship

     of regional divisions is channeled into terminal treatment plants for treatment moreover the production
     process of natural gases requires a miniscule amount of water making such a small impact on the water
     environment lng terminal divisions are managed below the statutory level of concentration for water
     pollutants as they are equipped with oil treatment facilities moreover the seawater entering into an open
     rack vaporizer orv in the lng gasification process is discharged into the coast without any environmental
     impact after being used for heat exchange

     management of hazardous chemicals
     major hazardous chemicals used on sites include sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrogen chloride hci
     they are used to adjust the level of ph within water tanks of the submerged combustion vaporizer
     smv which serve as lng gasification facilities such substances in particular are used in a lower level
     of concentration which are not classified as hazardous ones causing no harm to the body and the
     environment hazardous chemicals used are managed according to legitimate procedures without leakage

     waste management
     we stringently apply the treatment standards above the statutory levels prescribed in related laws on the
     waste generated from sites in the middle of production and supply process and construction works data
     on waste is recorded in the it system for internal environmental management on a monthly basis and
     is reflected in the next years plan to lower the amount of waste generated we proactively take part in
     the government policy on control and recycling of waste and continuously reduce the amount of waste
     discharge by transparently managing the entire process from discharge to delivery and final treatment
     we ensure that waste treatment companies are periodically guided and inspected so that waste generated
     from sites could be appropriately treated waste being generated in all sites of kogas registered in allbaro
     system httpwwwallbaroorkr in real time whenever it is discharged delivered and treated and it is
     disclosed through the environmental information disclosure system once a year

     protection of biodiversity
     kogas conducts the environmental impact assessment to seek for ecofriendly and sustainable
     development by predicting and evaluating the impact of construction or operational projects on
     environmental changes in advance and devising measures for environmental conservation in addition
     we conduct followup review on environmental impact for expost management and monitoring upon
     the completion and operation of construction works changes in the habitation of flora and fauna and
     observational review of the aquatic ecosystem are discussed in the consultation council consisting
     of related specialists  project companies representatives of local residents in the area of review and
     organizations of environmental conservation we also come up with measures for improvement through
     consultation with them upon exploring points for improvement results of biodiversity review are
     submitted to a related local government to be subject to verification of appropriateness and feasibility
     which are registered in the information support system for environmental impact assessment and
     disclosed accordingly

     prevention of marine pollution
     kogas has established a system to promptly and efficiently respond to sites of accident by devising a
     manual on onsite actions to respond to marine disasters in addition we are fully equipped with more
     disaster reduction supplies than statutorily required along with continued training against potential
     accidents thereby minimizing secondary environmental damage resulting from accidents

risks and opportunities   there has been a greater interest in measures for climate change because of the continuous increase in the carbon
of climate change         emissions  the cause for global warming  and from the onset of the paris agreement in korea directions to convert
                          into fuels for power generation including coal are positively reviewed and roles of the natural gas lng  a lowcarbon
                          emitting fuel  is expected to play intensified roles as an intermediary fuel which might be an opportunity for kogas
                          furthermore kogas initiation to diversify its business into new and renewable energy sectors including hydrogen energy
                          and lng bunkering business is expected to significantly contribute to higher revenues and kogas financial structure
                          meanwhile kogas is aware of the necessity of cdm business while exploring business for reduction in emission some of
                          the business cover a need to procure emission credits as the amount of allocation by the government is reduced by phase
                          including the amount of paid allocation and also improving facilities to control procurement cost we currently conduct
