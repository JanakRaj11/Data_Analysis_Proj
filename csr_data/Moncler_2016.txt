letter
to stakeholders
2015 was a particularly significant year for moncler
in addition to its positive business and financial results the year saw a strong acceleration in the groups commitment to an
ever more sustainable and responsible path to growth

during the year we established a sustainability unit dedicated to supporting the integration of social and environmental
factors into our business decisionmaking in addition we have expanded the scope of responsibility of the control and risks
committee within the board of directors to include sustainability issues so that these can be brought formally to the attention
of the highest level of the companys governance

this commitment is also evidenced in the publication of our first sustainability plan and sustainability report which are both
fundamental tools that help share our performance and future plans in this area with our stakeholders
all of the companys departments contributed to the production of both the plan and the report this was an active and
participatory process rooted in an awareness that a responsible company is also a company consisting of responsible people
people who know how to assimilate and then implement the organizations guiding principles not only when it comes to
strategic decisions but also in relation to daytoday actions im proud to be able to say that moncler would not be what it is
today  nor will it fulfill its future potential  without the talent passion and creative energy of its people

the most challenging of our 2015 projects related to down traceability thanks to the hard work of a group of experts and also
representatives of a number of stakeholders moncler has created the down integrity system and traceability dist protocol
which suppliers are required to implement scrupulously so as to ensure animal welfare throughout our down supply chain in
order to verify the correct application of the protocols requirements an expert third party has carried out more than 120 audits
its work has in turn been audited by a second accredited external body in 2016 we are committed to purchasing only down
that has been awarded the dist certification
over the course of the year we have also continued to monitor our supply chain via thirdparty socialethical audits
in spite of the continuing tough economic context moncler has created new jobs and offered professional opportunities to
young people the agegroup that particularly in italy has been amongst the hardesthit by the economic downturn in 2015
over 40 of all those who joined the group in italy and worldwide were aged under 30

the pursuit of the perfect comprehensive integration of sustainability into the way any company does business is by its nature
a neverending challenge and with this in mind we will not settle for the results achieved to date but instead will continue to
move forward applying our innate desire for improvement
while we are aware that we are only at the beginning of this process and that we have a long road ahead of us requiring a
great deal of hard work thought time and expertise we are also sure we have established solid foundations on which to build
the sustainable future we desire

we pursue sustainability and responsible behavior not only with the purpose of being competitive today and even more so in
the future but above all because we ourselves judge the value of our results by how we have achieved them and because we
believe that success is durable only if it contributes to creating shared value


                                                                                      the chairman and chief executive officer

represented by trade unions it maintains an ongoing relationship with union
representatives in a spirit of reciprocal recognition dialogue and cooperation

dialogue with a view to engaging workers representatives and maintaining a
positive climate in the company

of conflict thanks to the collaborative climate that moncler has sought to build
over the years once again in 2015 no strikes or union protests were organised
against moncler by workers employed by group companies similarly no
evidence was found of any action undermining freedom of association and the
right to collective bargaining or placing those rights at risk

padua  italy corporate office headquarters for all group operations agreements
reached included the recognition of production bonuses for 2015 and 2016 for
employees at trebaseleghe connected with the achievement of certain company
results

certain strategic decisions can have repercussions for employees accordingly in the
event of significant organisational changes such as the reorganisation of processes
or other plans of significant impact the group is committed to activating the
disclosure and consultation procedures contemplated by law

responsible ict components and equipment




moncler is committed to minimising the environmental impact of the informa
tion and communication technology ict that it uses it constantly seeks to
identify more efficient and innovative solutions and provides its italian and
international offices with guidelines for the purchase of environmentally
friendly ict equipment
moncler primarily uses multifunctional devices that print copy and scan all
in one which reduces energy consumption and simplifies maintenance existing
devices are progressively replaced with lower energy consumption units
since 2013 the group has pressed ahead in italy with a programme to replace
all hardware components and video terminals with new energy starcertified
devices energy star is a voluntary energy efficiency programme one of the
most wellknown worldwide developed jointly by the us environmental
protection agency and the us department of energy energy star is designed
to reduce costs and help protect the environment through the introduction of
energy efficient products and practices products carrying the energy star logo
guarantee excellence in energy performance

in recent years the group has been working to reduce replace consolidate and
virtualise its servers a commitment that has brought considerable benefits in
terms of energy consumption and related co2 emissions the extension of the
virtualisation programme and introduction of blade technology in data
centres has led to the use of smaller servers designed to minimise the energy
needed to cool the machines and optimise the use of space boosting performance
in june 2014 blade ibm pureflex servers were introduced in the trebaseleghe
corporate office padua  italy the initiative has led to a saving of over 50
in terms of annual kwh consumed per year equal to approximately 263
tonnes of co2 emissions saved per year compared to the technology replaced
of equal capacity also in trebaseleghe the use of blade servers was paired
with a sophisticated programme for the virtualisation of data management that
guarantees excellent computational capacity and full consolidation of physical
facilities further reducing sources of energy waste in addition to this in one of
the two server rooms racks were installed featuring an integrated cooling system
which further contributes to improving energy consumption
in 2015 an additional 41 virtual servers were created bring the number up
to 245 implemented on 24 physical servers used by moncler group in 2016
another 10 virtual servers will be introduced

in an effort to increase awareness among employees of the environmental impact
of their daily activities and foster more virtuous practices in 2016 personal codes
will be introduced in italian corporate offices for the use of printers the initiative
is designed to encourage the responsible use of resources and rationalise the
number of documents printed and hence the amount of toner and paper consumed

 emissions saved thanks to use of videotele conferencing technology was estimated adopting the following assumptions
  only videotele conference calls lasting more than 20 minutes were taken into consideration
  the average number of participants in each videotele conference call was assumed to be four people
  flights were associated to each international videotele conference call co2 estimates were calculated on the basis of the distance in kilometres
		 between the cities linked in the videotele conference call assuming two people would have taken flights in economy class
  road trips by dieselfuelled car were associated to each national videotele conference call co2 estimates were calculated on the basis of the distance
		 in kilometres between the cities linked in the videotele conference call
  for calls involving links to more countries eg italy japan and the united states only one calling point and one receiving point were considered
  the factors used for calculating emission savings are those published by the uk department for environment food and rural affairs defra in 2015
