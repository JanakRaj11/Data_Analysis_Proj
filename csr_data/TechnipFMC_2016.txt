as far as construction sites are concerned the largest portion of                    of large quantities of clean soil which have been reused onsite
nonhazardous waste generated was made of soil rock concrete                        for backfilling and for an environmental restoration project on a

                          nature and scope of our work
                          we conducted around ten interviews with the persons responsible for preparing the csr information in the departments in charge of
                          collecting the information and where appropriate responsible for internal control and risk management procedures in order to
                           assess the suitability of the guidelines in terms of their relevance completeness reliability neutrality and understandability and

                             taking into account industry best practices where appropriate
                           verify the implementation of datacollection compilation processing and control process to reach completeness and consistency of

                             the csr information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the csr
                             information
                          we determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the csr information with
                          respect to the characteristics of the company the human resources and environmental challenges of its activities its sustainability
                          strategy and industry best practices
                          regarding the csr information that we considered to be the most important 3
                           at parent entity level we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information

                             organisation policies actions performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified using sampling tech
                             niques the calculations and the consolidation of the data we also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with
                             the other information in the management report
                           at the level of a representative sample of entities selected by us 4 on the basis of their activity their contribution to the consolidated

                             indicators their location and risk analysis we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied and we performed
                             tests of details using sampling techniques in order to verify the calculations made and reconcile the data with the supporting documents
                             the selected sample represents on average 20 of headcount and between 18 and 79 of quantitative environmental data disclosed
                          for the remaining consolidated csr information we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the company
                          we also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed either in whole or in part
                          we believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used based on our professional judgement are sufficient to provide a
                          basis for our limited assurance conclusion a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures
                          due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems the risk of not
                          detecting a material misstatement in the csr information cannot be totally eliminated

                          conclusion
                          based on the work performed no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the csr information
                          taken as a whole is not presented fairly in accordance with the guidelines
