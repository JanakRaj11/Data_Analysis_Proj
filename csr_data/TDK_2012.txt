     energy on a global scale
     in our modern world it has become clear that energy problems
     must be tackled on a global scale while the demand for energy
     still is on the rise a plentiful supply is by no means assured
     finding ways to distribute energy more efficiently and utilizing
     alternative sources to fossil energy are therefore topics of vital
     importance

     sources is progressing the tdk group participates in these
     efforts through its power capacitor business
