         energy
         with regard to energy efficiency cascades has a good head start on its competitors
         and the market in general this is because on the one hand transforming recycled
         fibre takes less energy than wood and on the other we have a group of specialists
         among our ranks who have spent the past 20 years working on reducing the
         energy consumption of our plants these strategic decisions are reflected in real
         savings at the end of 2015 the average consumption of cascades plants was
         99 gigajoules 1 per metric tonne of saleable products while the canadian
         industry average is 2576 gjmt 2
         1
             ratio of energy used includes the gigajoules that are generated internally from black liquor at one of
             our plants differs slightly from the ratio of energy purchased 967 gjmt

        greenhouse
        gas
        in recent years cascades has converted its steam boilers from heavy oil to natural
        gas systems in addition to improved energy efficiency these changes have also
        reduced emissions of particulates sulphur compounds and greenhouse gases
        combined with business decisions these initiatives have enabled us to reduce our
        greenhouse gas emissions by 51 between 1990 and 2015




        water
        in the paper industry water is essential for processing and transforming fibres
        and other raw materials it is also used in a slew of related activities such as
        washing cooling and the production of steam energy once again the nature of
        cascades activities constitutes an indisputable competitive advantage as
        producing paper from recycled fibre requires much less water than processes
        involving the transformation of wood into wood fibre at the end of 2015
        cascades plants average water consumption was 99 cubic metres per metric
        tonne of saleable products while the canadian industry average is 65 m3mt 1
