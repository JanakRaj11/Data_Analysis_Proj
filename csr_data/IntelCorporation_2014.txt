                                         actual chips vary in size depending on the specific product the npi is indexed to a baseline year of 1999 with the exception of our greenhouse gas emissions and energy
                                         use indicators which use a baseline year of 2000 one important limitation of the npi is that it does not take into account the number of additional manufacturing steps
