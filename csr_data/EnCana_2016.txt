land management
our land management practices enable responsible use and development of land
resources we include life cycle analysis planning and mitigation in our activities
from the initial site and risk analysis through to abandonment and reclamation
our land management programs are comprehensive they ensure that
environmental risks are effectively identified and managed and include
mandatory programs that minimize reclaim or remediate impacts to land
throughout the life of the asset

responsible products for hydraulic fracturing
encanas responsible products program provides our operations teams with
guidance on managing additives and chemicals used in our hydraulic fracturing
and drilling operations our responsible products program helps us manage our
regulatory risk and mitigate potential environmental and community impacts this
is accomplished by maintaining an inventory of the products we use assessing
the potential impacts of those products to the environment and public health
and by using only those products which we have screened and that meet our
standards in our operations

spill prevention and management
preventing spills is essential to limiting our environmental impact ensuring a
safe workplace and reducing costs effective spill management requires routine
maintenance situational preparedness and continuous improvement in every
phase of our operations
our spill prevention principles focus our efforts on four areas transferring
fluid following procedures ensuring equipment integrity and considering spill
prevention in our site design we use these four focus areas to promote tangible
fieldbased practices that are incorporated into our operations and work sites to
prevent spills from occurring

waste management
effective waste management enables encana to minimize our impacts to the
environment our waste management practices ensure that waste generated by
our activities is appropriately classified for proper handling storage transportation
tracking and disposal in accordance with regulatory requirements
