		 introduction by the president


            this report was published in the year in which de nederlandsche bank
            celebrates its 200th anniversary from its inception in 1814 dnb has acted as the
            guardian of financial stability of course this role has changed its nature over
            the years however it was clear from the start that financial stability is an
            indispensable ingredient of sustainable welfare it is a precondition for balanced
            economic growth which in turn generates the resources underlying social
            cohesion sustained development and importantly longterm planning
            the financial crisis that impacted the world over five years ago now illustrates
            this complex intertwinement this crisis caused financial disruption on a global
            scale and efforts to restore stability have come at a high cost to society in the
            form of substantial unemployment and loss of income such developments may
            exacerbate existing social tensions such as those associated with access to and
            use of energy and natural resources in discharging its duties dnb has
            contributed to financial stability and hence to sustainable welfare throughout its
            200year existence

            a further increase of sustainable welfare in our country requires focussed policy
            commitment in a number of areas to begin with the cyclical situation
            increasingly permits a return to a strict interpretation of the dutch trendbased
            budgetary policy preferably including the former cautious projections of
            economic growth this will provide a clear framework for the options open to
            the government in consolidating its balance sheet and restoring its financial
            robustness thus it will contribute to administrative calm and prevent unpaid
            bills from being left for future generations also changes in our society such as
            shifting employment patterns and demographic ageing have compelled us to
            question the sustainability of existing arrangements specifically as regards
            pensions and health care the cabinets promise of a fundamental discussion on
            the dutch pension system is therefore to be welcomed and a similar debate on
            the funding of our health care system would be advisable we will return to this
            issue below

            2013 was the year that saw stabilisation of the global economy and towards the
            end a tentative clearing of the cyclical clouds this happened and is still
            happening at varying rates the united states are currently in the lead followed
            by the euro area including the netherlands as a cyclical latecomer this slow
            recovery is partly due to the severity of the losses sustained and national
            differences in the nature of the problems another factor is the degree of vigour
            with which policy reactions have been pursued policymakers have taken
            measures to repair the damage caused by the financial crisis in europe
            an essential step has been the decision to create a banking union and reforms in
            important areas have also been agreed at the dutch national level still major
            efforts remain to be undertaken in several areas


            11 dnb  annual report 2013

                introduction by the president




		 global economic recovery gains momentum in late 2013
                in 2013 the global economy grew by some 3 gaining additional momentum
                towards the end of the year a further pickup of global economic activity is
                expected the fact that most of the growth acceleration was attributable to the
                developed countries shows that the dynamics driving global economic growth
                are shifting from the emerging to the developed countries the former will still
                record a higher growth rate of around 5 in 2014 yet the shift is remarkable
                as it used to be the emerging economies that  helped by expansionary
                monetary and budgetary policies  acted as the powerhouse of the world
                economy immediately following the outbreak of the crisis

                in the united states growth picked up speed in the course of 2013 economic
                recovery was also recorded by the united kingdom a major trading partner of
                the euro area in japan the stated growth strategy is paying off although in a
                longer perspective the united states has lost weight as a global economic
                player the country is still the main trading partner of many countries it is
                home to the worlds most important financial centre and to the international
                reserve currency thanks to these commercial and financial channels the global
                economic cycle depends in large part on that of the united states under the
                impact of continued recovery of the us balance sheet consistently
                accommodating monetary policy and a declining rate of budgetary
                consolidation us economic growth will pick up in the coming years resuming
                its role as the engine of global recovery paradoxically however this role also
                poses a risk to the world economy as the us economy regains its cyclical
                steadiness the unconventional monetary stimulus will be tapered off
                the sustainability of global economic recovery will crucially depend on the
                gradual and controlled draining off of the current reservoir of us dollar
                liquidity which is expected to cause a global increase in the cost of capital
                if successful this will enable the accelerating growth of world trade driven by
                resurging global demand to offset the influence of less abundant global
                liquidity conditions


		 vulnerability of emerging economies
                growth perspectives of the many emerging countries that are particularly
                sensitive to the effect of the tapering policy have deteriorated relative to
                precrisis times in those days economies profited from strongly rising
                commodity prices an exportdriven growth model consistently relaxed
                monetary and budgetary policies and high domestic credit growth in recent
                years many of these factors turned against the economies of emerging countries
                countries that have pegged their exchange rates to the us dollar and countries
                where imbalances have built up in recent years are now particularly vulnerable
                this showed when in mid2013 financial markets started to anticipate the federal
                reserve boards decision to phase out its expansionary liquidity policy
                countries including brazil india indonesia south africa and turkey began to
                feel the effect of consequent portfolio reallocations on their economies relaxed
                monetary policies in these countries had fuelled increased capital inflows and in
                some cases substantial domestic credit expansion and concomitant buildup of
                large foreign debts often denominated in foreign currency and carrying short
                maturities if tapering entails the uncontrolled adjustment of global capital
                flows this will have adverse effects on such vulnerable countries both as regards
                the business cycle and in terms of financial stability conversely a controlled
                adjustment may trigger a growth slowdown to more sustainable levels
                intensification of global trade as a result of a cyclical resurge in developed
                countries may stimulate such developments a second factor that may help to

              achieve such a soft landing is continued dynamism in the chinese economy
              which drives economic activity in many asiatic and commodity producing
              countries the same applies to the pursuit of policies aimed to reinforce the
              economic structure and the creation of conditions for sustainable growth
              increasingly emerging economies find themselves faced with structural factors
              that depress their potential growth rates such as low investment efficiency
              demographic ageing and a suboptimal average education level especially in
              emerging asia potential growth in recent years has turned out below
              expectations encouragingly china has drawn up an ambitious reform agenda
              in this country the earlier growth strategy based on high investment activity has
              led to imbalances and vulnerabilities especially in and around the financial
              sector the reform agenda envisions economic restructuring such that more
              room is created for consumer spending and a services sector


		 global growth faces inherent risks
              the fact that the foundation for recovery of global growth appears to have been
              laid does not mean that such recovery will be particularly strong or riskfree
              underlying problems  the unhealthy financial condition of households
              financial institutions and governments plus the global excess liquidity  are too
              big apart from the risks attending the controlled draining of global excess
              liquidity buffer accumulation and debt reduction will take time also
              the financial problems in many countries have depressed potential growth
              a return to growth levels prevailing just before the crisis erupted is therefore
              unlikely sustained welfare will benefit from sustainable stable growth and a
              resilient financial sector policymakers the world over have committed
              themselves to this each from their own area of responsibility these
              responsibilities tend to be organised along national lines at the same time
              the credit crisis once more demonstrated the close international
              interdependency of all components of the world economy the fact that few if
              any protectionist measures were taken in response to the crisis shows that
              historical lessons have been put into practice in december 2013 the member
              states of the world trade organisation successfully concluded negotiations in
              the context of the socalled doha round the resulting multilateral trade
              agreement will benefit the growth of global trade this achievement also
              illustrates the strength of balanced international policy coordination that takes
              account of external effects


		 the euro area continue on course
              as the year progressed the euro area recorded its first modest positive economic
              growth since the crisis expectations are that the cyclical landscape will continue
              to clear up gradually yet growth remains subdued and will remain  across
              countries sectors and spending categories  heterogeneous if only because of
              ongoing balance sheet adjustments elsewhere too many improvements have
              been made in a relatively short period european political leaders have decided
              on the creation of a banking union  about which more will be said below
              many countries consolidated their public finances and implemented structural
              reforms macroeconomic imbalances decreased as did the financial
              fragmentation among member states relative calm returned to financial
              markets the adjustment programmes for ireland and spain could be rounded
              off successfully in december 2013 the return of sustainable calm and growth
              will require many further steps however and the improvements so far must not
              lead to a slackening of reform agendas the current rosier outlook and the
              gradual return of confidence are after all largely the result of expectations


              13 dnb  annual report 2013

                introduction by the president




                raised by actions taken earlier by governments and central banks the continued
                involvement of the international monetary fund imf in european adjustment
                programmes is highly desirable in this context such involvement furthers the
                objectivity modalities thoroughness and funding of adjustment programmes and
                has proved its value over the past few years yet the first responsibility for
                effecting more farreaching reforms and structural improvements lies with the
                countries themselves this is after all in their own interest a matter for concern is
                that while countries under a support programme have made substantial steps
                forward the pace of reform in large countries such as italy and france has been
                disappointing


		 imbalances abating slowly partly due to reforms
                the macroeconomic imbalances within the euro area whose painful effects
                became all too evident during the crisis have begun to even out at the same
                time the muchneeded strengthening of balance sheets in the private and public
                sectors has slowly been getting off the ground budget consolidation last year
                helped reduce the funding deficit prevailing in the euro area in most countries
                this has not yet led to a reduction of public sector debt ratios partly because the
                recession has dragged down nominal growth of gross domestic product gdp
                private debts however appear close to the turnaround point they have been
                clearly receding in spain and ireland given the size to which private and public
                debts have grown it will take several more years to reduce them to sustainable
                levels for reduction of public debt the amended european budget rules effective
                from january 2013 serve as guiding principles in the current environment of high
                indebtedness member states remain vulnerable to unexpected shifts in market
                sentiment governments will therefore do wise to formulate any growth
                stimulating measures in such a way that they do not result in higher public debt
                intensification of public investments could for instance be compensated for by
                spending cuts elsewhere in the budget

                the current account deficits of vulnerable member states were strongly reduced
                or even converted into a small surplus to some extent this is due to severe
                economic recession in those countries yet in spain portugal ireland and greece
                competitiveness is improving at a growing pace through labour cost moderation
                this is partly thanks to reforms in the wage setting framework leaving more room
                for decentralised wage negotiations in spain and greece company labour
                agreements now prevail over sectorwide agreements whereas in portugal and italy
                there is still room for improvement in spain wagesetting would also benefit by
                discontinuing the traditional practice of priceindexed salaries however
                the improvement in the cost of labour has not translated everywhere into lower
                sales prices further promotion of competition in product and services markets
                throughout the economic and monetary union emu as by the removal of
                restrictive legislation and barriers to startup companies could be useful in this
                respect macroeconomic imbalances exist throughout the emu and it rests upon
                every member state to reduce them deficit countries will find that the
                elimination of imbalances first and foremost serves their own economic
                robustness and secondly by implication that of the currency union in surplus
                countries reforms enhance the national growth potential and hence that of the
                emu

                the reform of euro area product and especially services markets clearly lags
                behind that of labour markets this is a cause for concern not least because the
                functioning of those markets is intertwined so that a lack of reform in one
                restricts the effectiveness of reforms in the other if there is more competition in


                14 dnb  annual report 2013

             introduction by the president




             product and services markets wage moderation will moreover lead to lower
             prices and not cause a mere shift from labour to capital in recent years
             especially the southern member states have laid the foundations for more
             efficient allocation of and increased demand for labour by relaxation of
             employment protection measures in countries such as portugal spain and italy
             a further relaxation of the right of dismissal in existing contracts deserves to be
             given priority as does a relaxation of rules for collective dismissal in greece and
             ireland yet essential for the effectiveness of such reforms is not only the de jure
             impact of legislation but also and especially its de facto impact the latter is
             sometimes influenced by factors such as bureaucracy judicial efficiency
             clientelism and in some cases corruption the latest global competitiveness
             report of the world economic forum for instance points to the adverse
             influence of bureaucracy in most euro area countries and to the presence of
             corruption in countries such as greece and italy also mentioned are
             vulnerabilities arising from the inefficiency of law courts in greece italy and
             portugal therefore judicial reforms in portugal and italy are welcome
             developments


		 financing economic activity
             in the effort to enhance the robustness of the euro area the financing of
             economic activity is a cause for some concern debates have focussed on the
             questions whether lending to the private sector whose growth in the euro area
             has weakened from 117 in 2007 to 10 in 2013 reflects depressed
             demandside developments or limited financial resources in the financial sector
             this debate is onesided however because what is essential is not the amount
             of credit but where in the economy the credit lands prior to the crisis
             for instance credit growth in some southern areas of the euro area was mainly
             attributable to households and real estaterelated segments of the economy
             there the credit contributed to imbalances in the housing market and the
             construction industry in such countries the drop in lending that followed the
             crisis was a painful but  in terms of sustainability  necessary development
             at the same time sustainable recovery in the more vulnerable countries of the
             euro area stands to benefit from lending to producers of exportable goods and
             services such lending may accelerate the necessary adjustment of the economic
             structure however parts of these vulnerable countries have seen lending to
             such export sectors decline in recent years this is a cause for concern also
             worrisome is the fact that recently established and small companies in the euro
             area are currently having difficulty in finding access to funding if only because
             this category includes innovative startups such companies play a prominent
             role in creating future productivity growth for this and other reasons
             expansion of financing possibilities as through the further development of
             capital and stock markets and of venture capital is of importance the european
             commissions recent study into the financing of the european economy
             provides important recommendations also relevant to the netherlands
             examples are better and more transparent disclosure on credit ratings
             an increase of private lending and the promotion of highquality
             straightforward securitisations


		 banking union
             the banks of course play a major role in the financing of economic activity in
             the euro area banks are increasingly enabled to do so as they are better
             capitalised and the creation of the banking union dampens the negative
             interaction between the solvency of member states and of banks as a result


             15 dnb  annual report 2013

introduction by the president




market confidence in the european banking industry can increase further
the banking union is a major structural reform in europe that is being realised
in relatively little time the speed at which the banking union is being set up
reflects the pressure from financial markets and the solidity of the support base
among policymakers regarding the necessity of this structural reform for
economic welfare the first element of the banking union that is to become
operational on 4 november 2014 is supranational supervision preceding its
introduction is a comprehensive asset quality review aqr of the largest banks
in the euro area this aqr will provide transparency on the financial condition
of the banks within the scope of european supervision the effectiveness of
such a review increases if clear and credible agreements are made on the specific
implementation of the safety net in case the aqr identifies a capital deficit
the final responsibility for the prudential supervision of all banks in the
participating member states will rest with the ecb which will cooperate closely
with national supervisors including dnb how the ecb will exercise its
supervision will depend on the position of the particular bank in the financial
system in this context the ecb will act as the direct supervisor for some 130
larger significant banks through dedicated joint supervisory teams composed of
staff from the ecb and national supervisors the less significant banks will
come under the ecbs indirect supervision while direct supervision will
continue to be exercised by the national supervisors the ecb may choose to
bring such less significant banks under its direct supervision as well european
banking supervision will bring new supervisory methods and processes and new
information needs while the ecb will oncharge the costs of its supervisory
work directly to the banking communities in the several member states
it stands to reason that banking supervision will become more costly as a result
regardless of dnbs continuous efforts to organise banking supervision in the
netherlands as efficiently as possible

the banking union will allocate staff for both the supervision of banks and the
resolution of problem banks at the supranational level this constitutes an
important step forward for without an adequate independently financed
european resolution mechanism the orderly resolution of banks will continue
to rely on funding by the national banking community or government
this would perpetuate the negative interaction between financial institutions
and national authorities it might even spark a conflict with european that is
supranational supervision european resolution aims to prevent future repeats
of the current excessive level of financial fragmentation between member states
and thus to contribute towards a level playing field that befits a european
internal financial services market with europewide risk sharing moreover
a european resolution fund may be smaller than the sum total of national
funds yet while welcome in themselves the current proposals on european
resolution still provide for only gradual and ultimately incomplete severance of
the ties between banks and member states over a period of ten years nor has
the safety net of the european resolution fund been given concrete shape
in this respect european supervision resolution and financing have not been
adequately aligned to the extent that risks remain at the national level
member states will have to maintain larger financial buffers and higher overall
reserves will be needed this illustrates the more general principle that holding
on to national sovereignty within a currency union carries a price tag

at the same time the european resolution framework aims to limit recourse to
public funds if a bank collapses through the bailin instrument
this instrument is used to write down corporate liabilities or convert them into
shares when a bank is in or close to default thus it serves to protect taxpayers


16 dnb  annual report 2013

             introduction by the president




             if the bailin instrument is to function properly it is recommended that banks
             build a clear funding structure including a sufficiently large and explicit bailin
             layer this will offer transparency to capital providers thus enhancing the
             credibility of bailin measures and reducing the uncertainty surrounding their
             possible effect also it will enable markets to make an accurate estimate of the
             actual financing costs  that is the costs net of implicit state subsidy through the
             deployment of public funds


		 unconventional monetary policy
             the decisionmaking process surrounding the banking union is welcome also
             from a monetary policy perspective monetary authorities played an essential role
             in reducing financial fragmentation in the euro area yet monetary policy cannot
             remove its root causes such as the negative interaction between member states
             and banks like many other central banks the ecb has fielded a broad range of
             unconventional monetary measures since the outbreak of the credit and debt
             crises bottlenecks in the monetary transmission mechanism were to some extent
             freed up through expanded liquidity provision to banks at the same time
             the collateral framework was relaxed so as to reduce the collateral scarcity faced
             by counterparties and sotermed outright monetary transactions omt were
             announced in order to stave off disorderly conditions in government bond
             markets the unconventional monetary policy of the ecb was subsequently
             relieved as banks became better capitalised taking their cue from the new basel
             supervisory requirements another relief factor formed the structural steps made
             to decouple banks and governments from each other it is important that the
             unconventional monetary policy measures should not be overburdened they
             may cause unintentional side effects and new risks especially if maintained for
             too long a persistently dominant role of the central bank in money and capital
             markets may disrupt the smooth and disciplined operation of those markets
             causing market parties to resume excessively riskseeking behaviour another risk
             is that the interdependence between central banks and governments increases
             for instance due to the large size of the central bank balance sheet in general and
             of the government bond portfolio on that balance sheet in particular

             over the longer term the high amount of liquidity created by the
             unconventional policy measures of the ecb poses a risk to price and financial
             stability premature normalisation may harm the recovery of the business cycle
             whereas a late exit could via excessive asset price inflation give rise to new
             bubbles and subsequent disruptions to be sure the prudent design of the
             unconventional measures limited some of the negative sideeffects setting
             conditions on the access to ecb financing facilities may impart the right
             incentives

             the unconventional policy measures should in due time be phased out
             gradually even though the design of the refinancing facilities in the euro area
             facilitates a more or less automatic exit their termination will have to be
             communicated with due care at all times a clear distinction should be made
             between conventional and unconventional policy measures communication on
             the use of conventional policy instruments centres on the future development of
             the inflation rate the unconventional policy targets the operation of the
             monetary transmission mechanism a complicating factor is the fact that this
             mechanism itself evolves over time partly under the impact of the economys
             response to changes in the environment the financial crisis has caused changes
             to the financial landscape and the regulatory regime which in turn will affect the




             17 dnb  annual report 2013

                introduction by the president




                transmission mechanism bank lending for instance may come to respond
                differently to movements in the policy rate


		 dutch economy on the way up again
                in the course of 2013 the dutch economy began to grow again it has however
                sustained a stiff blow from the financial crisis at end2013 gdp volume still
                stood some 3 below the level attained just before the credit crisis erupted
                moreover the improving macroeconomic picture masks strongly different sectoral
                developments most of the recovery is accounted for by large companies small
                and mediumsized companies are still experiencing more difficulty


		 the underlying strength of the dutch economy
                before economic growth can gather confident speed again a long slow and
                bumpy road will have to be travelled but there is no reason for gloom either
                the quality of our main production factor human capital is high by
                international standards and the same applies to the average financial strength of
                the dutch although not back to precrisis levels yet the average net financial
                assets of dutch households are among the largest in the industrialised world also
                comforting is the fact that in 2013 several parties showed responsibility by agreeing
                on institutional changes in such structurally important economic areas as the
                housing market the pension system social security and the financial sector these
                reforms are intended to make the dutch economy more flexible and hence more
                resilient although they bring a mix of pleasure and pain to everyone the reforms
                also provide clarity and as such they have stimulated dutch peoples confidence
                in the economy at end2013 for instance consumer confidence stood 24 points
                higher than at its low point in february it is now imperative that all intended
                reforms including those not completely implemented be pursued with vigour
                this will demand discipline because sustainable economic recovery also requires
                ongoing balance sheet adjustments for although encouraging steps have been
                made the muchneeded deleveraging in both the public and private sectors is still
                far from complete balance sheet restructuring takes time particularly in the
                current vulnerable economic conditions


		 sustainable welfare growth requires additional reforms
                apart from the implementation of agreed reforms further economic recovery will
                require patience strategic economic policy can best be geared towards creating
                conditions for sustainable welfare in a period after the economy has overcome the
                effects of the crisis this will involve efforts to make the dutch economy more
                robust regarding the public sector it is recommended that a critical look be
                taken at the composition and level of public expenditure public spending net of
                interest payments and the cyclical costs of unemployment and social support
                benefits increased by almost 4 of gdp between 2008 and 2012 this increase
                was largely accounted for by health care spending which also rose on an
                international scale this is one of the reasons why the coalition agreement
                includes measures to curb the growth of health care spending the scope and
                depth of any additional measures require political choices to be made notably
                health care in the netherlands relies mainly on collective funding as a result
                incentives are weak for both users and providers of care to use care resources as
                effectively as possible incentives for providers might be reinforced by
                emphasising public health results rather than number of treatments on the
                demand side patient contributions might increase cost effectiveness

introduction by the president




restructuring of the public sector balance sheet would benefit from a return to a
stricter interpretation of trendbased budgetary policy while trendbased
principles have underlain budgetary policy since 1994 successive cabinets have
in recent years amended these policy principles in a manner that is not
conducive to dampening cyclical effects or to the creation of governmental
stability also european budgetary rules which since the introduction of the
sustainable public finances act on 1 january 2014 have enjoyed legal priority in
the debate on the dutch national budget impede the operation of trendbased
budgetary policy the current improving cyclical conditions offer room for a
reformed and intensified trendbased budget policy such a policy should
include reintroduction of the socalled cautious economic growth projection at
the start of a cabinet term this also applies to the agreement to allocate any
budgetary windfalls entirely to the budget balance yet even if european rules
should at any point reassert their restraining hold on dutch budgetary policy
the need for political calm should still prevail it may be achieved through the
introduction of a correction mechanism providing for the automatic
cancellation of specific spending increases or tax reductions to prevent
noncompliance with european budgetary rules

to ease the budget balancing process and to confront the growing issue of
demographic ageing it is important that the earning capability of the dutch
economy should be increased structural reforms are needed not least because
our country faces a period where levelling population growth will exert negative
pressure on the potential growth rate the labour participation of dutch women
has increased in recent years although the parttime component of the labour
market leaves room for further growth at the same time participation in the
5564 years age bracket has increased considerably a trend which will be
reinforced in coming years as the pensionable age rises reduction of the costs
associated with the dismissal of employees in this age bracket which the
cabinet intends to achieve will make the 5564year old more employable and
thus increase their labour participation but these effects are temporary in
nature dutch structural growth potential will increasingly have to rely on
growing labour productivity high labour productivity is fostered mainly by
good institutions and highquality human capital an important element in a
small and open economy such as ours is the capability to absorb the knowledge
and innovations of others dutch education enjoys high international standing
and scores well above the oecd average moreover oecd research shows
the universal professional skills of the dutch which are expected to play an
important role in growth and innovation over the next few decades are
excellent

apart from higher investment in human capital investing in physical capital
goods may also contribute towards increasing dutch earning capacity
investments by dutch enterprises have dropped sharply since the crisis and are
now lagging behind companies in other eu countries crossborder investments
have grown though encouraged by increased opportunities for outsourcing of
capital intensive production processes dutch enterprises may in recent years
have shifted some emphasis across the border owing to the presence of many
multinationals in combination with a relatively small and open economy this
would partly explain the strong difference among enterprises according to size
larger companies emphasise exports and enjoy a relatively favourable outlook
also they have sufficient internal resources available and are relatively
profitable mediumsized and especially small companies by contrast have
been hard hit by a sharply contracted domestic demand have limited internal
resources and are less profitable evidently the low level of investment activity

               introduction by the president




               is to some extent due to the restructuring of the real estate sector that has been
               going on apace since 2008 resurging transaction volumes in the housing market
               and a moderate increase of construction order portfolios since the summer of
               2013 suggest that the real estate sector may be past its low point and will
               gradually exert less downward pressure on domestic investment growth
               however the fact that sales of existing homes are picking up does not imply the
               prospect of a rapid return to housing price levels that prevailed before the crisis
               this would be neither realistic nor desirable as ebbing tax subsidies and more
               restrained lending policies make for lower sustainable housing prices


		 access to corporate financing
               for many companies the ability to invest depends importantly on access to
               external financing in recent years this access has become less easy especially
               for companies that rely on bank financing including a large proportion of
               nonexporting mediumsized and small companies surveys show that
               limitations on bank lending to such companies are associated with increased
               credit risks stemming from the cyclical downturn another limiting factor has
               been the restrictive lending policies of banks facing inevitable and necessary
               balance sheet restructuring a healthy banking industry will thus create the best
               climate for healthy corporate lending conditions dutch banks are well on their
               way towards meeting the more stringent capital and liquidity regulations of the
               basel iii capital accord the stronger buffers required under basel iii will
               considerably increase banks resilience

               the financial crisis has illustrated the importance of broadened access to
               corporate financing a major step in this direction would be a dedicated
               programme or action plan charting existing impediments and suggesting
               possible solutions such a programme could take on board insights offered by
               recent domestic and international studies and could lead to financing concepts
               complementary to the banking channel a facilitating role in this respect could
               be fulfilled by the dutch investment institution nederlandse
               investeringsinstelling currently being formed companies with low disposable
               capital especially startups have a need for more riskbearing financing
               provided by venture capitalists or by the general public crowdfunding other
               possibilities may include a more prominent role for institutional investors more
               private equity or debt issuance the provision of subsidies and guarantees
               the growth of credit unions and especially the deepening of european capital
               markets through the harmonisation of bankruptcy and tax legislation
               underlying such alternatives which will anyway require considerable time to
               come to maturity will have to be the utmost transparency regarding inherent
               risks and their ultimate bearers such inherent risks are often substantial
               especially in sme lending and should as a rule be borne by private investors
               rather than taxpayers investors must be enabled to calculate their own
               exposures here too risk transparency helps for instance in the form of better
               data files providing commensurable financial information at the firm level


		 financial resilience of households
               households financial resilience will benefit by the shortening of household
               balance sheets while the net financial assets of dutch households are large
               much are held in illiquid forms such as the family home or pension rights
               and offsetting the assets are large debts mainly mortgages this constellation
               makes households vulnerable to adverse financial shocks it also makes the
               dutch economy vulnerable to the interaction between the housing market


               20 dnb  annual report 2013

                introduction by the president




                the banking industry and the pension system because it reinforces cyclical
                movements thereby increasing uncertainties how the household balance sheets
                are to be reduced is a matter for political debate since it affects several sectors
                including the housing market the pension sector and the financial sector
                generally the balance sheet restructuring process will be both complex and
                comprehensive it is therefore advisable to pursue a policy of gradual
                implementation it is promising that political decisions have already been made
                in a number of areas such as tax aspects of both homeownership and pension
                saving the correlation between home mortgage lending and pension saving in
                the netherlands reflects their interdependency in terms of tax treatment
                the political decisions now taken have created greater clarity and individuals
                will adjust their behaviour accordingly the decisions limiting taxfree pension
                saving and increasing the pensionable age have been a welcome but only first
                step this view is shared by the cabinet the envisioned fundamental debate
                surrounding the dutch pension system should therefore be initiated in the near
                future this fundamental debate should include deliberations on the best
                possible combination of collective and individual elements in the resulting new
                pension system the debate should also include the preferred level of variability
                in pension contributions benefits and accumulation these elements are
                interrelated it will be impossible to create stability in each of these three
                dimensions simultaneously stable contributions can be implemented through
                variable accumulation rates variable pension benefits or a combination of both
                choices made in this area will also have major implications on the
                macroeconomic level a pension system that exerts minimal autonomous effect
                on cyclical movements for instance will enhance public confidence in the
                economy even regardless of household balance sheet issues it is important that
                our pension system be adjusted to current changes in society where
                demographic ageing plays an increasing role and employment patterns are
                subject to sweeping changes these developments suggest a system that allows
                for more differentiation and thus individual freedom of choice strong points
                of the system that should be preserved include the prominent role of capital
                funding and the mandatory nature of pension accumulation while solidarity
                mechanisms should be kept transparent and a broad support base for the
                envisioned reforms should be actively sought


		 the dutch financial sector and its supervision
                sustainable economic growth requires a healthy financial sector regarding the
                latter major steps forward have been made international legislation has been
                tightened for banks the new regime is largely informed by the views of the
                basel committee on banking supervision the outlines of european banking
                supervision in the context of the banking union have already been discussed
                above regarding insurance supervision an important european agreement that
                brings closer the introduction of solvency ii by 1 january 2016 was reached in
                late 2013 the intervening period will have to be devoted to the gradual
                implementation of the new framework along with close monitoring of its
                operation and adjustment where needed while alertness to any unintentional
                side effects is in order with a view to effectiveness this structural reform must
                also be implemented according to plan this is because the restoration of
                confidence in the financial sector which is a major precondition for robust
                economic recovery will depend on strict implementation of and adherence to
                new tightened legislation

                dnb bases the exercise of its supervisory duties on a periodically updated
                strategy delineating the supervisory framework this dnb supervisory strategy is


                21 dnb  annual report 2013

               introduction by the president




               recalibrated every four years on the basis of domestic and international
               developments the recently published dnb supervisory strategy 20142018
               takes into account the recommendations of several inquiry committees and the
               lessons learned from past experience in the supervisory field such as the libor
               fraud and the nationalisation of sns reaal the new supervisory strategy puts
               greater emphasis on the integrity and governance of the financial sector
               including bonus policies and provides details on several aspects of the
               european banking union and on the additional buffer requirements imposed on
               banks insurance supervision will shortly become more riskoriented and
               forwardlooking partly because mediumsized and larger insurers are required to
               apply the theoretical solvency criterion

               since 2010 dnb has considerably tightened its prudential supervision
               a completely new topdown risk analysis method has been introduced leading
               to greater discipline and consistency in the supervisory process the new
               analysis starts with the translation of macroprudential risks as published by
               dnb in its overview of financial stability to the risk profile of the individual
               insurance entity macroprudential risks may relate to the economy as a whole or
               an entire economic sector but also to business models conduct and culture
               aspects infrastructure or ict these risks now constitute important input
               elements for the determination of individual institutions risk profiles and the
               actions they require to be taken a crucial element in dnbs risk analysis is the
               way institutions manage their risks increasingly dnb analyses these prudential
               risks on a sectorwide level for instance through thematic examinations into the
               effectiveness of institutions financial and operational risk management and
               their internal audit function such thematic examinations are also used to
               establish crossinstitutional benchmarks aspects covered in that context include
               conduct and culture business models and strategies

               on 1 february 2013 the minister of finance decided in close consultation with
               dnb to nationalise sns reaal in a market economy nationalisation should
               always be considered as the measure of last resort dnb therefore explored every
               avenue in order to avoid having to use this measure numerous alternatives
               involving private sector parties and solutions were examined yet the central
               objective pursued by dnb at all times was to safeguard financial stability in the
               netherlands that must never be allowed to be endangered only when it
               transpired that none of the alternatives would bring relief was the
               nationalisation instrument employed in order to safeguard financial stability in
               the netherlands


		 regulatory framework for pension supervision
               as a supervisor dnb attaches high importance to an adequate and sustainable
               pension system a system where pension funds realise to a satisfactory degree the
               ambitions encased in the pension scheme and the expectations of their members
               a major factor in attaining this goal is the review of the financial assessment
               framework the framework dnb advises the ministry of social affairs and
               employment on the substance of the framework and assesses the implementation
               aspects of relevant draft legislation the review of the framework is a necessary
               measure and will be worked out in detail this year it is essential that this work
               will be undertaken with energy so as to help ensure the solidity of the pension
               sector and effect the necessary restoration of confidence in the system in the
               longer term the sustainability of the pension system also demands more
               farreaching adjustments as discussed earlier

               introduction by the president




		 macroprudential supervision in practice
               in addition to healthy and resilient financial institutions a robust financial system
               is also essential therefore the promotion of financial stability has from 1 january
               2014 been enacted in the bank act as one of the duties of dnb to fulfil this
               duty dnb has been given new macroprudential powers on the strength of new
               european legislation for one thing dnb now has power to require banks
               in times of rapid credit growth to accumulate an additional capital buffer to be
               drawn down in less buoyant conditions most of the new instruments envision
               enhancement of the financial systems robustness acting on the market conduct
               of  and interaction between  financial institutions because instruments cannot
               be linked to individual financial stability risks the new powers target intermediary
               goals such as countering excessive credit growth and unwarranted maturity
               transformation these goals in themselves already provide sufficient cause for
               action and form the essential links in the spread of financial instability
               dnb intends to observe the greatest possible transparency regarding the use of
               macroprudential instruments transparency thus contributes to predictability
               which in turn may influence expectations and hence lead to more desirable
               behaviour also it may help enlarge the support base for measures taken finally
               transparency enhances the accountability of dnb as a macroprudential authority


		 the payment system reliable and innovative
               an element that is central to the financial system and important in shaping the
               interdependency between individual financial institutions is the payment system
               the role played by the payment system usually remains underexposed until
               problems such as the ddos attacks of april 2013 illustrate the social importance
               of smoothly operating payment infrastructures the ddos attacks could be
               countered relatively quickly the subsequent survey by the national forum on
               the payment system showed that representative organisations in the netherlands
               regard the payment infrastructure as robust the payment system of the
               netherlands is efficient and meets high technological standards as such it is an
               attractive target for criminals therefore robustness requires ongoing efforts to
               counter threats for one thing measures have been taken to prevent illegal gains
               from being made through copying bank cards almost eliminating this skimming
               practice dnb sees to it that institutions respond adequately to developments in
               the payment system and the concomitant risks and that they continue to take
               appropriate action in this context dnb welcomes its new statutory powers
               conferred on 1 january 2014 to exercise payment system supervision or oversight
               over major players

               along with the ongoing innovation race abuse of the payment system manifests
               itself in everchanging guises at the same time innovation is the source of
               permanent improvements in the payment system by which society may benefit
               if attacks cannot be prevented entirely they may be made controllable and their
               consequences manageable a wellknown innovation in the payment system has
               been the rise of a new virtual currency called bitcoin acceptance of this
               decentralised cryptographybased system has been limited but growing however
               the bitcoin is not legal tender and acceptance is never mandatory nor can
               bitcoins lay claim to the reliability of legal tender issued by a central bank and
               supported by a public safety net for the moneycreating banking industry also
               few prices are quoted in bitcoin which is therefore hardly used as a unit of
               account the price of the bitcoin is set in the market and includes a liquidity
               premium the virtual currency is subject to fluctuations in both value and
               liquidity in 2013 therefore the exchange rate of the bitcoin against for instance
               the euro varied enormously reducing the attractiveness of the bitcoin as a


               23 dnb  annual report 2013

introduction by the president




hoarding currency since the bitcoin network is largely anonymous the virtual
currency is an attractive target for criminal activities regulation of the bitcoin is
next to impossible users must realise the risk of price and other loss all in all
it is uncertain whether the use of the bitcoin will ever take off to an extent where it
may compete sustainably with official money

the year 2014 will see the introduction of the sepa european payment system
this marks an event of historic importance because after the introduction of the
noncash euro in 1999 and the cash euro in 2002 sepa also forms a major pillar of
the single euro payments market sepa marks a new phase in the standardisation
of the european payment system individuals and businesses throughout europe
will be able to pay each other with uniform instruments the distinction between
domestic and crossborder payments in euro no longer exists for direct debits and
credit transfers inside the eu and crossborder payments cost the same as
domestic payments consumers stand to benefit by sepa although they will have
to get accustomed to the new longer iban bank account numbers consumers
will also benefit because banks may now compete on the entire european
payments market this offers opportunities for the development of new
innovative payment services that may be used throughout the euro area however
banks and businesses have had to make heavy investments for the implementation
of sepa a compliment is due to dutch banks and businesses for their efforts to
make sepa possible

		 interdependence of growth and financial stability


   interdependence of growth and financial stability




 i interdependence of growth and financial stability


11 introduction
   one of the most important lessons to be drawn from the onset and aftermath
   of the credit crisis is that financial stability and robust economic growth are
   inextricably linked substantial progress has been made in the necessary balance
   sheet repair but the process is not yet complete one positive note is that the
   dutch economy began to grow again in mid2013 though the growth outlook
   for the coming years is modest attention must therefore now turn to increasing
   the dutch economic growth capacity and achieving a sustainable recovery of
   financial stability this chapter discusses four selected topics that highlight
   substantial challenges in this regard

   section 12 focuses on the structural capacity for growth in the dutch economy
   the key question addressed here concerns the scope for strengthening that
   capacity and in particular the role of lending in that process section 13
   discusses the macroprudential policy of de nederlandsche bank dnb
   with effect from 1 january 2014 dnbs task of promoting financial stability is
   embedded in the bank act bankwet and macroprudential policy provides the
   necessary tools for this task this section outlines the operationalisation of
   macroprudential policy in the netherlands section 14 takes a broader view by
   looking at the economic and monetary union emu and exploring how the
   emu area is recovering from the debt crisis the willingness of the european
   central bank ecb to make conditional purchases of euro area government
   bonds through outright monetary transactions omts together with the
   launch of the banking union largely restored calm to the financial markets
   in addition the divergence in financial performance between the euro countries
   has narrowed however ensuring sustainable calm requires a further reduction
   in the macroeconomic imbalances in the emu the concluding section of this
   chapter section 15 addresses the ecbs unconventional monetary policy
   which has helped restore calm to the financial markets due to its unintended
   sideeffects this unconventional policy also has a number of drawbacks
   the potential negative economic impact of an exit from the unconventional
   monetary policy is also reviewed in this section clear communication is crucial
   in avoiding this impact as far as possible

                                        and financial institutions to strengthen their balance sheets fundamentally
                                        the dutch economy is in good shape continuing to work towards a healthy
                                        banking sector investing in the labour force and further strengthening labour
                                        market institutions are all initiatives that will increase the structural capacity
                                        for growth


                                        121 balance sheet problems slow down economic recovery
                                        the dutch economy is recovering more slowly from the crisis than other core
                                        euro area countries the crux of the problem is sluggish domestic spending
                                         not just private consumption but also investments in housing and other
                                        assets chart 11 shows that private consumption in the netherlands has made a
                                        predominantly negative contribution to gdp growth since 2009 whereas in
                                        other core countries that contribution has been consistently positive

                                        the chief explanation for the shortfall in private consumption is the development
                                        of real disposable household income see chart 12 which has been under
                                        additional pressure since the crisis due to a variety of factors first there has been

                                        and pension funds has also constrained the indexation of pension and other

interdependence of growth and financial stability




social insurance contributions in addition inflation has remained persistently
high partly due to increases in indirect taxes but consumer spending has also
suffered from the damaged household balance sheets especially in the form of
lower home equity and the resultant increase in residual debt and individual
household savings have been showing negative growth for ten years restricting
the scope for more consumption

balance sheet repair takes time introducing a number of targeted measures could
speed up this adjustment process and support spending over time but first of
all it is important that underwater homeowners are able to obtain bank finance
for the residual debt this is facilitated by government policy a reduction in
pension accrual as long as it is accompanied by lower pension contributions
also creates scope for an increase in net wages responsible pay increases in
sectors that are in good health could create additional financial headroom as well
meanwhile the way in which the government implements its fiscal consolidation
will play a role gross public expenditure has risen sharply in recent years
from just over 45 of gdp in 2007 to around 50 in 2013 financing this
increase without an excessive rise in the budget deficit has required hikes in
taxes and social insurance contributions this is part of the reason for the
decline in disposable household income a critical review is therefore needed
of the level and composition of public spending

costs of health care are a key cause of the higher public expenditure
spending on health care rose from 87 of gdp in 2007 to 110 of gdp in 2013
the average annual increase over that period was almost 4 in real terms

                                         this sharp rise makes it painfully clear that the predominantly publicly funded
                                         dutch health care system is running up against the buffers in relative terms
                                         households outofpocket contributions to the health care they use are
                                         exceptionally low in the netherlands because such a large proportion of health
                                         care costs are publicly funded the present system offers inadequate incentives
                                         for both users and providers to ensure optimum effectiveness placing more
                                         emphasis in health care funding on results rather than number of treatments
                                         could boost incentives for health care providers while higher patient
                                         copayments could also improve costeffectiveness

                                         the rising costs of health care are also directly linked to faltering private
                                         consumption the individual public consumption  the proportion of public
                                         expenditure that goes directly to individuals such as spending on health care
                                         and education  is relatively high in the netherlands in other countries
                                         people have to use more of their disposable income to pay for these services
                                         as a result a comparison with the euro area of actual individual consumption
                                         ie private consumption plus individual public consumption reveals a more
                                         favourable balance see chart 13

                                         bank lending growth has fallen sharply in the netherlands since 2009 mortgage
                                         lending to households is barely growing at all rising by 06 yearonyear in
                                         december 2013 growth of lending to nonfinancial businesses has also slowed
                                         and has actually contracted since july 2013 this limited lending growth is
                                         related to falling demand for credit which is normal in a recession but is
                                         currently exacerbated by the deterioration in the housing market however

supply factors also play a role see box 11 first banks have tightened up their
lending criteria because of the increased credit risk the sme sector has been
particularly hard hit by the recession and is carrying a relatively high
proportion of payment arrears an added factor affecting mortgage lending is
the policy of banks to limit their relatively large exposure in view of the
concentration risk mortgage lending growth is also being squeezed by stricter
regulations on repayment options and loantovalue limits

a number of specific developments at banks have also affected lending since the
crisis first the dependence of dutch banks on market funding has made them
hesitant to take on longterm loans due to the higher refinancing costs and risks
this applies particularly to residential mortgages but also to business where




 box 11 study of supply factors underlying the lower credit growth
 research by dnb underlines the role of supply factors in the lower credit
 growth its analysis shows that banks stricter lending policies combined with
 the decline in demand for credit has led to an estimated fall in business
 lending growth of between two and four percentage points see chart 14
 postcrisis hypothetical scenario

 the sme sector is also facing stricter bank lending criteria with several banks
 continuing in 2013 to use the increased credit risk the access to market funding
 and their capital position as reasons to further tighten their lending policies
 see chart 15 the results of the study show that by applying stricter criteria
 banks have restricted the growth in total business lending the measures
 include higher collateral requirements smaller loan amounts and all manner
 of covenants written into contracts

 the study also shows that overly generous bank lending policies before the
 crisis contributed to excessive credit growth at the time see chart 14
 precrisis hypothetical scenario if banks had not relaxed their lending
 criteria from 2004 lending growth in 2006 and 2007 would have been
 between two and six percentage points lower this analysis contributes to the
 validation of macroprudential policy in the netherlands dnb has acquired
 new macroprudential instruments in 2014 which it can use to counter
 excessive lending growth section 13 takes a closer look at these instruments
 the crisis has revealed that some loans were granted too readily before the
 crisis for example in the commercial real estate market the current limited
 lending growth is also related to the inevitable deleveraging after the earlier
 strong rise in lending


more than threequarters of the outstanding volume comprises loans with terms
exceeding one year within the business loan portfolio loans to the sme sector
which is relatively heavily dependent on banks for finance have particularly
long terms banks are also working to strengthen their balance sheets
and restricting lending is one way to meet the capital requirements however
the extent to which the necessary strengthening of their balance sheets
contributes to banks reticence to extend business loans is uncertain

a broadening of the funding market is desirable in order to counter the present
squeeze on bank lending and to diversify the financial system in the longer
term expanding the availability of finance could help reduce the sme sectors
dependency on banks in the coming years smes must be provided with
finance not only through loans but also in the form of equity because capital
reinforcement will improve both their financial position and their access to
bank lending

alternative forms of finance such as microfinance crowdfunding credit unions
and venture capital are growing but continue to be niche markets securitisation
of mortgage and sme loans on bank balance sheets can also offer a solution

institutional investors can contribute as well examples include the creation of
the national mortgage institute and the dutch investment institute as well as
recent initiatives to set up investment funds specifically targeting the sme
sector finally the funding options could be increased if bankruptcy and fiscal
legislation were harmonised across europe if european and national sme
support programmes were streamlined and databases were set up to provide
better insight into the credit quality of the sme sector this could facilitate the
development of a broader credit market as was the case in the united states
and the united kingdom


123 structural growth outlook
as in many other countries slowing population growth means the netherlands
will be confronted with structurally lower economic growth after all prosperity
does not depend on overall economic growth but on per capita income growth
key factors here are the labour participation rate the number of hours worked
and the hourly productivity rate

the labour participation rate has risen sharply in the netherlands over recent
decades see chart 16 at the end of the 1980s the total participation rate in
the netherlands was relatively low compared with other european countries
however since the mid1990s the participation rate has been above average
mainly thanks to the increased number of women in the workforce recently
the labour participation rate of older people aged 5564 years has risen
spectacularly this too is primarily due to the increased labour participation
of women though attempts to address the problems surrounding the state
retirement pension aow and the abolition of early retirement schemes vut
have also contributed

disability can be boosted by plans to reform the provision for young disabled
persons wajong and the sheltered employment provisions

the annual number of hours worked per person has fallen steadily in the
netherlands over recent decades from nearly 1900 hours in 1970 to just below
1400 in 2012 the main reason for this is that women who began working during
that period predominantly took parttime jobs at present 62 of women in
the netherlands work parttime compared with 18 of men the average figures
in the oecd are much lower at 25 and 8 respectively rising real incomes
may be leading to a higher proportion of the labour force opting for more free
time however an undesirable situation arises when employees would like to
work more hours but choose not to because it hardly pays to do so for example
lower childcare allowance means that working an extra hour produces less and
less benefit for some employees the government therefore needs to stick closely
to the credo that working more must pay the van dijkhuizen committee has
made a number of very welcome recommendations in this regard such as
reducing income tax rates combined with a broadening of the tax base and
streamlining of the allowances system

still the structural contribution of the above factors to growth is limited so
economic growth will have to come mainly from increases in labour productivity
the drivers are complex first it is important that businesses invest in their
capital goods stocks because many productivityraising innovations are
incorporated in capital goods however since the end of the 1980s
the investment ratio of dutch businesses has been on a downward trend
see chart 17 it is important to identify the factors underlying this downturn
as discussed earlier it is in any event crucial that lending facilitates profitable
investment

human capital also has an important role to play the knowledge production of
a small country like the netherlands is by definition relatively low the ability
to absorb knowledge and innovations from elsewhere is therefore vital crucial
elements for achieving this are reading and numerical skills a command of

    the present rules impede the dynamic of the labour market especially in the case
    of older workers in longterm employment this can hamper labour productivity

    rights of different workers and are therefore a step in the right direction


13 macroprudential policy contributes to a strong financial system
    one of dnbs tasks is to promote financial stability to this end dnb acquired
    new macroprudential instruments in 2014 which can be used to increase the
    financial systems resilience to shocks and combat vulnerabilities


    131 promoting financial stability a formal task from 2014
    a stable financial system is a key condition for strong sustainable economic
    growth financial institutions and markets play a crucial role in financing
    investments and spreading risks many recent national and international reforms
    in the financial sector are intended to ensure that the financial system can
    continue fulfilling this role even in the face of economic or financial shocks
    these reforms are also intended to prevent the financial system itself from
    becoming a source of risk

    the new european supervisory regulations for banks incorporate macroprudential
    policy instruments that can be deployed to promote the solidity of the financial
    sector see box 12 the member states take the lead in the use of these
    instruments reflecting the fact that vulnerabilities are often national in nature

 box 12 overview of macroprudential instruments
 european regulations for banks

 stricter national requirements in several areas flexibility package
  capital and reserves
  large items
  liquidity
  exposures to specific sectors property and financial institutions

this is also a priority for dnb it is therefore important that promoting financial
stability is embedded in the bank act and the financial supervision act wet op
het financieel toezicht  wft as a formal dnb task from 1 january 2014
this offers dnb a broader statutory basis to make an active contribution to
a strong financial system the new european legislation allows dnb to take
measures to increase the resilience of banks to shocks if it identifies risks for the
financial system as a whole


132 macroprudential policy aims and instruments
macroprudential policy is an important tool for promoting financial stability
the emphasis in this policy lies on enhancing the resilience of the financial
sector by identifying and countering systemic risks for example through higher
capital buffers and curtailing the interdependence of financial institutions
macroprudential instruments are targeted primarily at ensuring that the financial
system can better withstand threats this is generally a more realistic aim than
preventing or eliminating threats which dnb often has virtually no ability to
influence financial developments are strongly driven by global factors
including capital market interest rates and financial market sentiment
moreover stability risks are often characterised by great uncertainty
which means they are recognised too late or not at all and cannot be mitigated
through advance measures

one of the macroprudential instruments is the countercyclical capital buffer
ccb which impacts lending banks are required to build up an additional
capital buffer in times of relatively high credit growth if a crisis breaks out
this buffer can be released so banks can use it to absorb losses other instruments
target specific systemic risks such as mortgages or commercial property exposures
or specific characteristics of banks for example banks that are classed as
systemically important are required to hold additional capital box 13 considers
the operation of two macroprudential instruments in more detail




36 dnb  annual report 2013

interdependence of growth and financial stability




 box 13 macroprudential instruments in practice two examples

 example 1 countercyclical capital buffer ccb
 instrument capital surcharge of up to 25 of the riskweighted assets or
 possibly higher

 purpose to protect banks against macrorisks

 intermediate goal to counter the risks of excessive credit growth

 indicator a credittogdp ratio that deviates from the longterm trend

 transparency
 	publication of the credittogdp indicator possibly other indicators and
    an explanatory analysis
 	establishment of buffers in accordance with guidelines being developed by
    the european systemic risk board esrb

 procedure
 dnb decides each quarter whether to activate or adjust the ccb partly on
 the basis of the above indicators if the ccb has been activated dnb can
 decide to increase the buffer reduce it or  during a crisis  release it so that
 banks can use it to absorb losses foreign banks are also required to build a
 ccb buffer of up to 25 as imposed by dnb for loans in the netherlands
 this maintains the level playing field between domestic and foreign banks

 countries are free to use additional indicators alongside the credittogdp
 ratio earlier crises have for example shown that the buildup of imbalances
 is often accompanied by strongly rising property prices countries that have
 currently activated the ccb  switzerland and norway  substantiate this
 with different indicators in addition to the creditgdp ratio


 example 2 macroprudential instruments targeting real estate
 instrument risk weights for property loantovalue ltv and loanto
 income lti limits

 purpose to protect banks and consumers against the risks of a housing
 market crisis

 intermediate goal to counter the risks of excessive credit growth in the
 property sector

 indicator lending to households in combination with a rise in nominal house
 prices investments in property as  of gdp

 transparency publication of the indicators used and any signal values

 procedure
 if indicators suggest a creditdriven property bubble dnb must assess
 whether instruments need to be deployed and if so which instrument is most
 appropriate dnb can adjust the risk weights which are mainly effective in
 increasing banks resilience to shocks




37 dnb  annual report 2013

interdependence of growth and financial stability




133 how does dnb use the macroprudential instruments
macroprudential instruments are linked to intermediate goals these can be made
more tangible than the ultimate risks and are therefore useful for operationalising
policy aimed at financial stability an example of an intermediate goal is
countering excessive credit growth this goal can be linked to instruments such
as the countercyclical capital buffer ccb and ltv limits another example is
countering perverse incentives for financial institutions this intermediate goal
can be linked to a capital surcharge for systemically important banks and an
obligation to disclose certain risks intermediate goals often stem from market
failures and are therefore a reason for intervention in themselves they are also
often essential links through which vulnerabilities can spread during a crisis

an acceleration of credit growth systematically emerges as a key indicator of
a buildup of imbalances this also applies to the netherlands where there is
a clear relationship between rising house prices and developments in the
commercial property market chart 18 there are intervals of more than twenty
years between successive peaks and troughs corresponding to the length of the
financial cycle dnb will therefore partly base any decision on whether or not
to deploy macroprudential instruments on these indicators macroeconomic
variables such as economic growth unemployment and inflation are generally
only moderately useful as indicators of macroprudential risks these variables
mainly reflect the economic cycle which is much shorter on average than the
financial cycle

although member states take the lead in macroprudential policy coordination
at european level is often desirable this enables crossborder effects to be taken
into account it is important in this context that countries acknowledge each

    others measures and apply them to crossborder lending by their own banks
    this reciprocity is actually mandatory for the ccb see box 13 within the
    banking union the ecb can also apply stricter macroprudential measures that
    target banks this builds in incentives to take timely action at both national and
    european level and helps counter inaction bias the inherent tendency to defer
    necessary measures when a crisis seems a long way off


    134 rules discretion and transparency
    macroprudential policy can be linked to indicators in a predetermined way
    this offsets the inaction bias referred to above and makes the policy transparent
    and predictable it also facilitates the preparation of policy measures thereby
    increasing their effectiveness on the other hand discretionary decisionmaking
    offers scope to respond to developments that are not captured by the indicators
    such as in the case of financial innovations in light of this decisionmaking
    based on limited discretion in which the authority combines its own view with
    fixed principles and indicators appears to offer the most suitable framework for
    macroprudential policy where possible the authority can use quantitative
    signal values as indicators it may for example explicitly commit to taking a
    decision about the use of an instrument if one or more indicators reach certain
    signal values

    financial stability is a difficult concept to measure and the accountability of
    the authority is therefore heavily dependent on transparency about the policy
    pursued this can be achieved through communication about the policy
    framework used the risks identified and the measures taken dnb has put this
    into practice in recent years through the regular publication of the overview of
    financial stability ofs and ad hoc publications on specific themes in the
    future these publications will devote more explicit attention to the way dnb
    fulfils its tasks in respect of financial stability they will consider matters such
    as deviations from the credit growth trend developments in asset prices and
    interdependencies between financial institutions at least twice a year dnb will
    provide information on the main systemic risks and the instruments used to
    map these risks


14 how the emu is recovering from the debt crisis
    following the announcement of the omt programme and the launch of the
    banking union calm has largely been restored to the financial markets in the
    currency union however sustainable calm requires a further reduction in the
    macroeconomic imbalances within the emu important progress has been
    made in this area but a great deal remains to be done the challenge is to
    continue along this path now that the pressure in the financial markets is easing


    141 debt crisis in a new phase
    the ecb announced its omt programme in september 2012 partly in response
    to the doubts that had arisen in financial markets about the irreversibility of the
    euro  doubts that were dismissed at the time as unfounded by ecb president
    mario draghi during that same period european government leaders put an
    end to the latent uncertainty about greeces future as a member of the emu and
    decided to create a banking union since then major strides have been made in
    a short space of time which would have been unimaginable until recently
    for example europe has developed and adopted legislation on common
    banking supervision in the euro area and a single resolution mechanism for


    39 dnb  annual report 2013

interdependence of growth and financial stability




banks see section 22 following a comprehensive assessment of bank balance
sheets the ecb will assume overall responsibility for banking supervision in
the emu at the end of 2014 equally important is the rapid establishment of
macroprudential authorities in many member states and the ability to
coordinate this policy at european level in the meantime many countries have
also made major progress in the areas of fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms

all these developments have taken the debt crisis into a new phase although the
changes have seriously impacted economic growth in the short term they will
ultimately help to prevent the kind of longterm economic stagnation that
occurred following the financial crisis in japan in the 1990s at the same time
a great deal still remains to be done and the improved situation in the financial
markets must not be allowed to lead to reform fatigue or a watering down of
the existing reform agendas


142 calm largely restored in emu financial markets
partly thanks to the ecb intervention the stress in the euro area financial
markets has eased considerably the ecb has provided liquidity to banks with
a term of up to three years thus assuring their funding for an extended period
by launching the omt programme the ecb has also enabled the support
buying of government bonds on the condition that countries that receive
support stick to an economic reform plan the omt programme has not yet
been activated but thanks to its signal function yields on government bonds
issued by vulnerable countries in the euro area have fallen substantially
the decline has been greatest in greece portugal and ireland but capital market
interest rates are also substantially lower in spain and italy ireland recently
ended the emergency financial assistance programme and the irish government
is once again able to raise finance independently the spanish support
programme for the financial sector has also come to an end while the
programmes for portugal and cyprus are running to schedule

the damaging capital outflow from the vulnerable countries to the core countries
of the euro area has meanwhile been reversed see chart 19 as a result
the funding conditions in the vulnerable countries have greatly improved
and their banks are regaining access to market funds making them less
dependent on finance from the eurosystem this is reflected in a decline of
more than a third in the balances in the target2 payment system and the
partial repayments on longterm loans from the ecb

however the financial conditions still diverge across the euro area countries
 though complete equivalence in financial conditions is not an end in itself
since the financial crisis the financial markets have been paying more attention
to risks and with good reason differences in economic fundamentals such as
the relative size of the public debt mean that capital market interest rates
continue to diverge across different countries and the funding conditions for
banks still depend on the quality of their assets monetary policy cannot
eliminate these risks but can buy time for the necessary fundamental reforms
and ensure that the financial markets continue to function properly when
assessing these risks

143 reduction in macroeconomic imbalances
the relative calm in the financial markets during the past year can only be
sustained if member states further reduce the macroeconomic imbalances that
built up before the crisis there are clear positive developments in this regard but
they have exacted a high price in terms of economic growth and unemployment

the competitiveness of vulnerable countries is clearly improving unit labour
costs in spain portugal ireland and greece see chart 110 have fallen
substantially over the last few years enabling these countries to recapture some
of the lost ground in terms of competitiveness since the launch of emu
in some countries however the changes have partly been achieved at the
expense of an exceptionally sharp fall in employment alongside the economic
component this sharp drop also reflects the need to reform the sector structure
initially employment shrank in domestically oriented sectors such as construc
tion which had grown too large in recent quarters pay moderation has made
a major contribution to the correction in unit labour costs making the
improvement more sustainable however the improvement in labour costs is
not yet translating into lower sales prices everywhere this is probably due to
lack of competition in product and service markets for example as a result of
regulations that restrict competition or administrative barriers to startup
businesses

balance sheet repair in the private and public sectors is also slowly but surely
taking hold see chart 111 savings in the private sector in particular have
increased sharply since the crisis as borne out by the higher net budget
balances in addition progress has been made in reducing budget deficits in
most cases this has not yet led to a reduction in debt ratios in the public sector
partly because nominal gdp has fallen as a result of the recession by contrast
private debt has reached a turning point in most countries and is already falling
markedly in spain and ireland despite these positive developments it is likely

to take some time yet before private and public debt has been reduced to
sustainable levels

the increase in savings and improvement in competitiveness have also brought
more equilibrium to the balances of payments in the euro area the current
account deficits in vulnerable member states have reduced sharply and have in
some cases been turned into a small surplus see chart 112 the german
current account surplus relative to the other emu countries has also declined
this specific trade surplus fell from over 25 of gdp in 2008 to a roughly
balanced position in 2013 in this way germany is contributing to the
restoration of balanceofpayments equilibrium within the emu
the improvement in the current account balances of the vulnerable member
states is partly due to a sharp decline in imports as a result of the deep
recession these countries were in until recently some of the improvement is
therefore likely to be lost again once economic growth picks up further
however this fall in imports also has a longterm component as demand in
these countries is likely to remain depressed for some time given the need for
further strengthening of balance sheets in the public and private sectors the
current account balances of spain portugal and greece in particular have also
been helped for a number of quarters by a distinct improvement in export
growth


144 structural reforms implemented
clear progress has been made in the area of structural reforms these reforms
are needed in order to increase the growth potential make it easier to adjust
wages and prices and facilitate the process of balance sheet repair vulnerable

member states have implemented many reforms in recent years especially those
under a support programme greece ireland portugal and spain however
the pace of reform in large emu countries such as italy and france leaves
something to be desired evidently reforms stand the greatest chance of success
when there is heavy pressure from the financial markets or conditions are
attached to reform programmes

the reforms have thus far been strongly focused on the labour market
for example the wage formation framework has been radically reformed in all
southern member states by expanding the scope for decentralised wage
negotiations in spain and greece decentralised agreements now even take
precedence over sectorwide collective labour agreements some southern
member states have also taken additional measures such as curbing the
automatic continuation of clauses from lapsed collective labour agreements
such as pay increases if no new agreement has been signed another example
is raising the minimum number of employees and employers that must be
represented by the relevant trade unions and employers organisations before
a collective labour agreement can be declared generally binding in addition
the minimum wage has been tackled portugal and at a later stage spain froze
their minimum wages which have actually been drastically reduced in greece

employment protection in the southern member states has also been relaxed
which in principle has increased the demand for labour while fostering its
efficient allocation one caveat here is that in practice it is not only the
statutory employment protection that is important but also its interpretation
by the courts and the efficiency of the judicial process in case of dismissal
this means that the effectiveness of these reforms only becomes apparent after
some time moreover in most of these countries there is a significant difference

in employment protection between temporary and permanent employment
contracts which hinders the movement from temporary to permanent
employment this affects young people in particular a further relaxation of
the employment protection in permanent employment contracts therefore
remains a priority in fact the same applies to most of the core countries as well

compared with the labour markets much less progress has been made in
improving the functioning of product and service markets though most
vulnerable countries have taken some steps in this regard still these reforms
are vital for increasing economic growth potential in the case of fierce
competition in product and service markets pay moderation leads to lower
prices and not just to a redistribution from labour to capital there is still
undesirable rigidity in this area in the core countries too especially in the
service markets this discourages investment and consequently depresses
domestic demand greater efforts are needed on this front both in the core
member states and in the periphery rigorous implementation of the eu
services directive is therefore a priority the smooth functioning of the product
and service markets also requires the resolution of institutional deficiencies
which act as informal access barriers the global competitiveness report
20132014 for example points out that an inefficient judicial process is a
problem in the southern member states and that companies in most member
states are weighed down by excessive regulation on the other hand positive
developments are also visible in this area portugal and italy for example

145 staying on course
the biggest challenge in the coming period is for member states to stick to the
course on which they embarked the improved financial conditions and the
signs of a fragile recovery in confidence have come about largely thanks to the
earlier intervention of governments and central banks only by continuing along
the present path will it be possible to make the recovery of the euro area more
futureproof and open the way for sustainable growth

this firstly requires that member states themselves continue the efforts they
have made thus far at european level it is key to continue encouraging these
necessary adjustments as much as possible the renewed european policy
framework must therefore be utilised to its full potential europe has tightened
up the fiscal rules in recent years and agreed new rules to deal with macro
economic imbalances the macroeconomic imbalance procedure  mip
experiences with this framework are still new but its application could be
improved by defining criteria more clearly and applying them more uniformly
focusing policy recommendations more on the principal problems facing countries
and devoting more attention to the implementation of recommendations

in 2014 there will be further discussions in europe about the possibility for
member states to make mutual contractual agreements to implement reforms
possibly in exchange for support from a european solidarity mechanism
however expectations should not run too high contracts could slightly increase
the incentives to reform but the important role given to the council of
ministers rather than the commission adds to the risk that member states will
water down recommendations or not implement them at all it would be better
if europe were to strengthen the enforceability of good fiscal and structural
policies in other ways greater enforceability is sometimes seen as an undesirable
constraint on national policy freedom however that greater enforceability
offers protection against an even greater loss of policy freedom if the imbalances
in emu countries become too great and they are forced to institute reforms by
pressure from the financial markets preventing imbalances is always cheaper
than correcting them partly because financial markets react strongly and
sometimes overreact if further mutual agreements are able to prevent those
imbalances all emu countries stand to benefit this includes countries that are
already pursuing sound policies since they will themselves be less affected by
the further agreements and unsustainable developments in the rest of the euro
area the same certainly applies to the netherlands which given its relatively
open economy large financial sector and sizeable pension assets is sensitive to
financial shocks in other countries

a first option for increasing the enforceability of sound policies is to enforce the
existing rules more strictly and in a more politically impartial way one way of
doing this would be to further strengthen the role of the european commission
particularly in the mip it would also be helpful if the council of ministers were
to vote in more stages of the existing procedures via a reverse qualified majority
this would make it more difficult for the council to reject or water down
commission proposals

15 risks of and exit from unconventional monetary policy
    the ecbs expansive unconventional monetary policy measures have improved
    market conditions and eased monetary transmission bottlenecks the challenge
    is to prevent negative side effects through appropriate design and a timely exit
    from these measures this demands careful communication by central banks
    the refinancing measures in the euro area have been structured in such a way
    that an exit from the unconventional monetary policy will in part be an
    automatic process


    151 consequences of unconventional monetary policy
    conventional policy in the form of cutting policy rates proved insufficient to
    stabilise the international economy a wide range of unconventional monetary
    measures was therefore implemented leading to strong growth in central bank
    balance sheets see chart 113 one of the main measures taken by the ecb
    involved significantly stepping up the provision of liquidity to banks in order to
    overcome the bottlenecks in monetary transmission to achieve this banks were
    granted almost unlimited liquidity in normal and very longterm refinancing
    operations vltros the ecb also relaxed the collateral requirements for
    providing this liquidity in order to resolve the shortage of collateral at peripheral
    banks in particular and to ensure the provision of sufficient liquidity the omt
    programme announced in mid2012 also enables the ecb to buy government
    bonds if the bond markets get into difficulties provided the government of the
    issuing country meets certain conditions and implements an economic reform
    programme the federal reserve fed and the bank of england boe expanded
    their monetary policies by lowering capital market interest rates through
    nonsterilised purchases of securities and since last year the bank of japan boj
    has been explicitly striving to achieve an inflation rate of 2 by aggressively
    buying securities central banks also influence the money market curve by issuing
    forward guidance on policy rates

    the unconventional policy had a considerable impact on the financial markets
    the liquidity support by central banks led to reductions in both money market

rates and lending rates the bondbuying programmes of the fed and the boe
reduced capital market rates and risk premiums by tens of basis points
and sometimes more than 100 basis points the improvement in market
conditions had a limited positive impact on economic growth in the short
term the feds forward guidance led to a flattening of the yield curve while the
ecbs forward guidance reduced the volatility of money market rates in the
euro area the announcement of the omt programme prompted a reduction in
the risk premiums that had been priced in for the breakup of monetary union
this narrowed the divergence between financial developments in the banking
landscape and in the capital markets within the euro area enabling the
monetary transmission channel to function better however as illustrated by
chart 114 several financial indicators for the euro area countries still diverge
more than before the crisis this is partly due to structural factors that cannot
be resolved by the central banks


152 unconventional policy carries risks
in addition to the advantages unconventional monetary policy also carries risks
which stem from the unintended sideeffects of the policy these risks can be
divided into four categories

 reduced market discipline the lower interest rates reduce the pressure on banks
to address balance sheet problems and write off bad loans that could lead to a
misallocation of credit the generous provision of liquidity by the ecb reduces
incentives for banks to raise market funding potentially leaving them dependent
on central bank funding it also perpetuates the fragmentation of the interbank

fragmentation the average median of the absolute deviation is calculated for three different periods

money market in the euro area and while the unconventional policy supports
the impact of conventional policy on the economy it cannot resolve the
underlying structural problems in the economy and the financial system all an
expansive monetary policy does is allow central banks to buy time to find
solutions attaching conditions to further support from the central bank may be
instrumental in forcing governments and banks to implement structural reforms

 price stability risks central banks are loosening monetary policy reins partly
because of the global trend of falling inflation however the ample liquidity that
central banks have created through their unconventional measures poses an
upside inflation risk in the longer term  and all the more so if the unwinding of
the monetary stimulus is initiated too late the ample liquidity can also fuel
excessive rises in asset prices equities and property when asset market bubbles
subsequently burst this gives rise to financial stability and deflation risks
the challenge for central banks is thus to recognise these risks in time and take
steps to adjust their policies early enough the main priority here is price
stability in the medium term

 dependence on governments with the large exposures central banks have built up
to their governments the dividing line between monetary and fiscal policy has
narrowed this is partly due to the provision of liquidity to banks as banks have
used this cash to buy bonds issued by their own government they have become
more dependent on that governments creditworthiness meanwhile this also
undermines the independence of central banks and increases the risk of
monetary financing these risks of unconventional policy must be contained by
keeping monetary policy within the limits of the eu treaty which prohibits the
monetary financing of governments

 financial imbalances unconventional monetary policy can lead to renewed
excessive riskseeking behaviour by market operators as the relative prices
change unconventional policy encourages market operators to invest in riskier
assets in search of higher returns this is actually the intention initially but it
can lead to asset price bubbles if the search for yield goes too far the abundant
liquidity in the system may find its way to emerging markets for example which
then become more sensitive to the phasing out of the expansive us monetary
policy macroprudential measures can be deployed to enhance institutions
financial resilience to possible market corrections see section 13


153 normalisation of monetary policy
given the risks of unconventional monetary policy described above monetary
policy will at some point have to be normalised one condition for this normali
sation is that the economy and the banking sector must have recovered from the
crisis sufficiently and convincingly for the time being that recovery appears to
be more pronounced in countries such as the united states and the united
kingdom than in the euro area when phasing out the unconventional measures
a number of other important factors will also have to be taken into account

during any exit a distinction must be made between conventional measures
policy rates and forward guidance and unconventional measures vltros
full allotment of liquidity requests and expansion of the collateral framework
when the economy starts to recover and risks to price stability increase
the monetary policy reins will have to be tightened as the health of the
financial sector improves and bottlenecks in the transmission mechanism reduce
the measures taken to increase liquidity can be scaled back and the list of assets


48 dnb  annual report 2013

interdependence of growth and financial stability




eligible for collateral can be shortened how unconventional measures are phased
out depends partly on the instruments used in the event of a recovery in
interbank activity and funding markets the need for precautionary liquidity will
reduce banks will make repayments on the longterm refinancing operations and
the liquidity surplus will shrink to some extent the design of the vltros thus
provides for a gradual and automatic exit from unconventional policy in the
euro area this will make the exit and communication about the process easier
however the policy of full allotment of central bank funding and the enlarged
collateral framework require an active exit in which decisions will have to be
taken on which assets are no longer eligible

the timing of the exit will be determined by the inflationary outlook and the
progress made in resolving the bottlenecks in the transmission mechanism
there is uncertainty about this especially in the euro area because the economic
recovery is still fragile and the euro area is experiencing a period of low inflation
which is below the ecbs price stability target the solidity of the financial system
will not be completely certain until the comprehensive assessment of bank
balance sheets has been completed see section 221 a premature exit could
harm the recovery while delaying the exit too long could trigger new financial
imbalances if monetary policy remains too loose for too long the risks described
above will become more and more manifest the interaction between the real
and financial spheres limits the ecbs room for manoeuvre for example
a premature tightening of monetary policy could hurt bank balance sheets to
such a degree that financial stability is jeopardised once again the creation of
the banking union will increase the room for manoeuvre because it will
contribute to a more robust banking sector

it is also important that the exit is implemented gradually a number of
indicators will be used to determine the pace as the conditions that count as
normal after the crisis are different from those before the crisis some traditional
indicators are less reliable for signposting the appropriate exit route there is for
example a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the potential growth of the
economy and the level of the neutral rate of interest a gradual exit will support
the recovery of market operation and allow close monitoring of the effects

apart from the speed of the exit the conditions that are regarded as normal
after the crisis will also dictate the way in which monetary policy is implemented
it is unclear whether there will be a complete return to the precrisis framework
the crisis and pending changes in financial regulations in relation to capital
and liquidity requirements influence the functioning of banks and markets and
therefore monetary transmission as well for example the shift from trading
activity to the secured money market begs the question of whether monetary
policy should still focus on interest rates in the unsecured money market it may
be that such developments demand changes to the monetary toolkit
and experiences with new instruments  gained during the crisis  can then be
useful moreover the ecb also appears to be focusing increasingly on financial
stability and is using new macroprudential instruments for this purpose this
too has implications for monetary policy because macroprudential measures
also affect the monetary transmission channels through their impact on financial
institutions and markets

exitrelated risks can be mitigated by preparing the markets in time an important
element in that preparation is a proper communication strategy this can help
limit the volatility of the financial markets once the expansive measures have
been scaled back

21 introduction
    the financial sector is going through a major transition in response to the
    financial crisis more than five years after its onset the end of this process is
    coming into view banks are making good progress with the transition in several
    respects including the strengthening of their buffers and the scaling back of
    their highrisk activities the consequences of the crisis have also prompted
    extensive changes in supervision the initial results are becoming apparent but
    implementation is still in full swing

    this chapter uses selected cases to outline the status of the principal challenges
    in supervision the focus is specifically on developments that will take place in
    the coming years and to a lesser extent on the supervisory activities in the
    reporting year a detailed review and account of the supervisory activities carried
    out by dnb in 2013 is given in the 2013 independent public body zbo report
    which is published simultaneously with this annual report

    section 22 describes developments in relation to the european banking union
    as part of the single supervisory mechanism ssm from 4 november 2014 the
    ecb will assume the ultimate responsibility for prudential banking supervision
    in the euro area the resolution of failing banks and the provision of safety nets
    will also be handled at supranational level within the banking union through
    the single resolution mechanism srm and the single resolution fund srf
    however a good deal of work remains to be done before november

    section 23 explores changes in the supervisory frameworks for banks insurers
    and pension funds dutch banks must be fully compliant with basel iii and the
    related european regulations by 2019 solvency ii is approaching for dutch
    insurers while the theoretical solvency criterion tsc has been implemented
    at national level work will also continue in the year ahead on the development
    of a new financial assessment framework financieel toetsingskader  ftk for
    dutch pension funds

    section 24 discusses developments in prudential supervision including integrity
    supervision the quality of supervision and its measurement the events
    surrounding sns property finance and the fixing of libor rates further
    underscored the importance of integrity supervision strengthening the position
    of integrity supervision is also one of the four key recommendations in the new
    dnb supervisory strategy 20142018 measuring the impact of supervision has
    also become more important in response dnb has developed a set of key
    performance indicators kpis for its supervisory ambitions formulated in 2012
    the first measurement was carried out in 2012 and the measurement and


    53 dnb  annual report 2013

    supervision work in progress




    reporting process was finetuned in 2013 for the results see the 2013 zbo report
    with a view to the accountability and continual improvement of supervision
    dnb will further embed these ambitions and kpis in its supervisory practice in
    the year ahead


22 european banking union

    221 european banking supervision
    dnb has been calling for supranational banking supervision for many years
    the ssm will help break through the negative interaction between member
    states and the national banking system supranational supervision is more
    consistent with the international nature of the banking sector in general and
    the dutch banking sector in particular from 4 november 2014 the ecb will
    assume ultimate responsibility for prudential banking supervision in the euro
    area in preparation the ecb is recruiting approximately 800 supervisors
    who will work closely with their national colleagues including those at dnb
    however the ssm is not a costsaving exercise in fact banking supervision is
    set to become more expensive ensuring an orderly transition to the ssm is
    a top priority for dnb in 2014

    the ssm will bring supranational banking supervision to europe an institutional
    improvement that dnb has supported for many years the banking union not
    only embraces supervision but also introduces supranational resolution of
    failing banks through the single resolution mechanism srm and the creation
    of safety nets via the single resolution fund srf the ssm will become
    operational on 4 november 2014 its geographical scope primarily concerns the
    euro area though member states outside the euro area can also participate
    the most recent signals from brussels suggest that the resolution pillar of the
    banking union the srm will likely come into effect shortly after the ssm
    this is welcome news as an effective banking union needs as a minimum
    to incorporate both supervision and resolution if supervision is organised
    supranationally but resolution is left at national level conflicts of interest can
    arise and undermine the effectiveness of the supervision it would mean for
    example that a supervisory decision to resolve a bank would be taken at central
    level whereas the bill resulting from such a decision would have to be paid at
    national level simultaneously introducing the two pillars in so far as possible
    will also reduce the risks for the taxpayer as early intervention through the srm
    avoids the need to address european funding mechanisms the third and final
    pillar of the banking union is a european deposit guarantee scheme dgs
    apart from a further harmonisation of national deposit guarantee schemes
    there are currently no concrete proposals on the table for a european dgs
    nor are they expected in the short term

    the primary purpose of the banking union is to break through the negative
    interaction between member states and their national banks several member
    states got into serious difficulties during the crisis because of problems with their
    national banking sectors and vice versa these national dynamics will be broken
    by centralising the supervision and resolution including funding of banks
    the banking union will also contribute towards a more level playing field for the
    banking sector banking supervision will become more uniform with less scope
    for national options and decisions this will help boost market confidence in the
    european banking system




    54 dnb  annual report 2013

supervision work in progress




the ssm is not a solo effort by the ecb but involves close cooperation between
the ecb and the national competent authorities ncas however the ecb
does take the lead in the ssm which is in line with its overall responsibility for
the prudential banking supervision of all banks in the euro area financial
supervision tasks other than the prudential supervision of banks fall outside the
mandate of the ssm and will continue to be organised at national level
examples or these include conduct supervision integrity supervision and
prudential supervision of pension funds and insurers

the ssm distinguishes between significant and less significant banks whether
or not a bank or banking group is classified as significant depends among other
things on the total value of its assets threshold value eur 30 billion and its
importance for the local economy threshold balance sheet values eur 5 billion
and 20 of gdp and in any event includes the three largest banks in each
participating member state in addition the ecb will exercise direct supervision
of banks that receive or have received direct support from the european
financial stability facility efsf or the european stability mechanism esm
of the total of more than 3000 banks in the euro area 124 are currently
identified as significant according to the above definition consolidated figures
this group of banks accounts for more than 85 of the consolidated bank assets
in the euro area the provisional list of significant banks includes seven dutch
institutions ing bank rabobank abn amro bank sns bank nederlandse
waterschapsbank bank nederlandse gemeenten and royal bank of scotland
nv together these banks represent almost 90 of dutch banking sector assets

the ecb will exercise direct supervision of significant banks through joint
supervisory teams jsts jsts are bankspecific account teams made up of ecb
and nca employees and led by a jst coordinator from the ecb the ecb will
make available more than 400 fulltime employees ftes to be divided across
an anticipated total of approximately 120 jsts the direct involvement of nca
employees in the jsts will ensure that local knowledge and expertise are being
used the ecb will supervise less significant banks indirectly these banks will
remain under the direct supervision of the ncas but the ecb can at all times
adjust or take over the supervision as part of this process ncas will report to
the ecb on their method of supervision and the decisions taken the ecb has
around 80 ftes available for this indirect supervision

in addition to institutionspecific supervision the ssm also provides for
crossinstitution supervision through a large horizontal supervision directorate
incorporating functions such as quality assurance market access intervention 
enforcement and onsite supervision dnb also covers most of these horizontal
functions but where the ssm identifies a separate onsite supervision function
dnb has integrated this function into its account supervision dnb has
additional horizontal functions that are currently not represented in the ssm
such as ict supervision and supervision of conduct and culture the ssm also
introduces new supervisory methods and processes it has for example
developed its own supervisory methodology risk assessment system or ras
which will replace dnbs risk assessment methodology focus in banking
supervision the new methods will apply in all member states participating in
the ssm and to every bank

the creation of the ssm has major consequences for dnb and the transition
will be an intensive process the largest changes will be made in banking
supervision the jsts for significant banks will have to be staffed while the
supervision of less significant banks must also be structured in accordance with


55 dnb  annual report 2013

supervision work in progress




ssm standards the onsite supervision function will consequently become
more separate from account supervision dnb also faces changes outside the
realm of banking supervision in such areas as the cooperation with insurance
and pension supervision financial stability macro and microlinkage dnbs
internal governance and the policy cooperation between ncas and the ecb

the transition also involves conducting a comprehensive assessment ca of
significant banks this detailed balance sheet review has in fact already begun
also for the seven dutch banks listed above there are three parts to the balance
sheet assessment 1 a supervisory assessment using ras 2 an asset quality
review aqr and 3 a stress test carried out jointly by the european banking
authority eba and the ecb see figure 21 in order to restore confidence in
the european banking sector the comprehensive assessment must be sufficiently
rigorous and must also be transparent in terms of process and methodology
the comprehensive assessment will be given a high priority during the
transitional year 2014 given the short timelines the specific expertise required
and the need for the exercise to be credible and impartial the ecb and ncas
will be supported by external parties

the ecb will pass on the costs of its supervisory tasks directly to the banking
sector the supervisory team will comprise approximately 800 ftes who will be
supported by a further complement of almost 300 ftes since the ncas will
retain their own budgets the introduction of the ssm means that banks will
face two supervision bills one central and one local the ecb is developing
a methodology for this compared with the other euro area countries banking
supervision in the netherlands is already fairly lean for example the average
dnb supervisory capacity for the three largest dutch banks is 15 ftes per bank
five fewer than the average used by other ncas for comparable institutions
dnb is explicitly seeking to avoid unnecessary overlap with ecb supervision
however the ssm is not a costsaving exercise banking supervision is set to
become more expensive

222 european resolution
european banking supervision is one of the three pillars of the banking union
in addition to the european supervisor a single resolution mechanism srm
is also being created for the orderly resolution of failing banks the srm will
have extensive powers one challenge here will be to ensure that strength and
competence are also embedded in the governance structure alongside the srm
there will also be a single resolution fund srf creating a single fund for all
banks within the srm area is an important step in breaking the interdependence
between banks and national governments it reduces the risk that public funds
will be needed to rescue banks in the future however to eliminate this
interdependence once and for all a supranational mechanism of last resort is also
needed for instance in the form of a credit line from the european stability
mechanism esm

new instruments such as bailin and resolution finance are intended to break the
interdependency between national governments and banks these instruments are
designed to protect states central banks and the banking sector itself against the
financial consequences of bank failures bailin is a means of writing off liabilities
or converting them to shares if banks fail or are in danger of failing it forms part
of the bank recovery and resolution directive brrd resolution finance
involves establishing arrangements in advance to finance the resolution of a bank
in the context of the banking union a single resolution fund srf will be built
up in europe financed by the banks which can be brought into play for a variety
of purposes such as liquidity injection or the provision of guarantees the brrd
is expected to come into effect in 2015 bailin no later than 2016

the brrd prescribes that investors must absorb losses equivalent to at least 8
of the balance sheet total via bailin before funding of up to a maximum of 5

can be provided from the resolution funds in principle public funds will be
used only after these options have been deployed the options of bailin and
resolution finance therefore reduce the risk that public funds will be needed to
rescue banks in the future however to completely break the interdependency
between governments and banks a publicly funded safety net totalling
eur 55 billion will be needed over and above the srf for example in the
form of a credit line from the esm

bailin
the purpose of bailin is to ensure that future bank losses are borne primarily by
shareholders and creditors before public funds are used this has a number of
key advantages first it limits the risks for the government second bailin
eliminates the distortion of the playing field between small and large banks
because of their critical function in the economy large banks stand to benefit
more from the safety net provided by the government third bank funding is
no longer implicitly subsidised but reflects the actual costs this reduces the
incentive for banks to take on excessive risks and encourages creditors to
monitor banks more effectively however since bailin implies that losses are
borne by different parties its application does carry contagion risks given these
risks it is important to know which parties are capable of holding debt paper
that may be subject to a bailin after all these parties run the risk of being
confronted with losses if a bailin proves necessary

as the bailin instrument in the brrd currently exists only on paper and has not
yet come into effect it is not possible to determine its effectiveness or its ultimate
impact on bank funding costs however there are indications that market
operators are increasingly allowing for the possibility of losses in the event of
a bank failure in the wake of the crisis investors no longer see bank debt as an
almost riskfree investment before the financial crisis investors rarely demanded
a risk premium for unsecured european bank bonds a return to that scenario is
now unlikely see chart 22

notwithstanding the bailin requirement the brrd allows the flexibility to
exempt specific creditors it is therefore not always clear in advance which holders
of bank debt will be affected this uncertainty could have a disproportionate
impact on bank funding costs banks can however mitigate this effect by
holding an explicit tranche of debt that is eligible for bailin financiers can price
a debt instrument more accurately if it is clear in advance that their loan will be
riskbearing if the bank gets into difficulties so an explicit bailin tranche boosts
financial stability and enhances the effectiveness of the bailin instrument

resolution finance
only after a bailin equivalent to at least 8 of the total liabilities has taken place
can a resolution fund provide capital of up to 5 of the balance sheet total
historically the 8 threshold is sufficiently high to ensure that resolution
finance will in most cases not be needed for loss absorption or recapitalisation
see chart 23 all uncovered liabilities with the exception of guaranteed
deposits must then be exhausted before a further contribution can be made for
loss absorption or recapitalisation

in its present form the srf is in principle not intended to protect shareholders
and creditors against losses in the event of resolution however resolution
experience shows that recapitalisation alone is often not sufficient to restore
confidence in the viability of a bank and that resolution finance is also needed
in cases that cannot be financed through bailin for example market operators
are often unwilling to finance a bank that is going through a resolution process
which potentially creates liquidity problems for the bank resolution finance
can resolve this by removing the uncertainty about toxic assets for example by
transferring them to a bad bank temporary finance or guarantees may also be
extended in addition capital may be provided to bridge banks and bad banks
as long as this does not conflict with the rule that shareholders and creditors must
bear the costs of resolution finally the funding can be used to compensate
creditors who are worse off due to the resolution than they would have been
had the bank been allowed to fail in the time following resolution and
recapitalisation the above measures can give the new management time to put

    things in order and restore confidence resolution finance can thus facilitate
    efficient resolution if a bank fails

    it is important for the effectiveness of the resolution fund and the banking union
    as a whole that the resolution fund is set up at european level european
    resolution finance enhances the credibility of the ecbs supervision because it
    involves application of the he who pays the piper calls the tune principle
    if member states remain individually responsible for resolution finance
    this could cause conflicts with european supervision a european fund
    by contrast automatically leads to exante risk sharing this reduces the risk of
    suboptimum resolution due to coordination problems and ad hoc risk sharing
    during crises it also reduces the tendency of national authorities to shield
    liquidity and capital at national level which will benefit the allocation of capital
    the operation of market forces and competition in europe a european
    resolution fund can also be smaller than the sum total of separate national funds


23 developments in the riskbased frameworks of the financial sector

    231 bazel iii crd ivcrr
    the capital requirements directive and the capital requirements regulation
    crd ivcrr which provide for the phased transposition of the basel iii
    capital accord into european directives came into force on 1 january 2014
    as a result european banks will have to meet standards that become increasingly
    strict each year up to 2019 banks strengthened their capital buffers substantially
    in recent years and the dutch banking sector remains on target to meet the basel
    iii capital adequacy requirements in full by 2019

    the basel capital frameworks are used as a starting point for calculating capital
    requirements in europe and many other parts of the world in europe these
    frameworks have been translated into regulations through the crd directives
    crd ivcrr came into effect on 1 january 2014 as part of the phased
    transposition of the basel iii accord into european directives in the years to 2019

    when the very first basel accord basel i was introduced in 1988 banks were
    obliged to calculate a riskweighted capital requirement this meant that a bank
    had to hold a certain minimum amount of capital depending on how risky its
    assets were for example a bank with a highquality mortgage book of
    eur 1 billion would need to hold less capital than a bank with a eur 1 billion
    portfolio of more risky commercial property loans the underlying idea was that
    banks with riskier operations needed larger buffers to absorb losses this same
    principle applies in basel iii though the method used for calculating risk
    weighted capital requirements has been refined and adapted over the years
    the basel i framework also introduced a minimum capital requirement of 8
    and created the first global standardisation of capital requirements

    the introduction of the basel ii accord in 2007 was an attempt to refine basel i
    the accord introduced a threepillar system the basel i capital requirements
    were replaced by new requirements that were placed in pillar 1 basel ii
    introduced the additional possibility provided certain conditions were met for
    banks to use their own internal models to calculate the capital requirements for
    credit market and interest rate risk this means that with the permission of its
    supervisor a bank no longer needs to base the calculation of the riskweighted
    capital requirement on prescribed standard risk weights but can use its own
    statisticallybased models the principal ideas here are that capital requirements

will then be more in line with the portfolios held by banks that banks can
strengthen their own risk management and that arbitrage by the shadow
banking sector will be avoided as far as possible the second pillar of the basel
ii framework comprises supplementary capital requirements the size of this
pillar 2 requirement depends on the degree to which the bank is exposed to risks
that are not covered by a capital requirement under pillar 1 examples include
concentration and model risks stress tests are another essential instrument in
determining the pillar 2 requirement the third and final pillar in the basel ii
framework consists of disclosure requirements for banks and supervisors
the idea is that disclosure enhances the quality of the information provided to
market operators thereby reinforcing the disciplinary impact of the market on
the conduct of banks

the basel iii accord tightens up the standards of basel ii the pillar 1 capital
requirement is increased in terms of both quality and quantity the proportion
of capital of the highest quality within the minimum capital requirement is more
than doubled to 8 and the introduction of additional capital buffers over and
above the core capital requirement of 8 means that the total amount of capital
to be held under pillar 1 may be higher for example basel iii introduces a
capital conservation buffer of 25 on top of the obligatory minimum capital
holding of 8 in addition dnb can order a bank to set aside a countercyclical
buffer of up to 25 if the bank has engaged in excessive lending this ensures
that banks build up a buffer during economically good times which they can
use to cushion losses when the economy weakens crd iv also introduces
a specific buffer component for systemically important banks and systemic risks
this buffer component will amount to between 1 and 3 for dutch systemic
banks see chart 24

finally the basel iii accord introduces an unweighted capital requirement
termed the leverage ratio in addition to the increased riskweighted capital
requirements this means that banks  regardless of how risky their assets are 
must always hold a certain amount of capital relative to their balance sheet
the leverage ratio thus serves as a backstop for the riskweighted capital
requirement starting in 2015 banks will be required to publish the leverage ratio
in europe the european commission will publish a final proposal by 2016
at the latest for the form the leverage ratio will take the european commission
aims to make the leverage ratio a binding requirement by 1 january 2018
the netherlands is arguing at european level for a leverage ratio of 4 at least
for systemically important banks

european banks can move in stages to comply with the basel iii framework
but must be fully compliant by 2019 dutch banks draw up migration plans each
year describing the steps they intend to take in order to meet this deadline
dnb assesses and monitors these migration plans carefully including the parallel
development of the capital buffers according to both basel ii and basel iii
to this end dnb has participated since the beginning of 2011 in the basel iii
monitoring exercise developed jointly by the basel committee and the eba
the purpose of this exercise is to gain insight into what the capital and liquidity
positions of banks will be under the basel iii framework all dutch banks with
the exception of branches of eu banks are taking part dnb uses these figures
in the first instance to increase its understanding of the current and future
development of the capital and liquidity position of banks under the new basel
iii regime additionally these figures form the starting point for the migration
plans

note the capital buffer in 2012 is shown under basel ii and is therefore not directly comparable with the data
for the other years which are expressed in terms of basel iii among other things the definitions of cet1
tier 1 and tier 2 were tightened up under basel iii in 2019 the major dutch banks must comply with
a riskweighted cet1 requirement that can be as high as 135 depending on the size of the sib buffer
and the countercyclical buffer the cet1 requirement is the sum of the minimum requirement 45
the breathing buffers 25 of capital conservation buffer 1  3 of systemically importantsystemic risk
buffer 0  25 of countercyclical buffer and a pillar 2 requirement approximately 1 the pillar 2
requirement can turn out higher and banks are not obliged to partially use cet1 to meet this requirement
source dnb




once the capital ratios of the dutch banking sector have been mapped out
the difference between the basel ii and the full basel iii framework in 2019 will
become clear see chart 25 the available capital buffers expressed in terms of
basel ii work out higher than the buffer according to the basel iii standards
this is because basel iii sets stricter standards for the quality of capital chart 25
also shows that dutch banks have strengthened their capital ratios substantially
in recent years the dutch banking sector is on course to fully meet the
enhanced solvency requirements of basel iii dnb will continue to closely
monitor the individual institutions migration plans

as a result of the stricter requirements for the quality of capital many old hybrid
instruments known as additional tier 1 or at1 instruments no longer qualify as
capital under basel iii these old instruments will be gradually phased out under
the crd iv rules at the end of 2013 the dutch state secretary for finance sent
a letter to the dutch house of representatives tweede kamer announcing

note this chart compares the total capital ratio expressed in terms of basel ii with the core capital ratio
cet1 under basel iii the reason that the total capital ratio under basel ii is not compared with the total
capital ratio under basel iii is that many old hybrid instruments issued by banks additional tier 1tier 2
instruments no longer qualify under the full requirements of the basel iii framework as it will apply in 2019
therefore the total capital ratios of dutch banks measured according to basel iii as per 2019 differ little from
the core capital ratios expressed in basel iii terms partly because of the disappearance of tax obstacles
dutch banks will gradually replace hybrid capital instruments that are being phased out with new qualifying
debt instruments
source dnb




legislation under which the new basel iii hybrid instruments will be treated as
debt capital this will remove the tax obstacles in future issues of new at1 debt
instruments enabling banks to strengthen their buffers further a key reason for
this decision is to guarantee a level playing field between dutch banks and banks
in other european countries almost all of which now permit taxdeductibility
of at1 under their own rules


232 insurers moving towards solvency ii
an important political agreement was reached at the end of 2013 which brings
closer the introduction of solvency ii on 1 january 2016 at the same time
meaningful steps were taken in the netherlands to make supervision more
riskbased and forwardlooking along the lines of solvency ii these steps were
necessary to be able to supervise insurers effectively in the runup to solvency ii

in 2013 a milestone was reached on the road to the introduction of solvency ii
the new european supervisory framework for insurers on 13 november 2013
the european parliament the european council and the european commission
reached a political agreement on the omnibus ii directive the agreement
establishes the main lines of the solvency ii framework and brings its imple
mentation on 1 january 2016 one step closer solvency ii introduces necessary
and fundamental changes in the supervision of insurers partly by providing
building blocks for better risk management riskbased capital requirements and
more forwardlooking supervision in addition the introduction of solvency ii
further harmonises european insurance supervision thus ensuring that all
policyholders will enjoy equal protection in the future




63 dnb  annual report 2013

supervision work in progress




a key component of the political agreement on solvency ii concerns the
valuation of longterm insurance obligations the omnibus ii directive
stipulates that the interest rate term structure against which insurance obligations
must be valued will contain supplementary addons and haircuts the directive
provides for a transitional period of 16 years for adjustment to the structure
this means that insurers have a maximum of 16 years in which to move from the
present interest rate term structure to the structure that will apply under
solvency ii insurers who wish to make use of this transitional measure must be
transparent regarding the effect of its application

to prepare for the introduction of solvency ii the european insurance and
occupational pensions authority eiopa issued a number of guidelines in 2013
these preparatory guidelines give national supervisors in europe tools to help
prepare for solvency ii in the areas of good governance own risk assessment
preapplication of internal models and reporting requirements by publishing
the guidelines which came into effect on 1 january 2014 eiopa is aiming to
ensure the consistent implementation of solvency ii in member states
the guidelines are aimed at national supervisors who are expected to incorporate
them into their regulatory frameworks or regimes and apply them to their own
national insurance sectors eiopa applies the comply or explain principle here
dnb has decided to fully apply the guidelines on good governance own risk
assessment and preapplication of internal models

last year significant steps were taken in the netherlands as well as at european
level to strengthen the supervision of insurers see figure 22 when it became
clear that the introduction of solvency ii on 1 january 2014 would not be
achieved the ministry of finance decided  partly in response to lobbying by
dnb  not to wait any longer for the introduction of solvency ii but to
strengthen dutch insurance supervision sooner dutch life insurers are facing
major challenges due to the shrinking market for individual policies see chart 26
driven partly by growing competition from banks in addition the returns
guaranteed to policyholders by dutch life insurers are relatively high by
international standards and this is expensive in the present low interest rate
climate against this backdrop the ministry of finance decided to make a
number of amendments to the decree on prudential rules for financial
undertakings besluit prudentiële regels wft  bpr these amendments include
the introduction of own risk assessment and the theoretical solvency criterion
tsc with effect from 1 january 2014

the introduction of the tsc marks an important step forward for insurance
supervision in the netherlands one shortcoming in the present solvency i
framework is that the capital requirement for insurers is not dependent on the
investment and insurance risks to which they are exposed that shortcoming is
resolved with the introduction of solvency ii the tsc will enable dnb in the
runup to the introduction of the solvency ii framework to assess the risk profile
of medium and large life insurers more effectively from 2014 this is because the
tsc serves as a riskbased indicator to establish whether an insurer will fall below
the required solvency margin in the coming 12 months or is in danger of doing
so if this is the case the insurer must submit a request for a declaration of no
objection to dnb to allow it to make dividend distributions or other capital
withdrawals this means that dnb can put a brake on capital withdrawals if the
financial position of an insurer is not strong enough the tsc thus enables
dnb to exercise more riskbased and forwardlooking supervision

securities insurers have increased their investments in mortgages and highgrade
government bonds with a credit rating of aa or higher these trends can lower
the risk profile of the investments of individual insurers and lead to a reduction
in the future capital requirement under solvency ii

this year will be dominated by the further development of the solvency ii
framework many components still have to be implemented in lowerlevel
regulations examples include establishing the level of the capital requirements
and determining the credit risk haircut in the interest rate term structure
the european commission will make a start on this in the first half of 2014
during this process it is important that sufficient account is taken of a number
of specific characteristics of the dutch insurance sector such as basic health
insurance in that context it is essential that capital requirements are realistic for

233 towards a futureproof pension system
steps were taken in the past year to make the dutch pension system more
sustainable one important step was the design of a new financial assessment
framework financieel toetsingskader  ftk further adaptations are still needed
however in order to ensure that the pension system reflects modern dutch
society where individuality and flexibility are increasingly important values
it is essential to retain the strong elements in the system such as full funding
and mandatory pension savings

in a good and sustainable pension system pension funds meet their obligations
and economic stability and growth are supported in the past year important
steps were taken to improve the pension system first the reinforcement of

pension fund governance act wet versterking bestuur pensioenfondsen 
wvbp came into effect this act further strengthens the quality and suitability
of pension fund governance and the degree to which directors are in control
a second step was the reform of the financial assessment framework in 2013
the blueprint for this new supervisory framework was developed by the ministry
of social affairs and employment in cooperation with dnb finally
the affordability of the pension contract was improved by the political
agreement in relation to the witteveen framework see box 21

the reform of the financial assessment framework is a necessary step that will be
worked out further in 2014 an energetic approach is essential here as it will help
ensure a solid pension sector and the necessary restoration of confidence in the
system chart 28 shows that the average nominal funding ratio at the end of
2013 was in fact back above the minimum required level of around 105 the real
funding ratio stood at 82 which means there is still insufficient money in the
system to compensate for inflation on a structural basis the real funding ratio
is calculated on the assumption of a 2 price inflation rate it is therefore
important to structurally improve the financial basis under the present system
partly bearing in mind the need for a further recovery of consumer confidence
the urgency of this question was expressed convincingly by the goudswaard
and frijns commissions in 2010



 box 21 witteveen framework and generational balance test
 in december 2013 the dutch government reached an agreement with a number
 of opposition parties on making the tax relief arrangements for pension
 contributions less generous the witteveen framework under the agreement
 starting 2015 the maximum pension accrual for an average salary pension
 scheme will be lowered from 215 to 1875 per annum in addition
 tax relief will be capped at an income of eur 100000

 these changes are taking place against the background of a rise in the
 pensionable age as people will be working longer they can still achieve
 a reasonable pension at a lower maximum accrual rate at the same time
 the government and opposition parties want pension funds that make their
 pension schemes less generous to ensure that the lower pension accrual is
 reflected in lower employers and employees contributions
 lower contributions could support the tentative recovery of the economy
 dnb endorses the governments aims

 at the same time pension contributions must be in balance with the
 commitments to pension scheme members dnb has offered to carry out
 a generational balance test on pension contributions this test is intended to
 ensure that decisions regarding the level of contributions are based on
 a balanced weighing of interests the basis for the generational balance test is
 the dutch pension act pensioenwet which prescribes such a balanced
 weighing of interests to support the test the government will introduce
 a number of legislative and regulatory amendments pension funds will
 for example be forced to be more transparent about pension accrual and to
 seek advice from the accountability board on the level of contributions
 in a letter to the government dnb announced that it will carry out a
 sectorwide review in the second half of 2014 to assess the balance between
 generations in setting the level of contributions for 2015

the longterm sustainability of the pension system will require further changes
there is scope for additional improvements in financial sustainability partly by
improving transparency for instance it is important for pension scheme
members to know the level of their pension and the related degree of uncertainty
further adjustments are also needed to ensure the societal sustainability of the
pension system in particular this means making changes to the institutional
structure of the system to better align the pension system with todays society
in which members expect more transparency demand more freedom of choice
and follow ever more varied career paths

against this backdrop the state secretary for social affairs and employment
announced the intention to launch a broad public debate in 2014 on the future
of the dutch pension system a logical theme in this debate is uniformity
in the present system pension funds are required to treat all members largely
identically as regards contributions entitlements and investment policy
one example is the flatrate contribution whereby members  regardless of
factors such as their age  pay the same contribution for the same pension
accrual however employment patterns today are more diverse partly because
of the rise in selfemployment career interruption for study or care leave and
regular changes of employer it is therefore important for the clarity of the system
that the scope for a transition from the flatrate contribution to a different
system is explored further

from a macroeconomic perspective it is also important to strike a better balance
between stable contributions and stable pension benefits where pension
contracts focus purely on the level of benefits financial setbacks often create
pressure to raise pension contributions while such a step would strengthen the
financial position of the pension fund it could also have a procyclical effect
after all changes to contributions  via the employers contributions  have an
impact on the competitiveness of companies and on employment a possible
alternative would be a stable pension contribution however where a pension
fund pursues a risky investment policy a stable contribution can lead to
volatility in pension entitlements and benefits this also affects the macro
economy through consumer confidence though the cyclical effect of volatility


68 dnb  annual report 2013

               supervision work in progress




               in contributions is generally greater than the effect of volatility in entitlements
               and benefits as changes in pensions that have not yet come into payment have
               a less direct economic impact at the same time the primary aim in the present
               system is that pension contributions should be selffinancing which can be
               at odds with stabilising contributions one possible way of ensuring that
               contributions remain selffinancing is to introduce flexible pension accrual
               this alternative has a smaller macroeconomic impact than large fluctuations in
               contributions

               finally it is important in the broad public debate to preserve the strong elements
               of the dutch pension system for example the dutch system sets itself apart
               internationally owing to its funded status and mandatory pension saving
               the collective nature of dutch pensions is also a strong feature collectivity leads
               to benefits of scale and enables risk sharing so that good times and bad times can
               be spread across different generations there are however limits to this form of
               solidarity imposing a disproportionate burden on certain groups of members can
               put pressure on the collective nature of the system if support is to be maintained
               the forms of solidarity should be transparent


		 24 the changing face of supervision
               dnb has intensified its prudential supervision in recent years however
               prudential supervision is never finished the recently published dnb
               supervisory strategy 20142018 describes a number of areas of supervision to
               which dnb will devote extra attention in the coming years key focus areas
               include integrity supervision and transparency regarding supervisory activities
               and their impact by rendering clear account to society supervision can bolster
               confidence in the dutch financial sector and in supervision with this in mind
               the supervisory ambitions and related kpis formulated in 2012 will be further
               embedded in dnbs supervisory activities in the year ahead

               it is not just the legislation and regulations that have been tightened up in
               response to the financial crisis dnbs prudential supervision has also been
               further intensified in recent years this was first set out in dnbs supervisory
               strategy 20102014 and in the action plan for a change in the conduct of
               supervision drawn up in 2010 supervision has become more forwardlooking by
               emphasising strategic and qualitative elements such as an institutions business
               model and its culture and decisionmaking processes these factors can have a
               major impact on the longterm solidity of an institution supervision also looks
               more explicitly at risks across individual institutions dnb safeguards the links
               between macroprudential analysis and microprudential supervision in several
               ways the financial stability division plays a central role here through macro
               economic monitoring drawing up a macroregister for supervision and setting
               policy for the orderly recovery and resolution of institutions

               supervision was also made more thematic with the introduction of the new
               focus supervisory approach in 2012 as a result dnb more often analyses
               and addresses prudential risks at sector level instead of focusing on individual
               institutions dnb now deploys approximately 25 of its supervisory capacity on
               supervisory themes a recent survey showed that supervised institutions actually
               experience the supervision as being more intensive more intrusive and more
               conclusive see the 2013 zbo report there is a greater willingness to take action

               meanwhile the supervisory organisation has been strengthened first
               dnb reorganised in 2011 the role of the expertise centres was reinforced


               69 dnb  annual report 2013

supervision work in progress




internal quality control intensified and intervention  enforcement were given
a separate and stronger position within the organisation in february 2012
the act strengthening governance of financial supervisors dnb and afm
wet versterking herziening governance dnb en de afm came into force
this act underpins the autonomous role of prudential supervision second
dnb succeeded in raising the level of specialist expertise through internal training
courses formerly conducted by the supervisory academy since 1 january 2014
the dnb academy and external recruitment third in 2013 dnb started using
performance measurement as an instrument to manage its own supervisory
organisation and render account to external stakeholders measuring results is a
standard component of supervisory examinations as far as possible results are
made public in the annual zbo report and updates

however prudential supervision is never finished and dnb will continue its
efforts in the above areas due to the exceptional financial sector dynamics
supervision is required to keep adapting to relevant new developments in the
sector this is reflected in the new supervisory strategy 20142018 this document
formulates ambitions for the financial sector and sets out four new core focus
areas for dnb supervision building on the direction dnb has taken in the
dnb supervisory strategy 20102014 first it is very important that the ecb
becomes an effective supervisor and that dnb is able to function effectively
within the ssm dnb gives high priority to achieving this second dnb
continues to strengthen its own supervisory approach to this end dnb is
looking to strengthen its information base among other things by focusing on
good data quality further strengthening the link between the macro and micro
levels carrying out more indepth supervisory examinations at institutions and
remaining constantly alert to underlying patterns third integrity supervision
will be strengthened the initiatives planned include formulating an integrity
supervision strategy across the supervisory spectrum creating clarity about
priorities and internal roles and ensuring that signals from the field are shared
more effectively finally where possible dnb will seek to be transparent by
providing more information about financial institutions and the effectiveness
of its supervision as part of the dialogue with external stakeholders
impact measurement is an important instrument in this respect

the following sections look in more detail at integrity supervision the related
supervision of conduct and culture at institutions and supervision impact
measurement


241 integrity supervision
in addition to financial stability integrity is a key condition for confidence in
the financial sector recent events such as the sns property finance affair and
the libor scandal have shown that infringements of integrity can have far
reaching consequences integrityrelated incidents damage trust and confidence
in an institution and have financial consequences through fines damage claims
and loss of clients in this sense there is a clear interaction between prudential
and integrity risks in addition to carrying out prudential supervision dnb also
supervises the integrity of financial institutions this task is laid down in the
financial supervision act wet op het financieel toezicht  wft the antimoney
laundering and antiterrorist financing act wet ter voorkoming van
witwassen en de financiering van terrorisme  wwft and the sanctions act 1977
sanctiewet  sw

supervision work in progress




the purpose of integrity supervision is to ensure a sound financial sector it is
vital to prevent the trust and confidence in a financial institution or the financial
sector as a whole from being undermined consequently integrity supervision is
primarily preventative in nature and aims to avoid infringement of integrity by
setting standards for the structuring of an institutions business operations
following an incident or other indications of a lack of integrity the focus of the
supervision becomes investigative where necessary dnb will cooperate in the
financial expertise centre fec with other authorities that are active in the
fields of supervision audit investigation and prosecution apart from sanctions
that may be imposed for infringement of integrity an institution will be
required to structure its business operations in such a way that these types of
infringements are avoided in the future

dnbs integrity supervision targets three types of integrity infringement namely
those whereby the institution perpetrates facilitates or is a victim of an integrity
infringement preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism are
often mentioned in the same breath as cybercrime yet there is an important
distinction between them an institution facilitates moneylaundering whereas
in the case of cybercrime the institution is the victim of an integrity incident
the infringement of integrity can also come from within the organisation itself
an example would be the taking of bribes or misconduct by staff when setting
interest rates as in the libor scandal when determining the necessary
supervisory action it is important to make a distinction between the different
types of integrity infringement each type has a different impact on an institution
and demands a different approach from both institution and supervisor

dnb will intensify its integrity supervision in the coming years and is developing
a broadbased strategy for integrity supervision the central plank of which is
detecting integrity infringements risk analysis and information sharing within
dnb are also being improved so that patterns can be detected more readily
using the existing information to this end dnb will draw on the experiences
of the netherlands authority for the financial markets afm among other
things finally the introduction of the ssm will also have consequences for
dnbs integrity supervision although this will continue to be a national task
the ecb  as the prudential supervisor  will wish to ensure sound and ethical
business operations prudential and integrity supervision are related on this
point and close cooperation and clear agreements with the ecb are therefore
necessary in order to avoid overlaps and blind spots in supervision


242 supervision of conduct and culture of financial institutions
supervision of the conduct and culture of financial institutions  and in relation
to that their internal governance  has steadily gained in importance since the
onset of the financial crisis the shortcomings that emerged during the crisis
have led to new legislation and regulations in the financial sector aimed at
repairing these internal governance defects figure 23 presents an overview of
the new rules and principles and shows that developments have followed each
other in rapid succession not only with regard to governance provisions in
legislation but also in terms of codes and principles the focus in many of the
governance measures put in place since 2008 is on conduct and the influence of
aspects of conduct on the governance of institutions and the effectiveness of
risk management

among the measures expected in 2014 are new rules on remuneration policy
and suitability tests these rules are partly the result of national developments

                                 recommendations by the financial stability board fsb changes have for
                                 example been made in the area of remuneration whereby bonus payments have
                                 been capped or prohibited within a short space of time following all the
                                 efforts to bring about behavioural change time alone will tell whether the new
                                 governance standards prove to be effective in practice society expects
                                 supervisors to make clear how effective their supervision is with this in mind
                                 dnb has initiated a project that measures the impact of its supervision on the
                                 suitability of directors and remuneration policy these measurements should
                                 reveal in 2014 whether the policy pursued has had the envisaged effect


                                 243 supervision performance measurement
                                 the importance of performance measurement in financial supervision has
                                 increased greatly since the outbreak of the financial crisis by rendering clear
                                 account to society supervision can help restore confidence in the dutch
                                 financial sector dnb actively seeks ways to make the impact of its supervision
                                 more transparent which means that it places more emphasis on impact
                                 measurement against this backdrop dnb formulated four ambitions in 2012
                                 for its supervision of the financial sector first supervision must minimise the
                                 risk of bankruptcies and instability second dnbs supervision must be classed
                                 as a best practice at the international level third supervision has the explicit
                                 task of promoting confidence in the dutch financial sector finally the authority
                                 of dnbs supervision must be taken as read by the dutch financial sector
                                 these four central ambitions have been operationalised in the form of key
                                 performance indicators kpis which show to what extent dnb is meeting its
                                 supervisory ambitions the first measurement of the kpis was carried out in
                                 2012 after which the measurement and reporting process was finetuned in 2013
                                 for the results see the 2013 zbo report in 2014 dnb will perform quarterly
                                 measurements to determine the progress in realising its four ambitions

ambition 1 supervision minimises the risk of bankruptcies and instability
with this ambition dnb seeks to ensure that no assets are lost through
bankruptcies to minimise the risk of bankruptcies dnb applies stepped
supervisory regimes in which the supervision becomes steadily more intensive
from lowthreshold to urgent if dnb raises the supervisory regime for an
institution the intervention strategy also changes financial institutions in the
highest regimes must formulate and implement an improvement plan in close
consultation with dnb so that they move out of the enhanced supervision
regime as quickly as possible institutions with a high risk profile should spend
no more than one year in the enhanced supervision regime based on past
experience this is a strict target nonetheless dnb believes it is important to
apply this standard

ambition 2 dnbs supervision is classed as best practice internationally
in a small open economy with a relatively large financial sector supervision
should be of the highest quality this ambition is intended to ensure that dnbs
supervision is among the best in the world a good indicator of this is the score
in the international monetary funds imf regular financial sector assessment
program fsap in a fsap the imf assesses aspects such as the quality of
financial supervision in the 188 member countries including the netherlands
the next fsap for the netherlands will take place in 2015 dnbs supervision is
also regularly assessed by other international bodies such as the financial
stability board fsb the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs
and other international standardsetters in the sector its performance is then
compared with that of its fellowsupervisors these organisations establish rules
and best practices that national supervisors must meet or that can be used as
a benchmark from november 2014 the ecb will also be a critical observer
based on its responsibility for the supervision of significant banks in the euro
area with regard to international benchmarks dnb is seeking to improve its
previous score and be among the top five countries in the benchmark

ambitions 3 and 4 supervision promotes confidence and has authority in the dutch
financial sector
since 2013 dnb has carried out an annual survey among external stakeholders
among other things to assess confidence in the dutch financial sector and dnbs
authority see the 2013 zbo report dnbs reputation is also measured using
the reputation monitor developed by erasmus university rotterdam
this measurement takes the form of a quarterly survey held among dutch citizens
with an aboveaverage interest in and knowledge of the financial world financial
citizens the results can then be compared with those of other organisations
in addition dnb fulfils the role of gatekeeper for market access for financial
institutions and directors if licences granted and director approvals must be
rescinded at a later date this has a negative impact on confidence in dnb
to assess the level of due care employed in these procedures dnb therefore
applies the norm that no problems must arise within two years of the approval of
a director or the issuance of a declaration of no objection

it is important that kpis and targets are always viewed in context there may be
a good reason for failure to achieve a target which  provided it is properly
substantiated  need not detract from the ability to achieve an ambition
given the interconnectedness and interdependencies within the financial sector
it is difficult to entirely exclude external influences from a performance
measurement conversely hitting a target does not by definition mean that the
ambition in question has been achieved naturally it is not just the current
score on the kpis the snapshot that is important but also the development

the film of those indicators over time only then do improvements become
clearly visible with a view to the accountability and continuous improvement
of supervision dnb will further embed its ambitions and kpis in its supervisory
practice in the year ahead

 3 payment and settlement system
   challenges and opportunities



31 introduction
    the key aim of the payment and settlement system is invariably to ensure
    that security reliability and efficiency are preserved amid technological
    economic and social changes

    this chapter examines the following topics measures in response to disruptions
    and ddos attacks in the spring of 2013 section 32 innovations and their
    impact on security and efficiency including the farreaching transition to sepa
    standards section 33 developments in the cash distribution and processing
    market section 34 and dealing with a potential scarcity of goodquality
    collateral section 35


32 a secure and reliable payment system
    the analysis carried out by the national forum on the payment system
    maatschappelijk overleg betalingsverkeer  mob in 2013 showed that the
    netherlands has a wellfunctioning payment system however it identified three
    areas where user groups would like to see greater availability or improvement of
    alternative payment methods


    321 analysis of the robustness of the payment chain
    technological developments imply increasing freedom of choice with regard to
    payment methods but also create a more complex payment chain and risks of
    breakdowns the breakdowns and ddos distributed denial of service attacks
    in april 2013 prompted mob to analyse the robustness of the payment chain
    the forum looked at what alternative payment products were available for credit
    transfers direct debits inpayment transfers acceptgiro ideal credit cards
    debit card payments electronic purse cards chipknip cash and atm
    withdrawals and how quickly and on what scale these alternatives could be
    brought into use if a payment product was no longer accessible through a
    specific channel or multiple channels the analysis concluded that the dutch
    payment system is robust there are alternatives to existing payment products or
    there are several different methods channels that can be used to effect the
    payment user groups identified three areas where they would appreciate action
    to increase availability and provide improved alternatives online banking
    ideal the payment standard for secure direct online payments via ebanking
    and debit card payments banks have already taken steps to improve the
    resilience to ddos attacks and work is also ongoing to upgrade the fallback


    77 dnb  annual report 2013

payment and settlement system challenges and opportunities




capability of mobile banking for consumers moreover banks are taking technical
measures to reduce the interdependencies between online banking mobile
banking and ideal and are working on a mobile variant of ideal for debit
card payments banks and retailers are exploring fallback options the measures
taken will be evaluated by mob in the first half of 2014

in addition two legislative changes have strengthened the supervision of the
payment system firstly with effect from 1 february 2014 clearing and
settlement institutions parties that forward approve or net payment instructions
are subject to supervision and secondly on 1 january 2015 the financial
supervision act wet op het financieel toezicht  wft will explicitly state that
rules can be set for the operations of authorisation holders to promote the
effectiveness of the payment system


322 cyber attacks in the payment and settlement system
cyber attacks target both the availability and the integrity of various products
channels and organisations in the payment and settlement system the ddos
attacks in april 2013 led to the temporary shutdown of online banking systems
and services cyber criminals seek financial gain and develop attacks using
malware and phishing techniques banks have invested heavily to increase their
ability to monitor detect and block fraudulent transactions in their payment
systems the fraud figures stabilised in 2012 and began to decline from 2013
onwards see chart 31 in the netherlands too debit card skimming has been
a major problem for years the level of security has ultimately been increased
and the losses from skimming have been contained considerably this was
achieved through the introduction of the emv chip to replace the magnetic
strip and a measure referred to as geoblocking  the standard blocking of debit
cards for payments outside europe  unless customers specifically indicate they
want to have this block lifted temporarily or permanently

given the increase in the number and complexity of attempted attacks it is
vital that banks continue to refine their countermeasures this applies to
mobile banking as well which has grown so fast within the space of two years
that it is now used more widely in the netherlands than traditional pcbased
online banking de nederlandsche bank dnb ensures that institutions
address these developments adequately and take measures to combat risks that
could undermine controlled business operations the thematic examination of
information security which has been ongoing for several years now shows that

    payment and settlement system challenges and opportunities




    the level of information security has improved since 2010 a thematic
    examination of complex ict infrastructures will be initiated in 2014

    at european level prudential supervisors and payment supervisors overseers
    have joined forces in the security of retail payments forum which was
    established by the ecb in 2011 in early 2013 to apply more uniform rules for
    online retail payments the ecb published a series of minimum security
    recommendations for online banking and online card payments supervisors and
    overseers can incorporate these recommendations into the assessment frameworks
    at national level the netherlands already amply met these standards

    at global level the basel committee on payment and settlement systems cpss
    is developing policy in relation to cyber security for financial market
    infrastructures fmis such as systemically important payment systems central
     securities depositories and securities settlement systems central counterparties
    and trade repositories the efforts are focused on fmi initiatives aimed at
    increasing the resilience to cyber threats and target both the participants and
    the operator responsible for the processing settlement and logging of transac
    tions in the payment and settlement systems specific attention is being devoted
    to situations where a cyber attack infects both the primary system of an fmi and
    its backup facility given their critical role in the financial system fmis fall
    under the oversight payment supervision of central banks the accountability
    for the performance of dnbs oversight of payment and settlement systems is
    set out in the 2013 oversight of payment and settlement systems report

    in october 2013 the dutch government published the national cyber security
    strategy 2 setting out a line of action for combating cybercrime in the financial
    sector by strengthening cooperation this helps to structurally strengthen the
    enforcement capacity the governments aim is that private sector operators
    should actually play a role in public sector structures partly through the liaison
    structure of the national cyber security centre ncsc to which people from
    a number of vital sectors have been seconded since october 2013 dutch banks
    have had a permanent representation in the ncsc further reinforcing
    cooperation in the event of cyber incidents in the private and public sectors

    the payment and settlement systems will be further affected by technological
    and market developments in the years ahead meanwhile cyber threats will
    continue to develop and target the availability and integrity of different
    products channels and organisations it is therefore essential that both private
    and public sector operators take measures that safeguard the security of the entire
    chain and it is important that they continue to work on measures in 2014 to
    further strengthen both the individual and collective resilience to cyber threats


33 faster and more efficient payments
    innovations in the payment system often improve efficiency and are therefore
    desirable provided security and safety are adequately guaranteed ease of use
    and adequate security determine whether consumers businesses and retailers
    will use a given payment option


    331 sepa a basis for innovations at european level
    the biggest change affecting the payment system in recent years is the transition
    to european standards for credit transfers and direct debits this has laid the
    basis for the single euro payments area sepa which enables consumers and


    79 dnb  annual report 2013

payment and settlement system challenges and opportunities




businesses to easily transfer and receive payments in euros to and from accounts
in other countries the most noticeable change for consumers is the conversion
of their old bank account number into the longer iban account number sepa
is one of the biggest projects ever undertaken in the dutch payment system and
creates substantial project and operational risks in response to this dnb set up
a special agency in 2011 to organise the transfer of the netherlands to the new
standards their iban promotion campaign encouraged banks large corporations
smes software companies and consumers to make preparations for the migration
to sepa at european level it was decided at the start of 2014 to extend the
original deadline of 1 february 2014 by a further six months the netherlands
was largely ready for the migration on 1 february

now that the sepa migration in the netherlands and europe is virtually
complete it is time to look ahead the standardisation of the main payment
products opens the way for more competition and therefore more efficiency
lower costs and better more innovative products it will for example be easier
to process payments at european level creating scope for consolidation and
therefore cost reductions through scale effects for instance the netherlands
based payment processor equens also processes part of the german and italian
retail payments and sepa creates opportunities for new payment services that
can be used across the whole euro area a case in point is the emandate that is
being developed for the sepa direct debit this digital authorisation for a direct
debit collection represents a considerable efficiency improvement compared
with the present paper forms but sepa will also act as an incentive to find
solutions to enable more and more payments to be made automatically
with a single click this will obviate the need to manually type in long payment
references on payment transfer forms for example

while sepa offers multiple opportunities for improving the european payment
system this will not happen automatically ensuring that the payment system
continues to meet users needs and requirements will demand increasing
cooperation at european level it was therefore a welcome move when
in december 2013 the ecb created the euro retail payments board erpb
which brings together providers and users of payment services the erpb is the
european counterpart of the dutch national forum on the payment system
mob national central banks play an important role within the erpb as a link
between the national and european level there are still differences between
countries in terms of infrastructure and payment habits and discussions will
therefore initially mainly take place at national level the netherlands
for example is exploring possibilities to speed up the processing of payments
for example by enabling payments to be credited at weekends as well as during
the week ultimately however european solutions are preferable to national
ones to benefit most from the single market


332 recent payment innovations
one important payment innovation that will change checkout behaviour is
contactless payment in 2013 this new payment method was tested in the
netherlands by three banks  abn amro ing and rabobank  as part of the
temporary mobile payment project in leiden in addition several parties in the
payment system began issuing new debit cards with contactless chips the users
mobile phone or debit card is held a short distance from the pointofsale pos
terminal in order to carry out the payment a pin need not be keyed in for
lowvalue payments which speeds up the payment process the limit has been
set at eur 25 in order to restrict financial loss in the event of card misuse


80 dnb  annual report 2013

payment and settlement system challenges and opportunities




for example through loss or theft the contactless technology has the same
level of security as a debit card with a chip that is used in pos terminals
as contactless payment is primarily intended for relatively small amounts it will
replace the chipknip electronic purse card which will be abolished with effect
from 1 january 2015 currently consumers mainly use cash for small payments
in 2012 79 of payments up to eur 5 were made in cash depending on the
number of pos terminals suitable for this technology and on the reaction of the
public to the new payment method the introduction of contactless payment
could lead to a further decline in the number of cash payments

a new mobile pos terminal mpos was launched for retailers who are not yet
able to offer customers the option of debit card payments retailers can connect
this device to their smartphone or tablet enabling them to accept card payments
this device works in the same way as a pos terminal major card companies
carry out security checks on the mpos terminals and issue a certificate for
approved devices the costs of the mpos terminal are lower compared to
a regular pos terminal and providers generally do not charge a monthly fee
but rather a percentage per payment this considerably lowers the entry
threshold for retailers who need a pos terminal only occasionally

for some years payment service providers have been offering consumers and web
retailers online payment facilities based on online banking the payment service
provider gives access to the payment account on behalf of the consumer in
order to make the payment to the web retailer already in 2009 dnb indicated
that it had serious concerns about the technical configuration of this solution
security is at stake because a party other than the account holder is given access
to the payment account at the end of 2012 dnb developed the dual consent
approach for providing secure and reliable thirdparty access to payment
accounts that access is only granted after both the customer and the bank have
given their agreement this approach also includes the recommendation that
the third party be placed under supervision within the recast payment services
directive this view is supported by dutch stakeholders including the online
retail organisation thuiswinkelorg the netherlands bankers association
the payment system facilitator currence and the dutch consumer association
and is set out in a joint position paper the european parliament and the eu
council will debate the revised version of the payment services directive in
2014 under the proposal by the european commission the third party in the
transaction will be placed under supervision however the dual consent
approach has not been incorporated in the proposal


333 bitcoin a development outside the usual parameters
a development that falls outside the usual systems and therefore raises national
and international questions is the virtual bitcoin currency bitcoin is a decen
tralised system based on a cryptographic calculation whereby linkedup network
computers together generate the digital bitcoin currency users can buy bitcoins
from online exchange offices and place them in a virtual bitcoin wallet
the network not only generates bitcoins but also serves as the payment system
each bitcoin and each wallet has a unique number which is not linked to an
identity or name however its anonymity also makes the bitcoin attractive to
criminals for example bitcoins can be used to launder money and transactions
can be effected without being overseen by the authorities making bitcoin
payments is virtually free and very fast moreover there are no national borders
within the network meaning that it makes no difference where the payer and
recipient are located this is different from the regular payment system


81 dnb  annual report 2013

    payment and settlement system challenges and opportunities




    where payments to the other side of the world involve fairly high transaction
    charges legal tender derives its reliability from the fact that the money is issued
    by a central bank and from the confidence that is placed in banks for example
    through the deposit guarantee scheme this is not the case for bitcoins there is
    no organisation that can offer that level of confidence if an online service for
    bitcoin wallets fails or is hacked customers will lose their bitcoins in december
    2013 dnb therefore issued a warning that consumers should be aware of these
    risks virtual currencies fall outside the scope of the financial supervision act
    which means there is no supervision of the currency or the entities that offer
    bitcoin services


34 cash distribution and processing in a state of flux
    the use of cash is declining as dnb considers it very much in the public
    interest that cash remains widely accessible and usable efforts are made to
    organise the distribution and processing of cash in the netherlands more
    efficiently

    a total of 38 billion cash payments were made in the netherlands in 2012 down
    more than 13 compared with two years earlier see chart 32 cash withdrawals
    from atms and bank counters fell to an estimated eur 47 billion in 2013
    a decline of over 10 in two years see chart 33 the declining use of cash
    means that the relative impact of the fixed costs of distributing and processing
    banknotes will increase for example the extensive network of atms is a major
    cost item for banks while cash transport and processing also carry fixed costs
    in order to reduce the fixed costs banks are rationalising their atm networks
    the number of bank atms in the netherlands had fallen to under 7700 at
    the end of september 2013 800 fewer than four years earlier see chart 34
    banks are also raising their fees for handling cash in particular the fees retailers
    have to pay for depositing and withdrawing cash these fee increases may
    prompt retailers to further promote debit card payments something that dnb
    regards as a positive development

    however as cash still plays a key role in the payment system it is very important
    that it remains easy for consumers to withdraw cash from their bank accounts
    that retailers still have good facilities for depositing their earnings into their
    accounts and that cash can still generally be used for making payments to date
    cash is the only payment instrument that is accepted virtually universally for
    pointofsale transactions no less important it is the last remaining alternative
    if the electronic payment chain fails to function for any reason for example
    during a technical breakdown or cyber attack moreover there are still people
    who perhaps temporarily do not have access to a debit or credit card

    dnb therefore encourages efforts to make the distribution and processing of
    cash more efficient this will allow better control of costs without affecting the
    accessibility and usability of cash the threeyearly study by mob provides
    important information on this issue the 2013 study showed that accessibility is
    still good in the netherlands 998 of residents have access to a bank atm
    within a radius of five kilometres the accessibility of cash is also enhanced
    by the growing number of nonbank atms these are now installed at
    approximately 800 retail locations across the netherlands mainly in
     supermarkets

83 dnb  annual report 2013

    payment and settlement system challenges and opportunities




    the restructuring of the cashintransit and cash processing market is a very
    important factor here and was set in motion by the creation of geldservice
    nederland gsn in 2010 the three largest dutch banks decided in consultation
    with dnb to set up this jointly owned subsidiary to carry out a large proportion
    of their banknote handling activities gsn now processes the banknotes that
    these banks receive from their customers ultimately gsn will also take over
    responsibility for arranging the maintenance and filling of bank atms as well as
    the related cashintransit activities gsn will contract companies to carry out
    these activities on its instructions this will lead to considerable efficiency
    gains which are necessary in order to ensure that cash remains affordable
    the transition which will take place in 2015 is having considerable consequences
    for cashintransit companies which have traditionally handled these activities
    for the banks

    the changes taking place in the cash distribution and processing market also
    place demands on dnbs supervision the concentration of the banknote
    handling activities of the major banks at gsn has caused cashintransit
    companies to focus more on providing services to retailers those services enable
    retailers to pay their cash takings into their bank account without having to use
    the cash deposit facilities offered by their own bank as a result a nonbank
    intermediary may temporarily become the owner of this cash in view of the
    associated risks such intermediaries must be placed under prudential supervision
    of dnb as payment service providers another aspect is cash supervision
    which has been a dnb task for some years the main object of this supervision
    is to ensure that atms are stocked with genuine banknotes although losses
    due to counterfeit cash in the netherlands are relatively limited see table 31
    combating this phenomenon remains important as evidenced by the increased
    number of counterfeit notes intercepted in 2013

    table 31 counterfeit euro notes intercepted in the netherlands

35 what if goodquality collateral becomes scarcer
    several financial institutions are anticipating a shortage of specific collateral
    assets in the coming years while there are no fears of a complete shortage
    this expectation of collateral shortfalls is apparent from discussions with
    dutchbased financial institutions which are taking steps to minimise the risk
    these market reactions offer advantages but could also create financial stability
    risks such as increasing interdependence procyclicality and asset encumbrance

    use of collateral is one of the most important techniques in mitigating counter
    party risk it is used primarily in the money market derivatives markets payment
    and settlement systems and credit operations with central banks demand for
    highquality collateral is increasing since the financial crisis market participants
    have been less willing to provide unsecured finance and new regulations have




    84 dnb  annual report 2013

payment and settlement system challenges and opportunities




been introduced such as the liquidity standards set by basel iii the new
european regulation of otc derivatives emir and internationally agreed
collateral requirements for bilateral otc derivatives although the demand for
highquality collateral in the euro area is rising faster than the supply
an absolute shortage is unlikely still individual financial institutions may face
a shortage of specific collateral assets the new otc derivatives regulation means
that pension funds and insurers will have to meet their collateral obligations
more often in the form of cash or highgrade liquid government paper
potentially leading to a shortfall of such assets banks could also experience
shortages for example if the present liquidity portfolio does not meet the basel iii
standards

financial institutions can reduce their need for collateral by engaging in fewer
highrisk transactions if these transactions do not directly serve a business
objective or help reduce excessive leverage and speculation this will benefit
financial stability however one possible undesirable effect is that institutions
avoid collateralbased transactions that are designed to cover balance sheet risks

financial institutions are also taking steps to professionalise collateral management
by improving their information systems and optimising the use of assets already
in their possession that process of collateral optimisation is complex and
increases the internal interdependencies within financial institutions  all the
more so if they are institutions that hold collateral in several countries or use
external service providers recovery and resolution plans must be in place to
address these internal interdependencies

another possible market reaction is to create new collateral assets by securitising
loan portfolios eg mortgage books this leaves balance sheet assets such as
highgrade government paper available for other purposes one risk of increased
securitisation is that the assets on a banks balance sheet become increasingly
encumbered in the event of the banks failure few funds will be left over for
unsecured depositors and the deposit guarantee scheme

a number of financial institutions are also considering collateral transformation
borrowing highquality assets using lowerquality assets as collateral an institution
that is itself active in the repo or securities lending market party a in figure 31
can borrow cash from a bank or highgrade government bonds from institutional
investors some service providers including clearing members also offer
collateral transformation services sometimes they deliver the requested assets from
their own books sometimes they obtain them from the market see figure 32
collateral transformation can enable financial institutions with a shortage of
specific collateral assets to borrow those assets from parties that are not currently
using them a key risk is that the financial system may become more inter
dependent more complex and less transparent in addition collateral
requirements are often procyclical stricter in times of market uncertainty
so that parties dependent on collateral transformation are forced to provide
more assets in uncertain times or  in the worst case  find that the transformation

4 from a dutch to a european institution
  celebrating 200 years of dnb

  de nederlandsche bank dnb celebrates its 200th anniversary this year
  founded by king william i in 1814 the bank by virtue of its actions steadily won
  the nations trust and evolved into a genuine national bank for the entire dutch
  people in 1914 dnb warded off a bank run and thus definitively established
  itself as the bank of banks in the netherlands after the second world war
  dnb contributed to the countrys financial stability by acting as a true guardian
  of the guilder  a role it continued to fulfil until the arrival of the electronic euro
  in 1999 followed three years later by the introduction of euro notes and coins
  and now a new landmark is imminent the transition at the end of this year
  from national to european banking supervision

  dnbs first centenary celebration was given added lustre with an april fools hoax
  in a fullpage report newspaper het leven claimed that three french gangsters
  had robbed several bars of gold from dnbs head office in amsterdam having
  gained entry to the building by melting away the bars of a cellar window with an
  acetyleneoxygen flame the police gave chase it said but the gangsters escaped

  four months later the readers of het leven received a real shock once again
  dnb found itself under threat this time however the culprits were not fake
  gangsters but alltooreal panicking customers who had spent the night waiting
  outside dnbs head office on the oude turfmarkt in amsterdam police had to
  be called in to restore order and fainting ladies needed to be revived with eau de
  cologne the run on dnb had been triggered at the end of july 1914 when the
  stock exchange bell on the nearby damrak was sounded calling all conscripts to
  report to their army units the national mobilisation was motivated by fears that
  the germans would advance towards france through the dutch province of
  limburg despite hasty reassurances from the german government that it would
  respect dutch neutrality calm was not immediately restored for days long
  queues of worried citizens waited outside the dnb building

  as banknotes were not always accepted for payments people turned to the dnb
  agencies to exchange their notes for coins the stocks of coins held by dnb and
  its agencies rapidly dwindled and the whole payment system was in danger of
  grinding to a halt dnb president gerard vissering saved the day he proposed
  that the government would temporarily issue vouchers for the silver a week
  after the mobilisation the first silver coupons could already be exchanged for
  banknotes at the same time businesses were crying out for banknotes
  unable to meet the demand dnb decided to issue emergency notes
  these were simple pieces of paper with a simple decorative edge but no
  watermark dnbs governing board also decided to circulate a limited number
  of banknotes that were specifically intended for payments between financial

from a dutch to a european institution celebrating 200 years of dnb




institutions dnbs rapid intervention was a herculean task the transportation
of the banknotes was such a huge operation that the trains could not cope and
for the first time in history cars were used to get the banknotes to their
destination at the same time dnb was asked to take part in a support fund for
stock exchange members who were at risk of running into payment difficulties
representatives of the amsterdam haute finance community came cap in hand
to the oude turfmarkt and dnbs governing board pledged to make 200 million
guilders available for the fund the immediate crisis had been defused
prompting a proud dnb president vissering to write  we had suddenly
become the central institution around which everything was concentrated 


slumbering old lady
due to the outbreak of the first world war dnbs first centenary celebrations
were necessarily sober but it was in those war years that dnb in the words of
president vissering was transformed from a slumbering old lady into a very
lively institution the bank was involved in financing the supply of goods
it assisted the government with grain purchases and acted as one of the initiators
of the netherlands export company num dnb also played an essential role
in a settlement system for amsterdambased banks which would later gain
national significance

one hundred years earlier when dnb was founded by king william i it had
by no means been anticipated that dnb would one day become the countrys
central bank but the bank featured prominently in king williams plans for the
country even before taking the oath on 25 march 1814 king william i had
signed the decision comprising the patent and regulations for de nederlandsche
bank and the name he gave to the new institution also signalled that it was not
intended to serve a specific section of the population but the nation as a whole
in short dnb was to be a national bank in setting up the bank the king was
driven by the obligation resting upon us to revive commerce as the lifeblood of
this state from the slump brought upon it by earlier times and circumstances

william i was thus responding to the republics degeneration at the end of the
eighteenth century the debtcrippled state had seen societys belief in its ability
to repay its financial obligations fade away as a result the state also suffered
a loss of authority and could no longer muster the resources to maintain the
dutch merchant trading network towards the end of the eighteenth century
this led to the birth of the heavily frenchinfluenced batavian republic
which was succeeded at the start of the nineteenth century by the kingdom of
holland under louis napoleon bonaparte a full annexation by france
followed in 1810 but this soon came to an end in 1814 when his brother
napoleon bonaparte was forced to renounce the french throne


merchant king
the future rested in the hands of king william i who launched an
industrialisation policy in a bid to break through the obsolete trading structure
 of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries his efforts were only partly
 successful but the dedication and perseverance he brought to the task earned
 him the honorary nickname of merchant king the foundation of dnb was an
 expression of his entrepreneurial drive uniquely dnb acted both as a credit
 institution and as a circulation bank ie a bank authorised by the government
 to issue banknotes

this was the key distinction between dnb and the amsterdam exchange bank
amsterdamse wisselbank which was set up in 1609 by the city of amsterdam
to end the chaos in the payment system caused by the use of hundreds of
different officially recognised coins merchants could entrust their gold
and silver pieces to the new exchange bank in return for a credit or deposit
in the banks books in exchange they received a handwritten receipt a bill of
exchange with which they could also pay their creditors in addition the
exchange bank provided giro payment services enabling the rich to make
money transfers to third parties and it started extending loans to the dutch east
indies company the states of holland and the city of amsterdam after its
initial success as one of the engines that propelled amsterdam to preeminence as
the worlds economic and financial capital during the golden age the exchange
bank gradually lost momentum and faltered unlike similar institutions
elsewhere such as the riksbank founded in sweden in 1668 it never developed
into a circulation bank meanwhile the republic sank into economic decline
and the oncedynamic city of amsterdam languished in stagnation in 1820 the
exchange bank closed its doors six years after the inception of dnb the new
bank was not granted a monopoly on the issuance of banknotes but it was
protected against competitors thanks to an exemption from stamp duty on its
banknotes furthermore copying dnb notes was made a criminal offence

still dnb got off to a rather difficult start in the first decades after its inception
its economic influence and geographical reach were limited and largely confined
to amsterdam nevertheless its first financial year was fairly successful in 1815
dnb paid out a dividend of 58 however the issuance of five thousand shares
initially met with a lukewarm response and attracted few subscribers among
amsterdams haute financiers the bulk of the share capital five million guilders
was contributed by the king and the state in 1816 barely twothirds of the five
thousand bank shares issued had been sold bankers widow and businesswoman
johanna borski 17641846 came to the rescue in 1816 by agreeing to buy the last
1892 shares at a price of 101 on the condition that dnbs authorised capital
would not be allowed to increase during the first three years the scarce shares
shot up in value not least thanks to the high dividend over 10 in 1819
enabling johanna borski to sell her shares at a huge profit

in the second half of the nineteenth century dnb finally became the national
bank that william i had envisaged from the outset the catalyst was the newly
flourishing economy which boosted demand for credit dnb occupied a strong
position as a lender as it held large stocks of precious metal as a result it was
able to meet the accelerating demand for credit which was much more difficult
for the banking houses

a pivotal figure in dnbs rise to prominence was william c mees a bankers
son from rotterdam who started at the bank as company secretary in 1849 and
then served as its president from 1863 to 1884 mees had outspoken views about
dnbs role which he thought should focus first and foremost on serving the
public interest as part of this effort he also sought to make the institution
more transparent through the publication of monthly figures on the circulation
of banknotes the current account and precious metal holdings dnbs lending
powers were also expanded because as mees explained it was necessary to set
the banks credit to work much more boldly than before

from a dutch to a european institution celebrating 200 years of dnb



paternal supervision
the bank act bankwet of 1863 provided dnb with national status and it was
given the task of opening agencies throughout the country at least one agency
was established in each province while the economically powerful city of
rotterdam was given a branch bank that was authorised to perform the same
services as the head office in amsterdam in addition correspondent agencies
were set up in smaller regional centres which operated on a commission basis
in satisfying the regional demand for credit and money the extensive branch
network was instrumental in galvanising economic growth prompting some
historians to speak of an industrial revolution with a dutch signature

the economic resurgence also stimulated the advent of private banks at the end
of the nineteenth century dnbs traditional customers including businesses
switched over to these private banks to benefit from their broader range of
services these in turn came to dnb to rediscount their customers paper and
to take out loans using their securities as collateral this enabled the private
banks to substantially expand their lending operations dnb gradually saw its
role shift from a lender to businesses to a lender to banks a process that was
completed in the twentieth century

a crucial side effect of this new role was that dnb required insight into the
creditworthiness of its bank customers they were required to submit information
on the ratio between lending and capital as well as to provide reports in the form
of monthly statements this was the prelude to dnbs future role as supervisor
however pending the formal acceptance and legal confirmation of its
supervisory status the arrangements were initially confined to an informal type
of paternal supervision


bank run
dnb gained in national stature in 1914 when it managed to avert a bank run at
the outbreak of the first world war in the 1920s it became clear that a number
of banks had lent too much against insufficient collateral some went bankrupt
others needed to be restructured in some cases dnb acted as lender of last
resort or forced the banks to undergo radical reorganisations the aim was to
prevent a domino effect of collapsing banks leading to a fullblown financial
crisis the successful containment of the looming crisis further strengthened
dnbs status as a national bank during the interwar period

the bank act of 1948 assigned even greater powers and responsibilities to dnb
which was officially proclaimed guardian of the guilder pursuant to section 91
of the act its task was to  regulate the value of the dutch currency in the
manner that best serves the countrys welfare and prosperity while keeping that
value as stable as possible  as the only bank authorised to issue banknotes
dnb had effectively fulfilled this role since its incorporation in 1814
however until the middle of the nineteenth century this role was less visible as
coins still accounted for the lions share of monetary transactions in the
netherlands when it became clear that dnb held sufficient liquidity in coins
and coinage metals the public started to place more trust in the banknotes
issued by the bank consequently the share of banknotes in the total money
supply grew steadily after 1850 dnbs monetary policy evolved as a result
following the introduction of the silver standard 18471875 and the gold
standard 18741914 and 19251936 the metallic money system came to an end
in 1936 banknotes were no longer exchangeable for gold and the acceptance
of paper money became a question of trust like many other countries


92 dnb  annual report 2013

from a dutch to a european institution celebrating 200 years of dnb




the netherlands opted to influence the economy by more closely coordinating
its monetary and socioeconomic policies this was the chief underlying reason
for nationalising dnb in 1948 and entrusting it with an exclusively public task
aimed at promoting welfare and prosperity in a broad sense


power to overrule
the nationalisation had profound consequences also for dnbs relationship with
the government as a measure of last resort the government was empowered to
overrule the bank and issue an instruction  for the coordination of the
governments monetary and financial policy and the banks policy 
the power to overrule as laid down in section 26 of the bank act was an
ultimate remedy in the eyes of its initiator finance minister pieter lieftinck
the intention was that the implications of using it would be so daunting that
both the minister and the central bank president would do everything in their
power to ensure it was never activated  and this is how it remained until the
introduction of the new bank act of 1998

central bank president marius holtrop in 1964 expressed the relationship
between the dutch state and dnb as follows the ship of state has only one
captain being the government but the legislator has  prescribed that in the
choppy waters of monetary policy the ship of state must use the services of
a marine pilot that pilot is de nederlandsche bank an experienced captain
trusts his pilot but as every sailor knows the captain always remains
responsible even when the pilot is navigating the ship

the records show that the closest the government ever came to overruling the
bank was in 1975 when central bank president jelle zijlstra flatly refused to use
direct monetary instruments to finance spiralling public expenditure
prime minister joop den uyl commissioned a study into the conditions under
which he could overrule dnb in the end the government backed down because
of the tremendous authority that zijlstra enjoyed in the netherlands as a former
finance minister and former prime minister his successor wim duisenberg
was also aware of his powerful position commenting in an interview on his
relationship with prime minister ruud lubbers he observed lubbers is the
prime minister but i am the president  a tongueincheek remark perhaps
but it conveys the delicate balance of power and division of roles between the
government and the central bank at the time


act on the supervision of the credit system
under the bank act of 1948 dnb was also responsible for circulating banknotes
facilitating funds transfers and promoting crossborder payments a further task
consisted of the supervision of credit institutions initially an unofficial task
this latter role was formally laid down in the act on the supervision of the
credit system wet toezicht kredietwezen  wtk in 1952 at first a distinction
was made in the supervision between socioeconomic and microprudential
supervision

socioeconomic supervision gave dnb extensive powers to intervene at private
banks among other things these banks were not permitted to extend unlimited
credit to consumers and dnb was authorised to intervene whenever their actions
posed a threat to the stability of the currency microprudential supervision was
aimed at ensuring that banks conducted their business in a careful and
responsible manner and avoided taking unacceptable business risks even today


93 dnb  annual report 2013

from a dutch to a european institution celebrating 200 years of dnb




banks are only permitted to merge with or take a stake in other banks or insurers
after dnb has issued a declaration of no objection

until well into the 1990s microprudential supervision in the netherlands was
sectororiented dnb oversaw banks investment firms and foreign exchange
offices while the securities board of the netherlands stichting toezicht
effectenverkeer  ste which was set up in 1992 supervised listed investment
firms and listed companies the pension and insurance supervisory authority
pensioen en verzekeringskamer  pvk concentrated on pension funds and
insurers at the same time the legislator and supervisors were beginning to
recognise that the financial world was becoming increasingly intertwined
due to an ongoing process of both national and international mergers between
institutions products too were becoming more complex as a result supervisors
sometimes encroached on each others territory which confused supervised
institutions to address this problem the council of financial supervisors
raad van financiële toezichthouders was set up in 1999 to discuss crosssector
supervisory issues


merger between dnb and pvk
just three years later it was agreed that a new supervisory approach was needed
dnb and the pvk were entrusted with prudential supervision which monitors
the health of financial institutions the ste in turn became the netherlands
authority for the financial markets autoriteit financiële markten  afm
and was made responsible for the supervision of business conduct at financial
institutions the afm also kept an eye on how institutions communicate with
customers and was given the ultimate responsibility for granting licenses to
investment firms a further step was taken in 2004 when the prudential
supervisors dnb and pvk merged in accordance with a new single act
the financial supervision act wet op het financieel toezicht  wft

despite the improvements made by means of the integration of the dutch
supervisory system the collapse of the us merchant bank lehman brothers in
september 2008 made it painfully clear that both supervision and legislation
had failed to keep pace with global economic developments in the 1980s
the englishspeaking world had embarked on a process of liberalisation and
deregulation and many countries around the world had followed suit
this process had spurred the globalisation of markets and companies leading to
unprecedented innovation as well as greater prosperity


stormy weather
due to the intertwining of markets companies and products the credit crisis
took on the character of a fullblown systemic crisis hidden weaknessess in
the supervisory framework came to the fore such as low capital requirements
and the absence of an international liquidity standard in his 2011 book
nout wellink aan het woord former dnb president wellink said
in midseptember lehman brothers collapsed this caused an enormous
shock which reverberated right through the capillaries of the global financial
system abn amro and fortis soon found themselves in trouble and iceland
was also battling the waves of course you can try to pin the blame on any
tom dick or harry at microlevel but there was a common underlying cause
the foundations were a lot more brittle than we had realised 




94 dnb  annual report 2013

from a dutch to a european institution celebrating 200 years of dnb




the profound shock of the credit crisis as well as the ensuing criticism on
microprudential supervision from society at large prompted a period of serious
selfreflection at dnb this resulted in 2010 in the dnb supervisory strategy
20102014 a document setting out the banks conclusions and action points that
were implemented in the following years the general thrust of these action
points was that supervision required a greater emphasis on the suprainstitutional
perspective than before

dnb opted for a more forwardlooking and suprainstitutional perspective
as well as close coordination between macro and microsupervision
more attention is now devoted to the business model and strategy and the
conduct and culture of supervised institutions


europe
meanwhile there is also an unmistakable trend towards more international
consultation regulation and policy coordination the credit crisis led to basel iii
for banks and gave an impulse to the development of solvency ii for insurers
a further step will be taken at the end of 2014 with the transfer of the supervision
of banks from the national supervisors to the ecb the european banking union
is created in response to the lesson learned from the credit crisis that financial
institutions in europe are or can grow so big that they become locked in
a deadly embrace with government budgets this in turn could jeopardise the
financial stability of the entire euro area to prevent this a supervisory board
will be put in place with farreaching powers for the supervision of all 4000
banks in europe a health check consisting of a comprehensive balance sheet
assessment will be performed on the 130odd most significant banks in europe
at the same time a european resolution mechanism a european resolution
fund and a european deposit guarantee scheme will be put in place

the advent of european banking supervision in the form of a supervisory
board formally controlled by the governing council of the ecb reflects the
fact that supervision financial stability and monetary policy are steadily growing
towards europewide consultation and decisionmaking interestingly the trend
towards paneuropean monetary policy already started in the wake of the
second world war the first step was taken at national level with the bank act
of 1948 which designated dnb as the guardian of the guilder this was soon
followed in the early 1950s by initiatives to foster political cooperation at
european level starting with the foundation of the european coal and steel
community ecsc and the european economic community eec
culminating  in 1992  in a common internal market with free movement of
people goods services and capital parallel to this development the idea for
a monetary union arose in the 1960s the first step was the snake arrangement
where the eec countries sought to keep their currencies stable versus one
another this initiative foundered on the contrasting economic and monetary
interests of germany and the netherlands on the one hand and france and italy
on the other in 1979 the snake arrangement gave birth to the frenchgerman
idea for a european monetary system ems ten years later in 1989 jacques
delors the then president of the european commission presented a followup
proposal the economic and monetary union emu and the introduction of
a single european currency the euro in 1992 this plan was formally endorsed
by the maastricht treaty

in 1999 the longawaited moment arrived when several european union member
states decided to set up an economic monetary union that year the euro was


95 dnb  annual report 2013

from a dutch to a european institution celebrating 200 years of dnb




introduced albeit only in electronic form and the national currencies were
pegged to the euro the netherlands whose exports and prosperity depend
strongly on european trade wholeheartedly backed the move however
the countrys participation necessitated a new bank act which came into force
in 1998 this stipulated that dnb would form part of the european system of
central banks escb among other things this meant that the government
would lose its right to overrule but instead would have the right to demand
 data or information which in its opinion was necessary to determine the
financial and economic policies of the government since 1 january 1999
monetary policy has been determined by the governing council of the ecb in
frankfurt its first president was dutchman wim duisenberg


crowning achievement
the full governing council includes the presidents of the national central banks
of all member states acting jointly but in a personal capacity dnb president
klaas knot his fellow central bank presidents and the members of the ecb
executive board map out the course of european monetary policy which the
national central banks then implement between 1999 and 1 january 2002
there was a currency union with a common noncash euro but there was still no
tangible common currency on 1 january 2002 the first euro notes and coins
reached the purses of the european citizens

the single currency is the crowning achievement of a multidecade historic effort
which strove to establish the free movement of goods capital and labour in
order to promote peace and security the guilder which boasts a history of
almost 450 years with dnb as its guardian for nearly two centuries had to make
way for this broadlyendorsed historical objective this year a new pillar is being
added in addition to monetary policy the supervision of banks which has been
dnbs statutory task since 1952 will be lifted to european level two hundred
years after it was founded in 1814 the amsterdambased institution that first
evolved into a national bank has now become a fullyfledged member of a truly
paneuropean institution

    in this chapter de nederlandsche bank dnb reports on the main results
    achieved in 2013 the ways in which the macroprudential mandate and
    instruments are embedded in the organisation along with the monetary response
    to the reduction in market tensions are discussed in section 52 the main
    developments and results of the core task of supervision are summarised in the
    separate independent public body zbo report section 53 examines how
    dnb incorporates corporate social responsibility csr into its activities while
    section 54 explains why costs came out lower in 2013 than budgeted section 55
    describes the organisations corporate governance and explains how dnb seeks
    to limit risks while it also provides an overview of the key risks identified to
    date section 56 contains information on dnbs investments and financial risks
    and explains how monetary exposure fell considerably in 2013 as a result of a
    reduction in monetary policy credit operations section 57 describes the activities
    undertaken by dnb to communicate financial knowledge to the dutch public and
    the technical assistance it offers to fellow central banks and supervisors in other
    countries lastly section 58 discusses dnbs efforts to continue improving its
    operations these include endeavours to further improve organisational efficiency
    by increasing the opportunities to work independently of place time and device

    dnbs governing board presented a new longterm strategy polaris to the
    organisation in 2012 the polaris strategy consists of a renewed mission
    ten longterm ambitions and a strategic framework the ambitions are as follows

    1	dnb is an influential bank in the european system of central banks escb
    2 dnb is a leading institution in the area of financial stability
    3 dnb stands for efficient and robust payment and securities chains
    4 dnbs supervision sets a benchmark and is authoritative
    5	dnb influences financial and economic policy in its preferred direction
    6	dnb makes full use of the synergy stemming from its combined role of
        central bank and supervisor
    7 dnb hires only the best people for all positions
    8	dnb has a modern information system and produces useful statistics for
        internal and external users
    9	dnb helps build trust in the financial system through consistent
        communication
    10 dnb has an effective governance model

    sustainability plays an important role in dnbs performance of its tasks
    as outlined in section 53 and reflected in the organisations mission dnb seeks
    to safeguard financial stability and thus contributes to sustainable prosperity in
    the netherlands this refers to longterm sustainable prosperity based on

    sustainable economic social and environmental factors restoring trust and
    confidence in the financial sector in the euro and in dnb as a central bank and
    supervisor has top priority dnb seeks to perform its core tasks as effectively and
    efficiently as possible and wherever feasible to integrate and embed sustainability
    into its operations and the performance of its tasks sustainability is consequently
    discussed on various occasions in this chapter both with regard to the core tasks
    and to the operations

52 results achieved in dnbs core tasks

    521 financial stability
    dnb is responsible for overseeing financial stability in the netherlands in its
    overview of financial stability ofs dnb sets out the risks to financial
    stability and recommends ways of limiting these risks the issues it highlighted
    in 2013 included the potential impact of sustained low growth on credit quality
    the risk of sudden increases in interest rates and the effect of the deposit
    funding gap on bank funding following on from the risk analysis in the ofs
    operational supervision assesses whether risks at any individual institution
    require mitigating action ie the macromicro link whereby macro risks are
    converted into micro action

    the risk analysis also forms the basis for certain specific examinations such as
    the crosssector thematic examination of interest rate risks that was carried out
    in 2013 in the ofs dnb called on the dutch banks to continue strengthening
    their capital buffers so that they remain on course to meet the basel iii
    requirements in a way that does not excessively restrict their lending operations
    to make adequate provisions and to reduce their reliance on market funding
    the sector made further progress in this respect in 2013 with the result that the
    banking sector recorded a higher tier 1 capital ratio in the third quarter of 2013
    than a year earlier while also reducing its reliance on market funding banks
    have been making increased provisions for propertyrelated loans since their risk
    management practices were assessed in the thematic examination of commercial
    property insurers meanwhile were instructed by dnb to be more cautious in
    their issuing of guaranteed returns in order to incorporate guaranteerelated
    risks and other future risks more effectively into the supervision of the insurance
    sector dnb has urged the ministry of finance to introduce more riskbased and
    forwardlooking elements into its supervisory framework these elements

include an own risk assessment the theoretical solvency criterion tsc and the
requirement for institutions to seek approval for dividend payments if their
solvency position drops below the tsc new legislation that includes these
elements came into force on 1 january 2014 the european crisis and the
discussions of a banking union have highlighted the need for a transparent
harmonised type of bailin mechanism whereby shareholders and creditors also
contribute to the rescue of a bank that is on the verge of collapse as well as the
importance of credible balance sheet assessments these latter assessments have
been started

the financial stability committee met on two occasions in 2013 this committee
which is chaired by dnb president klaas knot also includes representatives of
the netherlands authority for the financial markets afm and the ministry of
finance the committee called on dutch banks to be more transparent about
their risks by applying the recommendations of the enhanced disclosure task
force edtf in their annual reports it also discussed how best to structure the
mortgage lending market so as to achieve greater longterm financial stability
the committee welcomed the policy aimed at gradually reducing loantovalue
ltv ratios and also made recommendations for further standardisation of
mortgage loans in order to make them more attractive to nonbank and foreign
investors

various changes in the bank act bankwet and financial supervision act wet
op het financieel toezicht  wft came into force on 1 january 2014 which
explicitly assign responsibility to dnb for promoting the stability of the financial
system the entry into force of the capital requirements regulation crr and
the implementation of the capital requirements directive iv crd iv mean
that dnb will be able to deploy macroprudential instruments when performing
this task the crd offers various opportunities in this respect including
increasing sectoral risk weightings requiring a countercyclical capital buffer and
imposing higher capital buffers on systemically important banks in 2013
dnb was involved in drawing up legislation to embed these instruments at a
national level and thus allow them to be deployed in practice at an international
level dnb actively contributed to the effective structuring of macroprudential
policy in various forums including the european systemic risk board esrb
in addition dnb chairs the instruments working group which focuses on
operationalising instruments and objectives details of this work were published
in early 2014 prompting the esrb to issue a public recommendation

from a financial stability perspective it is important to ensure effective
intervention is possible if an institution unexpectedly encounters problems and
if necessary to resolve the situation substantial progress was achieved in 2013 in
the recovery and resolution plans for the largest banks as dnb started putting in
place feasible and credible resolution strategies in liaison with the ministry of
finance and the larger dutch banks most efforts to devise resolution legislation
have been made at a european level with dnb supporting the ministry of
finance in this respect and also helping to delineate the position of the european
central bank ecb

the texts of the bank recovery and resolution directive brrd which is the
european bank resolution framework and the deposit guarantee scheme dgs
directive were completed during 2013 and will come into force within the
foreseeable future towards the end of 2013 the member states also agreed on a
single resolution mechanism srm

522 monetary tasks
as a member of the eurosystem dnb contributes to developing and
implementing monetary policy measures aimed at promoting price stability
 which is a precondition for sustainable economic development against the
 background of the european debt crisis unconventional monetary policy
 continued to play a prominent role in 2013 market tensions abated further during
 the year as reflected for example in the early repayments on the longerterm
threeyear refinancing operations ltros this was partly thanks to the ecbs
 outright monetary transactions omt programme which did not need to be
 activated in 2013 either the extension of fixedrate fullallotment refinancing
 operations until at least mid2015 means that banks in the euro area can count
 for the time being on the availability of virtually unlimited liquidity within the
 eurosystem providing they have sufficient collateral still only politicians can
 take the measures needed to secure a sustainable solution to the problems facing
 the currency union such as stricter and more enforceable budgetary rules
 and structural measures to boost the euro areas competitiveness and growth
potential substantial progress was achieved in this respect in 2013 including the
establishment of the banking union see section 14

the euro areas economic development remained extremely modest although
gradual signs of a cautious return to growth emerged in the second half of the
year however inflation dropped below 1 during the year and the ecb
responded by reducing the policy rate in both may and november 2013
in order to provide the markets and the general public with more guidance on
how the ecb governing council views the longerterm inflation outlook and
the interest rate policy to be pursued the ecb explicitly announced in july 2013
that it expected policy rates to stay at their current or a lower level for some
time to come in an environment of very low interest rates many central banks
are using forward guidance as a monetary policy instrument

in addition to its monetary task dnb also plays an advisory role in national
and international policy debates and is therefore represented in various national
and international platforms leveraging these contacts its expertise and its
independent position dnb seeks to provide policy advice that promotes
financial stability and sustainable prosperity through for example a stronger and
more stable economic and monetary union emu dnb also ensures its voice
is heard in national policy debates including the semiannual economic forecasts
dnb has expressed its views on the need to consolidate public finances and also
contributed in response to requests or otherwise to the debate on other current
issues such as the dutch pension system and the countrys housing market
an example of dnbs work in this respect can be seen in its involvement in the
creation of the national mortgage institute

dnb also increasingly plays a role in facilitating policy debate in this context
it has arranged various meetings with national and international experts to
discuss the roles of net and gross capital flows labour market reforms in the
emu and the savings surplus in the dutch corporate sector

the economic crisis has raised fresh questions for economists and highlights the
need to expand the range of policy instruments available to them dnb has a
responsibility to contribute to this academic challenge

consequently dnbs 2013 research programme once again devoted a good deal
of attention to improving existing econometric models and developing new
ones in this context the interaction between the financial sector and the real


106 dnb  annual report 2013

accountability




economy is an important aspect because the existing models have proved not
to accurately reflect reality this study has provided greater insight into the
financial cycle and contributed to an operating framework for macroprudential
policy


523 payments
under the auspices of the dnbchaired national forum on sepa migration
nfs stakeholders are working on the migration of the dutch payment system
to the european standard the single euro payments area sepa dnb is
responsible on behalf of the nfs for ensuring the sepa introduction proceeds
smoothly and efficiently while also enabling the payment system to continue
functioning properly in support of this aim an iban promotion campaign was
launched to make businesses and consumers aware of the changes involved in
migrating to sepa and to help them prepare this campaign won two awards in
2013 for its communications a san accent and a bronze effie substantial
progress was achieved in the sepa migration in 2013 whereas only 4 of credit
transfers and under 1 of direct debits in the netherlands complied with the
european standards at yearend 2012 these figures had risen to 85 and 49
respectively by the end of 2013 this means that the netherlands will not need
to use the grace period to 1 august 2014 that has been granted by the european
parliament and the council wherever necessary however banks will allow
businesses and consumers to continue using the national payment infrastructure
during this grace period

dnb is seeking to enhance the banknote recirculation process in the netherlands
to this end banknotes that are suitable for reuse may now be recirculated by
market players wherever possible in a changing cash environment banknotes are
being recirculated through channels other than the traditional ones ie banks
and cash processors and increasing numbers of retailers use banknotes from
their cash takings to replenish cash machines this is one of the reasons why
forty million fewer banknotes were deposited with dnb in 2013 than in 2012
2013 530 million notes 2012 570 million notes in 2014 dnb will continue its
efforts to have as many banknotes as possible recirculated by market players
it will also conduct a pilot project in which cash processors will exchange
suitable banknotes with each other rather than the current situation where
notes are deposited by one party at dnb which then distributes them to the
other party

the increasing shift from physical to digital payments will also help improve the
efficiency and security of payments and this trend is expected to continue over
the coming years it is important however to continue devoting sufficient
attention to the need to keep payment services accessible for vulnerable groups
such as the elderly and people with a functional impairment without internet
access with a low level of education or who are economically inactive the need
to maintain the accessibility of the payment system is one of the core tasks
assigned to the national forum on the payment system mob which is
chaired by dnb and which sets out to promote the efficiency of the dutch
payment system during 2013 mob published its third accessibility monitor
in which it confirmed that the availability and accessibility of basic banking
services remained good some very practical issues such as the legibility of the
new paper transfer forms and the position of telephone banking in the sepa era
were resolved to the full satisfaction of the various groups represented on mob

accountability




as more and more people are doing their banking over the internet it is
important to ensure that online banking systems and mobile banking apps are
sufficiently accessible and this is an area where there is still room for
improvement the mob working group on availability and accessibility
organised a thematic meeting in 2013 to improve banks awareness of this issue
and is monitoring developments in this field

mob is also discussing the robustness of the payment system against the
background of the ddos distributed denial of service attacks on banks
which resulted in the temporary unavailability of online payment services in
april 2013 its analysis of how the payment system can be made more resilient
found that although the system as a whole is well protected there are a number
of individual aspects that can be improved these are currently being worked
on and the measures taken will be assessed during 2014

another important aspect with regard to the robustness of the payment system
is banknotes vulnerability to theft intelligent banknote neutralisation systems
ibns are used to reduce this vulnerability as far as possible these systems use
ink firesmoke and bonding technologies to make banknotes unfit for use in the
event of attempted theft the most common application of these technologies is
in dyepacks and atm cassettes within the netherlands bankers association
nvb an expert pool comprising representatives of both dnb and the large
banks is investigating the opportunities for using ibns to prevent ram raids




 box 1 security versus accessibility
 dnb regards the security of the payment system as essential it is also
 important that the payment system remains accessible for everyone
 including the vulnerable groups in society the challenge here is to find an
 appropriate balance between security and accessibility greater security
 for example often results in reduced user convenience and higher costs
 banks aim to secure their payment systems in a way that has least impact on
 these systems accessibility and in doing so make use of various innovative
 solutions

 substantial amounts have been invested in recent years in detection systems
 that can distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones without
 making any concessions in terms of accessibility these investments have
 started to bear fruit data published by the nvb show a reduction in the
 number of fraud cases

 the introduction of mobile banking is an example of an innovative
 technology that increases accessibility while also incorporating various
 measures to improve security it allows users to do their banking via an
 application app on their mobile phones using a secret code this means
 they can see the balance on their account and execute transactions anywhere
 and at any time its simple interface makes mobile banking highly accessible
 users can also activate a voiceover that reads out menu options in order to
 make mobile banking secure transaction limits are set and the security is
 linked to recently used account numbers neither measure obstructs users
 wishing to perform the most common transactions but both reduce the risk
 of criminals committing fraud

524 supervision
a healthy strong and sound financial sector is able to absorb shocks and
anticipate changing circumstances adaptability is a vital element of a robust
financial sector and a shockresilient financial system the ability of the dutch
financial sector to adapt remained under pressure throughout 2013 the need to
adapt stemmed not only from the continued lack of strong economic recovery
but from the implementation of laws and regulations which also demanded
considerable efforts from financial institutions the financial sector also has to
contend with the new social reality in which restoring societys trust in the sector
is proving to be a lengthy process this issue was reinforced by the nationalisation
of sns reaal and the manipulation of libor

the supervisory focus in 2013 was primarily on restoring buffers and balance
sheets on managing financial and economic and integrity risks on preparations
for banking supervision at a european level and on implementing supervisory
requirements as well as requirements driven by legislation and regulations
however explicit attention was also devoted during the year to the quality of
governance and the viability of business models

the aspect of international supervisory policy introduced in 2013 that will have
most impact was undoubtedly the european parliaments adoption of the
regulation establishing the single supervisory mechanism ssm under the
ssm the ecb will be responsible from 4 november 2014 for supervising over
3000 banks consolidated figure in the euro area the ssm regulation also
entrusts the ecb with responsibility for direct supervision of the 124 significant
banks direct supervision of less significant banks on a daytoday basis will still
be carried out by the relevant national competent authorities ncas but the
ecb can give direction and if necessary take charge dnb was closely involved
over the past year in preparing for the ssm and european banking supervision
this included involvement in a detailed charting of the european banking
landscape drafting a legal basis for the ssm large data requests for the ecb and
preparing an asset quality review aqr

the reporting year was also dominated by the implementation of the various
supervisory requirements and the requirements resulting from legislation and
regulations the focus for banks was very much on the global basel iii agreement
and its transposition into european legislation through the crd ivcrr rules
the requirements imposed by basel iii include significantly stricter capital and
liquidity buffers considerable time was spent during the past year on examining
how the basel iii migration plans can be used as the basis for providing guidance
to ensure banks comply promptly with the new rules insurance companies also
made significant progress during the year on preparing for the introduction of
solvency ii on 1 january 2016 the transition to solvency ii represents a
fundamental advance on the current framework because for example
it introduces riskbased capital requirements in liaison with dnb the ministry
of finance decided in 2013 to make the dutch supervisory framework for insurers
more riskoriented and more forwardlooking from an earlier date these new
rules came into force on 1 january 2014 and will further improve dnbs ability
to effectively supervise the sector during the year the pension sector also took
major steps towards establishing a more sustainable pension system
these included the pension fund governance further measures act
wet versterking bestuur pensioenfondsen  wvbp which took effect during
the year and a detailed review of the financial assessment framework for
pension funds dnb was intensively involved in advising the ministry of social
affairs and employment on both these developments during the year

in addition the consequences of the nationalisation of sns reaal were
monitored as part of dnbs operational supervision in early 2013 dnb and the
ministry of finance had been forced to conclude that no publicprivate solution
was available that would satisfactorily reinforce sns reaals capital position
dnb consequently advised the minister of finance to use the opportunities
offered by the intervention act interventiewet to secure the vital functions of
sns reaal and the interests of savers and policyholders in doing so it explicitly
took account of the interaction between macroeconomic aspects financial
stability and the supervisory measures to be taken in respect of sns reaal
since the nationalisation dnb has remained closely involved in developments
relating to sns reaal including the restructuring plan required by the european
commission dnb was appreciative of the report that was published by
the ens committee on 23 january 2014 this committee was set up to assess the
nationalisation of sns reaal and one of its main conclusions was that the
nationalisation was unavoidable dnb has taken due note of the committees
recommendations and will consider the recommendations for dnbs governance
structure in the discussions to be held on changes in the division of banking
supervision responsibilities following the establishment of the european banking
union consideration will also be given in that respect as to how best to structure
and further reinforce the link between macro and microprudential supervision

operational supervision in 2013 also targeted the investigation into rabobanks
possible involvement in irregularities relating to the libor and euribor
submission process this investigation started in january 2012 and dnb
identified a serious breach of the rules for sound and ethical business operations
during the period studied in response to this breach rabobank introduced
a series of measures in liaison with dnb in order to reinforce its business
operations alongside various change programmes relating to culture conduct
and compliance action was taken to reinforce rabobanks risk management

lastly during the year dnb actively sought to identify opportunities to make
the effects of its supervision more visible by clearly accounting to society for
its supervision dnb can promote trust and confidence in the dutch financial
sector this means placing greater emphasis on impact measurement in 2012
dnb defined four ambitions for its supervision of the financial sector with a set
of key performance indicators kpi for each ambition the first measurements
of these kpis in 2012 led to various changes in 2013 to tighten up the measuring
and reporting process the results are set out in the 2013 zbo report
external stakeholders were also consulted and reported that dnbs supervision
had become more indepth and tenacious this is important for dnb to know
as it is one of the objectives of the projected change of organisational culture
at the same time however the financial sector is exceptionally dynamic
which means that dnb will continually have to adapt its supervision in
response to relevant developments this is reflected in dnbs new supervisory
strategy 20142018 in which dnb sets out its ambitions for the financial sector
and various new focal points for its supervision this new supervisory strategy
builds on the route mapped out in the previous supervisory strategy in 2010
more information on the results governance risk management efficiency and
legitimacy of supervision in 2013 can be found in the 2013 zbo report

sustainability in supervision
as far as dnbs supervision is concerned sustainability includes taking account
of stakeholders interests in decisionmaking as well as maintaining transparent
policy and conduct and a longterm perspective corporate social responsibility
csr is incorporated into supervision in the way dnb assesses how institutions

accountability




comply with their nonfinancial requirements specifically what is required of
them in terms of integrity strategy business models governance conduct and
culture

sustainability is also a factor in the assessment of whether financial institutions
policymakers are fit for appointment in other words whether they are able to
independently assess the interests of all stakeholders within their governance
responsibilities the integrity of institutions and their employees must be beyond
reproach if society is to have trust and confidence in the financial sector
dnbs integrity supervision in 2013 focused on examining whether financial
institutions proactively sought to prevent corruption and the facilitating of
corruption explicit attention was also devoted to identifying any involvement
of supervised institutions in money laundering and the financing of terrorism
see section 22 of the 2013 zbo report

taking stakeholders interests into account means institutions must be transparent
about their governance strategy objectives policy and results by explaining
and being accountable institutions enable stakeholders to verify how their
interests are taken into account and to respond accordingly the longterm
perspective is reflected in dnbs supervision of institutions business models
and strategies their remuneration policies and their conduct and culture
this supervision of business models and strategy involves focusing specifically
on institutions longterm sustainability their remuneration policies must be in
line with their strategy and longterm results and should not encourage
excessively highrisk behaviour as this may jeopardise the sustainability of the
institutions results and its continued existence in various ways lastly
dnbs supervision of conduct and culture seeks to encourage policymakers to
reflect on their own performance and on how their decisions take account of
the longterm outlook for the business and stakeholders interests in 2013
following on from its earlier investigations of conduct and culture at banks
insurers and pension funds dnb investigated five institutions at which it had
previously identified highrisk conduct these investigations found that the
institutions in question had taken due account of the aspects previously
identified and were following up appropriately during 2013 dnb also conducted
new investigations of the interaction between conduct organisational culture
and integrity at various institutions including trust offices its findings resulted
in the issuance of a series of general sectorwide recommendations for supervised
institutions as well as the creation of a selfassessment model for institutions
see section 22 of the 2013 zbo report


525 statistics
the statistics function supports dnb and the escb in performing their primary
tasks fast highquality and easily accessible information is consequently
becoming increasingly important both in respect of supervisory data and the
data dnb collects in support of its monetary and financial stability policies
these activities were expanded in 2013 to include the preparatory work needed
to ensure compliance with the ssm which assigns a central role to the escbs
statistics function the reporting frameworks for banks were also changed to
comply with the new european supervisory requirements crd iv from the
start of 2014 substantial progress was made during the year in overhauling
dnbs statistics systems and particularly in providing supervisors with improved
access to data on banks pension funds and insurers the escb also revised its
statistics regulations to accommodate the data requirements arising from the
new macroeconomic manuals of the imf bpm6 and the un sna2008

    accountability




    as well as those of users in the fields of financial stability and payments
    preference must increasingly be given to a more intricate system of data
    collection in order to ensure a flexible response to rapidly changing demands
    for information in the future such a system may include the individual loan
    data that are often available elsewhere in centralised credit registration systems
    another aim of the statistics function is to ensure that market parties and the
    general public receive information promptly therefore during the year dnb
    published new tables on securities ownership as part of its efforts to comply
    with all sdds plus requirements a new imf statistics standard for countries
    with systemically important financial sectors it also improved the accessibility
    of its statistics by for example adding interactive graphs a strategic european
    statistical forum in which the netherlands is represented by statistics
    netherlands cbs and dnb has been set up in order to continue meeting
    the increasing european requirements for statistics


53 corporate social responsibility
    dnb used the output of its stakeholder dialogue on corporate social
    responsibility csr as input for further tightening of its policy and for
     determining its priorities in this area dnbs csr policy consists of five themed
     areas csr in core tasks the environment sustainable procurement social policy
     and social commitment each of these areas includes a number of topics
     or spearheads for which annual and mediumterm objectives are set
    the extent to which these objectives have been achieved is reported annually
    more information on the csr policy and how it is accounted for in this report
     can be found in the csr annex on dnbs website


    531 stakeholder dialogue
    dnb seeks to ensure its stakeholders are closely involved in the performance of
    its primary tasks to this end it periodically holds an open and structured
    stakeholder dialogue with parties such as supervised institutions the ministry
    of finance the ministry of social affairs and employment and the afm
    its fellow supervisor for more information see the csr annex in the 2013
    annual report this dialogue covers both policy and the use of resources

    between october and december 2013 dnb conducted a stakeholder dialogue
    in the form of a questionnaire a feedback session and a series of interviews
    specifically focused on its csr policy the interviews concentrated on dnbs
    csr policy and how this is accounted for in the annual report the materiality
    analysis see figure 51 reflects the outcome of this dialogue dnbs stakeholders
    are the people and organisations that work with dnb or that attach importance
    to the work role and influence of dnb as a public institution with a social task
    its stakeholder dialogue includes representatives and policymakers from stake
    holder groups such as supervised institutions the government the netherlands
    court of audit stateowned entities ngos such as eerlijke bankwijzer
    the global reporting initiative gri and the oecd the common element in
    the results of the dialogue is the stakeholders wish that sustainability becomes an
    integral and operational part of dnbs various core tasks dnb will conse
    quently examine whether esg environmental social and governance risks
    can be added to the risks that are included in dnbs supervision while also
    being aware of the need to take account of the european banking supervision
    frameworks and the demands that these will impose on capacity according to
    its stakeholders dnb should in any event ensure a clearer profile for csr
    within its core tasks as dnb is a public institution with a social task

     sustainability is already embedded to a considerable degree in its core tasks
     this is where dnbs true added value for society is to be found rather than in
       albeit also important  operationallyrelated activities such as efforts to reduce
      the organisations carbon footprint and its policy on contributions and donations
      dnb has consequently set itself the objective of incorporating sustainability
      more effectively into its accounting for the performance of its core tasks this is
      why the previously separate sections on accountability and corporate social
      responsibility have been integrated into a single section accountability

54 development of costs
     the costs attributed to dnbs core tasks in 2013 amounted to eur 3472 million
     see table 52 with the exception of the costs for monetary stability and
     economic advice the costs of performing the core tasks were higher in 2013 than
     in 2012 the sharpest cost increases occurred in the supervision and payment
     operations the increase in the costs of supervision in 2013 was largely
     attributable to the expansion in capacity required as a result of the new
      supervisory model focus and the new supervisory category of investment
      institutions alternative investment fund managers  aifm the increase in the
      case of payment operations was the result of higher costs for banknotes and certain
      nonrecurring costs relating to sepa preparations see dnb budget for 2013

     explanation of variance between actual and budget for 2013
     total costs came out eur 164 million below budget with much of this

eur 26 million other material differences in each core task are discussed
below

the budget overspend of eur 3 million on financial stability was attributable to
higher ict spending relating to preparations for the deposit guarantee scheme

over half eur 16 million of the eur 28 million underspend on monetary
stability and economic advice was attributable to developments affecting dnb
as a whole in addition a number of policy departments decided in 2013 not to
fill all their vacancies in anticipation of the efficiency objectives set for 2014

in addition to developments affecting dnb as a whole eur 16 million the total
underspend of eur 30 million for payment operations was largely attributable
to the decision to defer a project to improve the provision of information in the
cash business from 2013 to 2014 as a result of reprioritisation within dnb this
accounted for around eur 10 million of the underspend

the costs of the core task of supervision came out eur 91 million lower than
budgeted with eur 77 million attributed to lower staff costs these costs are
largely determined by the deployment of examining officers ie ftes in direct
supervision a capacity increase of around 10 had been budgeted for 2013 in
view of developments such as the new supervisory model focus as this increase
was phased in over the course of 2013 average staffing levels for the year as a
whole were around 29 ftes lower than budgeted which explains the underspend
in the supervision divisions this underspend was expected and announced in
the 2012 zbo report by the end of 2013 more or less all the staff vacancies had
been filled and the planned capacity increase achieved some of the underspend
on staff costs was also due to the positive factors referred to above and affecting
dnb as a whole the separate zbo report provides a detailed overview of the
development of costs within the core task of supervision see wwwdnbnl

the costs associated with the financial expertise centre fec were
eur 03 million below budget largely because of savings on staff costs

   spending on the core task of statistics was eur 16 million lower than budgeted
   in addition to savings in the area of salary developments this underspend
   largely related to lower staff costs and lowerthananticipated depreciation and
   amortisation

   efficiency and legitimacy
   dnb strives to ensure its spending is completely legitimate consequently
   its planning and control pc cycle includes a specific link between the
   objectives of dnb and the related costs incurred dnb has instructed the
   external auditor to assess the efficient and legitimate use of financial resources
   and to give an account of this in the auditors report which is included in the
   report on the role of dnb as an independent public body this also ensures
   compliance with dnbs obligations under the financial supervision act and
   the pension act pensioenwet the indicator used to measure dnbs efficiency
   is the extent to which its pc cycle operates properly

   the internal standard is a legitimacy rate of 99 the percentage achieved in
   2013 was 994 2012 and 2011 992 and 994 respectively

   bank dnb forms part of the european system of central banks escb
   dnb president klaas knot is a member of the governing council and the
   general council of the european central bank as a supervisor dnb has the
   status of an independent public body zelfstandig bestuursorgaan  zbo

552 risk management
in 2013 the governing board adopted a risk management framework and an
integrated risk management policy this risk management framework creates a
framework for a joint approach to risk management within dnb by bringing all
the risk management activities together within this framework and viewing these
activities and the identified risks as an integrated whole the risks to which dnb
is exposed can demonstrably be managed more effectively the risk management
and control systems are reviewed periodically dnb seeks to comply with the
applicable laws and regulations governing supervised institutions and to
implement progressive insights this basic principle has resulted in the
establishment of a more cohesive effective and integrated risk management
system within the dnb organisation one of the principles here is that risks
should be addressed in a consistent manner but that risk management can be
applied in a differentiated way across the various parts of the organisation

the governing board and divisional directors receive a quarterly management
report on the status of and developments in the key risks facing dnb in general
and those facing individual divisions in particular the governance structure of
dnbs risk management is based on the three lines of defence model
these three lines of defence  line management supporting risk management
and control functions and the internal audit function  operate independently
of each other with each contributing to the quality of the risk management and
control system the governing board is supported in this by bodies such as the
risk management committee rmc which advises the governing board on
asset and liability management and associated risks this includes the strategic
investment policy risk framework and buffers the rmc also examines
operational risks within the central bank activities with a specific focus in
20132014 on the legal risk in contracts

management of specific risk types
dnbs integral risk management and control system makes a distinction between
strategic financial and operational risk management its strategic risk management
focuses primarily on managing dnbs strategic ambitions financial risk
management is described in section 56 operational risks comprise various risk
types including information security risks process risks business continuity
risks physical security risks and compliance and integrity risks

the purpose of information security is to assure the confidentiality integrity
and availability of information in a consistent and effective manner in 2013
in addition to the continual monitoring by internal security experts
dnb introduced a coordinated approach to information security this means
that from 2014 onwards information security will be incorporated more
integrally efficiently and effectively into all relevant developments at dnb

risk management focuses on the entire process of identifying analysing
managing and monitoring operational risks with the aim of safeguarding
controlled operations various methods and techniques are available to the
organisation in this respect risk selfassessments rsas at tactical and

operational levels as part of both business operations and individual projects
remain an important element of dnbs operational risk management

the purpose of business continuity management bcm is to coordinate
measures to mitigate material and nonmaterial loss as a result of a potential
or actual crisis jeopardising the continuity of dnbs processes bcm risk
management is at a mature level within dnb the bcm policy was reviewed in
2013 as part of efforts to increase professionalism while also taking account of
the escb requirements and best practices applicable to the netherlands core
financial infrastructure

physical security at dnb focuses on aspects such as the security of individuals
and buildings as well as the safe transportation of people valuables and goods
in 2014 the general intelligence and security service of the netherlands aivd
will conduct an indepth risk analysis on behalf of the national coordinator
for security and counterterrorism nctv to establish whether the various
security measures in place together with the governments response capacity
are still adequate any recommendations resulting from this analysis will be
followed up during the year

the risk management system in the compliance  integrity ci department
focuses mainly on contributing to adequate management of the integrity risks
and on preventing and mitigating losses resulting from actions contrary to
internal and external laws and regulations standards and codes of conduct
in 2013 ci specifically targeted risks relating to the handling of information
outsourcing outsourcing dependency and fraud

key risks
dnb faces some key risks in implementing its strategy as described below

1 the financial risks for dnb increased in 2012 in the wake of the financial and
european debt crisis and the measures taken by the eurosystem to control this
crisis given the significant increase in risks the dutch state decided in early
2013 after consulting the ministry of finance to issue a guarantee for dnbs
crisisrelated exposures a degree of risk remains however as not all the financial
consequences of the european support packages are covered by the guarantee
dnb is closely monitoring developments and will take any action required

2 providing it is properly structured the banking union represents an important
step in restoring trust and confidence in the european banking sector
this banking union comprises three pillars a single supervisory mechanism ssm
a single resolution mechanism srm and a single european deposit guarantee
scheme dgs recent indications from brussels suggest that the resolution
pillar may come into force shortly after the ssm that is good news since
at minimum a banking union needs to have mechanisms in place for both
supervision and resolution in order to be effective if supervision is organised
supranationally while resolution remains at a national level conflicts of interest
may arise and undermine the effectiveness of the supervision the new european
resolution authority will have substantial powers and a single european resolution
fund srf financed by the banks the fresh resolution instruments will greatly
reduce the chances that public funds will have to be used to rescue banks in the
future a number of important risks remain however the srf for example
comprises national compartments that will gradually merge into a single fund
the level of risk sharing during this transitional period is limited which entails
the risk that the negative feedback loop between banks and governments will not

accountability




be broken a european public safety net will remain necessary given the
relatively limited target size of the srf otherwise there is a risk that the safety
net will ultimately remain national the complex decisionmaking procedures
proposed for the srm also seem likely to obstruct effective action in an
emergency dnb will do everything in its power to achieve what it regards as
an effective banking union

3 the banking union has farreaching implications for dnbs prudential
supervision of the dutch banking sector as it will result in a situation whereby
the supervision of systemically significant banks is overseen by joint supervisory
teams from the ecb in frankfurt these teams will comprise both local
examining officers and officers of various other nationalities dnb will continue
to be responsible for supervising less systemically significant banks and has set
up a project team to shape the new organisation and oversee this new method
of working

4 violent crime is increasing particularly within the cash sector preventing and
mitigating the use of violence against dnb and its employees is a high priority
within the organisation to this end dnb performs risk analyses on an ongoing
basis and implements the resulting measures while also maintaining an adequate
level of physical and other security as well as sharing relevant knowledge and
experience with agencies in the netherlands and abroad a security awareness
programme has been introduced to make dnb staff aware of potential threats
and controls the screening procedures for both new and existing staff will be
tightened up in 2014 so that possible vulnerabilities can be identified earlier

5 good security is obviously crucial if confidential information is to remain
protected dnb handles a great deal of confidential information if this
information should enter the public domain through theft including cybercrime
loss or leakage this could cause serious damage both to the organisation and
other stakeholders in order to prevent this dnb is committed to ensuring its
information security policy and procedures are up to date at all times

evaluation of internal risk management and control systems
the governing board evaluates the functioning of its internal risk management
and control systems on the basis of reports from the planning and control cycle
these are used to establish the extent to which the divisions manage operational
risks and implement appropriate measures to control those risks the governing
board also uses rsas at a strategic level in the divisions chains and processes
as well as periodic reports from secondline functions and by the internal and
external auditors

in order to limit its financial reporting risks the board also assesses whether the
processes and systems used for financial reporting are carried out in a sound
manner to achieve this relevant information sources and statements by the
owners of the relevant systems and processes are analysed

the evaluation of the functioning of the internal risk management and control
systems any material shortcomings significant changes and the key risks are
discussed in the various meetings of the audit committee and subsequently
reported to the supervisory board

in control statement concerning financial reporting risks
based on the evaluation it has carried out dnbs governing board declares that
with regard to the financial reporting risks in 2013 the internal risk management

    and control systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting is
    free of material misstatement the internal risk management and control

56 financial exposure
    dnbs financial exposure relates to its monetary operations external reserves
    and the euro investment portfolio although the risk profile of the financial
    exposure improved during the reporting year the risks generally remained high
    the higher levels of trust in the european financial markets resulted in a fall in
    the exposure relating to monetary operations in view of the high risk profile in
    these monetary operations the risk profile in the management of the external
    reserves and the euro investment portfolio has expressly been kept low
    due to the drop in income from monetary operations and lower revenue from
    disposals of dnbs own investments the result for 2013 was considerably below
    the 2012 level


    561 risks
    the securities market programme smp exposures arising from the monetary
    policy and the monetary policy credit operations largely define dnbs risk profile

    monetary policy in the euro area is determined jointly by the central banks in
    the eurosystem and the profits and risks are in principle divided among the
    national central banks in proportion to their share in the capital of the ecb
    in the case of dnb this share is 57 dnb uses the expected shortfall es
    method with a oneyear horizon and a reliability interval of 99 and scenario
    analyses to calculate the size of the risks the risk in noninvestment grade
    countries is assessed using a stress scenario

    total financial exposure from monetary operations external reserves and the euro
    investment portfolio amounted to eur 853 billion see table 53 the higher
    levels of trust in the financial markets resulted in a significant fall in the exposure
    although the risk profile of this exposure improved during the year the risks
    remained high in absolute terms the underlying risk excluding gold stood at
    eur 135 billion as at yearend 2012 and fell to eur 112 billion as at yearend
    2013 this reduction is attributable to significantly lower tensions in the
    european financial markets partly due to the recapitalisation of the greek and
    spanish banking sectors and the support provided to cyprus as the risk at
    yearend 2012 exceeded the capital buffer of eur 78 billion the dutch state

           issued a fiveyear guarantee up to eur 57 billion in early 2013 this guarantee

           these exposures relate to the smp and amounts owed by banks and national
           central banks in noninvestment grade countries greece cyprus and portugal
           the exposures to which the guarantee applies fell from eur 216 billion to
           eur 174 billion during 2013 primarily as a result of repayments under the smp
           and the recapitalisation of greek banks although no losses were incurred on
           these exposures during the reporting year the risk profile remains high

           in view of the high risk profile arising from its monetary policy tasks dnb
           maintains a very low risk profile in its own investments the interest rate risk on
           these investments is managed by capping the size and duration of the fixed

eur 23 billion to eur 128 billion as a result of redemptions see table 53
the 2012 announcement of the omt programme marked the formal end of the
smp while the purchases under the cbpp also ended in 2012


563 external reserves and euro investments
the size and composition of the external reserves and euro investments excluding
gold did not change in 2013 the external reserves and euro investments
eur 470 billion see table 55 serve to support the eurosystems common
monetary policy and dnbs financial stability objective as a result strict demands
are placed on the credit quality and liquidity of the investments

the main change in these exposures resulted from the sharp 30 fall in the gold
price in 2013 which reduced the value of dnbs gold holdings to eur 172 billion
these holdings serve as an anchor of trust and are also maintained for diversification
purposes

the bonds in the fixedincome portfolios are largely issued by governments
including regional authorities and supranational institutions and have short
remaining terms to maturity new guidelines for investments were issued in 2013
in consultation with the minister of finance and in accordance with section 16 of
the bank act under the revised investment guidelines all the fixedincome euro
portfolios  ie the euro other financial assets and heldtomaturity portfolios 
may be combined joint management will enable these portfolios to be managed
more efficiently in 2013 it was decided to reclassify the heldtomaturity portfolio
based on marktomarket valuation this will allow active management to anticipate
changes in the risk profile the us dollar portfolio eur 69 billion allows dnb to
meet requests for currency from the ecb the imf and the dutch state while the
australian dollar portfolio eur 10 billion is held in order to spread default risks
more broadly

the equity investments eur 16 billion which are held for diversification purposes
had a good year these investments are handled by three external managers two of
whom operate passive management policies and apply a benchmark based on regional
msci indices the benchmark for these passive equity investments was revised in
2013 as it was decided that there was no longer any need to deviate from the msci

    564 results
    in 2013 dnb recorded a profit of eur 1178 billion see table 56 and the financial
    statements income from monetary operations is a major component of the result
    the decrease of eur 326 million in this income item to eur 942 million was
    attributable to repayments early and otherwise on these operations and lower
    interest income from monetary policy credit operations due to the reduction in the
    policy rate to 025 the 025 narrowing of the difference between the interest
    rates on liquidityproviding and liquidityabsorbing operations also contributed to
    the lower result

    dnbs own investments achieved a result of eur 329 million which was also
    significantly lower than in 2012 the fall of eur 358 million was attributable to
    lower returns on the fixedincome portfolio this was the result of lower interest
    rates on investments and lower realised gains on the revaluation accounts for
    fixedincome securities gains realised on the revaluation accounts in 2012 were
    high because of the shortening of the term to maturity of the portfolios the sharp
    fall in the gold price in 2013 did not impact the result as this is charged to the gold

support dnb provides is especially targeted at central banks and supervisors in
the group of countries jointly represented in the imf by the netherlands and
belgium this imf constituency comprises fifteen countries primarily in the
former yugoslavia and the former soviet union these countries are still
developing and many of them continue to need assistance to reinforce their
resilience and longterm stability the capacity devoted by dnb to technical
assistance in 2013 amounted to 760 days equivalent to 38 ftes excluding cash
expertise a further 16 ftes were devoted to coordination control and support
taking the total to 54 ftes in early 2014 the dutch government agreed for a
fifth year to sponsor the highlyreputed academic training programme that the
duisenberg school of finance developed at dnbs request for central banks
ministries of finance and supervisors in the constituency countries a particular
feature of this programme is that central banks and ministries attend the same
workshop this helps them improve their understanding of each others work

    system that dnb has put in place in the netherlands for recirculating banknotes


58 operations

    581 effectiveness and efficiency
    in 2012 the dnb governing board presented a new strategic plan polaris
    to the organisation this consists of a renewed mission and ten ambitions
    see section 51 in formulating these ambitions the governing board has set
    the course to be followed in the coming years this strategy will be reviewed
    whenever circumstances  such as the introduction of european banking
    supervision  require although other organisational goals will also be relevant
    in the years ahead these longterm ambitions reflect the governing boards
    focus areas in the coming years the regular planning and control cycle will be
    used to monitor progress towards achieving the specific targets that have been
    set as part of the ambitions and to make any necessary adjustments

    in line with this multiyear strategy various steps were taken in 2013 to enhance
    the effectiveness and efficiency of dnbs operations these steps included
    revamping communications with the specific aim of reinforcing supervision
    and ensuring that dnb can communicate more effectively with society about
    supervisory issues as well as making more explicit use of communications as a
    tool for achieving effective supervision

    in addition given the positive experience to date see section 582 dnb has
    decided to extend the training programme started in 2012 to attract highly
    talented staff the newly established dnb academy see section 582 is now
    responsible for coordinating the various inhouse training initiatives

    consideration is also being given from an accommodation perspective to how
    the divisions operations and processes can be better supported one initiative
    involves the promotion of flexible working resulting in fewer physical
    workplaces from a cost perspective it was decided to dispose of dnbs external

training location the opportunities to work independently of place time and
device were expanded during the year thus allowing employees to work more
efficiently as part of this process work was started on modernising the ict
infrastructure and making it more flexible for example by examining the
opportunities for cloud computing and modernising dnbs data storage facilities
in addition dnb took action to further strengthen its procurement activities
the various improvements underway will continue in 2014

as part of a campaign to curtail spending all employees have been asked to
come up with ideas to reduce costs and make operations more sustainable


582 employees
in dnbs strategic plan polaris human resources are seen as the most important
tool for achieving the organisations objectives one of these ambitions states
that dnb wants to hire the best people for all positions in addition to
attracting highly talented people dnb must also be able to retain them and
provide development opportunities all hr activities are aimed at making a
contribution to this ambition this is done by offering interesting challenging
work and sufficient opportunities for growth and development as well as
promoting job rotation and training

focus on recruitment
all recruitment and selection activities were assigned to a single centralised
recruitment team during 2013 so as to make these activities more efficient
while also reducing the time it takes to recruit staff and to achieve a perfect
match for this latter purpose dedicated recruiters focus on specific target groups
including new hires and economic legal or actuarial specialists the advantage
of such a setup is that the recruiters get to know their target groups increasingly
well and so build up everlarger networks this in turn means they are better
placed to recruit proactively and to identify the people best qualified for the
position this approach has proved successful in for example the expansion of
the staffing capacity of the supervision divisions in 2013

traineeship programme
dnb held its second selection day for trainees in february 2013 the key aim of
the traineeship programme is to recruit highly talented young people seven new
trainees started work in seven different divisions on 1 april these trainees
emerged as the best candidates from a total of 226 applicants and several rounds
of selection apart from the recruitment of highly talented young people
the traineeship programme also promotes crossdivisional cooperation through job
rotation in october 2013 dnb was awarded the 2013 prize and accompanying
accreditation for the best starter traineeship programme in the benelux at the
annual career event held at the utrecht jaarbeurs exhibition centre a new group
of trainees will join dnb in 2014

from supervisory academy to dnb academy
in june 2013 it was decided to set up a dnb academy this academy will bring
together the various existing dnb training programmes including the supervisory
academy and the basic central banking course dnb academys centralised
management of these programmes will enable participants to expand their
networks and exchange knowledge above and beyond the dnb divisions in which
they are working the curriculum will therefore in any event include modules
common to all traineeships it has also been decided that from 1 january 2014
all supervisory employees will have to obtain forty continuing professional

development cpd points ie hours each year in this way training and
development will become even more of a strategic tool for improving supervision

management development md
various md activities are undertaken to support the performance of dnb
management the didactic design of these activities takes the polaris strategic
plan and the divisions policy plans into account activities that focus on
developing management talent include

	the oneyear leadership development programme vlot which is intended
   for employees seen as having the required leadership potential prepares
   participants in the course of a year for possible managerial appointments
	the leadership and flexibility lef and executive trajectory et
   programmes which prepare selected department heads for a possible transition
   to more senior leadership roles in addition to their network function these
   programmes focus on developing personal and leadership qualities and give
   participants the opportunity to work on some of the challenges facing the
   division or organisation they also provide a link to the polaris ambitions

single supervisory mechanism
from 1 november 2014 the ecb will have final responsibility for supervising
banks in the euro area the single supervisory mechanism  ssm the ecb is
looking for people throughout europe to fill these responsible and challenging
roles as a member of the european system of central banks escb dnb is
seeking to have suitable staff from its own organisation appointed to positions
at the ecb this was already happening in the case of monetary policy tasks and
is now being extended to include european banking supervision to this end
the following action was taken in 2013 or will be taken in 2014

 identifying and actively approaching potentially suitable candidates
 removing any possible obstacles
 providing information on living and working in frankfurt
 providing information on recruitment and selection
	providing training to improve candidates command of english as well as
   preparing them to work in an international environment and to apply new
   supervisory methods

diversity
having signed the talent to the top charter the governing board reiterated in
early 2013 its target of having 32 of management positions filled by women by
2014 the percentage achieved in 2013 was 30 when recruiting new staff
dnb looks for women who have gained management experience outside dnb
this resulted in the appointment of one candidate to a management position
in 2013 in the case of internal appointments to management positions
the composition of a divisions management team from a perspective of male
female diversity is consistently taken on board all the development
programmes also address the issue of diversity in order to continue promoting
greater malefemale diversity the governing board has decided to aim for 50
participation by women in the dnb traineeship programme this target was not
achieved in 2013 partly because far fewer women than men applied for the
traineeship programme this is due to the fact that women are underrepresented
in the job profiles for which dnb is seeking to recruit young graduates
ie background in economics or econometrics dnb wants to create added
value by capitalising on the diversity of its workforce the focus in this respect
is not only on malefemale diversity but also on other aspects such as ethnic

origins religious beliefs and sexual orientation eleven dnb mentors provided
guidance to refugee students during the year as part of our sponsorship of the
uaf foundation for refugee students

employee satisfaction survey
dnb held its annual employee satisfaction survey in october 2013 the score
for general satisfaction continued its rising line increasing from 75 out of 10
in 2011 to 76 in 2012 and 77 in 2013 the 376 score for inspired and committed
employees was above the benchmark of 363 achieving dnbs ambition of
being able to recruit and retain highly talented people will depend on factors
such as the quality of management as well as on the organisations ability to
offer its employees challenges and opportunities for personal development
the scores for these aspects in the survey also rose during the year the level
of satisfaction with management rose from 72 in 2012 to 74 in 2013 while
satisfaction with the opportunities for development rose from 69 in 2012 to 70
in 2013 both scores were above the 2013 benchmark scores of 73 and 66
respectively

employee development and career progression
offering satisfactory opportunities for growth and development is a way for dnb
to ensure it can retain the best people for the organisation in cases where a
perfect match is not yet in place training courses career counselling job rotation
and departures are used as instruments to have employees move on to positions
to which they are better suited

performance management
a new version of the performance management system pm20 became
operational for all dnb employees in 2013 this will enable dnb to focus even
more on performance to this end a sevenpoint assessment scale which
replaces the existing fivepoint scale has been adopted and the rules of the system
have been clarified the revamped system will be reviewed once the performance
appraisals for 2013 have been completed in other words after february 2014

health and working conditions
the sickness reporting frequency fell from 114 in 2012 to 105 in 2013 while the
sickness absence rate remained the same at 288 the sickness absence rate for
large banks came out at 343 in 2013 psychological complaints accounted for
much of this absence and many of these cases were of a longterm nature
the occupational health and safety service will be devoting extra attention
to this issue in 2014 the banks hr advisers will be consulted on how line
management can be helped to identify psychological problems at an early stage
and thus enable preventive action to be taken the 2014 focus areas will be
vitality a healthy lifestyle and sustainable deployment of employees

dnb is committed to continually improving its working conditions in 2012
the globally accepted ohsas 18001 standard was implemented and certified in
the cash operations department where the physical workload is relatively high
ohsas stands for occupational health and safety assessment the external
audit will be held in february 2014

the cash operations department has devised policy for promoting the
sustainable deployment of employees that takes account of their physical
workload this is because the average age of employees in cash operations is
now over 50 the policy will focus on reducing the physical workload and on
encouraging task rotation and employability the logistics and sorting unit has

accountability




worked with po to compile a strategic staffing plan following an analysis of
current and future staffing levels this will form the basis for action to improve
the sustainable deployment of employees implementation of the policy on
sustainable deployment will continue during 2014 the focus here is on
developing resources to reduce the physical workload on workplace studies of
jobs involving heavy physical workloads as well as office work places and on
opportunities for job rotation the aim in this respect is to achieve the
maximum possible variation in employees work account is also taken of the
composition of teams with additional staff being deployed in the event of
physically demanding activities

collective labour agreement
all employee salaries were raised by 058 on 1 july 2013 this rise was based on
the basket now tracked by dnb and the afm for collective pay rises
dnbs pension scheme was changed with effect from 1 january 2014 in response
to new tax legislation the most important change in this respect relates to the
rise in the standard retirement age from 65 to 67 in line with the changes in the
pension scheme the leave scheme for older dnb employees was discontinued
from 1 february 2014 dnb is currently discussing a policy on vitality with the
unions both parties understand the importance of good policy in ensuring
employees remain fit and healthy


583 compliance and integrity
dnb may be expected to demonstrate the highest level of integrity and dnbs
compliance and integrity programme is designed to ensure it can live up to these
expectations the aim of this programme is to manage integrity risks and to
promote ethical conduct by the organisation and its employees the compliance
and integrity ci department provides guidance to management on setting an
example and seeks to ensure employees are aware of their professional duty to
act with integrity

continued management of principal integrity risks
efforts were undertaken in 2013 to deal with the integrity risks prioritised in late
2012 dnbs information security platform identified a solution that sharply
reduced the number of inadvertently sent emails in addition dnb analysed the
compliance and integrity risks that can arise through the use of insourced workers
while also giving consideration during discussions with management to the risks
specifically facing managers these include the risks involved in handling
confidential information problems relating to inadvertently sent emails and the
use of insourced staff these discussions will continue in 2014

continuing development of ethical culture within dnb
various actions were taken in 2013 to embed an ethical culture within dnb
these included the organisation of twelve workshops for teams and the revision
of the contents of the orientation programme for new staff this resulted in higher
attendance at the introductory workshops fourteen of which were held in 2013
lastly in january 2014 dnb launched a system for measuring ethical awareness

promoting an active and facilitating role for management
all managers completed the revised twoyearly management selfassessment in
2013 to show how they manage ethical conduct in practice the results were
compared with those of 2011 and discussed with management at a departmental
level these discussions were followed by various activities ranging from
workshops to risk analyses while a special meeting was also arranged for managers


128 dnb  annual report 2013

accountability




on the subject of exemplary conduct the selfassessment will be further improved
based on the points identified by managers and will next be held in 2015

mirroring other supervisors
dnb has shared its knowledge and experience with compliance and integrity with
various parties including the tax authorities the amsterdam municipal integrity
bureau and the uwv employee insurance agency it also arranged an
international seminar on compliance and integrity for central banks and
 supervisors representatives from twentyone different organisations took part in
 the seminar

effective and efficient implementation of basic operational tasks compliance with
integrity rules
employees submit reports requests for advice and incident reports mainly
electronically to ci which then uses a computerised system to handle them
see the csr annex to the annual report 2013

integrity incidents
an integrity incident or suspected integrity incident occurs when there is a risk
that dnbs integrity or reputation or that of its employees could be
compromised by an infringement of internal or external laws or regulations
most of the incidents in 2013 related to careless handling of information see the
csr annex to the annual report 2013 all incidents were investigated in most
cases it was established that an irregularity had indeed occurred a special or
preliminary investigation is launched for incidents where an employees
reliability is being questioned in 2013 five such investigations were initiated
into careless handling of pricesensitive information a possible breach of
confidentiality provisions suspected incorrect claims for hours worked
two investigations and an employees criminal history in four of the cases it was
established that no integrity regulations had been breached the fifth investigation
had not yet been completed at the time of writing of this annual report


584 environmental care
dnb has set ambitious environmental objectives from 2014 for example it is
seeking to be climate neutral by purchasing green energy and offsetting its
remaining co2 emissions through gold standard credits

in 2013 dnb also started investigating the opportunities for a new lease policy
based on a remuneration benchmark market standards in light of the results
of this investigation the governing board decided to align the lease policy with
the organisations csr policy

the focus areas of dnbs environmental policy are compliance with legislation
and regulations management of environmental risks and a permanent
commitment to improving the organisations environmental performance
progress in this respect is monitored through audits with environmental
performance being measured against the stimular environmental barometer
see wwwmilieubarometernl results achieved are subject to periodic assessment
dnb operates an iso 14001certified environmental management system for
three departments that have a significant environmental impact

environmental policy also plays an important role in the ict function policy
in this area focuses on ensuring the sustainable provision of ict services from
procurement to disposal equipment written off by dnb is given a new lease of

life through the close the gap foundation other examples of recycling within
dnb include payments recycling of rejected money containers into pellets
while the seals used to secure transport and storage units for banknotes and
coins are also recycled more information on dnbs environmental policy can
be found in the csr annex to the annual report 2013


585 sustainable procurement
dnb revised its policy on sustainable procurement during the year under review
alongside legitimacy and efficiency see section 54 csr is now one of the
pillars of this policy this means that dnb takes account of the impact of
purchased products services and labour on society in other words the social
environmental and economic consequences for society in general and for dnb
its suppliers their employees and any subcontractors in particular

under the revised procurement policy dnb will continue seeking for example
to apply the social and the environmental criteria set by the dutch government
nl agency available social criteria will be applied wherever possible while csr
will also become an integral part of the strategy set for each european tender
one of the objectives of dnbs procurement policy for 2013 was 100 sustainable
procurement through application wherever possible of the nl agencys
environmental criteria these criteria were applicable and applied to three of the
sixteen european tenders carried out and completed in 2013 in addition all the
european tenders considered whether any additional sustainability aspects could
be taken into account these additional requirements were included in two
tenders  the renovation of the sarphatistraat offices and the procurement of
armoured transport vehicles in addition the dnb code of conduct and integrity
rules which focus on such things as preventing conflicts of interest and bribery
apply both to dnbs own staff and to insourced workers

banknotes made from sustainable cotton
since 2007 dnb has required its banknote suppliers to include a proportion of
sustainably produced cotton in their products an example of this is the fair trade
cotton system which guarantees that cotton farmers receive a fair price and sets
conditions for issues such as human rights no child labour and environmental
aspects no use of pesticides the fairtrade labelling organization carries out
local inspections to verify that these conditions are being observed since 2012
dnb has also offered suppliers the option of using a proportion of organically
farmed cotton in addition to fair trade cotton

dnb ordered 825 million banknotes in 2013 the paper used by suppliers
contained 5 fair trade cotton and 25 organically grown cotton meaning that
a total of 30 of the cotton used was sustainably produced an additional
positive development is that dnb played a leading role in the eurosystem
agreement that all national central banks will start using sustainably produced
cotton in their banknotes in 2014

by analogy with the use of fair trade cotton in the clothing industry dnb agreed
to pay a bonus for increasing the availability of fair trade cotton for banknotes
in 2013 the solidaridad network was once again responsible for allocating this
bonus the money went to the procotton project an initiative of the rabobank
foundation and solidaridad aimed at encouraging smallscale farming
organisations in developing countries to participate in sustainable textile chains
and thus increasing the supply of all kinds of sustainable cotton the procotton
projects main aim is to improve cotton farming communities standard of living
and prosperity

586 social commitment
contributions and donations
dnb assesses requests for financial and nonfinancial contributions and
donations on the basis of its dedicated policies in these areas the budget of
eur 14 million for contributions in 2013 was the same as in 2012 in 2014
however this budget essentially be halved because of the closing of the money
museum and the resultant discontinuation of dnbs annual contribution
however in accordance with the authorisation decision bulletin of acts and
decrees 2013 542 dnb will take over the money museums management and
conservation responsibilities as well as the collection of the ministry of
education culture and science and that of the dutch royal mint in 2013
the donations budget of eur 250000 was the same as in 2012 donations and
sponsorship are decided and monitored annually at a centralised level

dnb seeks to support activities that have some relationship to its core tasks
it provides financial and other forms of support to various organisations
mainly those in which dnb has a supervisory or advisory role or which dnb
helped set up such as the duisenberg school of finance the money museum
geldmuseum  until the end of 2013  and the money wise platform wijzer
in geldzaken under this platform over forty partners from the financial sector
the public sector public information and consumer organisations as well as
the academic world have joined forces to help improve consumers financial
awareness and education dnb is one of the four sponsors of this project
dnb employees also spent time during the year on initiatives launched by the
child and youth finance international organisation which sets out to improve
the economic awareness of children and young people

dnb makes both monetary and other donations to charities active in the fields
of culture health care and civil society among the recipients of dnb donations
in 2013 were the alpe dhuzes foundation for cancer research and the sire
public service advertising organisation in addition one dnb employee was
also released from his dnb duties to work three days a week for alpe dhuzes
until 1 september 2013 and inspire2live the literacy foundation stichting
lezen  schrijven was given the opportunity to use dnbs reception area
while small donations were also made to childs destiny of hope
the international foundation for alzheimers research and the droomboom
foundation for autistic children through members of staff who sit on the boards
of these foundations

under the building together samen bouwen banner dnb employees can take
part in organised volunteer work projects some 125 dnb employees took part in
a total of thirteen voluntary work projects in 2013 this work can be broken
down into three categories

	activities involving people in a care centre such as sea fishing a sports days
   for people with a mild disability at the cordaan institute in amsterdam
   and the annual summer party for people with a mental disability at the
   s heeren loo care centre
	activity projects where dnb employees do odd jobs such as gardening or
   painting
	knowledge transfer projects where dnb employees work with the jinc
   organisation to provide job application training short internships and
   coaching programmes to give young people from underprivileged backgrounds
   a better start in the labour market a campaign in november 2013 resulted in
   almost eighty volunteers being recruited for jinc projects in 2014

61 introduction
    calm has returned to the financial markets partly thanks to the announcement by
    the european central bank ecb of its outright monetary transactions omt
    programme in 2012 and the decision by european government leaders to create
    the single supervisory mechanism ssm the economic climate improved
    slightly both in the netherlands and internationally the risks however have not
    yet receded the nationalisation of sns reaal on 1 february 2013 was a farreaching
    intervention and included the firstever use of the intervention act
    interventiewet de nederlandsche bank dnb together with the european
    national supervisors and the ecb is getting ready for the transition to the ssm
    at the end of 2014 and by way of preparation has initiated the comprehensive
    assessment ca of significant banks these events were a recurring topic of
    discussion at the meetings of the supervisory board in the presence of the
    governing board partly in light of dnbs position as central bank within the
    european system of central banks escb and as prudential supervisor
    these external developments which clearly also have major internal consequences
    are reviewed in greater detail elsewhere in this annual report

    in march 2013 with a view to the risks to dnbs balance sheet the dutch state
    issued a guarantee for dnbs crisisrelated assets the guarantee agreement was
    entered into for a fiveyear period but can be ended earlier or extended
    depending on how the risks develop at the time of adoption of the financial
    statements the abovementioned financial risks had not led to actual losses or
    to a call on this guarantee the net profit for 2013 came to eur 1178 million
    and the profit distribution to the dutch state amounted to eur 1119 million
    partly because of the uncertainties surrounding the level of dnbs profit
    no interim dividend has been paid out since the 2011 financial year on 8 march
    2013 the minister of finance reported to the dutch senate that the payment of
    an interim dividend was not to be expected in the coming years

    dnbs new governance model which arose from the act strengthening
    governance of financial supervisors dnb and afm wet versterking governance
    dnb en afm and entered into force on 16 february 2012 was further elaborated
    in 2013 in conformity with its statutory mandate the supervisory boards role
    previously focused mainly on supervising management and operations at dnb
    since february 2012 however the board has also supervised the governing
    boards policy in relation to the implementation of dnbs national tasks as set
    out in section 4 of the bank act 1998 bankwet 1998 these concern the
    implementation of dnbs general policy and the safeguarding of the quality and
    effectiveness of that policy the national tasks involve the policy aspects
    including associated safeguards of the prudential supervision conducted by

    dnb the payment systems task the statistics task and the performance of the
    tasks mentioned in section 4 on the islands of bonaire st eustatius and saba
    this expansion of the supervisory role not only places demands on the boards
    composition and profile but also on the way it operates the supervision
    committee which was set up in 2012 reports on the policy aspects of the
    prudential supervision conducted by dnb the audit committee reports on the
    policy aspects of the other tasks under section 4 in 2013 the supervisory board
    regularly discussed the implementation of the governance model with the
    governing board various aspects of the governance model were reviewed both
    in the plenary meetings as well as in a separate meeting

    as no appointments or reappointments occurred in the year under review
    the boards malefemale mix remained unchanged the composition of the
    supervisory board also remained the same and likewise its malefemale mix
    in the event of appointments and reappointments to the governing board and
    supervisory board the supervisory board will naturally focus on the adopted
    profiles which include a balanced malefemale mix of the board

    in conformity with section 131 of the bank act 1998 the supervisory board

    of the boards committees are briefly described below

    as part of the supervisory boards supervision of the management and general
    course of business within dnb the financial results for 2013 were discussed by
    the audit committee and in the plenary supervisory board meetings
    these discussions were based on the periodic integrated financial report


    136 dnb  annual report 2013

report of the supervisory board




incorporating the former financial report and the quarterly reports of monetary
operations and investments the management letters from the external auditor
and the internal audit department iad and the iad quarterly reports
one recurring issue was the development of the balance sheet financial risks as
a result of the debt crisis the guarantee issued by the dutch state testifies to
these risks the supervisory board established that the net profit fell by
eur 901 million in 2013 from eur 2079 million in 2012 to eur 1178 million
this reflects the improvement of the risk profile though the board emphasises
that the risks have on the whole remained at a high level no gold sales took
place in 2013

the supervisory board held detailed discussions with the governing board about
the 2013 financial statements and these meetings were attended by the external
auditor the opinion of the external auditor and the iads analyses were taken
into account in these discussions pursuant to article 196 of the articles of
association the board subsequently adopted the financial statements and offered
them for approval to the general meeting of shareholders on 12 march 2014
the latter adopted the financial statements discharged the governing board of
responsibility in respect of their management and the supervisory board in
respect of their supervision

the supervisory board discussed and approved the budget for 2014 on
22 november 2013 this concerned the first budget where the supervisory costs
were budgeted on the basis of a longterm cost framework the supervisory
board established that the most important internal business and operational
control instruments such as the planning and control cycle and the risk
management and control system operated effectively no specific points for
attention emerged in this context

with regard to the internal operations the supervisory board notes that in the
year under review the governing board and management devoted attention to
the processes of change taking place within dnbs supervision these changes
create the conditions for more intensive and decisive supervision and this
longterm process of change will remain a primary focus area for the supervisory
board in the coming period in addition the board is involved in the ssm from
several perspectives given the major changes involved the ssm represents one
of the most fundamental changes for dnb not just in terms of the design of
the supervisory processes but also for the supervisionrelated governance of
dnb furthermore the arrival of the ssm will have farreaching consequences
for the statistics function and the internal operations of dnb the supervisory
board obtains information on these subjects via the supervision committee and
the audit committee and naturally in its plenary meetings the supervisory
board notes that the governing board is taking up these challenges in an
adequate manner

in connection with the expansion of the supervisory boards tasks under dnbs
new governance model and more specifically its supervision over dnbs policy
for conducting its prudential supervisory task the supervisory board  together
with the minister of finance  commissioned an evaluation in march 2013 of
whether dnb and the ministry acting both individually and jointly responded
in a timely and adequate manner to information signals and developments
concerning the financial position of sns reaal this jointlycommissioned
evaluation was carried out by the evaluation committee on the nationalisation
of sns reaal ens consisting of rein jan hoekstra and jean frijns
the supervision committee was intensively involved in dnbs activities for

68 concluding words
    clearly 2013 was another highly eventful year in which dnb was unrelentingly
    confronted with many challenging developments although the debt crisis abated
    dnb must in its capacity as a central bank within the escb remain as vigilant
    as ever as a prudential supervisor dnb successfully expanded its supervisory
    capacity and the entire organisation is preparing for the fundamental changes
    resulting from the arrival of the ssm in the year under review it once again
    became clear that weaknesses existed in a number of the supervised institutions
    we note that the governing board and employees tackled the various problems
    with outstanding knowledge and expertise in combination with unflagging
    energy and admirable resilience for this reason the supervisory board would
    like to express its appreciation to the governing board and employees for their
    commitment in 2013 and looks forward to its continuing cooperation with the
    governing board with great confidence

latvia to the euro the number of ncbs participating in the eurosystem has grown to eighteen

the ecb has been allocated a share of 8 of the total value of euro banknotes
in circulation while the remaining 92 is allocated to the ncbs in proportion
to their weightings in the capital key of the eurosystem the share of banknotes
in circulation allocated to each ncb is accounted for on the liabilities side of
the balance sheet under banknotes in circulation

in accordance with the banknote allocation key and the value of the euro
banknotes actually circulated by that ncb gives rise to further intraeurosystem
positions these interestbearing3 claims or liabilities are disclosed under
subitem claims within the eurosystem  net claims related to the allocation
of euro banknotes within the eurosystem

for the five years following the year of the cash changeover4 the intraeurosystem
positions arising from the allocation of euro banknotes are adjusted in order
to prevent significant changes in ncbs relative income positions as compared
to previous years the adjustments are effected by taking into account the
differences between the average value of banknotes put into circulation by each
ncb in the reference period5 and the average value of banknotes that would
have been allocated to them during that period under the eurosystem capital
allocation key the adjustments are reduced in annual stages until the first day
of the sixth year after the cash changeover year from then on the income on
banknotes is allocated fully to the ncbs in proportion to their paidup shares
in the ecbs capital for the central bank of cyprus and the central bank of
malta this period ended on 31 december 2013 for the národná banka slovenska

this income is realised unless the ecb governing council decides otherwise
the ecb will in january of the following year distribute this amount among
the ncbs in the form of an interim profit distribution6 before years end
the governing council may decide to retain the proceeds from the securities
markets programme smp and if necessary the seigniorage income from euro
banknotes in full or in part if the amount to be distributed exceeds the ecbs
net profit for the year subject to a decision to that effect by the ecb
governing council the amount concerned may be reduced by the expenses of

may be added to a provision for foreign exchange rate interest rate and gold
price risks the amount distributed to dnb is presented in the profit and loss

form of gold or convertible currencies the dutch quotum for which dnb acts
as manageragent equals sdr 5162 million in 2010 it was decided to increase
the quotum which will result in a higher reserve tranche position through the
transfer of 25 of the enlargement the effective date of the quotum increase is
uncertain because the largest member of the imf  the united states of america
 has not ratified the change once the change has been enacted the dutch
quotum will increase by sdr 36 billion the imf remunerates this position at
an interest rate which is updated weekly in 2013 this rate was between 003
and 013 on an annual basis 2012 between 003 and 015 this rate reflects
the prevailing sdr interest rate

the loans eur 1612 million consist of a loan to the poverty reduction and
growth facilityexogenous shock facility trust prgfesf trust and a special
bilateral loan arrangement which was included in 2010 in the new arrangements
to borrow nab the prgfesf trust eur 298 million is a fund set up to
supply the principals of subsidised lowinterest loans to the poorest developing
countries the netherlands has pledged sdr 500 million to the prgf loan
account in respect of these amounts a contract was agreed with the imf
entailing that each drawing must be repaid in ten equal tranches within 55 to
10 years after the drawing dnb receives the prevailing market rate on the loan
the interest rate subsidy is financed by the ministry of foreign affairs

under the nab eur 1314 million a credit line with a maximum of
eur 101 billion has been made available for use by the imf for its regular
operations in addition to the regular quotum in 2011 it was decided to
increase the financial efficacy of the imf through new bilateral loans totalling
eur 456 billion of this euro countries are to shoulder eur 150 billion
the contribution of the netherlands eur 136 billion was effected in 2012
the imf has not yet drawn on this facility the new bilateral loans will function
as the imfs last financial line of defence in case the quota and the nab
both face exhaustion since dnb is the executing body of the dutch imf
membership credit guarantees up to the sum of the maximum commitment for
each facility have been granted by the dutch state

under the covered bond purchase programmes cbpp1 and cbpp2 the ecb

covered bonds issued in the euro area the aim was to ease the funding
conditions for credit institutions and enterprises and to encourage credit
institutions to maintain and expand their lending to clients both programmes

programmes

securities purchased under the securities markets programme smp and those
purchased under the covered bond purchase programmes cbpp1 and cbbp2
have been designated as held to maturity and are presented at amortised cost
less any impairment

the annual test to determine any impairment is performed by the eurosystem
on the basis of the accounting policies applicable to the european system of
central banks see under accounting policies above the available information
and the expected realisable value as at balance sheet date this is in accordance
with a decision by the ecb governing council which dnb observes as regards
the securities purchased under the securities markets programme smp and

no impairment have been made either

although the escb tests did not result in any impairment on these positions
considerable risks due to the debt crisis remain and may still give rise to losses
the governing council of the ecb and the governing board of dnb regularly
assess the financial risks attaching to the securities held in the smp and cbpp

the part of other securities consisting of securities valued at amortised cost
has been reclassified as marked to market which facilitates more effective
control of interest rate and credit risks at the same time the positive intent to
hold these securities to maturity was relinquished the papers will be sold at an
expedient moment given the target risk profile of the entire portfolio

in 2013 it was decided to transfer the fixedincome securities from other
financial assets to other securities the reason is that the transfer made the
management of the risks on such paper more effective and efficient and risk
developments regarding the portfolio easier to anticipate

the said transfer led to a oneoff value transfer of eur 5444 million at the time

according to article 28 of the escb statute the national central banks of the
escb are the only shareholders in the capital of the ecb each ncbs capital
interest depends on its share fixed in accordance with article 293 of the escb
statute this share is reviewed every five years the capital interests in the ecb
are valued at purchase price

on 1 july 2013 the capital key was adjusted to reflect the accession of croatia to
the eu under section 483 of the escb statute the paidup capital of the ecb is
increased automatically whenever a new state joins the eu and by consequence
its central bank joins the escb the increase is determined by multiplying the
prevailing amount of the subscribed capital ie eur 10825 million by the ratio
within the expanded capital key between the weighting of the entering ncbs
and the weighting of those ncbs that are already members of the escb
as a consequence the subscribed capital of the ecb was increased on 1 july 2013
from eur 10760 million to eur 10825 million the result was that the share of
dnb in the increased subscribed capital of the ecb eur 429 million
decreased from 39882 tot 39663 whereas asset item 81 participating interest
in the ecb increased by eur 08 million to eur 4694 million

    allocation of monetary income and

 provision for monetary policy operations
in conformity with article 324 of the escb statute the provision against the risk
of default on the part of counterparties has been divided within the eurosystem
among the national central banks of the participating member states in
proportion to their capital key in the year of default having assessed the size of
this provision in accordance with general accounting policies the governing
council of the ecb has decided to release it the residual amount of the
provision was eur 310 million for dnb this resulted in a release of
eur 17 million to profit see also net result of monetary income pooling
in the notes to the profit and loss account

 provision for staff remuneration
dnb operates the following arrangements
 a defined benefit pension arrangement
	a contribution to the health care insurance premiums of pensioners
   limited group
 a limited inactivity arrangement
 a service anniversary and retirement bonus arrangement
 a redundancy programme

the pension scheme is an indexlinked careeraverage scheme with guaranteed
indexation in line with general wage increases pensions of existing pensioners and
former dnb employees are indexed only if the pension funds financial position
so permits due to a funding deficit having arisen at the dnb pension fund the
fund has drawn up a recovery plan to make up for the deficit a premium policy
has been drawn up under which the fund will restore its assets to the minimum
funding level within a period of five years as from end2008 and the required
level will be recovered within 15 years on 31 december 2013 the funding ratio of
the dnb pension fund based on the ultimate forward rate in line with dnb
requirements stood at 1089 so that a state of underfunding did not exist on

custody
dnb holds securities and other documents of value in custody for third parties
such custody is for the account and risk of the depositors

guarantee scheme for crisisrelated assets
in 2013 the financial risks for dnb decreased as a result of the measures taken by
the eurosystem to stabilise the operation of the euro area12 whereas the risk
profile of dnbs financial exposures improved in 2013 it remains relatively high
the financial risk excluding gold at yearend 2013 was determined at
eur 112 billion dnb uses the expected shortfall es method to measure and
manage its financial risks with various scenarios being calculated the resulting
calculated risk is higher than the total capital and general reserve of
eur 78 billion in march 2013 given the risks arising from the debt crisis the
minister of finance issued a free and unconditional guarantee of up to
eur 57 billion on the basis of the scenario risks this guarantee relates to
dnbs share in possible losses on crisisrelated exposures in the monetary
portfolios

offbalance sheet liabilities
liability claims and procedures
by reason of its supervisory task or otherwise dnb may receive liability notices
or preannouncements of such notices in some cases liability proceedings have
been brought against dnb where the liability amounts cannot reasonably be
predicted or where reasonable doubts remain as to whether a claim will stand
up dnb suffices by mentioning such cases in these notes the governing
board saw no reason to make a provision on this account in 2013 the relevant
current cases are discussed in more detail below

claims of fortis shareholders
a group of belgian fortis shareholders has brought proceedings against dnb
 as well as against the dutch state and fortis  before the brussels commercial
court in an action including a claim for damages of eur 5 per share it is not
known how many shares are involved in its ruling of 8 december 2009 the
commercial court honoured the dutch states and dnbs invocation of
immunity in these proceedings some of the fortis shareholders appealed against
this ruling in 2011 in 2013 the appeal court ruled that the dutch state and dnb
cannot be tried before a belgian court on the grounds of immunity

stichting pensioenfonds vereenigde glasfabrieken
the appeals board for trade and industry in its ruling of 10 september 2013
rejected the appeal by dnb and upheld the initial court ruling the case
concerned dnbs decision to instruct a pension fund stichting pensioenfonds
vereenigde glasfabrieken to substantially reduce its investments in gold
on 15 march 2012 the district court ruled against dnb reversed the decision
on objection revoked dnbs principal decision and reopened the investigation
in preparation for a further ruling on the amount of compensation payable
the latter proceedings have been resumed in may 2012 the pension fund
calculated its loss at approximately eur 95 million the amsterdam district
court is expected to rule on the claim for damages in 2014

stichting gedupeerden easy life
a foundation stichting gedupeerden easy life set up to represent investors
claiming to have lost money as a result of the activities of easy life initiated
legal proceedings against dnb at the amsterdam district court in 2012
the foundations claims include a request for the court to rule that dnb acted
unlawfully towards investors who invested in various companies not subject to
supervision that operated under the easy life banner and to order dnb to
compensate the losses the investors suffered the court reviewed the submissions
on both sides and in early december 2013 heard the parties in session a ruling is
expected in the first half of 2014

shipping company and entrepreneur from greece
a natural person and an enterprise in greece have instigated legal proceedings
in greece against parties including dnb and the dutch state the dispute
leading to the summons concerned a commercial dispute between the company
and a banking consortium on repayment of a credit facility and the related call
on a bank guarantee the main complaint against dnb would seem to be that
dnb failed to intervene adequately after allegedly being informed about the
laundering of proceeds from criminal activities in march 2013 dnb submitted
a notice of defence to the law court in greece the hearing of the case has been
postponed until april 2014

a decline in the price gains on fixedincome instruments was caused by a drop in
sales and by duration reduction with a view to reduce risks the fall in the price
gains on sales of equities resulted from lower sales in 2013

the writedowns consist largely of price revaluation losses on fixedincome
securities eur 30 million

income during 2013 the resulting eur 484 million expense was lower than the
eur 945 million expense incurred in 2012 this item also includes dnbs share
in the net result of a eur 17 million provision against risks of default by
counterparties within the eurosystem 2012 eur 36 million

the amount of each eurosystem ncbs monetary income is determined by
measuring the actual annual income that derives from the earmarked assets held
against its liability base the earmarkable assets consist of the following items
lending to euro area credit institutions related to monetary policy operations
denominated in euro securities held for monetary policy purposes
claims equivalent to the transfer of foreign reserves to the ecb other claims
within the eurosystem net resulting from target2 transactions net claims
related to the allocation of banknotes within the eurosystem and a limited
amount of gold reserves proportional to the eurosystem capital key gold is
assumed to generate no income securities held for monetary policy purposes
under the decision ecb200916 of 2 july 2009 on the implementation of the
covered bond purchase programme or the decision ecb200117 of 3 november
2011 on the implementation of the covered bonds purchase programme cbpp 1
and cbpp 2 are assumed to generate income at the refinancing rate where the
value of an ncbs earmarked assets exceeds or falls short of the value of its
liability base the difference is offset by applying the refinancing percentage to
the value of the difference the income on the earmarked assets is included
under interest income

the liability base consists of the following items banknotes in circulation
liabilities to euro area credit institutions related to monetary policy operations
denominated in euro other liabilities within the eurosystem net resulting
from target2 transactions and net liabilities related to the allocation of
euro banknotes within the eurosystem any interest paid on items included in
the liability base has to be deducted from the monetary income to be pooled

the net result of pooling monetary income can be broken down as follows

overall net result of monetary income pooling                            467     909




the monetary income pooled by the eurosystem ncbs is to be allocated among
the ncbs in proportion to the subscribed capital key monetary income pooling
and redistribution leads to redistribution effects such effects may arise from
on the one hand differences between eurosystem ncbs with respect to returns
on certain earmarked assets or interest paid on related liabilities on the other
hand the shares of earmarkable assets and related liabilities of those national
banks differ from the shares in the total earmarked assets and related liabilities
allocated to the ncbs according to the eurosystem capital key for dnb the net
result of the pooling of monetary income eur 467 million compared to
eur 909 million at yearend 2012 arises from the difference between the
monetary income pooled by dnb eur 1436 million and the monetary income
accruing to dnb according to the eurosystem capital key eur 951 million
in addition in 2013 corrections have been made to the redistribution of monetary
income in 2008 and 2012 leading to an eur 1 million net gain for dnb
furthermore it includes dnbs share in the net result of the change in the
provision for monetary policy operations being a release to profit of eur 17
million against a release of eur 36 million in 2012

9 other income
this item includes the proceeds arising from the fact that the costs of supervision
are passed on to the supervised institutions as well as the government
