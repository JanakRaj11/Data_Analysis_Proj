our sustainability principles values are both the result of material
issues that have emerged from the involvement of the various
functions and of the various forms of dialogue and discussions with
groupʻs stakeholders


this document was the first step in the preparation of a
sustainability report in line with gri which led us to focus more on
the aspects that really matter on which we will target our efforts in
response to the needs and expectations of our stakeholders



over the year 2015 there no critical issues emerged from the
activities of stakeholders involvement

the drafting and publication of the sustainability report and other
reports on the assessment of our corporate social responsibility by
ecovadis enterprise has received appreciation from all of our
stakeholders

procurement approach


g4  ec9
the group favours domestic suppliers and in particular companies
that can provide goods and  or services in the whole national
territory most of the spending on supplies for the three countries in
which the organisation operates is made from local suppliers ie
operators located in the same country and in many cases in the same
region or city where the offices of the groupʼs companies are
the raw material used for production is defined by the customer
and generally produced  manufactured by multinational paper
mills
we avail as much as possible of local suppliers as shown in the
paragraph g412

following the evaluation of environmental impacts lcia in relation
to the annual production our consumptions were monitored to
intervene significantly by establishing objectives aimed to
       reduce natural resources waste
       reduce our contribution to global warming
the extent of reduction was determined through the evaluation of
the carbon foot print for the years taken as reference


focus on biodiversity
one of the environmental elements in which palladio group pays its
attention is biodiversity of course we do not operate in protected
areas or where there are endangered species but through the
adherence to the forest management systems as fsc and pefc  we
confirm our interest in this field
supporting the protection of forests and wildlife as well as standing
up against the illegal trade in the wood industry seems only right
given our kind of manufacturing
our staff awareness in this field is very strong the company
promotes initiatives which directly involve the employees and in
some cases their families by advertising our sustainability activities
through brochures posters and visits to our facilities all this is
making sure that our vision and commitment in the environmental
field is also shared with them

14 m3 per head almost all the water consumed comes from
municipal water while about 18 of consumption consists of ground

consumption flow reducers were installed to the taps in the toilets
of our sites simple devices that mix air with water and double

for the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from the processing
of paper materials employed in the plants of palladio group we
considered the value of co2 emissions per ton of raw material                      picture 7 total tco2 emissions d originated by use to raw material processing for each plant

produced provided by different paper mills specifically the emission
of co2 was weighed according to the amount of material taken if
the supplier has not sent  delivered the value per ton of co2 we
applied the highest value available
we also note that co2 emissions considered and referred to as co2
from processing is derived from the product of the conversion index
