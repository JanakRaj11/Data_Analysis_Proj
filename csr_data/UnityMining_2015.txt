                        also a signatory to an emergency response mutual aid
                        agreement in the region which enables the mines in the
                        area to draw upon mine rescue team resources from
                        other nearby mining operations in the unlikely event of
                        an emergency the mutual aid agreement significantly
                        strengthens each mines emergency response capability
                        and ensures that potentially problematic administrative
                        matters associated with providing mutual aid do not
                        unnecessarily complicate important response efforts

                        incident occurred during the year on january 8
                        2015 the mine dewatering pipeline ruptured adjacent
                        to the henty river and untreated mine water was
                        released sampling undertaken immediately following
                        the incident and in the following days indicated that
                        the impact was very minimal and of short duration
                        immediately following the incident a sample was taken
                        both downstream and upstream of the point of entry to
                        the henty river this sampling indicated an increase
