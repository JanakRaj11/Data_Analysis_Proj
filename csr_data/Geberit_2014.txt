12 key impacts risks and opportunities with regard to sustainability

a sustainable corporate culture makes it possible to increase the value of the company over the long term and minimize risks for its future
development geberit aims to be a role model and to set standards for customers suppliers and other partners this applies to watersaving
sustainable products environmentally friendly and resourceefficient production procurement and logistics with high environmental and ethical
standards and good safe working conditions for the more than 6200 committed and qualified employees worldwide the corporate social
responsibility is realized among other things within the scope of global social projects relating to the core competence of water and is intensified
through partnerships such as that with swiss waterkiosk aimed at cleaning polluted drinking water in bangladesh there is also a longterm
 partnership with the swiss development organization helvetas

the  50th anniversary of the geberit concealed cistern is a perfect example of how longterm business success is compatible with
environmentally friendly action this highly successful product which has been sold over 60 million times was a farsighted strategic step on the
journey from a sanitary unit to the bathroom of today in its modern form water saving through reduced flush volumes reliable quality and comfort
for end users as well as the 25year guaranteed spare parts availability for plumbers are all convincing aspects of a sustainable product

sustainability means satisfying the needs of todays generation in a manner that will ensure a solid basis for the livelihoods of future generations
with its millennium development goals from the year 2000 the united nations aims to halve the number of people without access to clean drinking
water and sanitary facilities by 2015 this demonstrates the great importance of the topic of water for world health world nutrition and
peacekeeping the increase in the worlds population migration urbanization climate change and natural disasters can lead to regions that are
currently well supplied with water becoming problem regions in the future these global trends will have a significant impact on future sanitary
technology watersaving resourceefficient products are becoming even more important the study published in 2013 by the european
commission on the criteria for an ecolabel aimed at reducing water consumption in european toilets was therefore broadly received and discussed
the eu is increasingly putting water conservation on its political agenda and is developing ecolabels for efficient toilets urinals washbasins and
showers as an industry leader in the area of sustainability geberit imposes stricter standards on its products than those prescribed by the
european ecolabels leading geberit wc flushing systems therefore already meet the requirements for this ecolabel according to the product
classification system well water efficiency label for watersaving and resourcesaving products introduced by the industry back in 2011 seven
out of eight certified geberit product groups are represented in the highest classification class a the analysis of the entire value chain in the form
of a  water footprint shows that nearly 100 of the water consumption is attributable to the product usage phase the water savings are
impressive according to one model calculation the entire dualflush and flushstop fleet of cisterns produced since 1998 has so far saved
around 15800 million cubic meters of water in comparison with traditional flushing systems in 2013 alone the water saved amounted to
1980 million cubic meters this is more than half of the annual consumption of all german households

however the continuous reduction of the ecological footprint of geberit products goes beyond water saving since 2007 geberit has been
implementing the  ecodesign approach this means that concepts are tested in their entirety during a products early development phase in
order to examine how water energy and material consumption in the product and value chain can be optimized at the same time production
processes can often also be simplified and cost savings made thanks to its pioneering work on the topic of ecodesign geberit is well equipped in
terms of possible requirements as envisaged as part of an eu ecodesign directive

 green building has long been more than just a trend european standards in this area are becoming more and more important and new
standards are setting out the basic rules for environmental declarations for individual products and systems in buildings geberit published the first
environmental product declaration for lavatory taps in 2012 and a pilot project for the systematic and simpler development of environmental
declarations and ecological product information was launched in 2013 at the same time more and more buildings are being constructed in
accordance with voluntary sustainability standards such as dgnb minergie breeam and leed investors project developers owners and tenants
are looking for system providers with holistic expertise regarding green building that can contribute to the respective desired standards being
fulfilled in a targeted manner this is opening up a future market with major potential in which geberit is present with watersaving energysaving
lownoise and durable products the group is well positioned as a leading system provider of sanitary solutions in green building and plays an
active role in the relevant associations the importance of the topic is also reflected in the increasing number of green building reference projects in
which geberit products are installed

the gri g3 guidelines serve as the basis for this report an expansion of the materiality analysis for defining report content is planned for 2014 as
part of the switch to the gri g4 guidelines

the gri guidance for defining report content and related principles have been implemented as extensively as possible the basis for
sustainability reporting is a materiality analysis for the identification of those aspects that are of significance for geberit and its stakeholders the
concerns of the stakeholders are addressed in the interactions and dialogs named under  416

all topics classed as significant and related measures are presented in compact form primarily within the  sustainability strategy the aspects of
the 10 principles of the un global compact which geberit has committed itself to uphold and which are presented in the  communication on
progress un global compact are also material in terms of completeness all of the companys economic environmental or social effects that
appear to be of relevance have been included in the reporting based on the gri g3 guidelines insofar as corresponding information was available

objective of the work performed by the external stakeholder panel was to review geberits sustainability strategy and reporting and support
further development this involved analyzing whether the most important topics were included in sustainability reporting and whether the concerns
of the stakeholders were taken into consideration in particular the panel examined the extent to which the principles of inclusivity participation
of stakeholders materiality relevance and significance to stakeholders and responsiveness response to stakeholder issues were considered
in the reporting the results of the stakeholder panel are presented in the  panel statement some recommendations of the panel were already
included in the sustainability reporting for 2012 please also refer to the  response from geberit to the panel statement they also served as a
basis for the further development of the sustainability strategy and reporting for 2013

39 data measurement techniques and bases for calculations

the guidelines and assessment rules of the gri g3 standard were applied wherever the data situation permitted

environmental area

  all relevant environmental and occupational safety data is recorded in a groupwide software program newly implemented in 2012 and analyzed
  within the scope of the corporate ecobalance energy master plan and geberit safety system gss
  the swiss ecological scarcity method 2006 version is used as the assessment method for analyzing the environmental impact see  dmaen
  there are plans in 2014 to switch to the new 2013 version and the most recent data from the ecoinvent database version 30
  the calculation of the relative environmental impact and relative co2 emissions is based on currencyadjusted sales
  the calculation of energy see  en3 and  en4 and greenhouse gas data see  en16 is based on the internationally recognized ecoinvent
  database version 20 and the continental electricity mix for europe the us and china the data covers scope 1 and 2 as well as scope 3 to a
  certain extent as per the ghg protocol see the greenhouse gas protocol ghg initiative  a corporate accounting and reporting standard
  revised edition 2004 of the world resources institute wri and the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd a separate
  life cycle assessment lca was drawn up for the production and use of biogas in pfullendorf de there are plans in 2014 to switch to the most
  recent version of the ecoinvent database version 30 and the national electricity mix
  the calculation of other air emissions see  en19 and  en20 is based on the ecoinvent database version 22 the continental electricity mix
  for europe the us and china and also takes into account specific emission factors for diesel vehicles with particle filters direct emissions
  comprise emissions from the burning of combustibles and fuels as well as the consumption of solvents indirect emissions comprise emissions
  from the production of electricity there are plans in 2014 to switch to the most recent version of the ecoinvent database version 30 and the
  national electricity mix
  since 2010 data on the transport services intercompany and distribution of the most important transport service providers has been recorded
  by the new logistics center in pfullendorf de and the environmental impact calculated along the same lines as the corporate ecobalance in
  addition to direct emissions emissions at the tail pipe the assessment also includes the provision of fuel vehicles and infrastructure the
  ecoinvent database version 21 is used as the basis for the data the system scope has been retained for the 2013 data see  en29
  business flights have been recorded and included in the assessment since 2012 the flight distances are calculated according to the respective
  departure and arrival airports the co2 emissions comprise direct and indirect emissions and are based on the ecoinvent database version 22
  the water footprint calculated since 2012 that covers the entire value chain is a simplified balance sheet based on the ecoinvent database
  version 21 all water flows contained in ecoinvent except for turbine water were taken into account the calculation includes water consumption
  for the provision of raw materials production at geberit use of the manufactured products wc cisterns urinal flush controls and lavatory taps
  during their entire service life and disposal
  the co2 footprint calculated since 2012 is based on the same assumptions as the water footprint emissions from logistics were additionally
  taken into consideration in the usage phase both water consumption energy for water supply and the disposal of nonpolluted waste water and
  energy for the provision of hot water lavatory taps were taken into account

employees area
quantitative data on employees see  employer responsibility la is collected using a central management information system with the

415 basis for selection of stakeholders

systematic dialog with stakeholders helps geberit to identify possible conflict issues and opportunities for further development and to respond to
these in good time at the national and international levels the geberit group and the group companies maintain relations with organizations and
institutions in the respective countries that direct requests and suggestions to the company the stakeholders listed under  414 have been
identified as important for systematic stakeholder dialog as they fulfill one of two criteria either the stakeholder group exerts a strong influence on
the economic environmental or social performance of geberit andor the stakeholder group is strongly affected by the economic environmental or
social performance of geberit


416 approaches to stakeholder engagement

as part of sustainability reporting on the 2012 financial year geberit for the first time initiated and consulted a panel of external stakeholders the
objective of the work performed by the external stakeholder panel was to review geberits sustainability strategy and sustainability reporting this
involved analyzing whether the most important topics were included in sustainability reporting and whether the concerns of the stakeholders were
taken into consideration the results of the stakeholder panel are presented in the  panel statement in the  response from geberit to the
panel statement geberit deals in detail with the external statement and the recommendations contained therein the next stakeholder panel
consultation is due to be carried out in 2014 and is intended to support geberit in identifying key sustainability topics for its reporting in
accordance with gri g4

a stakeholder analysis is performed at all production plants as part of environmental management in accordance with iso 14001 requirements
are recorded situationally in stakeholder dialogs based on this information geberit identifies potential for conflict or opportunities and essentially
pursues a cooperative approach in order to discuss and further develop possible measures with the stakeholders concerned

ec2 financial implications of climate change

climate change is influencing the availability of water resources throughout the world in 2010 the world bank forecast that the adjustment to an
increase in temperature of the global climate of two degrees celsius between 2020 and 2050 would cost between usd 70 and 100 billion per year
20 percent of this is attributable to water supply and flood protection measures the fourth un world water development report published in
2012 underlines the necessity to integrate the topic of water more prominently into global governance in view of the global trends sustainable
water use is essential for ensuring viable social and economic development around the world water is of central importance for nutrition health
the environment the economy and energy production sensible water management therefore calls for crosssector solutions

these trends will determine the sanitary technologies of the future watersaving resourceefficient products will become increasingly important
geberit is taking advantage of the opportunity to meet the growing worldwide demand for watersaving products and to contribute towards the
diligent handling of water thus making a name for itself as a leader in sustainability products classified as special watersaving products already
make a substantial contribution to group sales  business report  business and financial review  sustainability

compared to this relatively big opportunity geberit is exposed to an average risk of natural disasters triggered by climate change which can
fundamentally affect production areas or transport areas none of the production sites is particularly at risk in this respect as geberit does not
operate in the classically energyintensive industries there are currently no special co2 regulations such as statutory emission limitations etc on
the other hand geberit is indirectly affected by higher energy or raw materials prices and by generally increasing requirements in terms of energy
management with its internal energy master plan and the measures related to its co2 strategy see  en18 geberit is reacting proactively and is
working continuously on saving energy improving its energy efficiency and reducing its co2 emissions in this way the company is saving on
energy costs and reducing the risks associated with co2 emissions

as far as corporate risks are concerned the audit committee of the board of directors introduced a comprehensive system for the monitoring and
management of the risks associated with the companys business activities including the risk category co2 emissions see  financial report

intensive support to plumbers and planners see  business report  business and financial review  customers for example this includes the
training of over 3000 planners and plumbers in 2013 on the implementation of new drinking water directives in switzerland furthermore the
education of students and research on sanitary technology and sustainable construction are supported by cooperation with institutions such as
the swiss federal institute of technology eth in zurich ch the university of applied sciences rapperswil ch and tongji university cn

geberit uses its knowhow to set industrywide standards for water conservation and the relief of water and waste water systems for example
geberit actively worked on adapting the applicable standard for the dimensioning of waste water piping to smaller diameters this is important so
that the full functionality of the piping system is ensured even with lower quantities of waste water geberit also supported the launch of well
water efficiency label a product classification system for watersaving and resourceefficient sanitary products that was introduced in 2011

also to be emphasized are the economic impacts on suppliers transport companies and the local economic regions of the production sites the
groups cost of materials in 2013 was chf 5972 million previous year chf 5907 million geberit has relations with a total of more than 1200

6 ecology en

dmaen management approach ecology

geberit has long stood for a high level of environmental awareness and been committed to environmentally friendly resourceefficient production
as well as the development of watersaving and sustainable products environmental criteria are considered in all decisionmaking processes in
addition processes are continuously being optimized so that a proven high standard is achieved which often greatly exceeds legal requirements
geberits environmental principles are defined in the  code of conduct

systematic groupwide environmental management takes center stage this is the remit of the central environment and sustainability department
that reports directly to the ceo guidelines and measures pertaining to all aspects of the gri environmental guidelines are coordinated here since
1992 a network of environmental managers has been practicing active environmental protection at the production plants thus ensuring that the
measures are implemented worldwide for objectives and measures for production see  wwwgeberitcom  sustainability  sustainability
strategy

since the beginning of 2007 geberit has had a  combined group certificate for quality and environment in accordance with iso 9001 and iso
14001 which by now covers all production locations with the exception of the site in india and logistics services this certificate is valid until
2015 the persons in charge at all locations meet at least once every year to exchange experiences and share best practice the most recent
meeting took place in september 2013

the preparation of an annual corporate ecobalance has been an integral part of geberits environmental strategy since 1991 the corporate eco
balance covers 16 production plants worldwide the logistics center in pfullendorf de and the eight largest sales companies the  production
plant in pune india which commenced operations in the second half of 2013 and represents geberits 17th production site across the globe will
be included in the assessment as of 2014 the corporate ecobalance enables an overall assessment of the environmental impact and its largest
contributing factors this makes it possible to calculate the total environmental impact of the geberit group in terms of ecopoints and monitor the
implementation of the environmental targets key figures for environmental impact energy consumption and the co2 emissions triggered by the
transport of geberit products are reported separately the co2 emissions generated by air travel have also been recorded since 2012 in 2013 the
rollout of the integrated management system for quality environment energy and safety was continued at all plants this includes the further
implementation of the software program launched in 2012 for the groupwide monitoring of the corporate ecobalance the energy master plan and
occupational safety among other things this enables energy consumption to be monitored on a monthly basis

the absolute environmental impact for the group declined by 21 in the reporting year previous year decrease of 51 this is explained by
improved electricity efficiency an increase in the share of green electricity and the use of biogas to replace natural gas sales after currency
adjustment grew by 36 in the same period the relative environmental impact with respect to sales currencyadjusted improved by 55 and
exceeded the target figure of 5

detailed key figures on the environmental impact are provided at  key figures sustainability  environment longer time series are now also
provided for individual key figures


en1 materials used

the most important materials for production are plastics metals semifinished and finished products a total of 184216 metric tons of materials
were used in 2013 previous year 177762 metric tons detailed key figures on the use of materials can be found at  key figures sustainability 
environment

for packaging materials used see  en27


en2 percentage of recycled material

when estimating the share of recycled material in production a distinction is made between external and internal sources of raw materials for
reasons of expediency

external sources
the share of recycled material in purchased metals is relatively high the data is based on geberits product life cycle assessments for supply pipes
for buildings 2009 extrapolated the raw material metal purchased contains around 54 or 26000 metric tons of recycled material

with plastics virgin material is primarily used the search for suitable highquality regranulate from external plastic waste is an integral part of
geberits procurement strategy in terms of the material abs a suitable alternative made of 100 recycled material was found this alternative is
based on highquality plastic waste from the electronics industry eg used computer cases according to the supplier the manufacture of this
regranulate consumes over 80 less energy compared to the manufacture of a metric ton of new petrochemicalbased plastic furthermore
between one to three metric tons less co2 are released into the atmosphere depending on the material in 2013 over 350 metric tons of abs
regranulate were used for the mounting frames for concealed cisterns the use of plastic regranulate is to be increased further and applied to other
product areas

internal sources
in terms of the raw material plastic recycled material is primarily generated internally and is ground on site or via a decentralized mill and fed back
into the process the proportion fluctuates depending on the manufacturing process for blow molding it is around 35 for injection molding
around 15 depending on product class and for pipe extrusion around 3 this corresponds to a total of around 7700 metric tons

en3 direct energy consumption

geberit generally uses energy purchased externally the direct energy carriers scope 1 include heating oil extra light natural gas and the fuels
diesel and gasoline consumption of natural gas was increased by 48 previous year reduction of 111 and heating oil consumption was
reduced by 310 previous year reduction of 399 fuel consumption increased slightly by 16 previous year increase of 38

since 2012 a  block heating station has been in use in pfullendorf de this plant was fed by 106 gwh of regionally produced biogas in 2013
the electricity generated by the plant 39 gwh is fed into the transmission grid and the resulting heat 49 gwh can be used in production thereby
substantially reducing the use of natural gas the efficiency of the plant is 82

for detailed key figures on energy consumption see  key figures sustainability  environment


en4 indirect energy consumption

at geberit only electricity consumption is significant for indirect energy consumption scope 2 and it simultaneously represents the greatest
environmental impact in terms of end energy electricity consumption declined by 15 in spite of higher production previous year decrease of
07 the share of purchased green electricity was increased by 1 gwh to 21 gwh in 2013 and now accounts for 19 of total electricity
consumption

since 2012 the group has also been generating electricity in a  block heating station powered by regional biogas in pfullendorf de this
electricity is fed into the transmission grid with this figure amounting to 39 gwh in 2013 furthermore the roof area at the plant in givisiez ch
was made available to an energy services provider in 2013 for the construction of a 3050 m2 photovoltaic system with projected annual electricity
production of 05 gwh however this contribution is not included in the energy balance as the energy produced is managed by the regional energy
supplier

for detailed key figures on electricity consumption and the electricity mix see  key figures sustainability  environment


en5 energy saved

important energysaving measures in production include

  the insulation of buildings
  the continuous modernization of the machine fleet
  increasing the efficiency of production installations
  the optimization of cooling systems through the use of natural ambient cold free cooling
  the improved use of waste heat heat recovery
  the careful use of compressed air

concrete examples show the clear efficiency gains that the reduction in relative energy consumption has been contributing to for years

  the number of injection molding machines retrofitted or purchased new with energyefficient drive technology was increased from 74 to 96 in
  2013 with the two chinese plants in shanghai and daishan benefiting particularly from this development the analysis on site showed that a
  modified machine consumed an average of over 40 less energy this measure enables the chinese plants to save approximately 2 gwh of
  electricity per year
  replacing an old blow molding machine in pfullendorf de with the latest machine technology contributes to a reduction in energy consumption of
  around 06 gwh per year
  a pilot project for the preheating and drying of plastic granulate was started at the same site using the waste heat from the block heating
  station as opposed to additional heating energy enables the plant to save around a further 06 gwh per year
  by carefully planning new buildings the company is also investing in the energyefficient infrastructure of the future the completely  new
  stateoftheart factory premises currently being built in ruše sl are already serving as a role model in all of slovenia in the area of green
  building and production the sites sophisticated holistic energy concept includes the use of all waste heat from industrial processes as well as
  the complete absence of fossil fuels the available ground water is used for cooling while rainwater is collected and used both as fire fighting
  water and for watering the surrounding area

although no quantitative summarized breakdown of energy savings according to the measure implemented is available systematic energy
management has been expanded further in 2013 work commenced on the development of a systematic energy management system at the three
sites in pfullendorf lichtenstein and langenfeld de and preaudits have already been conducted by sqs the certification of these production
plants according to iso 50001 energy management is planned for 2014 within the scope of the existing integrated management system
according to iso 9001 iso 14001 and ohsas 18001

en6 energyefficient products

the biggest environmental contribution by the geberit products lies in the conservation of water which indirectly also saves on energy

  the creation of the infrastructure for drinking water supply and waste water disposal the conveyance processing and distribution of water and
  the subsequent purification of the waste water in a wastewater treatment plant also consume resources and energy according to the ecoinvent
  database version 21 93 mj of energy are required per cubic meter of water and 061 kg of co2 emissions are released reference values for
  europe
  the  water footprint which has been prepared since 2012 covers the entire value chain and shows that almost 100 of water consumption
  occurs during the usage of the products the picture is similar for the co2 emissions around 67 of the total co2 footprint occurs during usage
  the total water savings achieved by geberit products in use throughout the world are impressive according to one model calculation the entire
  dualflush and flushstop fleet of cisterns produced since 1998 has saved around 15800 million cubic meters of water to date in comparison
  with traditional flushing systems in 2013 alone the water saved amounted to 1980 million cubic meters

direct energy savings when using the products are made possible thanks to systematically improved energy efficiency current examples include

  with its simple modern lines and wealth of innovative technology the new  geberit aquaclean sela shower toilet launched in april 2013 is a
  compelling product offering a high level of convenience in adding this model geberit is supplementing its line of shower toilets with a complete
  solution that has been fundamentally redesigned and fits into nearly any style of bathroom the spray functionality which uses aerated water for
  cleaning is the main feature of the new shower toilet enrichment with air not only gives a pleasant feeling of cleanliness but also reduces water
  and energy consumption with the spray intensity at the maximum setting just 05 liters of hot water are required for the entire shower
  procedure this results in around 65 less water consumption and 33 less electricity consumption compared to the top geberit aquaclean
  8000plus model for further information see  business report  business and financial review  innovation
  with the  electronic lavatory taps type 185 and 186 the company has for several years been offering environmentally friendly products for
  public facilities that reduce water consumption the taps which were awarded the top a category by the well water efficiency label ensure
  economical watersaving consumption thanks to their control electronics since spring 2012 a new generator unit has been using the energy of
  the flowing tap water to generate the required electricity thus making the electronic taps independent of mains current or batteries
  the  geberit actuator plate sigma70 which will be launched on the market in 2014 distinguishes itself through its refined elegance and a
  patented servo technology that does not require an external energy source due to its use of pipe pressure thanks to this technology a gentle
  press suffices to trigger the dual flush



en7 reduction of indirect energy consumption

  raw materials the ecodesign workshop in product development generally pursues the approach of using as few materials as possible see
   en6 and  en26 no quantitative analyses on the resulting energy savings are available
  logistics for information on the reduction of energy consumption see  en29
  business trips travel using company vehicles is covered in  en3 as part of the co2 strategy an ambitious fuel reduction plan for new vehicles
  has been defined the emissions caused by business trips by air travel have also been captured and calculated since 2012 for both these figures
  see  en18

this information partially covers the requirements of the gri indicator


en8 water consumption

the  water footprint which covers geberits entire value chain shows that nearly 100 of water consumption is attributable to the use of the
products while the manufacture of the products by geberit accounts for less than 001 of water consumption geberit nevertheless also serves
as a role model with respect to its internal water consumption in production and goes to great lengths to further optimize its processes with
regard to water consumption every year

geberit mainly uses fresh water from the public water system together with well water and rainwater thanks to targeted savings measures the
consumption of fresh and well water has been reduced by nearly 40 since 2006 and is now leveling out at a low level consumption decreased by
35 in 2013 water consumption per sales currencyadjusted has declined by over 50 since 2006 confirming that geberit is on track to meet
its longterm target of reducing consumption by 5 per year

geberit also advocates the economical use of water beyond processes and products this can be seen by its collaboration in the development of
the product classification system  well water efficiency label introduced in 2011 its collaboration within the standard group for the
development of the new iso 14046 water footprint standard and its active role in the dialog with stakeholders on the european ecolabel for wcs

en16 direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions

a comprehensive co2 footprint has been calculated since 2012 the co2 footprint covers the entire value chain  from the provision of raw
materials the manufacturing of products at geberit logistics and use right through to disposal an analysis of the co2 footprint revealed that
product use 67 and the provision of raw materials 21 are by far the largest sources of co2 emissions during product use the provision of
water treatment of waste water and generation of hot water play a central role production by geberit accounts for only 3 of total co2 emissions
in a relative comparison the transport 1 and disposal 8 of the products also cause fewer emissions

co2 emissions are calculated as part of the annual preparation of the corporate ecobalance the six leading substances as per the kyoto protocol
co2 fossil ch4 n2o hfc pfc and sf6 were used for the greenhouse gas emissions and shown as a sum parameter co2 equivalents or simply
co2 the calculation includes both direct emissions scope 1 from the burning of combustibles and fuels see  en3 and indirect emissions
scope 2 resulting from electricity consumption see  en4 the emissions from the preparation of combustibles and fuels in the upstream chain
scope 3 are included in the cumulative value see  en17

key figures on the co2 emissions are available at  key figures sustainability  environment

in absolute terms co2 emissions scopes 1 and 2 decreased by 27 to 69909 metric tons in 2013 previous year 71853 metric tons if one
relates these emissions to sales currencyadjusted there is an improvement of 61 at 75 electricity consumption is by far the largest source
of co2 followed by combustibles and fuels just the purchase of 21 gwh of green electricity in pfullendorf de daishan cn givisiez ch and
weilheim de reduces the co2 emissions by more than 12200 metric tons


en17 other relevant greenhouse gas emissions

other relevant greenhouse gas emissions scope 3 result from

  the provision of combustibles and fuels in  en16 which accounted for some 2000 metric tons of combustibles and around 2250 metric tons
  of fuels in 2013
  the raw materials used and the gray energy purchased along with them this is estimated for the corporate ecobalance and amounted to

en18 initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

under the established  co2 strategy the co2 emissions per sales currencyadjusted should be reduced by 5 per year on average between
2006 and 2015 with an improvement in this key figure of 61 geberit outstripped this annual target in 2013 and is well on track with its strategy
see  en16 in line with the bestinclass approach ambitious longterm goals were drawn up at the end of 2012 based on organic growth co2
emissions should be reduced by 20 by 2020 compared with the base year 2000 in line with the eu target values in addition the share of
combustibles from renewable sources should be increased to 25 and the share of electricity from renewable sources to 60 by 2020

the measures for implementing the co2 strategy are based on the three pillars energy saving increased energy efficiency see  en5 and the
targeted expansion of the share of renewable energy sources an energy master plan is being implemented in the largest plants to manage and
plan energy consumption this provides a forwardthinking illustration of the development of energy consumption and co2 emissions in
switzerland geberit works with the business energy agency and has also obtained corresponding co2 certificates

in 2013 another 2 gwh of certified green electricity was purchased by the largest production plant in pfullendorf de bringing the total for green
electricity to 14 gwh the plan is to increase this by another 3 gwh in 2014 the daishan cn plant purchased around 2 gwh of wind energy in the
reporting year which accounted for around 60 of the plants total energy consumption in addition the plant in givisiez ch converted to 100
green electricity and purchased approximately 46 gwh of green electricity in 2013 in 2013 the consumption of green electricity amounted to 21
gwh previous year 20 gwh renewable energy sources accounted for 31 of total electricity consumption previous year 30 furthermore the
roof area at the plant in givisiez ch was made available to an energy services provider in 2013 for a 3050 m2  photovoltaic instalation with
projected annual electricity production of nearly 05 gwh

the share of renewable energies when it comes to combustibles is also being increased gradually an important milestone was reached in 2012
with the commissioning of the  block heating station in pfullendorf de which was fed by 106 gwh of regionally generated biogas in 2013 this
already brought the share of renewable energies for combustibles to 21 in 2013 target figure 25

the efficiency of the inhouse fleet of vehicles is enhanced with a consistent purchasing policy since early 2008 binding guidelines have applied for
the purchase of new vehicles with the goal of reducing consumption by 10 every three years until 2012 since 2013 this fuel reduction plan for
new vehicles has been increased to 5 per year to reach an emission value of 100 grams of co2km by 2020 as targeted by the eu at the same
time emissionreducing measures are being implemented currently 99 of all geberit diesel vehicles have particle filters

geberit promotes awareness among all employees for the promotion of environmentally friendly behavior new employees receive training on the
subject of sustainability at geberit as part of their job orientation program in the largest plants this is also tailored to the target group of
production employees

the following examples show that considerable progress was made in the past few years in weilheim de the manufacturing waste was reduced
by 80 in five years mainly through the use of a new foaming facility this pioneer project was tested and implemented in several stages central
aspects include the use of rainwater for cleaning which is then added to the foaming process as process water and optimized cleaning cycles to
prevent residues in the plant

en26 mitigation of environmental impact of products

the basis for sustainable products is a systematic innovation process in which the most environmentally friendly materials and functional principles
possible are chosen risks are minimized and a high level of resource efficiency is targeted for the production process as well as the product itself
 ecodesign workshops in which different disciplines cooperate and ensure that every new product exceeds its predecessor in environmental
aspects are an integral part of the early development phase

specially created product life cycle assessments are important decisionmaking tools for development and provide arguments for the use of
resourceefficient products detailed life cycle assessments have already been prepared for the following products drainagesupply pipes
aquaclean 8000plus electronic lavatory taps type 185186 concealed cisterns and urinal flush control an environmental product declaration
epd was issued in accordance with the new european standard en 15804 for the first time in 2012 the  epd for lavatory taps provides
relevant comparable and verified information about the products environmental performance new ways of more efficiently creating product life
cycle assessments and epds for other products are currently being sought a pilot project for the systematic recording of environmental data at
the product level was therefore started which should greatly simplify a further processing to epds and ecological product information this further
supports the visible positioning of the company as a provider of system solutions in the area of green building examples from the product range
that help to reduce the environmental impact

  since 2011 a new technological solution has been deployed to simplify the conversion of the large flush volume on nearly all concealed cisterns
  from 6 or 9 liters to 45 liters the gradual conversion of the product range is creating great potential for even more water conservation
  the new well water efficiency label which was introduced by the european umbrella organization for valve manufacturers eunited in 2011 and
  which determines the water efficiency of products in line with the european energy label provides more transparency in the area of water
  conservation see also  pr3 of the eight geberit product groups already certified seven are represented in the a one in the b class these
  product groups account for around 20 of group sales
  swift implementation of the european drinking water directive 9893ec which is valid as of december 1 2013 and defines a maximum allowable
  lead concentration in drinking water in 2013 geberit adapted all components made of copper materials that come into contact with drinking
  water  some 1800 products  to the new requirements and did so ahead of time thus ensuring that customers with geberit products are on the
  safe side
  the geberit sovent fitting which facilitates an optimal layout of waste water discharge stacks in highrises was streamlined and optimized
  thanks to the leading knowhow of geberits flow specialists the new flowoptimized fitting causes the water to rotate in the discharge stack
  which creates a continuous column of air in the center this ensures optimum pressure compensation and increases the discharge rate by 40
  while at the same time taking up less space and using 45 less material the sovent fitting also permits the use of relatively smallsized
  discharge stacks even in very high buildings
  since 2010 ecodesign has also been included in product modifications and technology projects thus ensuring that opportunities to reduce the
  ecological footprint are always utilized to their full potential from the end of 2013 the elements for wcs urinals and washbasins will receive new
  halogenfree protecting hoses for the threaded rods by replacing around 67 million hoses 110 metric tons of polyvinyl chloride pvc can be
  replaced by 35 metric tons of environmentally friendly polyethylene pe

advances in the reduction of the environmental impact were not only made at product level but also with regard to product information from
2013 the user manuals for the shower toilet will only be provided to the main markets in five instead of 22 languages this change which was
initiated by environmentally conscious customers is very effective as it reduces paper consumption by some 19 metric tons per year

en29 environmental impact of transport

in the area of logistics in addition to cost effectiveness and punctuality it is increasingly important to customers that transport services be as
environmentally friendly as possible geberit does not maintain its own fleet of vehicles because external logistics equates to around 35 of the
geberit groups total environmental impact production plants and sales companies collaboration with the transport service providers that work
with geberit is central partners agree to actively support geberit in its efforts to use energy and packaging material efficiently and to reduce
emissions and undertake to provide the data needed for geberits environmental reporting

the logistics calculator developed in 2010 facilitates the capture of data on the vehicle fleet composition transportation performance and fuel
consumption of all transport service providers as well as the preparation of the annual ecobalance in the reporting year the twelve largest
transport service providers handled 1766 million tonkilometers previous year 1697 million tonkilometers this generated 27483 metric tons
of co2 emissions previous year 26883 metric tons the increase in transport services and co2 emissions was mainly caused by the increase in
sales and the related increase in transport volumes the share of euro 5 vehicles remains high at 87 euro 6 vehicles compulsory for new vehicles
from january 1 2014 were also used for the first time as a result euro 5 and euro 6 vehicles account for a total of nearly 90 of the entire truck
fleet

another important step in reducing the environmental impact is switching from road to rail for instance 80 of the goods transported from italy
and 50 of those transported to italy are moved by train the use of  megatrailers which can carry an approximately 15 greater load volume
also increases energy efficiency in 2013 about 1350 such transport runs previous year 1280 between rapperswiljona ch and pfullendorf de
and around 800 transport runs previous year 800 between pottenbrunn at and pfullendorf de were completed in this way this translates into a
reduction of 134000 kilometers compared with conventional transport runs as a result diesel consumption was reduced by 39900 liters and
co2 emissions were lowered by 164 metric tons geberit is also working on innovative solutions aimed at enabling a higher goods per truck ratio 
ie increasing capacity utilization of the transport volume

furthermore the pilot project with an  environmentally friendly natural gas truck running between pfullendorf de and rapperswiljona ch
commenced at the end of 2013 this pioneering project is being conducted in collaboration with a transport service provider and a truck
manufacturer

7 employer responsibility la

dmala management approach to employer responsibility

responsibility for all important aspects of the gri guidelines with respect to labor practices at the geberit group lies with the head corporate
human resources who reports directly to the ceo

geberits most important ambassadors are its employees they shape the companys image and represent geberit in their daytoday contact with
customers and many other stakeholders this task can only be performed by employees who are aware of what their company stands for and what
its objectives are geberits central corporate and brand values are defined in the  geberit compass geberit aims to act as a role model for
ethically unimpeachable environmentally friendly and socially responsible operations the  code of conduct fills this objective with tangible
content and to this end serves as an authoritative source of guidance the code applies worldwide and is available on the intranet in 14 languages
revision of the code was started in 2013 and will be completed in 2014

a fundamental goal is to reinforce the performance culture increase transparency and promote talent the standardized global performance
assessment development and compensation process pdc started in 2012 was therefore continued remuneration policies are based on
standardized job assessments and salary levels for the relevant country a central element of the process is that several supervisors assess the
performance development and salary of an employee together the process is concluded with a feedback interview between the employee and
their direct supervisor a total of around 1000 employees or 15 of the entire workforce are involved in this pdc process

the priority in terms of internal employee communications is for interactive realtime communication that is accessible to all the intranet
introduced in 2009 plays a central role here special solutions have been developed for production employees in the form of newsletters andor
large screens for joint use the ceo albert m baehny regularly informs the employees of the current state of the business the economic
parameters the future prospects and general topics of interest in videos that are accessible on the intranet as well as via electronic newsletters
the  geberit integrity line that was designed in 2012 and launched on january 1 2013 enables all employees to anonymously report internal
irregularities in their mother tongue 35 languages thereby making an important contribution towards the upholding of high compliance standards
within the group there were no significant incidents in 2013 the few registered complaints were all dealt with and issues were cleared up swiftly

geberit has formulated the vision of an accidentfree company to meet the groups ambitious standards the objective is to reduce the accident
frequency rate afr and accident severity rate asr by 5 per year and thus by 50 between 2010 and 2020 for this purpose a comprehensive
master plan for occupational safety including a package of measures for the period 2013 to 2015 has been developed and adopted this will be
implemented and checked as part of the geberit safety system gss the basis for the monitoring is the monthly recording of all accidents from
january 1 2013 onward important elements of the geberit safety system include a vision safety policy and sitespecific safety principles as well
as the definition of rules in the event of breaches the development of a suitable organization structure awarenessraising and training as well as
the planning of regular internal and external audits the geberit safety system is to be integrated into the geberit management system by mid
2014 and all production plants including logistics are to be certified according to ohsas 18001 in combination with iso 900114001 by mid
2016 the two chinese production plants have been certified according to ohsas 18001 since 2009 the sales company in the uk since 2010 the
production plant in givisiez ch since 2011 and the plant in pottenbrunn at since 2013

the ability to win and retain the right employees for the company is becoming more and more important for the future employer branding is a
component of superordinate corporate branding and creates a unique employer identity geberit continued the rollout of its employer branding
concept in 2013 and intensified its presence at job fairs in particular in doing so geberit sharpened its profile as a company that offers attractive
international development opportunities at the interface between the craft engineering and sales sectors

effectively worked in 2013 these amounted to 10661572 hours previous year 10680389 hours the statistics show only those occupational
accidents that occur during working hours or business travel and lead to lost working time of more than one day a total of 109 accidents were
recorded previous year 125 accidents equivalent to 1325 lost working days due to occupational accidents previous year 2164 lost working
days there were no serious or fatal accidents employees at geberit are not exposed to a particularly significant extent with regard to
occupational illnesses this category is therefore not covered

furthermore the accident frequency rate afr and the accident severity rate asr are recorded in a standardized manner these rates are
calculated as the number of accidents or the number of lost working days per one million hours worked the afr was 102 previous year 117 the
asr dropped significantly to 1243 previous year 203 geberit is therefore back on track with regard to its longterm objective of reducing the
frequency and severity of accidents by 5 per year or by 50 between 2010 and 2020

la14 genderbased differences in salaries

protection of the principles of equality is anchored in the  geberit code of conduct this includes the prohibition of discrimination against any
employee on the basis of gender according to the annual binding survey of all geberit group companies no differences between the basic salaries
of women and men exist anywhere within the group fair and equal pay for women and men is guaranteed as follows

  determination of salaries primarily according to function evaluated in accordance with the proven hay method a score is calculated based on
  the assessment criteria knowhow problemsolving and accountability the resulting number of points is the basis for determining the salary
  this guarantees fair salary structures irrespective of gender
  binding wage agreements with set pay grades at many geberit sites
  an indepth investigation carried out at four production companies in 2011 revealed no differences between the salaries of men and women the
  investigation covered the pay levels of production employees within an established site in employeefriendly germany at a production site of
  many years standing in slovenia and at the two chinese sites where employee protection and fair wages are largely the responsibility of the
  company itself

8 human rights hr

dmahr management approach to human rights

in terms of information the promotion of awareness and controlling human rights issues related to the business activities of the geberit group are
the responsibility of corporate human resources for internal topics equal treatment freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
and of corporate purchasing with regard to procurement practices

the  geberit code of conduct is authoritative in the area of human rights among other things stipulating the exclusion of child and forced labor
compliance with the code of conduct is monitored as part of a binding annual survey of all geberit group companies

longterm cooperation reciprocal commitment sustainability and social responsibility are important guidelines for geberit these acquire
particular importance in the procurement of raw materials semifinished products finished products and services the high standards with respect
to fair business practices environmental protection and safe working conditions are therefore also expected from suppliers the  code of
conduct for suppliers applies to all geberit suppliers worldwide verification is the responsibility of corporate purchasing

with respect to measures and objectives regarding the code of conduct and procurement see also  wwwgeberitcom  sustainability 
sustainability strategy


hr1 human rights aspects in investment agreements

there are no significant investment agreements which include human rights clauses or which have been audited in terms of human rights aspects
agreements with suppliers include human rights clauses which must be audited and upheld by geberit suppliers see  hr2


hr2 screening of suppliers with regard to human rights aspects

with respect to human rights violations the greatest risk lies with suppliers who can only be influenced indirectly geberit does all it can to
minimize this risk and requires its business partners and suppliers to comply with comprehensive standards above all with respect to consistent
environmental protection socially acceptable working conditions and fair business practices

at the end of 2007 a  code of conduct for suppliers was introduced for the first time which is geared among other things to the principles of
the united nations global compact upon request by geberit the supplier must prepare corresponding records in order to demonstrate
compliance with the standards of the code and make these available at any time should the supplier fail to comply with the regulations set out in
this code then corrective measures are taken wherever possible failure to comply on the part of the supplier is regarded as a serious obstacle to
the continuation of the business relationship if the supplier does not correct this noncompliance geberit can terminate the cooperation as of the
end of 2013 701 suppliers had signed the code of conduct previous year 671 this is equivalent to 95 of the total procurement value previous
year 95 thereby meeting the target value of 95 for 2013 among the top 200 suppliers the share of companies that have signed is 99
previous year 99 the code of conduct is binding for each new supplier

in the interests of the systematic planning and performance of audits which are generally conducted every three years the existing risk
management approach was further developed in 2012 based on the division of suppliers into risk classes  depending on production location
country and production processes in the reporting year 40 companies were identified in the highest risk category this is equivalent to less than
5 of the entire procurement value to ensure neutrality and the expertise required for the audits geberit also works with an external partner in
china the carrying out of audits by independent experts has proven effective performing such audits makes an important contribution to
enhancing credibility in supplier management any shortcomings exposed by audits give rise to sanctions as a rule a deadline is imposed for
remedying the situation for example shortcomings were revealed at three chinese suppliers in 2013 primarily in the areas of occupational safety
working hours and remuneration action plans were agreed upon with these three companies the implementation of which will be checked and
demanded during a reaudit in 2014

only in a few justified exceptional cases are there plans to impose complete regulations on the second tier and third tier in the supply chain by
getting them to sign a code of conduct as this would result in a disproportionately high level of additional administration with little added benefit
geberit pursues a pragmatic yet effective approach when auditing suppliers in the highest risk category an analysis of their most important
suppliers is included in the risk analysis and the audit investigations on site at the end of the day geberits goal is modern supplier management
where the relationship with the supplier is actively managed and sustainability risks in the supply chain are jointly analyzed

hr3 human rights training for employees

with media such as training films developed especially for this all employees worldwide have access to the code of conduct via the intranet in

association or collective bargaining as defined in the ilo core labor standards are subject to restriction at the geberit group

categorically rejected according to the annual binding groupwide survey there were no cases of child labor revealed in 2013 there were likewise
no such cases arising during the audits carried out at suppliers the basic principles set out in the code of conduct for suppliers explicitly include
compliance with the ilo core labor standards for the exclusion of child labor

hr8 human rights training for security personnel

at its production sites in europe the us and china geberit is not confronted with the need for special security measures that increase the risk of
human rights violations to date this problem has therefore not been relevant to geberit within the scope of its global activities


hr9 violation of rights of indigenous peoples

to date this problem has not been relevant to geberit within the scope of its global activities
