        caring for older adults

        i was introduced to a grace place an adult day care center that provides respite for caregivers
        and a community for the people who attend  we partner with a grace place to do a number of
        activities we have carved pumpkins had an ice cream social and worked with the clients one
        onone to do holiday shopping we played bingo we have danced and sang carols together
        my favorite experience is handing out the presents to them at their holiday party the look in
        their eyes to receive a new robe or socks or a book is priceless they have been a recipient
        of our angel tree and the enjoyment of seeing wishes come true right in front of your eyes is a
        moving experience  they have truly captured my heart

         a message from
         genworths volunteer of the year
                                            volunteering has been something that ive been passionate about
                                            for quite some time now and genworth has been instrumental in my
                                            volunteer efforts genworth is a company thats just as passionate
                                            as i am about giving back to the community one of our values at
                                            genworth is heart  and i see it everyday through our volunteer
                                            activities whether its the smile on my mentees face when she gets the
                                            math question right or the high five from a participant who just finished
                                            in first place at the special olympics swim meet

                                    where we live in richmond virginia i get to mentor kids through the
              linda hall            big brothers big sisters organization  in the summer time i recruit
         genworth employee          volunteers for the special olympics swim meet  around the fall
                                    through project homeless connect i get to work with a homeless
        person and connect them to nonprofits in hopes they find housing a job and so much more
        locally im able to help oneonone with so many organizations  but with genworth i am also
        able to help in a collective impactful way through our annual united way campaign  powered in
        part by the genworth foundations contribution i figured that if im lucky to have a great support
        system that i should pay it forward and use the opportunity to help others and their families

        in 2013 i had my first child a baby boy my husband and i had help and support from our family
        members friends and community not everyone is lucky enough to have the circle of support
        that we have in raising our child that is why its even more important to me to give back to the
        community and help those organizations that focus on families in need reach out give back
        have fun
