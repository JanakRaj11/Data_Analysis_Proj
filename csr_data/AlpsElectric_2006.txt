aiming to achieve corporate growth and
harmony with the earth
  i believe that when companies conduct business in the future what should be foremost in their
minds is harmony with the earth as it turns the earth is carrying an infinite number of living
creatures of all sizes including 65 billion people the earth is a spaceship floating in space from which
we cannot disembark and transfer to another and its crew members mission is to sustain the ship for
the ages to come the earths resources are limited as are the number of places to where hazardous
substances can be disposed of so it is only natural that the crew members are obliged to reduce these
substances that are being discharged daily all corporate activities should also be seen as issues
related to the entire globe or spaceship earth if every individual human and company cooperated in
tackling such issues as the environment food energy and various disputes from this spaceship earth
perspective we would have a peaceful and smooth journey in order to maintain our spaceship in good
condition we the crew members must play our part
  meanwhile companies have to grow through their business activities i believe that what is most
important in balancing the need for protecting the environment with corporate growth is a
management system designed to achieve harmony with the earth therefore achieving corporate social
responsibility

passing on our founding spirit
  we shall create topquality products always remembering to contribute to society since our
foundation we have progressed with the philosophy that a company is a social entity that has an
obligation to contribute to society this is included in our company precepts and we abide by it in our
managerial practices
  the alps group finds its corporate social responsibility csr origins in this very founding spirit
which has also become our foundation in implementing business activity we recognize that it is very
important to have a common corporate philosophy of social contribution at all of our business locations
around the world
  i believe that the globalization of our group is manifested in smooth communication that goes
beyond the many races languages and national boundaries as well as in the sharing of alpsism 
our groups unique corporate culture
  with this as the groups background our basic policy on group management states as entailed in
our founding spirit the alps group shall work to improve its enterprise value as a whole and
contribute to societies by creating new values that satisfy stakeholders and are friendly to the earth
through close collaboration and collective strengths of group companies while acknowledging their
autonomous nature
  our aim is that each and every employee at all of our business locations around the world maintains
a high level of awareness and contributes to society particularly in environmental preservation as a
member of spaceship earth not only at work but in their communities and homes as well


                                                                                            alps csr report 2006   4

                              csr committee chairman




        integrating our corporate and csr plans
           in an eu white paper issued by the european commission csr is defined as a concept whereby
        companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their
        interactions with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis in other words csr aims to promote a
        balance between corporate growth and social accountability exemplified by action to further the
        stability of the global environment this description really questions corporate philosophy and refers to
        management itself
           the alps group launched its 5th midterm business plan in april 2006 as the person responsible
        for csr i decided to integrate that management plan with the promotion of csr


        our founding spirit alps precepts the origin of csr management
           in order to draw up our csr midterm plan we formed an internal working group in january 2006
        and began deliberation by defining csr of the alps group
           during that process we found that societal contribution a concept that exemplified the spirit of the
        time of our foundation was clearly mentioned in the alps precepts we were reminded that social
        contribution had been the basis of our management system from the time of our foundation to the
        present day and decided to consider csr as the starting point for alps group management


        promoting csr as the alps group
            in drawing up alps groups csr objectives and establishing a system to promote csr we placed a
        great deal of importance on group management the alps group encompasses alps electric alpine




5   alps csr report 2006

electronics and alps logistics and consists of 45000 employees these 45000 employees make up one
alps the importance of csr must be perceived equally among group companies and our objectives
will never be reached until all employees are aware of the groups social responsibility
  at the same time these days new management issues are arising such as how to deal with
corporate law internal controls compliance and establishing risk management systems however
detailed investigation revealed that these issues all related to elements of csr so we decided that
ultimately they would comprise csr promotion initiatives we had a strong conviction that we would
be able to promote group management with csr as the keyword


setting ones own objectives and aiming to conduct daily csr activities
  the most salient characteristic of our csr midterm plan is the fact that representatives from each
department established their own objectives representatives from sales development and
management departments thought about the nature of csr issues in their department and held
discussions in the end production line and sales departments decided on the objectives for alps core
businesses and corporate departments decided on the objectives for management
  there were some objectives consistent with profit making and others that seemed at first to be
incompatible with shortterm profit therefore it is not possible to attain such objectives without a
keen awareness of the necessity for social responsibility
  fiscal 2006 is the initial year of csr for alps first of all based on the 20062008 csr mid  term
plan the csr committee will thoroughly enlighten the employees as to why the alps group is
promoting csr then each employee at all of our business locations around the world will gain an
awareness of their company as a social entity when they begin to carry out their daily work whilst
having the idea of harmony with the earth in mind our company would truly have accomplished csr

           alps electric s csr midterm plan
           the planning process
                at alps electric fiscal 2006 has been determined the first year of csr the company integrated the
              csr activities that had been conducted separately by each business location and division and worked
              on the 5th midterm business plan fy2006fy2008 from the perspective of csr the sections
              below present the process according to which the members of the working group formed in january
              2006 discussed csr initiatives and laid out the plan


     fulfilling the expectations of society and customers
       society is demanding that companies practice increasingly integrated csr management among customers such
     as set manufacturers and automobile manufacturers an increasing number of companies are adopting csr
     promotion as a criterion for procuring products and services including green procurement which requires
     environmental awareness in the manufacturing process
       responding to this social trend alps decided to start drawing up its csr midterm plan  a concrete plan to
     promote integration of csr management



     foundation for alps csr
       the foundation for laying out this csr midterm plan was the company precepts of alps electric see p6 in
    1958 ten years after the companys establishment the precepts were created to hand the founding spirit down
    from generation to generation societal contribution and confidence building cited in the precepts created about
    50 years ago represent exactly the spirit of todays csr
      we have launched this plan based on the idea that the starting point of our csr initiatives can be found in
    company activity thus far  we are not starting from scratch


     formation of a csr working group
       the csr working group was formed in january 2006 for the csr plan we needed to determine how to build
    relations of mutual trust with a variety of stakeholders in order to consider our relations with a wide range of
    stakeholders from as wide a perspective as possible we selected 20 representatives from ten departments including
    sales and marketing human resources materials control environmental planning corporate treasury and public
    relations

 laying out the csr midterm plan
   first of all the working group members formulated a stakeholder definition making sure that there were no
omissions of stakeholders related to alps see pp910
   subsequently they examined and analyzed first what alps is expected to do second what it is currently
responding to and third what it will need to satisfy in terms of sociality environment and management this
procedure was completed by the departments that have close relationships with each group of stakeholders for
example shareholders and investors were assigned to the corporate treasury department and company
members and their families to the human resources department
   while progress was smooth for domestic production bases the working group found it difficult to grasp the
situations of overseas production bases this was due to lack of information about the way csr activities were
conducted at these bases nevertheless csr is a worldwide movement and in the near future all our business
locations around the world will need to respond to this trend this prediction led the group members to a realization
that each business location needs to quickly investigate its current situation and clarify its tasks and they decided
to draw up a plan accordingly
   moreover the working group discussed ways of coordinating the alps group as a whole aiming to undertake alps
groupwide activities in the future the present midterm plan however applies to alps electrics domestic locations
and overseas affiliates alps electric global
   next the working group discussed the structure for promoting csr initiatives in this discussion it was confirmed
that it was necessary to establish a structure that allowed the company to respond flexibly to diverse requests from
stakeholders as a result the group set up a multifunctional highly flexible general subcommittee group and
global governance within the csr committee rather than many smaller subcommittees
   in addition the group members confirmed that each business location had officers in charge of personnel legal
matters compliance resources quality assurance and environment services it was surmised that using these
officers as a network to promote csr would accelerate alps electric groups csr campaign


the first year of the csr campaign
   the 20062008 csr midterm plan drawn up through the above discussion was launched in april 2006 the first
year of alps csr campaign to fulfill the expectations of customers and society and to continue to be a reliable and
trustworthy corporation alps employees will join forces to aggressively undertake the campaign some of the targets
set in the plan will take a long time to accomplish however by achieving the targets one at a time in the way the
company has done so far alps is determined to promote steady csr activity

             the 20062008 csr midterm plan is the initial step for alps electric groups csr campaign the
          plan was drawn up through discussions held by a working group composed of 20 representatives from
          csrrelated departments from the perspective of all stakeholders expectations we analyzed the
          current business practices of the company and consequently decided to prioritize areas that did not
          fulfill these expectations we set three year targets for the plan aiming to achieve fulfillment in all
          areas every individual employee from corporate and all other departments will play their part in
          promoting alps csr based upon this midterm plan

 system in fiscal 2000 in accordance with the ministry of the                          and groundwater
 environment guidelines to monitor its environmental costs                               the economic benefits2 derived in fiscal 2005 increased
 and associated economic benefits                                                     from those in fiscal 2004 due to higher profit from sales of
   the investments and expenditures for fiscal 2005                                    materials as a result of increased production
