  relationship with our business partners

collaboration with our business partners
  for assuring the quality of our products
many of the companys products are manufactured at the
suppliers factories for this reason the cooperation of
suppliers in such areas as furnishing reliable data is
indispensable for assuring the quality of our products
     prior to starting business with any new supplier the
company audits it in accordance with the requirements of
the iso9001 system these audits examine 65 items
including environmentrelated items a supplier must score
above the standardset minimum points in order to be
qualiﬁed separately the company audits its suppliers and
provides guidance to them as necessary based on
environment and quality audit forms that are provided by its
customers in particular suppliers that are subject to many
complaints are regarded as suppliers requiring intensive
management and have quality improvement staff assigned
exclusively to them in an effort to carry out quality
improvement activities together with such suppliers
     since ﬁscal 2006 we have held quality study meetings                                                         japanese only

  according to the environmental policy for example in the ﬁeld of waste
  we strictly enforce the separation of paper upon disposal in an effort to
  reduce unnecessary waste each and every employee has two garbage
                                                                                                            motion detector

  and the other for nonpaper waste paper disposed of separately is

  strictly enforce duplex printing printing on both sides of copy paper we     san diego ofﬁce
  even have a dedicated printer for printing on the reverse side of copy paper
  other than the printer for printing on new paper
       we also make energy saving efforts the book vault and the
  warehouse have a motion detector installed which is set to automatically
  turn off the lights when no one is in there we also make sure that lights in
  the kitchen and the hotwater service room are turned off when not in use
       we are always looking for new innovative ideas to make further
  improvements we have started making efforts to use glasses instead of
  paper cups which is our next goal the possibilities of environmental
  preservation activities are inﬁnite we will continue to promote such
  activities
