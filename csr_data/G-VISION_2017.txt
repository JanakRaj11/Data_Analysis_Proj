                  the electricity consumed by the group was 1114216 kwh contributing to 60168 tonnes
                  of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions currently the group mainly uses compact
                  fluorescent light bulbs cfl which was part of the groups energy saving initiatives in
                  recent years the group has been replacing all broken light bulbs with led lights to further
                  maximize energy conservation employees are trained to switch off lights and air
                  conditioners for vacant areas regular maintenance also helps to improve the
                  energyefficiency level of the groups airconditioning and refrigeration systems thus
                  reducing the consumption of electricity in the long run

            equivalent emissions the operation of restaurants requires the use of water for food processing
            and cleaning purposes to maximize water saving the group has implemented certain water
            conservation measures low flow fixtures were installed to control water flow from the main
            switch employees are trained to turn off all water taps when they are not in use water pipes are

3     the environment and natural resources
       the group realizes that the restaurant and the office operations have continuously consume
       energy resources and inevitably led to certain extent of gas and waste emissions which ultimately
       have a negative impact on the environment in view of the risks associated with the pollution and
       the global warming effect the group is committed to promote environmental protection
       awareness and to minimize its environmental impact more ecofriendly work practices and
       policies are introduced and implemented in the groups daytoday operation with the aim to
       achieve a higher standard in the work of energy saving and emission reduction
