limitations
the process an organisation adopts to define gather and report data on its nonfinancial performance is not
subject to the formal processes adopted for financial reporting therefore data of this nature is subject to
variations in definitions collection and reporting methodology with no consistent accepted standard this may
result in noncomparable information between organisations and from year to year within an organisation as
methodologies develop

the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed in the report are subject to inherent limitations
given their nature and the methods for determining calculating or estimating such information our
independent assurance report should therefore be read in connection with the gri guidelines

a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters
that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement accordingly we do not express an audit
opinion

conclusion
based on our work conducted as above nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that

  the report of arcelormittal kryvyi rih for the year ended 31 december 2016 does not adhere to gri
   guidelines with respect to the principles of materiality stakeholder inclusiveness sustainability context
   and completeness

  the disclosures in the report do not adhere to gri g4 option core criteria and that the gri content
   index as included on pages 4044 of the report is not appropriate

  the selected indicators marked with a  on page 37 of the report and enumerated above are
   not presented fairly in all material aspects in accordance with gri guidelines
