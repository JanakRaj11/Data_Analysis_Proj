ancient zinc mining
          zinc mining is not new in india among the old
          workings for zinc in india the zawar complex of
          rajasthan in western india is the most famous
          though old workings are seen in rampura agucha as
          well as rajpura dariba impressively abundant traces
          of old workings extend all over the 25 km mining
          belt and go down to a depth of 90 m below surface

          the zawarmala mine at zawar is an ancient mine
          which as per radio carbon dating is over 2500 years
          old the ancient retorts can still be seen while going
          towards zawar mines as a tribute to this natural
          history of zinc mining at zawar hindustan zinc
          decided to showcase its history through an exhibition
          and built a site called ancient mining and smelting
          heritage which was inaugurated by
          mr tom albanese ceo of the vedanta group




          though the zinc mining in india dates back to over
          2500 years old and the retorts of ancient mining can
          still be seen at zawar about 45 km from udaipur the
          zinc as a metal has not been much known or utilized in
          india we are still exploring the new areas where zinc
          could add value to consumers and also add to the
          gdp of the country

     identifying material issues

     materiality assessment is the new tool for strategizing
     sustainability of businesses it is the process of defining
     the aspects that are of highest importance to the
     stakeholders and the management of a company the
     materiality assessment process requires engagement
     with various stakeholders to get an understanding of the
     aspects that they think are important to them and can
     impact them at the same time it is also important to
     have the perspective of the management on aspects
     relevant to sustainability

     approach to materiality
     the materiality assessment process at hindustan zinc
     was a part of the preparation of the sustainability report
     201516 we engaged with an external consultant to
     conduct the materiality assessment process our
     approach involved a 7step sequential materiality process
     that helped us to identify and prioritize key sustainability
     issues for the reporting period the criteria applied when
     selecting material issues included the relevance of the
     issue to the relevance to the stakeholders the
     finalization of the materiality matrix was drawn on
     several internal sources and external sources

     safety excellence journey aarohan

       in 2013 hindustan zinc associated with dupont to enhance
       safety culture and inculcate a behavior of safety amongst our
       workforce we had two main goals
       a zero harm through the transformation of safety culture
       b achieving excellence in safety standards

       we named the initiative aarohan  the journey of stepping up
       towards safety excellence our employees and contractors
       were also partners in this initiative since we believe that safety
       is every individuals responsibility our operations can achieve
       the vision of zero harm only when our employees take
       responsibility for their own safety and safety of those working
       witharound them

       this initiative helped us to reorganize our safety architecture
       and frame our safety management design based on safety
       management evaluation and safety perception survey

       the journey of aarohan has succeeded in demonstrating visible
       felt leadership with the line management proactively taking
       accountability and responsibility for safety and developing a
       belief that all injuries are preventable through this aarohan
       journey weve noticed significant improvement in the following
       areas
       ÿ reporting of leading indicators
       ÿ reduction in incident rate
       ÿ improvement in quality of incident investigation
       ÿ increased active employee participation  in safetyrelated activities and campaigns
       ÿ enhancement in standardisation of systems and skill development etc

       all this has successfully inculcated a positive safety behaviour as employees have made identification of risks
       an integral part of their work activities we attribute this positive move to the conscious efforts weve made
       towards safety through aarohan

       contractor safety management
       contractors play a key role in our business and were focused on fostering contractor awareness on safety
       theyre actively involved in aligning to the safety behaviour and implementing improvements to ensure safe
       working places right from contractor selection till job completion our contractors are obliged to work in
       accordance to our safety standards and systems for which they are provided the necessary safety induction
       and refresher trainings from the moment they associate with us weve made their participation in all our
       safety campaigns and awareness drives mandatory additionally we have prepared comprehensive elearning
       modules for contractors a contractor score card system has also been introduced which is tracked on a
       regular basis to evaluate their safety performance contractor field safety audits are also conducted
       periodically to improve their safety standards

                                before all else

                  mikhail sonam geotechnical engineer rampura agucha underground mines shares
                  his experience
                  risk in mining is usually viewed through the lens of likelihood and the consequence of a hazard dealing
                  with hazards is a reactive approach in the mining environment however identifying old  new potential
                  hazards assessing their likelihoods and consequences and finally rectifying the same to eliminate the risk is a
                  new and proactive approach

                  and it is this approach which we are implementing at the rampura agucha underground mine from
                  immediate near miss  incident investigations systematic root cause analyses all the way to effective
                  implementation of systems  procedures are ensured here reporting of unsafe works and conditions are
                  appreciated just as much as doing work safely one can observe here the attitude to strive towards
                  understanding issues and improving standards and all these factors make raug a safer place to work

                  nowadays the first question asked in every meeting is how safe was our
                  previous day of operations rather than how much developmentproduction
                  did we achieve on the previous day we know now that the senior leadership
                  cares about the safety of each and every worker working with us clearly the
                  management believes in safety before all else

this is based around the advice of global health authorities who recommend a minimum of 10000
steps a day this 100day virtual race with a target of 10000 steps per day was launched by the
company for our employees and their spouses each of them received a step kit that included a
pedometer to be worn through the waking hours so that steps taken by the individual could be

case study

acrophobia testing

    one of our safety programs involves testing workers for acrophobia fear of height an acrophobia
    testing facility was created to check whether a worker is fit to work at height

    the testing facility has a walking bay of 300 mm width 7 meter length and 5 meter height the same is
    accessed through staircases a person is asked to walk with fall protection on this walking bay the test is
    performed in presence of a medical practitioner who interviews each worker to check whether he has any
    complaints of fear giddiness vomiting or other issues while ascending descending or working at height

    workers who are confident are asked to walk on the structure which is provided with a fall protection
    arrangement the workers are monitored before and after walking on the structure for pulse rate and
    blood pressure workers who clear the test are allowed to work at height while those who fail to clear it or
    have hypertension are given work at the ground level

sindesar khurd mine as well as enhanced recovery
refined metal production was higher than mined metal
production due to conversion of existing mined metal
inventory and enhanced smelter efficiencies

case study

exploration excellence adding more than we deplete

   we at hindustan zinc since inception have championed the cause of exploration as being integral to our
   mining operations and as a result high quality projects have been added to our portfolio at regular intervals
   the glaring example is rampura agucha the largest and lowest cost leadzinc mines in the world the finite
   life of this massive reserve is continuously extended by successful exploration programmes undertaken by
   our extremely motivated exploration team the team adopts innovative drilling technologies and stateof
   theart software packages for revealing the story of the depths

   the first major drilling innovation dates back to 2005 when modern wire line diamond drill rigs were
   introduced these rigs had faster drilling speeds than the conventional types commonly used in india at that
   time usage of these drill rigs enhanced daily productivity by 57 times per rig facilitating rapid evaluation of
   the deposit the second major drilling innovation was the use of motorised directional drilling mdd this
   method has the advantage of accessing ore bodies at different vertical depths from the same parent hole
   as a consequence this saves the cost of redrilling a long length and enables a fan of holes to intersect the
   ore body at different points

   to further enhance the exploration innovations the latest softwares are used for precision in resource
   estimation this improves the efficiency of modelling of the data obtained from the drilling programmes
   datamine a mining specialist software has enabled the company to improve interpretations and streamline
   the process of quantitative prediction of resource availability these softwares are also a great aid to
   geologists enabling them to identify gaps in drilling data and uncorrelated ore grade intersections

   in a nutshell with these modern exploration methods it has been possible for hindustan zinc to add much
   more to our resource inventory than we have depleted

maintaining air quality
we strive to maintain ambient air quality around our
operations this is a very important aspect of our ems
that emphasises on reduction of emissions from point
sources mobile sources and other fugitive emissions

as part of our regular environmental monitoring we
record the stack emission parameters including
particulate matter pm sox and nox during the
reporting year the emission from all these sources
amounted to 0043 million mt we make all efforts to
keep our emissions in control by improving our
operational processes and by increasing efforts on
awareness drives as a best practice management we
have installed an online effluent and emission monitoring
system connected directly to the servers of pollution
control board

dust is another pertinent problem that we deal with in
our mining areas and we take all appropriate measures to
minimize the emissions concentrates transported to
smelters in trucks are covered with tarpaulin cover that
eliminates release of dust while transportation we also
take appropriate measures to extract dust settled on
roads by daily sweeping using mechanical sweepers if
the problem still persists we try to suppress the dust by
sprinkling water we also have mechanised sprinklers         installation of online particulate
installed at ore loading points and throughout the ore       matter emission monitoring and
transportation channel from the mines to the mills we       online water monitoring systems
are also applying chemical dust suppressant along with       at hindustan zinc

        attempting water positivity

        in the global scenario of water scarcity we
        acknowledge the way we value manage and
        use water at hindustan zinc our exclusive
        water management policy aims at achieving a
        lean water footprint and developing
        sustainable water resources the policy also
        lays down the target action plan that
        prioritizes the following
        a water conservation at source
        b zero discharge from operations
        c efficient water use by the community
        d rainwater harvesting and water
             accounting

        we drive these action plans in all our
        operations and keep track of the progress
        regularly operating in rajasthan  a region
        that faces acute water shortage  we consider
        it our responsibility to optimize our processes
        so that they consume the least amount of
        water possible and have a positive water
        footprint for our mining and smelting
        activities we depend on surface water
        rainwater municipal water supplies other
        water utilities and ground water refineries
        during 201516 we obtained 2654 million m3
        of water from these sources our efforts have
        resulted in significant reduction in fresh water
        consumption and if we compare our specific
        water consumption over the years there is a
        decrease of 16 between 2011 to 2016

     case study

     zero discharge no more a myth

        the reverse osmosis plant at our chanderiya lead zinc
        smelter clzs used to generate high tds ro reject at
        the rate of 11001200 m3day natural evaporation at
        ro reject pond and borrow pit after spraying on slf
        was the natural course for this ro discharge in our
        quest to retain the zero discharge status and make
        useful utilization of such a huge quantity of water that
        was being evaporated we decided to recover water
        from this reject

        we installed and commissioned a sea membrane ro in
        september 2015 this ro plant which had a capacity of
        1250 m3day was fed with the ro reject and it had a
        recovery efficiency of 56 this led to huge water
        saving and significant reduction of overall fresh water
        requirement at clzs while this project has been
        successful for better management of ro reject it has
        also strengthened our integrated water  wastewater
        management plans

water has no boundaries neither do our efforts to achieve water positivity we went beyond hindustan
zincs operations to protect the beautiful and wellknown lakes of udaipur we entered into an agreement
with the udaipur municipal corporation umc and the urban improvement trust to commission the first
sewage treatment plant stp of rajasthan under a public private partnership model with a capacity of 20
mld the stp treats nearly 30 of the sewage generated by the city the treated water from the stp is
reused in our rajpura dariba mining  smelting complex

in summers 15 of the treated water is released into the river to maintain the water table in the area the
sludge generated is also sourced as manure to the local bodies by the udaipur municipal corporation due to
the success of this project we have entered into an agreement with the state government of rajasthan to
expand the capacity of the stp by another 20 mld in phase ii this winwin arrangement between
hindustan zinc and udaipur municipal corporation umc and the urban improvement trust is an
exemplary initiative showcasing a corporates contribution to the sustainable use of water and ecological
restoration of lakes in udaipur

case study

nurturing our floral kinsfolk

  natural resources are finite as is biodiversity increasing demand for natural resources endangers local plant
  species unless we make special efforts we will lose several floral species that cater to our various needs
  such as fodder fruits fuelwood herbs medicines etc

  in 2013 we established a nursery hindustan zinc at rampura agucha mines done to help retain the vast
  pool of floral species the nursery was inaugurated on world environment day subsequently we have
  launched more projects at various locations such as

  ÿ   a floral nursery at kayad mine site
  ÿ   a herbal nursery at debari zinc smelter colony
  ÿ   a seasonal nursery at head office udaipur
  ÿ   a unique rashi van at head office

  the nursery at rampura agucha mine nurtures various endemic and medicinal plant species including gugal
  dhaak arjun mopane moringa while the nursery at kayad mine site houses anogeissussericea family
  combretaceae butea monosperma var lutea and commiphorawightiisyn c mukul hook ex stocks
  these nurseries also grow plant species which are preferred by peacocks such as ziziphus mauritiana
  aeglemarmalos sygygiumcumini and tamarindus indica our herbal nursery at debari zinc smelter colony
  area conserves around 1000 medicinal plants of 22 various species and the seasonal nursery at head office
  udaipur grows 1012 types of seasonal flower plants rashi van is a unique park developed for the
  conservation of medicinal plants where the plants are arranged according to the zodiac signs plants
  representing the 12 zodiac signs have been selected and they are being nurtured in this nursery along with
  18 more varieties of plants with medicinal value



  creating the butterfly niche
  butterflies the insect species are the agents of
  pollination and thats how they play a vital role in
  balancing the natural ecosystem enthused by this
  ecological fact we envisioned to create a habitat
  for preserving butterfly species that are taking the
  extinction route

  we began by enumerating the species present in
  the vicinity of our pantnagar metal plant a total
  of 117 butterfly species were recorded and some
  of them were very few in numbers this gave us
  the necessary impetus to concentrate our efforts
  and build a natural habitat for them we enclosed
  a 225 sqm area near the admin block and planted
  660 different varieties of seasonal and permanent
  flower species to attract butterflies to attract
  birds and maintain a natural habitat we created an
  oasis water pond for birds inside the park
  premises whilst the park would be a favoured
  resort for butterflies it would simultaneously help
  to increase awareness amongst the community
  about these beautiful natures creation that aid in
  pollination and balancing the ecosystem




                                                                                                                    63

        managing our waste

        waste generation is an integral aspect of our mining
        process since only 3 of the leadzinc mineral ore that
        we extract contributes to the refined metal at
        hindustan zinc we have a welldefined waste route
        aided by a wellestablished step by step monitoring
        process that ensures appropriate management of the
        waste waste efficiency at hindustan zinc is achieved by
        two major objectives  minimizing the quantum of waste
        generated and maximising recycling and reuse of wastes            nonhazardous waste generation million mt
        in case of disposal of waste we adopt the suitable
                                                                           hazardous waste generation million mt
        scientific method of disposal after extensive analysis of
        the waste type and its impacts
                                                                                                             06
        reducing waste generation                                            06                  06                    06

        our major focus has been to minimize waste generation
        in fy 201516 we generated 106 million mt of waste
        including hazardous waste and nonhazardous waste
        during the past three years we have observed a nearly
        constant trend in our waste generation pattern
        apart from industrial waste we are also cautious about
        the domestic solid waste we generate our approach like       201516             201415             201314
        always has been to maximize the use of any waste
        generated we have created nursery infrastructure with
        the solid waste generated at our locations which
        includes wood metals frp plastics teacups and water
        bottles now we have a beautiful nursery to grow
        saplings and plants built from recyclable solid wastes we
        have also set up an organic waste treatment plant to
        make compost of the organic wastes generated the
        compost is then used in gardening landscaping etc

                                       future technology
                  iron is a common metal associated with zinc concentrates during the refining process iron is removed from
                  the metal aggregate using the jarosite process to obtain zinc jarosite  a hazardous substance released
                  during the process  is combined with lime and cement to form an inert substance called jarofix which is
                  then disposed this conventional process requires huge land area for disposal making it an unsustainable
                  option in the long runto eliminate the generation of this hazardous waste we have identified a new
                  technology solution known fumer technology which will be implemented in near future

                  patented by xmetech south korea this process involves fuming the zinc ferrite zinciron metal aggregate
                  in a furnace to obtain residual metals captured as fume oxide and the iron waste generated as clean slag
                  this ironrich slag can be used as a raw material for the manufacturing of cement and other construction
                  products

                  this environmental friendly technology has several advantages over the conventional jarosite process
                  ÿ along with enhanced recovery of the metals zinc lead silver and copper this technology promises
                     complete elimination of land requirement for disposal of jarofix
                  ÿ the fume gases released in the process have the potential to generate green energy by the waste heat
                     recovery process

                     completely eliminated
                  ÿ the fumer slag contains about 76 lime which would later translate to a reduction of lime consumption
                     in the cement industry where this byproduct of the fumer technology can be used as a raw material

                  in the fumer process itself we are progressing steadily to establish this energy independent technology
                  which is likely to reduce our environmental liabilities significantly

managing the tailings generated at the mining operations demands constructive and channelized efforts the
post excavation activities are majorly concentrated around dealing with the tailings that cannot be recovered
completely but has to be discarded scientifically to avoid any damage to the surrounding environment the
conventional trend of surface disposal of these tailings in lined pits requires huge land areas in the vicinity of
the mines area

mining operations involve filling of stopesvoids to ensure stability and control subsidence mine back fill is
conventionally done through hydraulic filling with cement one of the contemporary alternative to this is the
pastefill technology which combines the backfilling process with the tailings management the tailings are
modified into a semisolid paste which is used to fill the empty underground voids after completion of metal
ore excavation the paste filling process ensures fast filling of the voids with practically no bleeding it also
has other advantages of minimum water requirement and drainage minimum fill and wall dilution in stopes
better recovery of intervening pillars better regional stability and surface integrity the process utilizes
almost all the tailings minimizing the surface disposal

with the successful commissioning of paste fill plant at our sindesar khurd mine and rampura agucha mine
we are glad to have started a unique trend in mining in india with both backfilling and tailings management
happening simultaneously the technology proves better than the previous low density hydraulic fill and also
conserves water internationally we are one of those few miners who utilized tailings and operate on paste
fill technology

                       flourish in the organization one such example is gunjan agnihotri who is one of our
                       stars of business currently heading human resources at the sindesar khurd mine
                       having joined the company in may 2011 as a fresher she was initially absorbed into
                       the talent acquisition team at hindustan zincs corporate office this gave her the
                       opportunity to work closely with senior business leaders hiring top notch talent for
                       the business and working with worldclass consultants have been enriching

sector independently and efficiently dealing with contractors and the local manpower today gunjan along

in her own words

                          the work atmosphere at hindustan zinc has always been motivational starting
                          kaizen competitions was a great initiative in the 2nd quarter of year 20152016
                          we solved the problem dealing with the failure of a discharge valve we presented it
                          in the kaizen competition

                         the discharge valve of the cooling tower and pump got damaged as a result it was
                         difficult to check nrv of the pump and we had to undertake a shutdown to replace
                         the valve with zero current of cell house on 7 july 2015 it was damaged as the
                         nrv was hitting it we increased the distance between nrv and valve by providing
                         a spool piece in between not only did it avoid hitting the nrv with the valve we
   also prevented damage to the discharge valve we saved 2 lakh rupees unwanted power zero shut down
   was also avoided

   this kaizen got selected in category a two team members got a reward of 7500 rupees each we were
   also appreciated greatly in the reward ceremony this improved my confidence and motivated me to do
   more improvement projects similarly in the 4th quarter we saved more than 10 lakh rupees by developing

                   transformational voyage
a resident of sakroda panchayat lachchu kunwar was a rajput housewife confined to her family until she
came across the unique livestock development project launched by hindustan zinc aware of her familys
meagre income and with no other alternative for extra earning lachchu decided to join the rela shg and get
trained on the gottery project what interested her most was that this project would provide all the initial
support including financial help and she had to repay only half the loan amount she would take to initiate the
project she started on this journey by buying 5 female goats and 1 male goat of the sirohi breed the
uniqueness of this breed is that they give birth in two cycles a year and produce twins they needed minimal
maintenance and had to be vacciniated at intervals today lachchu has a herd of 32 goats and makes a yearly
income of rs30000 by selling them the milk requirement of her entire family is also fulfilled from this most
importantly this project has played a transformational role in developing her enterprising abilities

a happy and confident lachchu expresses

this gottery business project of hindustan zinc has brought happiness in our
lives and homes and i will always be grateful to them

                  sakhi programme hindustan zinc has taken an amazing initiative to make women financially independent by
                  assuring them market the government too has been working towards the upliftment of rural women but the results
                  have been comparatively slow however this innovative concept has captured the essence of what the government
                  has envisioned doing since a long time and has achieved results at a much rapid pace by developing product based
                  cluster approach i would further congratulate the entire sakhi team for this innovative approach


                  anita bhadel women and child development minister government of rajasthan


                  i am grateful to hindustan zinc for undertaking such a wonderful initiative this concept and the entire programme
                  is a great confidence booster for the women of our villages there are many self help groups and ngos that are
                  working towards the empowerment of women but a concept like sakhi is really unique in its idea and execution
                  that recognises the womens talents and more importantly gives them a market to showcase their creativity and
                  their products 



                  diya kumari mla sawai madhopur
