leed  other standards
in the past couple of years rtkl has focused significant attention on    which lagged behind a 35 industry average as a direct result of
increasing our internal knowledge and capabilities surrounding green      this analysis in february 2014 rtkl formally adopted a leed
building market standards in 2013 we recognized that while our         accreditation policy for existing and new employees
credentials were strong there was considerable room for improvement
a comparison of our qualifications to the state of the highperformance   the response exceeded our expectations and at the time of releasing this
design market revealed key areas for progress for example in 2013       report our leed aps represent 44 of the total rtkl employees
leedaccredited professionals aps represented 21 of our employees     including administrative employees

general progress

within our professional design staff alone leed aps account
for 52 this significantly exceed our target35 based on industry
averages in 2013and we did it in half a year instead of 18 months as
planned this taught us how much we can accomplish if we put a little
weight behind our effort

along with an increase in leed accreditation we also were able to
achieve significant uptake in the number of projects pursuing leed and        building design   engineering
other market standards due to strong leadership and employee support
                                                                                construction    newsrecord

we nearly doubled our revenue for projects pursuing thirdparty
green standardsfrom 279 million in 2013 to 5219 million in 2014 as
a result building design  construction ranked rtkl 15 among green
design firms and engineering newsrecord ranked us 21 among
green architecture and engineering firms up from 36 in 2013a
significant jump in one year additionally prior to 2014 rtkl had only two
multifamily residential projects that had completed leed certification

this progress represents a strong foundation for which we are proud and
                                                                                                 engineering firms
our plan is to continue building momentum for example doubling the
number of staff and projects pursuing thirdparty standards is one thing
but how quickly can we use this new leverage to ensure a noticeably more
positive impact in our work

performance through smarter design
                                                                                                    35
during 2014 rtkl developed a energy tracking policy requiring all
applicable projects to report predicted energy use and we implemented         2011                 36
the policy on january 1 2015 we plan to evaluate this years results in
order to set minimum performance targets in 2016                                                   35

rtkl is a founding signatory of the aia 2030 commitment and we                2012           24
continue to submit project performance statistics annually prior to 2015
the 2030 target for energy reduction below the cbecs average was 60
                                                                                                      37
as of 2015 the target is 70 although our reporting for last year does not
yet represent the full spectrum of the work we do annually our average        2013             26
eui reduction reached 261 33 behind the previous 2030 target
                                                                                                   34
we still have significant progress to make if we hope to catch up that
being said the average peui reduction for all firms submitting to the 2030
commitment in 2013 was only 34 putting us behind average but only            2014          22
slightly 8
                                                                                                      rtkl peui

general progress

in 2014 we reported 74 projects to aia 2030 more than doubling the           of the 74 projects we submitted only 2 projects less than 3 exceeded
number of projects we reported in past years this can be attributed           the 2030 target and an additional 3 projects were within a few percentage
to our increased focus on data collection of our projects in order to learn    points while we remain well behind the 2030 target it is encouraging that
from and improve our work moving forward these 74 projects represent          recently we have seen an uptake in the number of projects that are
over 112 million square feet of designed space which would account for        pursing high energyreduction targets or zero net energy zne this
7 of the total square footage submitted by all firms to the aia last year    represents an exciting positive trend for our work
still 74 projects is not indicative of all of rtkls work from 2014 and we
hope to keep increasing the number of projects we are reporting until we       to ensure that we keep pace with the industry we hope to meet or exceed
have submitted all applicable projects                                        the aia averages by the end of 2016 our new energy performance policies

understanding that culture is key to innovation in november
rtkl launched its first annual weeklong innovation workshop called
sparkweek using the introduction to design innovation as a guide
sparkweek allowed rtkl employees all across the world to come
together and share ideas on pressing issues of mobility the results were
impressive and many of the ideas that were generated from sparkweek
are continuing to be pursued

this focus on innovation has only just begun but we are already seeing
results in how our work is being designed and how our employees work
together

this year we have taken many first steps in project work currently
underway are our first handful of leed v4 projects and we are
working on multiple projects attempting to reach zero net energy as
an international company that typically works at a significant scale these
projects have the potential to become the first and largest of their kind


we continue working to collect and enter project performance data in
the dash our internal dashboard that tracks the performance of our
work currently over 33 million square feet are represented in the
dash these projects combined are estimated to have saved our clients
over 215 million through better energy performance with a combined
average energy reduction around 23 from the baseline with the launch
of the new energy policy we hope that next year these numbers will
more accurately portray our entire portfolio of work

gualv new city hospital
guangzhou china

as part of the biggest hospital chain in guangdong province of china
gualv new city hospital is set to be a stateoftheart healthcare
community focused on sustainability and patient wellness the design
creates an innovative variation on the typical patient towers on podium
scheme the vshaped plans of the three bed towers angle toward
the southeast offering patients both better views and preferred solar
orientation reducing heat gain by 1520 and improving thermal
comfort the patient rooms look down onto a garden roof atop the
podium which houses exam rooms and other diagnostic functions
in a conventional hospital these spaces would be a rabbits warren of
seemingly endless corridors and dark windowless spaces however at
gualv new city the podium becomes a carved landscape that opens
the podium to light views and outdoor gardens as a result 95 of the
diagnostic spaces receive daylight an extraordinary achievement




                                                                              95         
among large hospitals the benefits of this approach include better patient
and staff comfort and wellbeing and lower energy use in 2014 gualv new
city received the 2014 international future health project award and
a rethinking the future sustainability award

                                                                              diagnostic spaces
