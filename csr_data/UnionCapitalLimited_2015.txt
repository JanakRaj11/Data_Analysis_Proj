                                          economic value added eva is an overarching measure used to measure the wealth
                                          generation potential of the company eva is an internal management performance measure that
                                          compares net operating profit to total cost of capital economic value added is also referred to
                                          as economic profit the eva is defined as

                                          eva  net operating profit after tax minus cost of capital

                                          economic value added is important because it is used as an indicator of how profitable company
                                          projects are and it therefore serves as a reflection of management performance

                                          the idea behind eva is that businesses are only truly profitable when they create wealth for
                                          their shareholders and the measure of this goes beyond calculating net income economic
