aspect materials
aspectspecific dma guidance for materials
as a producing company we use materials for our products for packaging and to facilitate processes we assume
product responsibility and develop manufacture and market our products in accordance with principles that ensure
customer safety and do not endanger the environment

we avoid waste wherever possible our lamps only contain a minimum amount of environmentally damaging
substances and we do not use unnecessary packaging materials we continuously work on improving our products
to make them as recyclable as possible when developing new products we reduce the amount of harmful
substances or if possible completely replace them with harmless substances

we aim to reduce the mercury content in all our products to the lowest amount technically possible therefore we
are constantly improving our product and production technology and we are continually upgrading our existing
production facilities to implement such technologies our approach is going beyond legal requirements such as
the european rohsdirective

we use environmental product declaration as a transparent method to communicate our committment to
sustainability for business customers understanding the environmental impact of sourced inputs enables the
overall environmental footprint of products or processes to be measured and for a thorough lifecycle assessment
to be conducted

percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials
the design process which includes ideas for packaging makes a significant contribution to waste prevention
early on osram has clear guidelines for the design and procurement of packaging packaging should be made
from environmentally sustainable materials that can be easily recycled or disposed of in addition its volume and
weight should be limited to the amount required to protect the contents this means that for the majority of our
products folding boxes are used for primary packaging and corrugated cardboard boxes for shipment packaging
the cardboard and paper used to produce these packaging components had a recycled content of between 70
and 90 in fiscal 2014

various recycling procedures have been established for the reuse of led and discharge lamps for both stationary
and mobile operations these procedures aim at neatly separating the components of the lamps and reusing the
remaining material wherever possible clean glass is used for the production of new lamps and mixed glass is
recycled with other glass metal parts go into metal recycling and plastics are mainly recycled thermally phosphors
are blown out or rinsed out and can be used for industrial processes this is how more than 90 of raw lamp
materials is reused

within our production processes primary energy use still plays a significant role that again leads to direct co2
emissions in order to comprehensively address the issue of energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg
emissions in our own production facilities we use our ehs policy set internal targets and monitor the
achievements by our environmental management system

for enhancing our approach and for identifying all potential savings osram initiated a special project at the start
of fiscal 2013 we established a global energy efficiency project with expert teams in all sites in order to enhance
energy efficiency through systematic implementation of appropriate measures all factories have been assigned
individual reduction targets for related emissions that need to be met by the end of the current fiscal year we are
also implementing an energy management system iso 50001 at all our german production sites which amount
to about 50 in terms of energy costs

aspect water
aspectspecific dma guidance for water
in the production of lighting products water is mainly needed for cooling processes and thus hardly polluted but
for osram it is still of great importance to use water responsibly and committed itself in its guidelines to manage
water and other precious resources sustainably
thus we make sure to either clean polluted water ourselves or redirect it to local sewage plants furthermore we
consider the scarcity of this precious resource in all our production processes and monitor our water usage

the adaptation of water management to the local availability of water is of great importance to osram for this
reason we keep an extra eye on those production sites that are located in areas of water stress or scarcity there
we place a special focus on continuously monitoring and improving our production processes to make them ever
more waterefficient and thus more economical as well as ecological many osram production sites have taken
steps to use the most environmentally advanced production techniques that reduce the usage of water to a
minimum you can find examples on our website wwwosramcomfactories

aspect products and services
aspectspecific dma guidance for products and services
our products affect the environment in a variety of ways obviously they are made in factories that have an
environmental footprint and they significantly impact on the environment during their use however in order to
evaluate lamps and how they actually deal with energy and resources it is not enough just to consider single
stages of their life cycle thus the life cycle analysis lca of a product considers the environmental aspects and
potential environmental impacts of a product throughout its entire life cycle

in order to assess the environmental performance of osram products life cycle analyses of several specific
products were conducted representing certain product groups the method for these analyses was an
assessment as outlined in the international standards iso 14040 and 14044 apart from the primary energy
consumption the impact on the environment was evaluated in specific categories

the collection and recycling of used discharge lamps for example is regulated in european countries by eu
directive 200296eg weee waste electrical and electronic equipment and implemented by specially
established organizations companies and foundations fluorescent lamps and discharge lamps contain small
amounts of mercury and valuable raw materials led lamps and luminaires also contain valuable raw materials
along with electronic components this is why it is important that the products are collected and recycled or
disposed of safely

the aim of product recycling is to recover as many sorted materials as possible in order to conserve limited
resources and to protect the environment through the professional disposal of hazardous substances

since 2005 we established collection recycling service organizations together with other producers of the
lighting sector within the eu to fulfill the requirements under the directive eu 200296ec weee as well as
201219eu weee recast and the relevant national implementations

anticipating the issue of recycling at an early product development stage means that over 90 of osrams lamp

accordance with local legal requirements or on a voluntary basis

additionally to the health and safety of our employees diversity is an important factor for osram for us diversity
is creating the opportunity for employees from different cultures and with different backgrounds religions
genders and skills to work together and to create competitive advantage our diversity program ensures that
employees with the same experience and qualifications have the same career opportunities irrespective of their
personal background gender or nationality the program comprises global projects initiatives and training
programs using webinars that are accessible worldwide the program aims to promote different ways of thinking
as well as greater understanding of diversity within the organization every year our women leadership forum
offers 25 female staff from across the world the opportunity to meet male and female role models from senior
management and focus on building their own leadership skills

highly qualified specialists and managers are crucial to osrams success competition for qualified employees
among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is intense the loss of qualified employees or
an inability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees required for the operation transition and
expansion of our business could limit our ability to conduct research successfully and to develop and sell
marketable products competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the area of rd engineering
and the project business qualified led sales people succession planning identifying and developing talent and
dedicated employee development programs are therefore a global focus

for addressing the development of our employees and talents we inter alia provide general and specific trainings
360 degree feedback sessions and have certain employee development programs in place such as the
management and leadership development programs

the effectiveness of our health and safety programs can be measured by the following relevant statistics they
encompass for osram gmbh all sites in germany excluding affiliated companies and for osram europe all
sites in europe including affiliated companies and osram gmbh
in comparison to previous years the numbers of occupational accidents are relatively constant within osram
gmbh with eight accidents per 1000 employees in 2014 we are way below the industry average not only can
this be explained by the intensive training that has been conducted by superiors and health and safety officers
but also by an increasing awareness of the importance of safety throughout the workforce improved machine
safety already during the planning and construction phase of machines also helped to decrease incidents over
the last years
accidents like stumbling falling or tripping as well as accidents related to internal transportation make up nearly
half of all occupational accidents our aim is being accidentfree  to this end the accident prevention measures
are constantly being improved in our plants above that the osram health and safety committee committed itself

one of the aspects of a sustainable supply chain that has gained special relevance lately is the issue of conflict
minerals osram has a long tradition of operating business in a way that is socially and environmentally
responsible our code of conduct for suppliers has always required our suppliers to respect the basic human
rights of employees and others and prohibited our suppliers and their respective suppliers from being complicit in
