for instance drawing on the pgnig code of ethics
the team has developed the code of responsible
gas and oil production which sets out our vision of
how we want to go about this process

we also wanted experts in drilling geology and
environmental protection and not merely spin
doctors to take part in meetings and share their
knowledge with local communities this is why
the entire communication team attended training
sessions where we learned how to listen and com
municate effectively as well as the role of body
language now we hold weekly meetings at which
we exchange information and discuss various
issues we have thus developed into a tightly
knit team working together to implement one of
pgnigs major pr projects

all our communication efforts are designed to
 provide target audiences with extensive
  information on shale gas production reliably
