cement business
our sales volume dipped by 2 as compared to the previous year mainly because of
lower production at chaibasa and bargarh plants where limestone mining operations
were suspended in the first half of the year due to regulatory issues although
both plants were restarted later in the year several other companies faced similar
suspension of operations of old mining leases under deemed renewal basis which was
hitherto permitted by law but were later required by a subsequent change in law to
seek fresh mining approvals for second and subsequent renewals of leases with the
resumption of mining operations and improved market conditions the second half of
the year fared better despite these challenges the company managed to achieve an
overall cement capacity utilization of 77 during the year which was 4 higher than
the industry average

                                           overall the company performed in line with its industry peers while net sales
                                           at  11433 crores were marginally lower than in 2014 sales realizations
                                           improved by 1 and ebitda by 2 pat was lower by 49 for two reasons
                                            one because of an additional depreciation charge of  16445 crore provided
                                           in respect of fixed assets with no remaining useful life pursuant to the provisions
                                           of schedule ii of the companies act the second reason for the variance in
                                           pat was that in the year 2014 there were certain conservative provisions of
                                            30923 crore that were subsequently not required because of favourable tax
                                           assessments and were hence written back whereas no such opportunity for write
                                           back arose in 2015

                                           organization structure
                                           a new functional organization structure was put in place in april 2015 which seamlessly
                                           phased out the earlier regionalbased structure the new configuration has already

climate change
new policies were adopted for sustainable development environment management
and energy conservation

we maintained a firm grip on restricting carbon dioxide and other emissions our
approach was seen by the government of india as being emblematic of the national
effort to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change this was evident from the
prominent display of the brand acc in the india pavilion at the cop 21 conference
of parties meet in paris in december 2015 organized by the united nations framework
convention on climate change

with a high score of 98 points out of 100 as per cdps independently assessed
methodology acc is one of the leading business houses in india identified for the
transparency and quality of its disclosure in the carbon disclosure project cdp the
global initiative that encourages sharing of climate change related information to help
drive global carbon reduction strategies

the company maintained its bestinclass position in terms of carbon footprint with
specific co2 emissions per tonne of cement at 533 kg co2tonne in 2015 this was
possible mainly by maintaining a share of blended cements as high as 85 of our
product portfolio

other enablers included the coprocessing of hazardous and nonhazardous industrial
and municipal wastes as alternative fuels and resources afr in cement manufacture
in order to reduce dependence on fossil fuel we expect to see added momentum in
thermal substitution rates further in the coming year with the stabilization of our new
preprocessing facilities at two major plants to enable safe handling of varied types
and volumes of waste streams

on the water management front we are progressing fast on the road towards a
zero waste water discharge status in 2015 we achieved reduction in specific water
consumption per tonne of cement by 76 as compared to the previous year two
major plants are already selfreliant in water

                                            acknowledged and demonstrated a belief in interdependence with all elements of

     ascertain the                         previous chapter and then went on to prioritize them in terms of their influence on the

     interest and views                    the objective was clearly understood  which was to ascertain the concerns level of
     of our stakeholders                   interest and views of our stakeholders in identifying the aspects they feel reflect the
                                           companys significant economic environmental and social impacts or those that may

     aspects                               the company the team prepared an exhaustive questionnaire for this purpose care
                                           was taken to ensure it was worded simply all aspects covered in the preceding year
                                           were listed in the questionnaire including a few new ones that the core team felt was
                                           relevant to our areas of business two notable ones in this regard are the economic
                                           aspect of logistics and the other is the use of alternative fuels and resources relating
                                           to our waste management services in previous exercises it was felt that these two
                                           aspects which are of vital significance to acc did not get addressed adequately in
                                           terms of the list of aspects suggested in g4 guidelines

                                           the stakeholder interactions in this regard was performed with a shortlist of major
                                           groups as per the prioritization and agreement on the desired sample size we felt
                                           would be representative of each group the priority stakeholders chosen for this
                                           survey were mainly those with whom our engagement is regular whether direct or
                                           indirect and occurring in key stages of our value chain namely activities performed in
                                           the course of sourcing producing and delivering products and services to customers
                                           and stakeholders all of these groups are entities that are referred in some way
                                           or other in the companys consolidated financial statements and other published
                                           documents stakeholders views were sought in different ways depending on speed
                                           and convenience

                                           thus employees were sent an email communication from the ceomd inviting

                                           interviewed over telephone to ascertain their concerns and views this approach was
                                           also used for some senior internal and external executives in the interest of time
                                           management

                                           the core team separately interviewed members of top management and functional
                                           heads to examine the significance and relative priority of the organizations economic
                                           environmental and societal impacts in doing this they were reminded to consider
                                           factors such as the companys current and future challenges risks and opportunities
                                           organizational vision promoters priorities and regulatory issues weightage was
                                           assigned to each stakeholder group in order to arrive at a single list of concerns
30  sustainable development report 2015

these insights thus gathered were analyzed together with the aggregated list of
stakeholders concerns to arrive at a fresh assessment of issues of material concern for
the organization accordingly this analysis is reproduced here to produce a fresh focus
of key issues based on the new materiality matrix

as compared to the previous year the matrix developed here has a few significant
differences in the previous matrix material aspects were prioritized as a synthesis
of those that were of common concern to external and internal stakeholders in this
exercise we rated aspects in terms of those that were of concern to stakeholders and
thus influence their decisionmaking versus the significance of the aspects to the
organization in terms of economic environmental and societal impacts certain other
changes that occurred in priorities are described here

public policy has not received priority hence we have not addressed this aspect
separately in this report nevertheless it did play an important role with all the activities
listed in the report for 2014 continuing to be pursued in earnest these include
promoting good concrete practices promoting the use of concrete as a good road
building material advocacy and promotion of our approach to waste management
services and highlighting the need to support climate change mitigation initiatives

conversely some aspects have been upgraded in priority these include products 
services

several interesting suggestions were made by both internal and external stakeholders
to include new themes as material aspects in view of their significant impact on the
companys sustainability performance the noteworthy aspects among these were

the remaining share of sales comes from direct buyers in the private and government
sectors for large projects and more sophisticated constructions the company has
constituted a specially designated sales team that focuses on such buyers called the
industrial infrastructure and commercial ici department this team represents the
businesstobusiness segment of the company the team also services key customers
who comprise other large users and those that consume cement as a raw material

customer servicing and technomarketing is a big differentiator our regional offices
and sales units have customer services cells manned by qualified civil engineers who
interact with customers to assess their needs and problems offer advice before and
after sales including educating users and customers on correct usage of cement and
concrete and good construction practices

acc was a pioneer in introducing the commercial sales of bulk cement and ready mixed
concrete rmx the demand for these products is mainly in large urban clusters and
infrastructure development projects these two value added products have together
accelerated and enhanced the pace and quality of large construction in india they
have even impacted the sophisticated retail buyer segment in markets like bengaluru
and goa while the share of these two offerings is still overshadowed by the large retail
segment that prefers bagged cement it is this category which represents the future
development of construction in the country

has expanded to cover a large number of cities in the country acc concrete had 50
rmx plants at the close of 2015 in the last few years accs concrete business showed

logistics and transportation also have significant environmental impacts the first
is co2 emissions emanating from fuel consumption this gets addressed by
ensuring regular maintenance of vehicles the second impact is the dust pollution
caused by trucks plying on roads these vehicles tend to stir up ambient dust on
and around the roads cement trucks are dedusted and covered in tarpaulins before
they leave cement plants in order to minimize dust pollution bulk transport of cement
is not only costeffective but also environmentfriendly similarly rail movement
is preferred for long distances as a more sustainable mode ready mixed concrete
that is transported in transit mixers is proven to be a valueadded option that is also
particularly a green option

co2 emissions
as a prominent member of cement sustainability initiative we are committed to
reducing emissions and have made steady progress on each of these levers thus we
have strived to achieve better kiln energy efficiency wherever possible to reduce the
amount of energy required per tonne of clinker produced we maintain a high rate of                                   acc has also been

                                           water is precious  trace it and save it




     in 2014 a target
     was set to install
     water flow meters
     and monitoring
     systems at all acc
     locations since
     then concerted
     efforts have been
     made to achieve this
     target




                                           tracking the use of water and arresting leakages to save water was envisaged as an
                                           important step in water conservation in 2014 a target was set to install water flow
                                           meters and monitoring systems at all acc locations since then concerted efforts have
                                           been made to achieve this target

                                           in 2015 the target was partially achieved as of now 12 plants have installed electro
                                           magnetic flow meters

                                           central monitoring stations were also installed in plants

                                           by installing water meters acc expects multifaceted benefits which in turn will save
                                           water for others and for future generations
     water flow meters were
     installed for every consumption
     and withdrawal point which                                  progress of water meters in 2015
     helps in water balancing and             20

   acc thondebhavi has planted near about 3000 plants including avenue plantation along the plant boundary to
   maintain the local ecology all trees chosen are of native species such as mahogany conocarpus casurina acacia
   auriculiformis silver oak millingtonia spethodia tublia rosea technoma gaudichowdi etc since these trees are
   already grown up to a considerable size approximately 814 ft they do not require much water anymore the plant
   survival rate is  90 once grown to its full growth the vegetation cover will act as a windbreak and expected to be a
   very effective arrangement for avoiding dust emissions apart from serving as wind barriers it will have other
   environmental benefits also such as groundwater recharge during rainy season capturing carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas
   and preventing soil erosion

   there are fourrow barriers of trees along the periphery of the plant which also improves the aesthetics of the plant

we have a comprehensive spill management system in place to minimize the impact
in the event of any spill in 2015 there was no incidence of any significant spill

a large proportion of cement bags is reused after the bags are emptied of their content
with only a small part being disposed as scrap construction sites find empty cement
bags useful to store other loose construction material often the empty bags are
cleaned and reconditioned to store and pack other items in many instances the bags
are cleaned and put to use as roof thatching material in view of these practices we
have not found it necessary or gainful for us to reclaim used packaging material

sector fertilizer unit with a mandate to utilize waste calcium carbonate sludge from the
fertilizer manufacturing process the company was then a front runner in using wastes
from other processes viz slag and fly ash to make superior blended cements slag is
a byproduct of the steel industry while fly ash is a reject from thermal power plants       in 2005 the company
five decades ago the companys chaibasa and sindri plants were paid a fee by steel            adopted a formal

    in 2015 two stateoftheart preprocessing facilities at wadi in karnataka and kymore in madhya pradesh were
    commissioned and have been operational for more than a year they have sophisticated equipment necessary for safe
    handling of varied types and volumes of waste streams including shredding and homogenising wastes prior to its final
    treatment via coprocessing they are also equipped with laboratories for characteristic analysis of all incoming wastes
    the facilities bring added momentum to coprocessing of larger volumes of wastes in a safe manner special precautions
    are undertaken to ensure complete traceability and transparency and to comply with all statutory laws and guidelines a
    trained and highly motivated workforce ensures that we deliver specialized solutions to the most pressing waste challenges

the waste coprocessing service extended by us ensures that the waste gets
completely destroyed in the cement manufacturing process because of its inherent
process requirements of very high temperatures and long residence times in the kiln
this is achieved without any change in the cement kiln exhaust gas composition or
the generation of any residues an intrinsic benefit of coprocessing is that it enables
conservation of natural resources in three ways firstly any residual resource value
present in the waste material gets utilized as an alternative resource thereby this
helps in reducing the reliance on fuels to some extent and thus in conserving natural

overall co2 emissions whereas other methods of disposal do not yield any resource

anti corruption
the company has not carried out a risk assessment specific to corruption risks of
operations units or functions as it believes these cannot be mapped given human
nature for being what it is the company believes that all functions are prone to
corruption risks as it is not practical to segregate such persons or functions individually
the difference may lie in the importance size and scale of the function such as sales
procurement and logistics nevertheless all internal controls are strengthened from
time to time to minimize eliminate such risks there were 7 confirmed incidents of
corruption cases in 2015 in which 7 persons have separated also during the year there
was one confirmed incident when a contract with a business partner was terminated
due to violations related to corruption there were no public legal cases regarding
corruption brought against the organization or its employees during the reporting
period
