concept will be implemented in two stages

   moderate diversification  projects on enhanced
   efficiency and the processing depth of the compa

   the use of existing competencies and infrastructure
 stage 2 20162020
   largescale development of new business areas 
   major projects related to the transbaikal mining

   the core idea of the concept is to establish a jsc

plementation of these projects involving investment
partners will help diversify the business and provide
