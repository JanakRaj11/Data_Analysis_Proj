service that would advance wfns rights and title in our traditional hunting areas this initiative

records management
records management played an integral role in the fy2016 wfn audit the team provided
training and support to financial services and the auditors to access relevant documents in wfns
electronic document repository auditors were able to ﬁnd the majority of their documents
independently without the assistance of records management or finance
additionally documents were captured and separated automatically using character recognition
and pattern matching to populate data this service saved wfns auditors many hours of document
retrieval time this automatic capture process also saved the records team hours of data entry
as relevant ﬁelds were populated automatically this new digitization process also eliminates
oﬀsite storage costs
records management now has a versatile process that can automatically apply document security
and be ﬁled based on the document type this can be used throughout all aspects of wfns
electronic document repository
upcoming records management projects include the centralization of all oﬀsite storage locations
as well as the use of wfns new business process tools to implement electronic processes designed
to eliminate ineﬃcient paper processes and forms the team has already mapped out the majority
of wfns internal processes and will be identifying opportunities to save staﬀ time and costs

a reduced surplus in 2016
after a very strong 2015 wfn governments consolidated ﬁnancial results declined
in 2016 consolidated revenues were down 15 million 4 to 424 million while
total expenses increased 1 to 396 million the bottom line was a surplus of  28
million down 43 from a 48 million surplus in 2015
the income statement revenues  expenses include two large unusual items
 1     a loss of 81 million was posted to record the debt purchase on the sneena
        overlook lands the payments and related borrowing was approved by
        membership and restored the lands to community control in august 2015
 2     a gain of close to 8 million was brought into income to record the value
        of sneena road and related improvements contributed to wfn by the bc
        ministry of transport
while the net eﬀect of these two lines on the statement of operations is a net loss
of about 100000 in the statement of operations the impact on the wfn ﬁnancial
position balance sheet is more substantial
                                                                                               brian conner cpa cma cafm

the 22 decline in net ﬁnancial assests is primarily due to the business loss noted
                                                                                          a wide range of accounting

                                                                                          reporting and planning services

beyond these two unusual items wfn ran well within budget operations budgeted           reporting to all stakeholders
to cost 318 million ended up almost 12 million under budget at 306 million the     including community members
biggest single item in the wfn budget is wages salaries and beneﬁts at 142           and ratepayers
million this came in on budget while most other expense items came in under
budget

wfn remains ﬁnancially strong
despite the sneena overlook lands business loss in 2016 wfn remains ﬁnancially very sound prior to 2016 net ﬁnancial
assests increased almost every year reaching 401 million in 2015 the decline in net ﬁnancial assets to 315 million is
a setback but can be absorbed by wfns reserves included in the 315 million net ﬁnancial assets is 111 million of
accumulated own source revenue osr the osr reserve funds are set aside for future community beneﬁt as directed by
council they remain a source of ﬁnancial strength and ﬂexibility that enables wfn to achieve its strategic goals for the
community including new housing enhanced education programs and other beneﬁts
the 112 million of capital assets added in 2016 such as roads sidewalks building and infrastructure provide improved
services and beneﬁts they are the basis of future prosperity as they make wfn a better place to live and do business
a ﬁnal reﬂection of wfns strong ﬁnancial position overall accumulated surplus including ﬁnancial capital and other net
assets was up 28 million in 2016 to 1026 million

the upcoming year
we look forward to a more routine year in 2017 that runs close to or better than budget increased revenues from all areas
will enable wfn to continue to deliver on its strategic priorities including capital works sidewalks member housing and
completion of the youth centre program enhancements will include
 additional title rights and reconciliation activity
                                                          enhanced early years programs

as in all years wfn will continue to make education training and capacity building for its members a top priority and
robust funding will continue to support all of these programs
