         the truth is we were pretty overwhelmed when we first set out to go green in 2007 there wasnt
         a roadmap to follow and most of the resources we found were geared toward large manufacturers            we all share the same planet and it is in desperate need of some tlc and by working together we
         but we were undaunted and began our journey by figuring out what made the most sense for us              can all make a bigger difference




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                customers
         along the way we probably reinvented the wheel a few times over but we had some early wins              i hope you enjoy taking a peak into our green team notebook for 2009
         too we began by tackling the lowhanging fruit like changing our light bulbs and improving our
         recycling then we examined our largest impact areas like commuting and business travel and             cheers
         created our green commute program and invested in unified communications technology


         the next step was to go bigger still but since softchoice leases all of its facilities and doesnt       melissa
         manufacture anything it wasnt clear where to focus our energy then we had an epiphany it
