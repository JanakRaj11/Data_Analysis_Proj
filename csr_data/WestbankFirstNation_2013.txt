another year of positive results
although the surplus for the past year was smaller than recent years wfn still continued
its long run of ﬁnancial surpluses for the year ended march 2013
wfn consolidated revenues declined from 423 million in 2012 to 351 million in
2013 this was primarily due to the westside road project in partnership with mot
winding down reducing total revenue by 55 million as well a change in accounting
policy meant that 11 million of development cost charges dccs was deferred and
not recognized as revenue as would have happened in prior years other miscellaneous
revenues also declined to make up the 72 million diﬀerence
wfn expenses also declined this year from 354 million in 2013 to 312 million in
2013 the biggest major decline in expenses was once again due to the westside road
declining the same amount as revenues 55 million some other operating expenses
especially salaries and wages and materials and supplies also increased in 2013 as wfn
grew to meet increased demands for services and infrastructure
the bottom line was a surplus of 39 million in 2013 this was 3 million less than the
2012 surplus of 69 million
                                                                                                               brian conner cma
