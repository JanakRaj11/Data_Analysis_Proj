charging station throughout 2016 our solar array generated 38 mwh of power for our facility

   since 2013 our facilities manager mike has used the epa energy star portfolio manager to help us track energy
   water and greenhouse gas ghg emissions

   we calculated our energy usage in electricity natural gas and fuels such as gasoline and biodiesel for companyowned
   vehicles and employee vehicles used for business trips from this we estimated the ghg emissions associated with
   operations there was only a nominal change in energy use broken down by source

in 2016 we continued to have positive sales growth while managing to reduce our

nonprofit spotlight
western environmental law center
the western environmental law center uses the power of the law to safeguard the wildlife
wildlands and communities of the american west as a nonprofit publicinterest law firm the
center provides pro bono legal services to the conservation community

in august 2016 we offered a dollarfordollar matching gift challenge to the centers supporters
with the goal of increasing funding to protect and restore wild salmon and the rivers they call home
the matching gift challenge was wildly successful generating muchneeded funds to defend the
health of the wests salmon and rivers as eugene oregons first salmonsafe certified company we
believe that funding legal advocacy to save salmon is a very worthy investment

when we go to court to fight for wild salmon its inspiring to know that we have progressive
businesses like mountain rose herbs on our side without the support of mountain rose herbs and
other funders we would not be able to provide free legal services to our clients who are often grass
roots conservation groups by enabling us to continue offering free legal representation to groups
