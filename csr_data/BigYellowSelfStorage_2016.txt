            the crc tax on emissions from our use of electricity gas and selfsupplied solar electricity generation rose from 1200tco2 to 1640 in
            2015 and will continue to rise to 1830 in 2019 under the crc tax scheme our total tco2 emissions reduced by 289 but our crc tax
            reduction from 2011 to 2015 was 29 due to a 268 increase in the 2015 tax rate big yellow has further plans to invest in external energy
            efficient lighting solar roof top installations and accurate solar performance monitoring to manage costs and savings efficiently until the
            merger of the crc tax with the climate change levy is confirmed in 2020
            this year we disclose our scope 2 off site power station electricity use and emissions as our most material energy use by dual reporting
            this is to compare the difference in our location based national grid and market based british gas electricity supply emissions
            the table below shows that carbon dioxide emissions that are location based are almost double the market based conversion factor tco2
            this is because the british gas fuel mix disclosure for electricity generation is based on a lower carbon mix of 33 natural gas 31 nuclear
            energy 23 renewables 11 coal and 2 of other fuels this disclosure raises consumer awareness of the lower carbon content of market

               peak emissions for scope 1

            2011 was the peak emissions and benchmark year for long term performance assessment for scope 2
            these reductions were mainly due to scope 2 supplied electricity emissions our energy use strategy aims to reduce emissions annual
            energy costs and carbon taxation by proportional percentages it has also created an income from energy company payments for generation
            and exporting excess electricity to the grid from our solar electricity generation investments
            scope 1 emissions from our stores represent only 28 of our combined scope 1 and 2 emissions in the year ended 31 march 2016 less
            refrigerant replacement was required for the third year in succession and the type used had a lower ghg emission conversion factor resulting
            in a significant reduction in ghg emissions from our peak refrigerant replacement in 2015 ghg emissions from flexi office gas heating are
            also indicating a constant reduction in tco2e in the year ended 31 march 2016 due to milder but wetter winters since 2012

   2011 peak electricity use due to occupancy growth

note 2008 peak use due to new store development and occupancy growth
we have been achieving a 45 annual average reduction of ghg emissions from 2008 to 2016 from 2017 we will adopt the uk commercial
property sector real estate environmental target of a 35 annual ghg emission reduction to align with the governments 2050 goal
to achieve this target our future programmes of relamping stores externally with energy efficient lighting is planned to begin in the year
ending 31 march 2017 additional investment in roof mounted solar installations at our new and existing stores is also proposed for the year
ending 31 march 2017 we will also use our energy saving opportunity scheme esos report to implement other energy efficiency
investments where we consider they are appropriate

            certification is required at new store openings store acquisitions and when solar panels are retrofitted onto older stores we have provided
            30 epcs to date in our stores representing 42 of the portfolio of the stores certified 73 have high a or b ratings mainly due to energy
            efficient internal led relamping and investment in low carbon electricity heating and cooling selfsupply such as solar and ground source
            heat pump installations considering that the whole portfolio has internal energy efficient led lighting apart from a few recent acquisitions
            we are comfortable that the preoctober 2008 stores will at least achieve the epc b rating in the future when the opportunity arises

            breeam certification is sometimes a local planning requirement for our stores especially for new developments in high density urban
            environments the methodology assesses impacts and opportunities for enhancing the design and construction environmental aspects
            the certification includes a review of new store energy sustainable building materials water efficiency waste recycling and ecology
            the review also includes social aspects of the building life include its resource management health wellbeing modes of transport and
