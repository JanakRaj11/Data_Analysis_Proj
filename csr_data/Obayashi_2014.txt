     we are currently working on a major development complex project on a 22 hectare 53 acre site in
     shinjuku ward tokyo lead developer sumitomo realty  development co ltd
       the project will construct a pair of highrise towers located within the yamanote line loop one
     building will be a 37story office and condominium tower with a multipurpose hall while the other will
     be a 26story seismicallyisolated condominium tower with commercial facilities and a public plaza
       the condominium tower will be completed first in december 2014 while the office and condo
     minium tower will be completed in march 2016

                                                                                                                  perspective drawing of the

                           at the same time disaster debris that normally cannot be recycled was solidified in cement to create
                        upcycle blocks2 for recycling as construction material we plan to make effective use of the upcycle

                        estate and 5 others
                        due to the decrease in fair value and profitability of real estate the companies reduced the carrying values of
                        these assets to their recoverable amounts and recognized the declines as impairment losses
                        the recoverable amounts of the assets were the net realizable values which were calculated as the selling
                        prices estimated based on the japanese real estate appraisal standards less applicable sales expenses
