adidas group products in 61 countries 65 of the factories are located in the asia
 pacific region 25 in the americas and 10 in europe middle east and africa
 emea

in the course of any calendar year there have been notable changes in the number of
supplier factories we work with as suppliers are added or removed this is because
business entities are created bought or sold by the adidas group or intermediaries  such
as agents  are hired or their services are terminated the data we are reporting here is a
snapshot in time capturing the situation at the end of twelve months of these movements

factories by country

the total number of factories we worked with in 2015 decreased by 5 compared
to the previous year

2015 saw a further reduction in the number of suppliers making products in china
supplier numbers in india also declined as a result of local sourcing integration which
is driving greater consolidation as newly developing sourcing location the number of
factories in myanmar expanded further and more factories were added to the supply

chain in cambodia pakistan and vietnam overall supplier numbers in emea continued
to decline with a significant reduction in local sourcing activities in the united kingdom
and a further reduction in factories producing in turkey the number of factories in the
americas increased slightly due to the onboarding of new us embellishers

adidas group licensees

                         didas group worked with 60 licensees whose suppliers
at the end of 2015 the a
manufactured products in 384 factories across 49 countries

as shown in the table below there was a significant change in adidas groups external
licensing footprint compared to the previous year the total number of licensees
decreased by 10 and their supplier factories by 14 this is mainly due to the removal
of rockport licensees after the sale of the rockport brand in 2015

number of training sessions divided by region and type

overall the number of training sessions conducted in 2015 declined slightly
compared to the previous year although almost 2000 people still attended training
sessions the training offered in each region covered basic as well as longterm
strategic topics

there were two reasons for the drop in the total number of training sessions firstly
group training sessions especially related to sustainability training topics partly replaced
individual ones ie for more than one supplier this offered both higher efficiencies and
opportunities for crosslearning and best practice sharing among suppliers secondly
fewer fundamental training sessions were held since there were fewer factories to
onboard

by a

the total number of initial assessments  the first approval stage for new entry
factories  decreased slightly by 7 compared to 2014 performance audits for our
established suppliers showed a decline of 4 reflecting the decline in the number of
suppliers as well as the increase in the number of suppliers that moved to selfgoverning
compliance activities including auditing the total number of environmental audits fell
slightly by 3 compared to the previous year specific chemical management audits
form part of the environmental audits and have been undertaken as well in addition to
these audits compliance staff conducted multiple supplier site visits to discuss specific
remedial issues to follow up project work or to conduct training sessions

there were a total of 285 initial assessments including initial assessment followups
72 of which were undertaken in asia with china accounting for 48 of all assessments
conducted overall 49 of all candidate factories were either rejected outright or
were rejected for failure to remediate threshold issues in a timely manner for further

a total of 49 2014 47 of all active suppliers were audited in 2015 highrisk
countries in asia 1 the major sourcing region of the adidas group received extensive
monitoring in 2015 with an audit coverage that was close to 59 it is important to mention
that our compliance database also includes suppliers located in lowrisk countries as
well as suppliers designated as low priority mainly referring to subcontractors making
noncore components for a finished product while we include these types of suppliers in
our database to achieve greater visibility of our supply chain they are currently excluded
from our monitoring activities consequently audit coverage would be higher if only
highrisk countries were taken into consideration

our monitoring programme is characterised by a risk management approach which
means that we do not envisage 100 audit coverage in every country where our factories
are located although there has been a decline in audit coverage in some countries the
intensity of engagement with factories has increased particularly in respect of those
suppliers with problematic or open threshold issues or those in need of support to
improve their management systems

noncompliances identified at supplier factories

our suppliers are evaluated against a number of critical compliance issues while
zero tolerance issues  such as forced labour practices  immediately disqualify
a factory from further consideration threshold issues trigger rejection at new
factories but can be addressed in a specified timeframe at existing factories
the charts in this section illustrate the noncompliances identified during initial
assessments and initial assessment followup visits to proposed new factories
in 2015

the first chart presents the labourrelated noncompliances identified in supplier
factories a supplier must resolve identified issues before it can be accepted into the
adidas group supply chain more than twothirds of the labourrelated findings fall
 into the top three broad categories wages benefits and working hoursovertime
 wages covers  among other things  policies and practices in the factory for the timely
 and full payment of wages overtime payments and deductions benefits relates mainly
 to policies and practices for benefits social and medical insurance leave and public
 holidays working hoursovertime covers management systems for working hours
 policies and practices excessive working hours regular and overtime working hours
 as well as rest days

besides identifying noncompliances with our workplace standards at factories the
adidas group compliance team particularly focuses on the existence and implementation
 of management systems on the suppliers side the team identifies any gaps in policies
 and procedures related to specific areas such as forced labour child labour freedom of
 association or discrimination as a result the percentages shown indicate the systemic
 shortcomings of newly proposed suppliers rather than the confirmed presence of
 specific noncompliances such as child labour etc for details see page 70

the second chart shows the health  safety noncompliances identified in supplier
factories fire and electrical safety are critical areas for any potential new supplier and
together accounted for 20 of the noncompliances identified in 2015 the way chemicals
were stored and used including the presence of banned chemicals accounted for 15
of nonconformances reported a further 17 of the findings related to management
systems policies and procedures and specifically a lack of conformance with our
workplace standards and expectations for effective health  safety systems including
the recruitment and retention of qualified safety staff

key performance indicator kpi
assessment crating and erating

we audit our suppliers regularly against our workplace standards and rate them
according to their performance to do so we have established an innovative way
to rate suppliers on their ability to deliver fair healthy and environmentally sound
workplace conditions

in 2015 social compliance ratings show that 69 of our direct suppliers were
assessed as good 3c or better and environmental assessment ratings show that
a total of 81 of factories received ratings as good 3e or better

social compliance rating ckpi
the following table shows the average assessment score by unit of measure for active
suppliers each unit of measure is scored out of 100 we use a parallel system to
measure environmental performance which is described later compared to 2014 the
average score of all ckpi units of measure increased in 2015

generally newly assessed factories start with a relatively low kpi score and build and
improve their management systems and compliance performance over a period of years
despite this we noticed improvements for all units of measure and the cumulative score
in line with the fall in percentage of 1c and 2c  and increase in percentage of 3c and
4c  factory clusters

the calculation method was changed in 2012 to better reflect actual supplier performance numbers are calculated using the latest kpi assessment
rating of each active supplier




the bar graph overleaf shows comparable data for the past six years using this rating
classification

in 2015 the number of 1c category suppliers which represent the lowest performing
factories with serious issues and very weak commitment to compliance decreased to 1
of the kpiassessed factories such factories are given a oneyear grace period to move
up a grade or have their services terminated since 2013 there has been a focused effort
to improve the 2c factories which has led to a 13 reduction of suppliers in this category
in the same time period the ratio of selfgoverning factories 4c  5c doubled to 26
                                                                      72

for our main production facilities the number of suppliers achieving 3c was even higher
69 of our direct suppliers had ratings of 3c or better which represents an increase of
15 compared to 2013 this means that we have overachieved our 2015 target of 60
of our direct suppliers achieving 3c or better it is worth noting that the relative number
of factories subject to ckpi ratings has remained relatively stable at around 45
throughout the last three years overall all these factories are performing better while
part of the influence in that upward movement comes from the suppliers achieving better
scores especially from the notable move to 4c levels part of it is through consistently
winnowing out 1c and the lowest performing suppliers from the supply chain

a parallel environmental kpi tool has been developed for a much smaller pool of selected
tier 1 manufacturing operations and tier 2 material suppliers as described below

environmental compliance rating ekpi
we adopt a riskbased approach to identify those suppliers that need to be enrolled into
the adidas groups environmental programme instead of covering 100 of the supply
chain we focus our efforts on those suppliers with potentially high environmental risks
and those that represent a significant production volume for the group

to evaluate these suppliers environmental performance we have developed the
ekpi rating which uses the same approach and methodology as the ckpi rating for
labour compliance the following table presents the ekpi performance results from
2013  2015

1 numbers are calculated by using the latest ekpi assessment rating of each active supplier



suppliers covered by our environmental compliance programme have shown a steady
improvement across most subsections of the environmental key performance indicators
from 2011 to 2015 in addition the cumulative ekpi score increased by almost 7
compared to 2014 reflecting the effort that has been put into working alongside all
suppliers under coverage to drive continuous improvement in their environmental
performance

while there was a slight reduction in the total number of factories audited overall there
has been an upward trend in the ekpi scores  with previously lowscoring factories
2e moving up to higher eratings  and a further increase in the number of factories
achieving a 4e score as a result a total of 81 of factories were assessed as good
3e or better

independent fla audits

in 2015 the fair labor association fla conducted four factory assessments or
remediation verification exercises using the methodology from the sustainable
compliance initiative sci

since joining the fla in 1999 more than 300 independent external audits and verification
visits have been conducted at adidas group suppliers the number of conventional
independent monitoring visits conducted by fla accredited monitors has gone down
over the years this is because of a shift from conventional monitoring activities to
engaging in valueadded fla projects that focus on reducing and eliminating chronic
noncompliance issues or improving monitoring methodologies one such activity
in 2015 was the launch of the fla strategic plan to evaluate the compensation code
element in practice at affiliated companies

in 2015 there were four sustainable compliance initiative sci audits done at factories
in pakistan china vietnam and egypt the remainder of our 2015 audit obligation was
directed to the development and launch of the fla fair compensation strategy the
implementation of this strategy and the 3year implementation plan is a requirement
for fla participating companies and accredited programmes

in 2016 the fla will continue to focus on fully implementing the flas core programme
creating a safe space for thought leadership improving the representation of its
stakeholder groups and strengthening the organisational foundation additionally the
fla will explore opportunities for convergence with other multistakeholder initiatives
and the work being done to confront the most challenging issues in respect of workers
rights

enforcement

warning letters

warning letters are an essential part of our enforcement efforts and are triggered
when we find ongoing serious noncompliance issues that need to be addressed by
our suppliers in 2015 we issued a total of 40 warning letters across 10 countries

the largest number of warning letters continue to be issued in asia where more than
60 of all supplier factories are located compared to the previous year the overall
number of first warning letters decreased significantly by 29 the total number of
second warnings increased in 2015 with ten letters being issued suppliers who receive
second warning letters are only one step away from being notified of possible termination
of the manufacturing agreement and receive focused monitoring by the sea team the
number of third warning letters issued to business partners which result in factory
terminations went down to zero in 2015 the overall decline of warning letters is in
line with the improvement of the kpi scores as warning letters significantly reduce a
suppliers kpi score

it is difficult to generalise about the grounds for a warning letter as it may be issued
for a single unresolved nonconformance or for multiple breaches of our standards
the range of issues that resulted in warning letters in 2015 included poor management
commitment excessive working hours nonpayment of wages and benefits poor
electrical fire or chemical safety poor communication and transparency problems

terminations and rejections

we work closely with our suppliers to help them improve their performance
however where we face situations of severe or repeated noncompliance we can
and do terminate business relationships with suppliers in 2015 we terminated
agreements with three suppliers for compliance reasons that were not a result of
warning letters

we also work closely with the global sourcing organisation and other business entities
to prescreen potential new suppliers if our initial assessments uncover threshold or
zero tolerance issues suppliers are rejected
                                                                         76

in 2015 initial assessments were conducted in 206 factories during 2015 101 factories
were either rejected directly after an initial assessment due to the identification of zero
tolerance issues or were rejected with a second visit due to identification of one or more
threshold issues which means they were rejected but given the chance to remediate
noncompliance issues within a specific timeframe overall the first time rejection rate
of 49 of all new factories visited was a little higher than the previous year

in addition to the first time rejection rate we also capture the final rejection rate this
covers factories directly rejected after the first visit that have no chance of a second visit
as well as factories rejected after being visited a second time at the end of 2015 we had
a final rejection rate of 10 this shows the importance and impact of preapproval
screening as well as the effort taken by the suppliers to resolve issues and come into
conformance with our workplace standards the remediation of factory issues is
beneficial for workers as it raises the bar in terms of better and timelier pay improved
benefits reduced hours and the legal protection of formal employment contracts as well
as significant improvements in basic health  safety within the workplace

suppliers who have threshold issues which are serious but correctable noncompliances
are normally given three months to remediate those issues before being reaudited for
final sea acceptance as in previous years china dominated the number of new supplier
initial assessments and corresponding rejection rates were high

certifications obtained by athletic footwear supplier
sites producing for the international market

in 2015 we worked with 31 athletic footwear suppliers who are certified in accordance
with the international environmental management standard iso 14001 andor the
workplace health and safety management standard ohsas 18001 these suppliers
produced around 98 of the a  didas groups global athletic footwear sourcing volume

we have limited control over the direct environmental impacts of the manufacturing
process and how our suppliers act the best way to influence the environmental impacts
of our suppliers factories is to encourage the introduction of environmental management
systems and we have made implementing such a system mandatory for all our core
suppliers achieving certification to a management system requires factory managers
to plan manage and review their own environmental performance

freight types used to ship adidas and reebok products

in 2015 we again tracked the environmental impact related to the transport of our
goods compared to previous years there have been some changes which were caused
by an adjustment in product classification some product groups are now classified as
hardware instead of apparel leading to an increase in the percentage of hardware
transported by truck all in all the vast majority of our shipments take place via sea

reducing volatile organic compounds

volatile organic compounds vocs which are typically found in solvents used in our
manufacturing process can  in high concentration  cause breathing difficulties
and other health problems for production workers for this reason we have been
requesting for more than a decade that our footwear suppliers significantly reduce
the use of vocs in their manufacturing

by applying innovative as well as environmentallysound bonding and priming
technologies while following the adidas group guidelines on the use of chemicals our
athletic footwear suppliers have been able to reduce the use of vocs from well above
100 grams per pair to below 20 grams

2015 is the year of our biggest success so far we achieved an alltime low of 156 grams
of vocs per pair performance improvement in every single country compared to 2013
shows that this is the result of hard work and a true commitment across our entire
manufacturing base

green company data

since its launch in 2008 the green company programme and its ambitious 2015
targets have driven continuous improvement in the environmental impacts of our
own site operations as of the end of 2015 we have well achieved our targets for
water savings per employee household waste reduction and reducing carbon
emissions but had challenges to meet the targets for paper reduction and energy
consumption per square metre the data reported covers 48 of our corporate sites
including administration offices own production sites and distribution centres


with water savings of 28 per employee we have well exceeded our targeted savings of
20 our overall household waste volume per employee was reduced by 27 exceeding
the 2015 target of a 25 reduction furthermore we achieved our 2015 target of reducing
carbon emissions by 30 per square metre these savings have been mainly achieved
through energy efficiency projects and several carbon offsetting programmes some of
our sites are still facing common challenges in accessing greener energy and scaling
up their use of renewable energy however reducing carbon emissions will remain a
focus of the green company initiative

our investment in more than 40 energy efficiency projects over the last years supported
through our greenenergy fund has strongly contributed to energy savings at our
corporate sites leading to a reduction of our energy consumption of 15 per square
metre but we have faced challenges to meet our ambitious target of 20 savings in
2015 especially the increased ecommerce business and growing number of employees
have influenced energy savings per square metre at our distribution centres and
administration offices the same is true for paper reduction whereas our administration
offices exceeded the 2015 target to cut our paper consumption by 50 per employee
the increased amount of products handled at our distribution centres continues to be
a challenge to reducing our overall paper consumption in total a reduction of 38 of
paper per employee was achieved by the group of reporting sites including administration
offices own production sites and distribution centres

during 2015 we developed and launched the second phase of our green company
strategy including targets to be achieved by 2020 read more about the results in our

environmental management systems
the green company initiative has been the driver for successfully implementing tools
that help us to continuously reduce the environmental impacts of our corporate sites
one of them is our shared environmental management system ems that is certified
according to the international iso 14001 standard the initial goal of the green company
initiative was to certify our five main brand headquarters including the adidas group
headquarters in germany the adidas reebok and taylormade headquarters in the us
as well as the ccm hockey headquarters in canada after the successful certification of
these sites to iso 14001 in 2010 and 2011 we decided to extend the system and introduce
the iso 14001 standard at additional sites including our distribution centres in 2014
we certified our 13th site the new central distribution centre in rieste germany a list
of all certified sites is given in the table below

community affairs

community affairs statistics

in 2015 we saw an increase in donation requests compared to the previous two
years donation or funding requests significantly varied in nature and purpose
incoming requests were carefully reviewed against the adidas group corporate
giving guidelines to ensure alignment with corporate policies guidelines and budget
framework

compared to 2014 the number of supported projects decreased which reflects our
more stringent approach in conducting needs assessments this helped us to focus on
supporting fewer but more impactful organisations

the amount of product donations decreased which arises from fewer product placements
in north america due to strategic changes in this market in the emea region we
targeted major volumes of product donations to support people in severe need such
as refugees at the turkishsyrian border as well as in germany in 2015 to effectively
respond to the refugee crisis in europe the adidas group expanded its financial support
in order to ensure an even more purposeful support compared to previous years we
saw an increase of volunteer hours of our global workforce which is the result of rising
employee involvement in particular in the context of refugee support

with our data tracking system we aim to fully cover activities from all subsidiaries
worldwide we are constantly reviewing our approach and the system to improve data
quality
