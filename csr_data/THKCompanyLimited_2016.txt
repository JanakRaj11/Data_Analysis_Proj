attracted by reliable performance
backed up by actual testing

information technology has spread throughout the society
we live in in recent years the medical industry has rapid
ly incorporated electronic information systems we now
have electronic health records and other kinds of medical
information systems that contain all sorts of information
from ct and mri images and treatment plans for incoming
patients to explanatory documents and consent forms for
surgeries and the enormous volumes of data collected are
stored on server computers if the servers were destroyed
in a big earthquake or some other disaster its no exagger
ation to say that virtually all medical activity would come to
a halt not only that the data in an electronic health record
is important private information belonging to the patient
and we have a responsibility to properly protect it another                akinobu kitagawa assistant manager information service division

enable a patient to give informed consent for an operation

     thks waterpowered generating system



     carving out a new future with technology and imagination
     light heat and motion from flowing water

     thk entered the ﬁeld of windpowered generation in 2009 when it launched an internal project aimed at developing key compo
     nents for wind turbines exploring new uses for the technology developed in that initiative thk has now applied it to waterpow
     ered generation following an initial test in taiwan in 2012 thk tested its new system at the kanagawa prefecture sagami river
     left bank land improvement district in 2014 continuing its campaign to help unleash the vast potential of renewable energy




     thk technology stands out
     the use of irrigation canals for waterpowered generation is relatively new there are strict limitations on the extent to which
     irrigation canals can be modiﬁed since any obstruction of the water ﬂow would have a major negative impact on the crop
     being watered for conventional waterpowered generation falling water must be devised which enables large volumes of
     power to be generated but requires major construction work that often costs at least ten times as much as the generating
     equipment itself
         thks system which generates electricity by means of a water wheel alone costs relatively little and neither damages nor
     obstructs irrigation canals since it doesnt require damming the ﬂow to create falling water theres little likelihood of ﬂooding
     and refuse and other ﬂoating matter can easily be cleared to permit stable operation

the great potential of renewable
energy is worth the cost

as someone who works with irrigation ive always thought
people should be more aware of the importance of irrigation
canals and not just because they carry water which is a
source of life im glad to have had the chance to help ex
plore their potential through thks project because i think
it will help the public better understand the ways in which
canals can help improve living conditions
   when i got my ﬁrst look at thks waterpowered gen
erator i saw right away that it wouldnt damage the canal
or anything else since the water wheel is the only thing
that goes into the water i knew this would be a valuable
experiment ordinarily hydroelectric projects require major
construction work so the simple design of thks system                                                    kazuhiro shiowaki engineer
was very appealing
   i work in agriculture so i have a basic interest in protect
ing the environment for the sake of the future i feel we
should be working hard to utilize renewable energy as a            theyre similar i hope thk will put its industrial insights to
countermeasure against global warming even if its a little       good use in relation to agriculture and come up with some
costly at present unlike solar and wind power waterpow         imaginative new ideas and technology i really hope the
ered generation can be available 24 hours a day provided          system that was tested in 2015 will be perfected and put
you have a steady ﬂow so it has great potential as a source       on the market id like to see thk continue to develop ways
of renewable energy if we put it to practical use it could be    to take advantage of the latent beneﬁts of irrigation canals
used to run the systems that control automatic sluice gates       and i hope people will learn about its efforts so far
which we already have so the power generated wouldnt
necessarily just be sold off but could actually serve as an
energy source on its own
   agriculture and industry are two separate ﬁelds of course
but both are devoted to producing things so in that sense

            why did furuno electric start using
                                                                                                               what convinced you to go with thk
            thk products

     our relationship with thk began about 10 years ago when                                           the development target was faster upanddown motion for
     we were still using sliding mechanisms on drive shafts for                                        our new product even if only slightly faster to get there we
     our products for the electronic devices on marine vessels                                       realized that we needed a mechanism that uses rolling mo
     sensors have to be lowered into the water from the bottom                                         tion not sliding motion and it was thk who had the best

     direction and we decided to use thk products in the drive                                        for largediameter specifications the product would have to
     shaft that raises and lowers the sensors for research and                                        be specially ordered but thk had standard products readily
     development purposes it was important to be able to speed                                        available so we went with thk
     up the raising and lowering of sonar devices by using a                                             in the past it took time for the sonar equipment to be low

     product we were able                                                                             and down very quickly so now when they locate a school of

nice everyone was so when it came time to find a job i chose thk in the
morning i work in the office scanning the order slips and drawings that get sent
to the factory and in the afternoon i do packing work this is only my first year
as an employee but i was able to use my packing experience and ended up
representing yamanashi in the abilympics coming into this years competition
thk employees had won the gold medal in the productpacking event three
years in a row i had my sights set on winning a medal too so i worked hard
to get better and ended up winning the bronze a fellow thk employee from
the yamaguchi plant won the gold medal so now thk has taken four in a
row which is really great to show my appreciation to all the people who have
supported and encouraged me i hope to win and make it five in a row next year

es so far ive only been involved in packing and processing orders but id like
to try my hand at other kinds of work in the future

100meter and 200meter race at a national sports competition for people with
disabilities held in nagasaki my goal now is to compete in a tournament called

skills in september 2014 i competed in the wordprocessing division of the
regional abilympics i didnt make it into the national tournament but im still
acquiring more skills i have levelfour certification now and im aiming for level

to enhance the efficiency of the plants air conditioning and
thereby reduce power consumption a layer of insulation has

on the roofs inner surface by as much as 17c resulting
in a 20 reduction in energy use compared to 2013 and
decreasing peak powerconsumption which is especially
important in summer when demand is high other sections
