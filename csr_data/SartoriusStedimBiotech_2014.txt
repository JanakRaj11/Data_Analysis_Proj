production and supply chain management

sartorius stedim biotech operates a well developed
global production network our largest sites are the
plants at goettingen in germany and aubagne in
france followed by the production facilities at
bangalore in india yauco in puerto rico and
guxhagen in germany our advanced production
facilities support the efficient manufacturing
processes and short lead and order processing times
we need to maintain our competitive edge around the
world

after we completed a number of significant capacity
expansion projects in goettingen guxhagen and in
yauco in the previous year we implemented a series of
small and mediumscale projects in the reporting year
to extend our manufacturing capacity at the
goettingen site in april 2013 we opened a new
building for manufacturing the plastic parts we use in
products like singleuse filters and bags the
substantially expanded production area provides ample
space for the installation of additional injection
molding machines the first of which were
commissioned during the reporting year we also
hired more employees to expand production capacity
significantly at the new plant in puerto rico in
response to persistently high demand for singleuse
bags from the pharmaceutical industry elsewhere we
acquired a building directly adjacent to our aubagne
facility in order to increase the space available at the
site for producing singleuse bags and plan to move
additional machinery there in mid2014 moreover at
our chinese site in beijing we installed a cleanroom in
which we intend to manufacture fluid management
products for the local market

initial preparatory steps have been taken for the
installation of a further casting machine at the
goettingen site to provide greater capacity and
flexibility in our filter membrane manufacturing
operations work to install the machine is scheduled to
commence in 2014

     sartorius stedim biotech does not supply its products
     directly to end consumers but rather to manufacturers
     of pharmaceuticals foods and chemicals and also to
     research and development laboratories to ensure that
     our products satisfy the most stringent quality
     requirements we employ rigorous quality checks and
     advanced manufacturing methods and processes such
     as cleanroom technology these manufacturing
     methods and processes are subject to constant review
     under our continuous improvement processes moreover
     and are refined appropriately as requirements evolve
     our successful completion of a host of annual audits by
     customers and our accreditation under iso 9001 and
     iso 13485 together document the high standard of
     quality achieved in sartorius stedim biotech products
     and processes to respond rapidly to any product
     defects and minimize any adverse consequences
     sartorius stedim biotech has established a traceability
     system that enables us to recall an entire product

     future business development

     the outlook for fiscal 2014 incorporates the risks and
     opportunities outlined in this report as we supply the
     biopharmaceutical industry our business development
     is generally driven by stable longterm trends
     therefore economic fluctuations play less of a role
     than for example decisions of regulatory agencies
     regarding drug approvals or the use medications

     assuming that the trends toward biomanufacturing of
     pharmaceuticals and increasing utilization of single
     use technologies will continue we forecast that sales
     revenue will rise by about 11 to 14 in constant
     currencies in 2014 the cell culture media and small
     scale fermentation businesses acquired are projected
     to contribute around six percentage points to this
     growth management expects that the underlying
     ebitda margin will rise to around 235 without
     any currency effects considered please refer to the
     definition for the operating earnings margin on page 25
     and  or the glossary

     moreover in 2014 we plan to invest about 6 to 8
     of sales revenue in the expansion of our production
     capacities among other projects

     with regard to our financial position we forecast that
     by the end of 2014 the ratio of net debt to underlying
     ebitda will edge down slightly without taking any
     potential portfolio changes into account
