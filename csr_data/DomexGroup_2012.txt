        message from vice general director


in 2010 puma invited our company to join a project called
global action network for transparency in the supply chain
our taipei head office decided to support our factory in this
endeavor in order to understand our issues challenges and how
to be a sustainable factory

after a series of trainings and with assistance from our head
office our factory finally finished the first sustainability report
completing this report was a difficult undertaking firstly we
have no prior experience writing reports based on gri
guidelines secondly we do not have any professional and
systematic methods for data collection and research we also
lack the human resources to do this lastly the most difficult
challenge for us was to finish this report in english however
because of our iron resolve and hard work we were able to
overcome these obstacles our report is in compliance with gri
guidelines and will provide useful information to our
stakeholders

to my knowledge the level b report is more extensive and requires more data for indicators research than the
level c report i think it will be meaningful for my team if this report could be compared with the level c
report by comparing the reports we will be able to identify what weaknesses we have what challenges we
need to overcome and what goals to set for future years

sustainability management is not a slogan it is a permanent goal for us to work on i believe pursuing
excellence is always our goal by providing a safe healthy and stable working environment we will create a
sustainable workplace that our stakeholders can trust

finally i sincerely thank the taipei head office for its great support and applaud all of my colleagues for their
hard work i also would like to extend my appreciation to puma for offering my factory this great opportunity
to learn from and work with other companies


sincerely

     history

      wing instructions from patrick tu former managing director of domex group in 1992 mr jerry lin
      flew to vietnam to explore the companys business potential with a few of his coworkers due to its
      good business prospects domex group established the first factory in vietnam in 1996 and built a
      second factory in 2001 they were 100 foreign investment companies since then mr lin has been
      appointed vice general director of the two factories in 2010 these two factories were combined and
      became domex vietnam co ltd the factory

                                                                                    sustainability report 2011    6

to satisfy with business needs our factory purchased advanced
production equipments in differ years we purchased two brand new
laser cut panels machines in 2005 and 2006 respectively




in 2006 we purchased an auto fabric cutting machine with
usd200000 and bought another on next year




from 2003 we established washing department and all garment
wash facilities were equipped with around usd 500000




key impacts risks and opportunities

impacts and risks
the weakened global economy has driven the competitions in vietnam which has reduced our
orders and profit
employment opportunities have increased in vietnam especially in the middle and southern provinces
according to our data our employees are mostly from the middle and southern provinces of vietnam in
2011 there were around 104 employees quitted their job and around 65 of them were from the middle
and southern provinces because of this reason our factory is starting to face the challenge of shortage
of workforces
according to bbcs reporting on august 2nd 2011 vietnams consumer price index was up 23 from
2010 which is the highest rate of inflation in asia furthermore vietnam government has announced its
plan to increase minimum wages starting next year which will accelerate the speed of inflation

opportunities
better relationships and ties with our clients are keys for the future of our factory we must all work
together with our clients to insure that we deliver outstanding products to our end customers
we have employed very experienced sewers to produce a variety of apparel products with high quality at
low costs



                                                                               sustainability report 2011   7

stakeholder engagement


according to the guidelines we first identified our
stakeholders in this process we spent a few days listing
comparing and prioritizing our potential stakeholders by
means of our study we finally identified employees
clients local community and trade unions as our top
four stakeholders after that we launched several meetings
with the representatives of stakeholders and worked out the
following table perceived by these stakeholders as the most
important issues

based on the following stakeholders expectations we worked out twenty indicators as the targets of
this report research the detailed information of twenty indicators please find gri performance
indicators which is listed in page 40 to page 42




                                                                            sustainability report 2011   12

       economic


according to the gri guidelines there are three aspects for economic which are economic
performance market presence and indirect economic impacts we choose economic
performance and market presence as for our aspects that important to our stakeholders
management approach to economic performance
clients  solutions
customers are the driving force behind domex our constant dialogue with clients drives quality and delivery
performance we continue to invest into new methods and enhanced good products that benefit the
professionals we serve for reaching this our factory is considering to hire more managers to enhance our
services secondly we will invest new production equipments for promoting our products quality


      economic performance

      there are four indicators in this aspect because of stakeholders concerns we select ec1 as our
      management approach

      this is the first practice for our factory to study this indicator in the past years what we did was to
      present yearly miscellaneous expenses to our head office in taipei without any analysis and this office
      will provide us feedback of yearly financial performance we do not need to set any financial goals or
      policies

      based on the guidelines we collected revenue and cost data separately the table in your right you can
      find the economic values compared with 2010 and 2011

there are some explanations for the red figures firstly inflation rate in 2011 reached 133 and was the
primary factor for the losses secondly employee salaries excluding overtime in 2011 rose around
12 which was a difficult challenge to our factory clearly comprehensive and detailed investigations
were needed and had to be conducted as quickly as possible




                                                                                             sustainability report 2011   14

we can find three indicators in this aspect and we chose ec7 procedures for local hiring and proportion
of senior management hired from the local community as our target

administrative department is included into the senior management but the head of hr department is
excluded because hr department is one department of administrative department

       environment


in the category of environment according to the guidelines there are nine aspects and thirty indicators we
chose three aspects which are energy water and emissions effluents and waste for our review the six
indicators are illustrated as follows

      management approach to environment

         enhance team work
      in 2010 the sustainability team was assigned the task of managing daily matters however after a
      year of implementation we realized that our main challenge was in enhancing team work in the
      internal departments in addition mr vincent liao who originally headed the sustainability team
      resigned within two months as a result we had to act quickly to fill the position with someone who has
      extensive experiences in the field to take on the work

        domexs operation
      the environmental performance of our factory is measured in terms of energy use water use waste
      consumption and etc we are trying to conduct a paperless operation in our office this operation
      could save 30 of our waste consumption


      en3 direct energy consumption by primary energy source


      definition
      direct energy gasoline and diesel
      indirect energy electricity
      total amounts of direct and indirect energy consumption can be calculated and obtained from our
      invoice gasoline and diesel are used in our factory and diesel is for boilers and some transportation
      tools and gasoline is only for transportation tools diesel and gasoline are purchased from local gas
      stations the two direct energies are not renewable in our factory

      performance
         diesel consumption
      the diesel consumption in 2011 decreased compared to that in 2010 in 2010 the consumption for
      diesel was around 9966 gigajoule of which 1272 gigajoule was for transportation usage and 8694 for
      production boilers
      in 2011 consumption for diesel was 8617 gigajoule of which 1513 gigajoule was for transportation
      usage and 7104 for production
      we can see that diesel consumption in 2011 decreased by 1349 gigajoule which is a reduction of
      around 1353 the following charts you can find the diesel total consumption of 2010 and 2011



                                                                                      sustainability report 2011   16

             diesel consumption for 2010 and 2011




     gasoline consumption
  gas consumption in 2011 increased the consumption of gas in 2011 was 1725 gigajoule this number is
  larger than 1468 gigajoule in 2010

  the increased consumption percentage for 2011 is 1487 which corresponds to 257 gigajoule you can
  find the gas consumption for those two years in the following chart



            gasonline consumption in 2010 and 2011




our analysis
in general the direct energy consumption in 2011 decreased by 955 the total direct energy consumption for
2011 was 10342 gigajoule which was a decrease by 1092 gigajoule from the consumption in 2010
from our analysis we determined that the main reasons for the reduction are
firstly the quantity of orders in 2011 was less than that in 2010




                                                                                    sustainability report 2011   17

firstly the quantity of orders in 2011 was less than that in 2010
secondly our factory engaged in several projects headed by puma in 2011 and these projects were
helpful for us to reduce energy consumption
lastly through our investigation the main reason for gas consumption increased in 2011 is we
supported our cars to another factory in vietnam for materials and final products shipping this
factory is located in xa phong phu huyen cau ketrà vinh việt nam the distance between our
factory and that factory is around 200 kilometers usually the shipping between two factories was
managed twice a week in 2011 for saving gas consumption our head office is considering to
purchase a truck for that factory
according to our sustainability strategy the goal of direct energy consumption in 2011 was around
953 gigajoule and this has achieved our original goal of 5 of reduction


en4 indirect energy consumption by primary source


definition
according to guidelines 31 electricity is the primary form of indirect energy and it is purchased
directly from the thu đức electricity company all machines in the factory are powered and
illuminated by electricity

performance
electricity consumption in 2011 was around 7363 gigajoule and 9211 gigajoule for 2010 the
consumption in 2011 was reduced by 1848 gigajoule which is a reduction of around 25 you can
find detailed comparisons in the following chart

analysis
according to our data the number of employees in 2010 was around 2517 which was more than the
2119 employees in 2011 after calculation electricity consumption per employee was 366 gigajoule
for 2010 and 347 gigajoule for 2011 which hit our goal of 348 gigajoule in 2011
we are able to conclude that the electricity consumption decreased from 2010 to 2011 which is good
news for us after the efforts we made in 2011


en8 total water withdrawal by source

operation in factory

from our data total water consumption was 203993 m3 in 2010 and 96263 m3 in 2011 this is a
reduction of around 5281 which is a big success in our sustainability management




                                                                                    sustainability report 2011   19

analysis
the major improvement in reducing water consumption was a result of green biz project report
in 2011 we joined green biz project held by vietnam chamber of commerce and industry vcci
this project was a full package to implement environment protection and business sustainability
development after four modules of training a group of project experts conducted an onsite evaluation
of our factory the visitors found that water consumption in our factory was a serious problem and there
was high possibility of leakage in underground water we found that water consumption was
significantly reduced since we repaired the leaking equipment
according to our origianl goal of water consumption we hope the rate of water consmption reduction
could be controled at 8643 m3 per employee apparently we have reached the goal through our hard
workinng


en16 total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions
by weight


data collection
our factory calculated the greenhouse gas emissions through monthly direct and indirect emissions
in our companys operations the ironing section and washing department need steam generated from
boilers the boilers operate on diesel and directly generate co2 emissions and contribute to the
greenhouse effect
some of our company vehicles run on diesel and gasoline emissions are produced by these vehicles as
well
all production equipment operations and illuminators run on electricity which generate indirect co2
emission


data and analysis
according to guidelines 31 there are three factors causing direct co2 gas emission in our factory they
are gasoline gas diesel and electricity
for gasoline the total amount consumed in 2011 was 46630 liters producing around 129 tons of direct
co2 gas emission in 2010 gasoline consumption was 39680 liters producing 110 tons according to
investigation our factory supported two vehicles for tra vinh factory our another factory in southern
vietnam and this caused increases of gasoline consumption in 2011
the following chart shows gas emission in 2010 and 2011

the main reason for the reduction is contributed that the orders related to washing and steaming were reduced
with around 13

in terms of this indicator we reached our goal in 2011




                                                                                     sustainability report 2011   22

en21 total water discharge by quality and destination

operation in factory
our factory has two sources of waste water one is from food hygiene consisting of discharge from
canteens and the other is from restrooms
the factorys waste water is discharged to linh trung export processing zone epz and is treated
there due to the epzs regulation our factorys waste water discharge should be compliant with the
standards of epz

water discharge plan
it is not easy for our factory to make a plan for annual water discharge the main reason is that we cannot
accurately predict the next years orders because of this uncertainty our factory is unable to offer a
concrete water discharge plan
however we make some rough estimation at the end of every year for example the general affair
department ga department announced the goal at the end of 2010 that water discharge in 2011 goes
to 170000 m3 this estimation was rough but it was an indicator

data and analysis
in 2010 the total water discharge volume reached 161222 m3 the average monthly consumption
volume was around 13450 m3 or 65 m3 per employee in 2011 the total water discharge decreased
dramatically the total volume in 2011 was around 75220 m3 and the average monthly consumption
was 6268 m3 or 296 m3 per person
the reduction percentage from 2010 to 2011 hit 5334 which was a really big achievement for our
factory you can find the water discharge data in the chart below
since our factory is located in epz the factorys waste water will be treated by epz and the treatment
results must be compliant with standard of vietnams regulations

analysis
in comparison to 2010 the total amount of waste in 2011 was reduced by around 42 tons or around
365 the reasons for this decrease are
firstly the quantity of orders decreased by around 20
secondly the factory made a lot of efforts to reduce waste we arranged several trainings for cleaners
and employees offering them the procedures of disposing of waste the right methods for recycling the
trainings were helpful to our waste management

employment types
there are four types in our research and four employment types could be defined as follows
first level vice general director
second level senior management including the title of manager and senior manager in the factory
third level middle level management team indicating line leaders up to the title of vice manager
fourth level operating level including employees of office staff sewers etc
according to our data the fourth level was the largest portion in 2011 which was 2193 employees and
accounted for 96 of our employees

employment contracts
we have three kinds of employment contracts which are definite contract indefinite contract and
probation contract
through our data the percentage of indefinite contracts reached 54 which means 54 of our
employees worked in our factory for more than three years from this data we can find that more than
half percent of our employees who signed indefinite contract with us and we are glad to see this

workforce breakdown by geography region
the largest portion of our employees in 2011 was from zone 2 which means most of our employees
come from provinces in the middle of vietnam the following figure illustrates the workforce
breakdown by region

reduced by 16  compared to that in 2010 the chart below provides more detailed comparison
on the other hand in terms of employment type we find the largest reduction of four types is the fourth level
operating level this is a red flag for upper management according to our data reduction of our orders
quantity is the main cause of this reduction

from our data the main reason for those employees who left the employment was to find new job in
their home town where were in central or southern provinces of vietnam according to our knowledge
currently it is easier for residents who live in central or southern provinces of vietnam to get their
employment opportunity




                                                                              sustainability report 2011   31

la 4 percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining
agreements


the vietnam general confederation of labour vgcl is the national umbrella organization for all
trade unions no union in vietnam can be formed without the permission and approval of the vgcl and
unions must operate under its umbrella

under this circumstance employees in our factory are voluntarily to join trade unions


data and explanations
in our factory all employees are entitled to join collective bargaining agreements cba according to
the labor laws of vietnam
according to our data there were 2254 employees who joined cba which accounted for 9954 of
the workforce in 2011 from our investigation the reason for the small portion of employees 046
who were not in the list of trade unions in 2011 was that these workers were not qualified according to
our internal regulations after signing an official contract with us our employees are able to join trade
unions



la 5 minimum notice period  s  regarding operational changes
including whether it is specify in collective agreements

facts and explanations
according to trade unions feedback our factory does not have a written procedure to ensure the
factorys practice of timely discussion of significant operational changes and engaging with its
employees and their representatives to negotiate and implement these changes
in many aspects of factory operations communication between trade union and upper management
needs to be promoted for example upper management seldom attends trade unions regular meetings
this is an issue for upper management to address
although the factory does not have specific rules or procedures for communicating with trade union the
factory management team always discusses with the president of the trade union before any important
decisions are made

our efforts in the future
firstly we need to create new procedures to regulate the minimum notice periods of ensuring timely
discussion of significant operational changes and engaging with our employees and trade union
representatives to negotiate and implement these changes which may have positive or negative
implications for workers




                                                                               sustainability report 2011   32

effective communication will be the best tool to promote management efficiency from now on the
representative of upper management needs to engage meetings with employees and trade union

     absentee rate comparision in 2010 and 2011




for ir according to our data there were ten injuries in 2010 and twenty injuries for 2011 on top of that
total number of employees in 2011 is less than the total number of 2010 this is reason why the ir of
2011 is higher than the rate of 2010
from our investigation we found out two factors caused the increasing of ar in 2011 firstly some
female workers asked their personal leaves mostly 30 days after their maternity leaves to take care
of their newborn baby secondly another major reason contributing to the high absentee rate is
because employees use their personal leave days prior to their official end date

hr5 operations and significant suppliers identified in which the right
to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining may
be violated or at significant risk and actions taken to support
these rights


trade union operations
our employees are able to freely form and join trade unions in our factory each group elects a
representative all employees in our factory have the right to join trade unions and almost all employees
are members of the factorys trade union
the trade union board is the management center of our trade union there are fifteen representatives on
the board including the trade union chairman the board calls for a regular meeting every month and
holds a trade union congress every two years in the trade union congress all representatives are
selected chairmanchairwoman is elected by all representatives in congress


our beliefs
freedom of association refers to workers right to create trade unions that represent them collective
bargaining is the process of negotiation between trade unions and employers both are fundamental
rights and they are linked collective bargaining cannot work without freedom of association because
workers views cannot be properly represented workers must be free to choose how they are to be
represented and employers must not interfere with this process
based on this belief our factory has never taken any actions to interfere with activities of trade unions
we always do our best to support trade unions in their operations


our key action points
l allow union representatives to access workers in the workplace
l allow workers to form or join unions of their choice and not force them to join a particular union
l comply with national laws regarding financial support for any unionworkers association
l allow workers to meet freely without management present
l do not interfere with manipulate or control any unions present in the workplace
l do not consider union activities or use blacklists when hiring or terminating workers
l consult with unions when required to do so

hr6 operation identified as having significant risk for incidents of child
labor and measures taken to contribute to the elimination of child labor


our beliefs
regardless of national laws or coc of our clients child labor has been considered as one of our zero
tolerance issues we have established a clear written policy against child labor and determined specific
working conditions for young workers


facts and analysis
to meet our internal needs taipei head office hired experienced senior managers to establish the
administrative department in 2007 one of the department responsibilities is to work out with the
clients compliance team and help each factory meet the clients requirements
with assistance from taipei head office our factory established an administrative department in 2007
and started a series of works to improve the hr department
our factory has had an established hiring procedure for many years child labor is absolutely forbidden
this is zero tolerance policy
in 2010 a young worker was hired in our factory without following our hiring procedure our factory
was embarrassed by this incident and we learned from this mistake
abolition of child labor has been our policy for many years and we are proud to say that this policy has
been truly realized


hr7 operation identified as having significant risk for incidents of
forced or compulsory labor and measures taken to contribute to
the elimination of forced or compulsory labor

our policy
our factory will not use involuntary labor of any kind including prison labor indentured labor bonded
labor or labor obtained through human trafficking or slavery employees shall not be required to make
deposits or surrender identity papers upon commencing employment with the company
overtime work must be strictly voluntary and must never deprive workers of adequate sleep freedom
or relaxation

facts and analysis
this policy has been practiced for many years infractions to this policy have rarely occurred
a few workers grievances indicated that group leaders request for overtime occurred once in a while
through our investigations most of the occurrences were caused by personal matters the
disagreements were solved with patience



                                                                              sustainability report 2011   38
