more than enough with additional financial resources we
could easily implement a multiple of such additional carbon         with climate friendly regards
offset projects in 2011 we were even able to generate more
co2 reduction certificates in our projects than customers
could purchase from us global demand and the opportuni

pipeline is full to bursting

in switzerland alone or the soon almost 40 billion tons of
co2 around the world for our fight on the road to achieve a
low carbon society we still need much more myclimate pow

emissions this is where our climate education comes into
play with a variety of handson projects we are mobilising
thousands of students youths adults and companies just
one highlight the climate pioneer celebration in november
2011 where the solar impulse pioneers bertrand piccard and
andré borschberg along with swisscom honoured young cli

is now being replicated all across switzerland also the co
operation with companies bears fruits the carbon manage

of hundreds of products and companies labelled climate
friendly products and consulted companies about how to
work more efficient and reduce their carbon footprint at the
same time

 10 years m                                                        many people do not want to wait for the decisions of
           councillor doris leuthard                               tomorrow they want to negotiate today  voluntarily but
                                                                    concretely this explains myclimates success i would like to
ten years is generally a short time to implement an idea and        thank and show my appreciation to all those who have con
turn it into something sustainable myclimate has succeeded        tributed to this
in doing this the former swiss federal institute of technol
ogy eth spinoff organisation has become an internation         federal councillor doris leuthard

 yclimate negotiates where many politicians citizens and         transport energy and communications
companies stop short whilst everyone agrees something
needs to be done to combat the increasing greenhouse gas
emissions the declarations of intent and fine words are often
not put into concrete actions the responsibility and the im
plementation are passed on an example of this is the slug
gish process of the international negotiations on a climate
protection agreement designed to replace the kyoto proto
col which will expire in 2013


but there is another way the foundation myclimate is mak
ing an important contribution to climate protection through
its daily work it shows what every individual person and
company can contribute to climate protection through in
forming and sensitising as part of the climate education pro
gramme the next generation will learn how greenhouse gas
emissions can be avoided national projects provide examples
of how new technologies can reduce emissions for unavoid          didier martenet
able greenhouse gas emissions myclimate offers the oppor
tunity to offset these through investments in carbon offset
projects avoid  reduce  offset is consequently one of the
principles the foundation stands for this principle must also
apply at international and national level time is short every
country must fulfil this responsibility and tread the path to
wards a climate friendly economy the goal must be a broadly
supported just climate regime for this we require clear rules
and legally binding national target values on emission reduc
tions or emission control
