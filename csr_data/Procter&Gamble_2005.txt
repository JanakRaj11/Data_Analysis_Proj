philanthropic efforts weve asked ourselves whether our efforts         we welcome your interest in our efforts and achievements and
and dollars are working as hard as they can weve concluded that        remain dedicated to touching lives and improving life in all that we
we can make a bigger more enduring difference by focusing pg           do its our purpose and our business
philanthropy more sharply on helping children in need to live learn
and thrive

as you will read in this report we are collaborating with global
partners such as unicef and the world health organization with
national governments and with ngos to offer programs around the
world that support the development of children in need from birth

we have also established safe drinking water for children as pgs
corporate signature program of our live learn and thrive efforts
with the us centers for disease control we have developed
technology that can purify even heavily contaminated drinking water
with a single sachet that costs pennies and treats 10 liters of water
this is critical because 5000 children die every day from diseases
caused by unsafe drinking water

enough pur to provide 150 million liters of safe drinking water but
getting pur to survivors was a huge challenge                          million liters of safe
the ﬁrst hurdle was getting product out of karachi and to the
affected areas urgently we ﬁgured that every day lost to bureaucracy   drinking water to the
meant more than 100000 packets werent getting to tsunami
survivors pg pakistan psi and americares waiting to transport
the product had to work out alternative export arrangements
                                                                        developing world and in

with pur started making runs from karachi to our humanitarian
                                                                        disaster relief during the
aid partners teams worked day and night to move nearly 10
million packets americares booked a plane to ﬁll up in karachi         past year
with 45 million packets to go to indonesia the plane came back
to karachi to be crammed with nearly 5 million packets for sri
lanka the organization worldvision took the job of getting the
pur through customs and distributing it to various aid groups to
bring to the survivors

various groups worked with pg to distribute instructions on how
to use pur the organization samaritans purse translated the
instructions into both tamil and sinhala

at the start of the tsunami disaster it seemed inevitable that a
second wave of deaths would occur from the lack of safe drinking
water but the world health organization is reporting that due
to the enormous relief efforts a major disease outbreak has been
avoided pg people who worked on getting pur to tsunami
survivors feel fantastic about that knowing that our work has
played an important role in this humanitarian effort




collaborative efforts succeed
following the december 2004 tsunami pg worked with
americares population services international unicef
worldvision care aquaya and the international federation of
red cross and red crescent societies to get enough pur to hard
hit areas to make 150 million liters of water drinkable this effort
is credited with saving many lives by preventing postdisaster
illness from contaminated water

unique recycling effort produces fuel

environmental services collects flammable solvents from the labs
and bulks them into 55gallon drums these solvents contain a wide
variety of hazardous wastes such as acetone toluene and methanol
the drums of solvent are blended with other flammable liquids and
oils to achieve the right btu value for fuel cement kilns use this
waste derived fuel to replace coal oil and other fossil fuels

this practice provides an alternative to incineration for pgs
organic waste streams that contain more than 5000 btus since
the beginning of 2004 the health care research center alone has
sent more than 7000 gallons of flammable solvents and oil for fuels

cost of incineration

key sustainability focus areas
at pg we proactively bring together innovative ideas and resources      pg has chosen to focus on water because we have a great deal
to create new products and services that improve the quality of           of expertise in this area and tremendous capability to improve life
peoples daily lives around the world at all income levels pg is       for people with insufficient access to clean water in addition water
particularly wellpositioned to do this because we are in touch daily     is integral to the use and disposal of most pg products nearly 85
with the needs of the worlds consumers                                  percent of them have some connection with household water use

to bring our sustainability efforts to life we decided to focus on       why health and hygiene
areas in which we can most effectively make a positive difference         health and hygiene affect all of us in both the developed and the

water coolwater washing makes new energy savings possible
theres an energysaving laundry revolution going on with tide
coldwater in the united states and canada and ariel actif à froid
ariel cold active in france both launched in early 2005 plus
ariel coolclean launched mid2004 in the uk  pg is making
it possible for consumers to turn down the temperature dial of
their washing machines as they no longer need hot water to get
the laundry clean

lowering wash temperatures can save signiﬁcant amounts of energy
and cost estimates are that a north american household can save
up to 20 percent of the energy it uses to heat water a french
household can reduce its electricity usage by up to 3 percent

washing machines are one of a homes highest energy users
taking most of the energy to heat water in north america the
proportion of energy used to heat wash water may be as high as
95 percent of the total energy used by the washing machine

the numbers show that washing in cold water makes a lot of
sense for both consumers and the environment so why do many
households in europe and north america still use hot water to
wash the key reason is that lower temperatures have not given
them the cleaning performance they want

with the introduction of tide coldwater and ariel actif à froid
all that has changed these detergents are speciﬁcally designed
for improved coldwater washing performance the scientiﬁc
explanation is that they use smarter chemical energy to clean
thus requiring less help from heat all consumers need to know
is that they can save energy and money and still achieve excellent
cleaning performance
                                                                          what if an average household
                                                                          converts to coldwater washing
government agencies and nongovernmental organizations are
so enthusiastic about the energy savings now available from
laundering in cool water that they are teaming up with pg in
                                                                          a north american household could save up
valuable alliances                                                       to 730 kilowatt hours of electricity per year
                                                                          for a savings of up to 63 these savings
in france ariel has entered into a threeyear alliance with
consodurable a nonproﬁt association whose mission is to
                                                                          amount to 10 percent of the total energy

consodurable wwwconsodurableorg is endorsed by the french             20 percent of energy used for water heating
ministers of environment and consumption and has been chosen
by the prime minister as one of the very few national causes

its clear that the global response to hivaids needs to include
provision of safe drinking water people who have hivaids are
more susceptible to waterborne diseases including parasites
viruses and pathogenic bacteria pgs pur puriﬁer of water
