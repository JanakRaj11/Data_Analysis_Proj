                        different terminal functions

                        vopak operates in a world that is constantly developing more and more oil products are being explored
                        or produced at locations other than where they are used the same applies to chemicals vegetable oils
                        and gases furthermore the demand for these products is continuously increasing this results in
                        growing logistic flows and an increasing demand for storage and transshipment services from our
                        customers vopak has set itself the aim to support our customers by operating and developing storage
                        facilities in seaports around the world
                        in the products logistic movements from producer to enduser vopaks independent tank terminal
                        network is well positioned to execute certain critical activities for which it operates three types of
                        terminals


                        importexportdistribution terminal
                        the logistics chain in bulk liquid import and export often involves transport by oceangoing vessels
                        for vopaks customers the terminal can serve as a point of origin for inland distribution by inland
                        shipping pipeline tank truck or rail alternatively it serves as a collection point for small parcels
                        originating from an inland production facility to create a large parcel for export overseas


                        hub terminal
                        a hub terminal combines the tasks of an importexportdistribution terminal with that of an international
                        meeting point for trade acting as a location that provides access to a market the vopak network
                        comprises hubs in the amsterdamrotterdamantwerp ara region in europe houston in the us
                        fujairah in the united arab emirates and singapore in asia


                        industrial terminal
                        the industrial terminal is a logistics center integrated via pipelines to a major petrochemical facility
                        within an industrial complex within the complex it supports product flows and the supply and export
                        of feedstock and finished products




                        co2 transportation and storage solution

                        in cooperation with anthony veder air liquide and gasunie vopak is developing a unique project
                        contributing to reduced carbon emissions the objective of the cooperation between the companies and
                        rci rotterdam climate initiative is to develop a solution for largescale co2 capture and storage in
                        rotterdam the netherlands the companies are partners of the rci


                        plans are in place to liquefy large volumes of captured co2 store them temporarily in a transshipment
                        location and transport them to oil fields or depleted natural gas fields under the north sea this way the
                        co2 can contribute to the further recovery of oil or it can be stored permanently the co2 will then no
                        longer impact our climate


                        participation in this consortium allows vopak to make a positive contribution to resolving this climate
                        issue if the plans are actually realized the initiative may rightly be called a world first

3 vision and strategy


a growing geographical imbalance exists both at a regional as well as at a global level between the
areas of production and industrial consumption of oil and gas products and chemicals as a result there
is a robust demand for the physical transportation and safe and efficient storage and handling of these
products this has led to a growing demand for solid infrastructures in order to seamlessly link up the
logistics networks of producers traders and distributors the need for storage and handling services at
critical locations is further intensified by new players in the market the liberalization of previously closed
economies and a demand that is becoming increasingly more specific for each country independent
storage and handling facilities can reduce the pressure on logistics systems and contribute towards the
reliability and efficiency of regional and global supply chains the most important requirements for bulk
liquid storage are the right logistic locations a strong focus on sustainability and safety reliable and
efficient services and the possibility of anticipating changes to the required services in a flexible manner

continues the developments mentioned in the 2010 sustainability report


for the report vopak has consolidated data from terminals under operational control and from terminals
that are voluntarily reporting data from other terminals are not consolidated in the report terminals
that are voluntarily reporting do so because they apply vopaks operational standards adhere to
vopaks code of conduct and are part of the threeyear cycle of vopaks terminal health assessments
the gate terminal in rotterdam is voluntarily reporting

                  reporting from the first day of acquisition
acquisitions      when a terminal is acquired and operations are continued there will be a grace
                  period of 1 calendar year before this terminal is in scope of the sustainability
                  reporting during this year all the data already have to be reported and monitored in

                  of scope of the sustainability reporting


vopak wants its sustainability policy ambitions and results to be transparent to all stakeholders in order
for it to be stakeholderinclusive in order to accomplish this ambition vopaks reports on performance in
the area of sustainability aligned with the sustainability reporting guidelines of the global reporting
initiative gri wwwglobalreportingorg additionally the vopak reporting criteria are based on the
guidelines as provided by gri


the aim of external reporting is to inform stakeholders about vopaks performance and improvements
this has two advantages
1 it demonstrates transparency and credibility in the way vopak manages its sustainability issues
2 it engages in a dialogue with stakeholders and the community in which vopak operates helping
   the organization to gain insights into and improve performance in the area of sustainability


our interpretation of people planet and profit and our acknowledgement of their interdependence are
being measured on 21 selected gri key performance indicators kpis that we report on they express
the performance in areas relevant to vopak and for which reliable information is available internally
the kpis address economic environmental and social performance areas we are convinced that in the
end applying the principles of sustainable entrepreneurship will result in high quality services without
undue social and environmental impacts




                                                                                              royal vopak sustainability report 2011   19

                           all quantitative data are reported through our hyperion reporting system by our terminals
                           a part of the exposure hours for calculating the tir are partly based on estimated amounts instead

supply chain responsibility
sustainability is a process whereby vopak recognizes its responsibility for the social ecological and
economic consequences of its activities across its entire supply chain


vopak does not manufacture any goods nor purchase any raw material or sell any materialsgoods to
its customers the core product is service delivery to our customers in order to promote higher levels
of sustainability across the supply chain vopak is increasingly assessing its suppliers on the basis of
work conditions and their use of sustainable materials eg general terms and conditions and toolbox
meetings


vopaks suppliers do not directly contribute to our core process service delivery to our customers
however suppliers are involved in supporting processes such as maintenance and construction projects
for new terminals and it is for this reason that they are also expected to be committed to our standards
and values


the general conditions for the purchase of goods and services include business conduct safety and
environmental conditions in which the vendor is held to the statements of our code of conduct the
vopak fundamentals on safety and the vopak sustainability policy these elements have to be confirmed
during a prequalification process by our internal audit department


the vast majority of the construction activities are executed under vopak management on our premises
where local supervision from vopaks own personnel is in place


vopak will end any commitment with a supplier if we conclude that this company is not behaving in line
with our general conditions and our code of conduct selective audits will be part of the vendor selection
process for existing suppliers compliance audits will not take place without cause until to date no
corrective actions had to be taken




                                                                                              royal vopak sustainability report 2011   23

behavioral competences form the starting point for creating worldwide uniformity in the assessment and
development of our employees on top of that the objective is to speak the same language on a global
level whenever we talk about performance and development the outcome of our assessments is
meticulously monitored whereby the tools that we implemented in the second quarter of 2011 will be
used and advice will be sought on further improvements to this global people  development gpd
process one initial outcome is that the quality of the appraisal meetings between managers and

                           section of beach in california are just two examples


                           to further encourage vopak staff to participate in the companys volunteering efforts a number of
                           employees established the vopak gulf coast employee volunteer initiative the initiative is also
                           intended to further strengthen the team spirit


                           in 2011 the volunteer initiative took part in many activities in one project the volunteers helped
                           assemble and distribute bicycles to underprivileged and atrisk children in harris county who were
                           promised the bikes as an incentive to try hard and do well in school numerous other projects were
                           supported throughout 2011 including taking part in the american cancer society relay for life
                           a fundraising event held in april 2011

      global vopak she day
      on 18 may 2011 vopak organized the annual global she day for the fourth consecutive year it is
      mandatory for every vopak location to organize a she day program by requesting comprehensive
      attention for safety health and the environment during the she day vopak aims to continuously improve
      the performance of both the company and its employees in these three areas the global she day is just
      one day but its impact is longlasting


      know the risks prevent incidents
      the main theme of this years global she day was think safe act safe the theme was chosen to
      underpin the importance of human behavior related to safety although our safety statistics have
      improved over recent years in 2011 the number of process incidents showed an increase this highlights
      the importance of remaining alert in order to prevent incidents from occurring to a large extent safety is
      the result of peoples behavior as such this years theme was very much in line with last years theme on
      prevention when we introduced the concept of last minute risk analysis think safe act safe is very much
      related to safety awareness increased safety awareness has to contribute to a further improved safety
      performance


      video message from the ceo
      at every vopak location the she day started with a video message from vopaks chairman of the
      executive board in which he again emphasized the importance of safe behavior he stated that safety is
      the result of our behavior and that the sense of the importance of safety must truly be embedded in
      peoples hearts and minds because only then will the company be able to prevent most  if not all 
      incidents and accidents this video message from the chairman was followed by presentations
      workshops and exercises at all vopak locations around the world




                                                                                                   royal vopak sustainability report 2011   31

                        community involvement
                        policy on community involvement
                        vopak operates in 83 different locations throughout the world it is the responsibility of the local
                        management teams of our subsidiaries to engage in activities with the local communities of our
                        terminals furthermore we encourage our management teams to strengthen the relationships with local
                        governments and other stakeholders this means that we do not apply a groupwide global approach
                        in general our efforts are aimed at initiatives that benefit local communities examples of activities that
                        we support are
                         local health care
                         local environmental initiatives
                         animal welfare
                         education
                         stimulating local economy


                        community involvement
                        beneficial community involvement mainly takes place at a terminal level and relates primarily to
                        longterm financially supported projects that benefit local communities or support healthcare initiatives
                        examples include
                         local hospitals and ambulance services
                         orphanages eg the durban terminal in south africa ecuador and peru
                         local animal shelters uk terminals
                         weekend schools and scholarships eg vlaardingen the netherlands and latin america
                         local sporting events many locations across the world
                         local infrastructure improvement eg vietnam
                         local economy by hiring as much as possible local people
                         local fund raising activities through participation in sporting events many locations across the world



                           vopak terminal durban  water for health
                           in may 2011 twelve employees of the chemicals emea division completed the vopak european
                           leadership program this development program included a special project to improve the quality of
                           life in south africa


                           clean drinking water is a primary necessity in the remote areas in the province of kwazulunatal
                           inhabitants get their drinking water from little rivers which are also used to wash clothes and for
                           sanitary purposes for this reason the team  together with nongovernmental organization
                           africaignite  committed itself to improve the drinking water in hladisa the project which was
                           named water for health introduced a technique by which water can be sanitized using sunlight
                           also to realize a sustainable improvement training was given on the importance of the right hygiene
                           and sanitation


                           the team stated it wanted to give something back to the local community in a sustainable way
                           with vopaks terminal making use of their land and of manpower a conscious decision was made
                           to choose an area not too far from the vopak terminal in durban which would bring the additional
                           benefit of being able to easily monitor the progress of the efforts taking place


                           water for health fits in with the activities that already take place around durban by means of
                           smallscale projects the vopak employees have already made other contributions to the local
                           population for example by renovating an orphanage

environmental policy
at present vopak operates storage terminals in 31 countries involving thousands of people directly as
well as indirectly and large plots of land this brings with it responsibilities for the surroundings not just
with respect to soil water and air but also towards the local communities and neighbors vopak aims to
be a responsible neighbor our objective is to further reduce emissions including those of gas and odor
in pursuing this objective we consistently adhere to guidelines set out in operating licenses legislation
and our own global standards vopak acknowledges that taking measures aimed at curbing emissions
may sometimes be in conflict with energy consumption as some environmental measures require the
use of energy we aim to strike the right balance in this respect


we are standardizing our approach at a global level and are mapping out the impact our operations may
have on the environment this helps us address the question as to how to minimize our impact including
our operations carbon footprint we are committed to developing a sound waste management system
and minimizing our energy consumption soil contamination air and surface water pollution and water
consumption



scope of carbon reporting
the energy and carbon emission reporting of vopak encompasses scope 1 direct energy usage and
emissions from combustion of fossil fuels and scope 2 indirect energy usage and emissions from
purchased electricity for our own usage we do not report on scope 3 direct and indirect energy usage
and emissions from purchased materials and services

                        facts and figures
                        energy and carbon emissions
                        efforts to reduce energy consumption and improve energy management continued to be successful
                        from both a sustainability and cost efficiency perspective the expert forum energy a groupwide
                        consultative body has been given the task of coordinating and encouraging energy management and
                        energy reduction projects employees are supported and encouraged to reduce energy consumption by
                        a set of vopak energy management guidelines


                        in 2011 the total energy consumption of the companies in scope was 4432 tj 2010 4944 tj an
                        improvement of 95


                        vopak generates a modest amount of co2 through its operating processes since these processes use
                        energy and co2 is released in generating energy vopak mainly consumes energy for pumping heating or
                        cooling products and for operations to achieve environmental improvements such as waste water
                        purification and vapor recovery systems


                        in 2011 five of vopaks terminals participated in the european emission trading scheme vopak
                        terminal vlaardingen the netherlands vopak terminal botlek rotterdam the netherlands vopak
                        terminal europoort rotterdam the netherlands vopak eos estonia and vopak terminal vlissingen
                        the netherlands the last terminal has recently entered the scheme because of the nox emission of
                        the vapor recovery unit


                        besides the european terminals listed above vopak has currently no other terminal with direct emissions
                        of more than 25 kton co2 per annum in 2011

                        vopak is not within the scope of the australian carbon emission system which will become operational
                        in 2012


                        the reduction of energy consumption leads directly to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in 2011
                        progress was made towards reducing the overall emissions of co2 per cbm storage this resulted in a
                        decrease of total carbon emissions from 143 kgcbm in 2010 to 140 kgcbm storage in 2011 the total
                        carbon emission direct and indirect is 340 kton in 2011 2012 395 kton


                        vopak has studied the new european trading system which will be effective as from january 2013 as
                        from 2013 the criteria to enter the ets will be changed eg all vrus that use fuel propane or natural
                        gas will also be part of the total system this study showed that this will not affect other vopak entities


                        direct energy
                        direct energy sources such as gaseous and liquid fuels are mainly used for production of steam for
                        heating purposes and limited onsite transportation by pumps that are driven by steam the total energy

36   royal vopak sustainability report 2011

since our storage capacity decreased in 2011 due to the sale of vopak terminals in the bahamas and
the uk not only the absolute energy used but also the total relative energy used was reduced within
the chemical europe middle east  africa division the reduction is part of our maintenance program
old inefficient heating systems will be or have already been replaced by modern efficient systems


at vopak terminal europoort energy consumption decreased by 7 in estonia vopak also had a decrease
of 5 in energy consumption a relative mild winter in europe also contributed to this


it should be mentioned that the quantity of lpg consumed does not only reflect the energy generated
from lpg in 2011 but mainly due to the use as support gases to realize the incineration of product vapors
in the different vapor treatment systems that vopak operates these vapor treatment systems prevent
the emission from hydrocarbon vapors originated during the handling and storage of chemicals and oil
products the selection of vapor treatment units that use these kinds of techniques is under review
where feasible more energy efficient systems eg vapor recovery units or vapor return systems will be
implemented


in 2011 one joint venture terminal in china used coal to generate steam in its boiler house

indirect energy
electricity is the main source of indirect energy at vopak however within the lng terminal vopak is also
using warm water from an adjacent electric power plant in using this source of excess heat vopak does
not have to use energy to vaporize and heat the liquefied natural gas see also page 40

 for the terminals in scope



the increase of relative indirect energy consumption is mainly caused by the higher turnover and
electrical heating at our terminals




                                                                                              royal vopak sustainability report 2011   37

                        total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by weight
                        vopak hardly generates any co2 from its operating processes and only generates some co2 during the
                        production of steam for heating purposes however the direct and indirect energy used in operations
                        both generate co2


                        no ozone depleting chemical substances are emitted most of the terminals do not handle these specific
                        chemicals at the terminals where we do handle these chemicals we use special vapor recovery
                        systems


                        total greenhouse gas emissions direct and indirect are calculated in accordance with the standards set

                        vopak has been able to reduce the total co2 emissions in relation to the capacity every year from 2009


                        waste
                        new concepts for the reusability of waste such as waste as a resource and waste does not exist are
                        examples of an increasing awareness and insights into how vopak as a company should deal with waste


                        at vopak these ideas are leading to new waste management concepts in which prevention and reuse
                        plays an important role in reducing the total amount of waste offered for wasteprocessing


                        to further develop the principles of waste does not exist a pilot study was launched in 2010 to identify
                        and categorize waste streams for prevention and reuse as a consequence the amount of waste
                        produced can be minimized and the reuse of waste is strongly promoted both within vopaks operations
                        and elsewhere


                           soil remediation policy
                            each spill that occurs at a terminal has to be cleaned immediately


                           residual waste management
                            when tanks change service to another product small amounts of product may remain in the tanks
                            and pipelines this residual product is currently treated as chemical waste and removed from the site
                            and discharged however there are companies that are able to upgrade this residual waste into a
                            product with a value


                        if we are able to implement these concepts it is estimated that we could save significant amounts of
                        our costs for waste disposal


                        in 2011 vopak has made a start to measure these data from all our terminals it is our ambition to analyse
                        the figures of 2012 so that targets can be set

      process incidents
      the number of process incidents that occur at our tank terminals is an important measure of our safety
      and environmental care process incidents include product spills product contaminations and fires
      including small smolderings


      our focus on the behavior of operators in order to prevent operational errors and proper maintenance
      to prevent failure of equipment and thus increase our process integrity has been effective in recent years
      the total number of process incidents in 2011 shows an increase to 147 2010 133


      for 2012 vopak will relentlessly pursue the global implementation of our standards as well as take
      preventive measures aimed at further reducing process incidents


      in respect of spills the total number decreased from 80 in 2010 to 79 in 2011 the quantity involved
      slightly reduced from around 600 cbm of product spilled in 2010 to around 550 cbm in 2011


      the amount of product contaminations showed an increase from 14 in 2010 to 30 in 2011 the number
      of fires shows in 2011 a moderate decrease to 38 2010 39 unfortunately an extra 7 fires was reported
      at the terminals that are not in scope of this sustainability report therefore the total amount of process
      incidents at vopak in 2011 was 154 as reported in the annual report

      land and water
      as a user and owner of land more than 1500 ha vopak has the responsibility to take care of this land
      as reflected in its environmental objectives almost half of this land is already equipped with a secondary
      containment system to prevent spills and other contaminations from entering the soil and groundwater


      another important responsibility is water management vopak aims to have closed water balances on
      each of its terminals by 2015 for this reason vopak has committed itself to conducting an assessment
      of its water care systems at the terminals the objective is to make a clear distinction between flows of
      good quality water ie clean rainwater and process water the principle is that clean water should
      remain clean and not be mixed with process water while process water will be treated in a water
      treatment plant a feasibility study at vopak terminal europoort done in 2011 proved that a closed water
      balance can be made in europoort the quantity of water treated at the waste water treatment plant is
      60 of all the water rain tap surface and ground water entering the site


      since 2010 initiatives have been taken to separate clean water and process water flows to improve the
      treatment of process water some existing treatment plants will be upgraded or replaced by new
      stateoftheart plants currently waste water treatment plants for the larger terminals are under review
      the results of the analysis are not yet available

                        impact on our surroundings
                        vopak has conducted a study to assess the impact of its regular business on its surroundings
                        the study indicated that depending on where the vopak location is situated one or more of the
                        following impacts could be applicable
                         noise

                         soil contamination and use


                        areas of special concern
                        some vopak terminals are in the vicinity of areas of ecological diversity where this is the case
                        extra care is taken to prevent any damage to this area from air soil groundwater and surface water
                        contamination the preventive measures are stated in the internal vopak standard for soil and
                        groundwater management


                        in 2011 vopak started an assessment in the ara region amsterdam rotterdam and antwerp of
                        every new location to identify the areas of special concern for the coming years vopak will extend this
                        assessment to all of its terminals


                        examples are
                         for the terminals in the rotterdam area in the netherlands a general study was conducted to assess
                           the impact of the different terminals on the natura 2000 areas natura 2000 is the european program
                           for wildlife areas
                         at vopak terminal europoort in rotterdam rare amphibious species were detected a program to
                           relocate these amphibians in a preserved habitat has started



                           gate lng terminal  intense cooperation and innovation
                           in 2011 vopak and its partner gasunie completed the construction of the first lng import and
                           regasification terminal in the netherlands consisting of three 180000 cbm lng tanks and two
                           jetties to accommodate the worlds largest lng vessels the construction work took three years
                           involving about 5 million man hours and was a complex task


                           intense cooperation with a range of government authorities and neighboring companies made a
                           rapid completion of the project possible the port of rotterdam authority provided an excellent
                           location at the very tip of the maasvlakte area guaranteeing good and safe access and fast
                           vessel turnaround cooperation with neighboring companies also ensured right of passage for
                           gate terminal


                           in line with their joint sustainability objectives the partners strived for a zero emissions terminal
                           the objective could be achieved by reusing energy from other sources for the lng regasification
                           process for this purpose a warm water connection was established from the cooling water basin
                           at the nearby eon power plant allowing a maximum 60000 cbm of warm water to be pumped
                           through the regasification circuit every hour this means that no additional energy is required to heat
                           up the ultracold lng the process water which is initially 7c warmer is discharged into the sea at
                           its regular temperature at the end of the process


                           in this way the terminal is saving approx 30 million cbm of natural gas that has to be burned in order
                           to have the same amount of energy additionally an emission of 50 kton of carbon dioxide into the
                           atmosphere is prevented


                           this ingenious and innovative solution delivers a unique winwin situation for eon gate terminal
                           and the environment

ambitions for the planet 2012
 in 2011 vopak has made a start to measure the water and waste data form all our terminals
  it is our ambition to analyse the figures of 2012 so that targets can be set
 vopak aims to have closed water balances on each of its terminals by 2015 for this reason in
  2012 at least 50 of the terminals should have a closed water balance
 in relation to the study to alternative green energy sources for terminals see page 44 we aim
  to have at least two feasibility studies for terminals in the netherlands
 in 2012 we will extend the study on the areas of concern to the vopak terminals outside the
  netherlands and aim to have a complete overview of all our terminals in 2013

                        as part of its innovation program vopak has identified the following innovation topics for shortterm
                        mediumterm and longterm research
                         energy efficiency
                         labor extensive operations
                         emission  wastefree operations
                         high service levels
                         intelligent automation
                         minimal use of space



                        projects
                        vopak does not have a separate research department we strive to participate in programs that address
                        our innovation objectives and topics for this reason we made the following commitments


                        dutch association of independent tank storage companies votob research into the potential
                        use of renewablegreen energy
                        in this program vopak will investigate the potential of renewable or green energy sources for our
                        terminals energy needs heat and electricity such as
                         wind energy
                         geothermal energy
                         solar energy
                         residual heat from neighboring companies


                        in 2011 vopak invested in the use of residual heat from a neighboring power plant for the first terminal
                        for liquefied natural gas lng that it commissioned with partner gasunie in rotterdam the netherlands
                        at this terminal the cooling water from a nearby electrical power plant is used to regasify the lng this
                        is the first time renewable energy is being used at a vopak terminal


                        automation projects
                        at the new amsterdam westpoort terminal that was commissioned in 2011 a new developed
                        terminal automation system was introduced this has resulted in increased process efficiency therefore
                        contributing to achieve higher service levels


                        game changer projects
                        at vopak we participate in the long term  10 years dutch scientific research program biobased geo
                         civil engineering for a sustainable society in this program vopak is especially interested in how to avoid
                        corrosion and the possibility of reversing corrosion for instance how to make steel out of rust another
                        topic in which vopak is involved is selfhealing materials especially selfhealing concrete and coatings

limited assurance report

to the executive board of royal vopak



report on the sustainability report

engagement and responsibilities
in the sustainability report hereafter report koninklijke vopak nv reports on its policies activities and performance
relating to sustainability in the reporting year 2011 we have been engaged by the executive board of koninklijke vopak
nv to review the report


a review is focused on obtaining limited assurance which does not require exhaustive gathering of evidence as in
audit engagements consequently a review engagement provides less assurance than would be obtained from an
audit engagement


the executive board of koninklijke vopak nv is responsible for the preparation of the report we are responsible for
providing a limited assurance report on the information in the report


reporting criteria
koninklijke vopak nv developed its reporting criteria on the basis of the g3 guidelines of the global reporting initiative
gri these reporting criteria contain certain inherent limitations which may influence the reliability of the information
detailed information on these limitations and on koninklijke vopak nvs reporting scope is given on page 19 in chapter 5
scope we consider the reporting criteria to be relevant and appropriate for our review


review procedures performed
we planned and performed our review procedures in accordance with dutch law including standard 3410n assurance
engagements relating to sustainability reports
we do not provide assurance on the assumptions and feasibility of prospective information such as targets expectations
and ambitions included in the report as this is the second year that the report is reviewed comparative figures
concerning 2009 and earlier years have not been reviewed by us
our most important review procedures were
 performing an external environment analysis and obtaining insight into the industry relevant sustainability issues
   relevant laws and regulations and the characteristics of the organisation
 reviewing the acceptability of the reporting policies and consistent application of these such as assessment of the
   outcomes of the stakeholder dialogue and the reasonableness of estimates made by management
 reviewing the systems and processes for data gathering internal controls and processing of other information such
   as the aggregation process of data to the information as presented in the report
 reviewing internal and external documentation to determine whether the information in the report is adequately
   substantiated
 evaluating the overall presentation of the report in line with koninklijke vopak nvs reporting criteria
 reviewing the application level according to the g3 guidelines of gri
we believe that the evidence obtained from our review is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion


conclusion
based on our review procedures performed nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to conclude
that the information in the report in all material respects does not provide a reliable and adequate presentation of
the sustainability policy of koninklijke vopak nv or of the activities and performance of the organisation relating to
sustainability in 2011 in accordance with koninklijke vopak nvs reporting criteria
