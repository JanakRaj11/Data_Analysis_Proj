message from the director technical




dear stakeholders

welcome to our third sustainability report for the year 201415 the year was a successful one for pll both in terms of
projects implemented and those conceptualized during the 201415 period some of our successes included
implementation of integrated management system at dahej terminal and being pursued at kochi terminal and
increase in area under mangrove plantation initiatives to over 1100 hectares further observing that a significant
amount of energy is spent on the natural gas liquefaction process for converting natural gas into lng by the lng
producing countries we feel there is a scope for recovery of this energy at our terminals during the regasification
process we are working on exploring the same

on another significant aspect we are constantly striving to provide safe and convenient working environment for our
employees to be able to work at their optimal level in this regard we invested in better systems and trainings for further
improving the working environment across our terminal sites we are investing in enhanced health safety fire and
environment trainings in this regard with focus on behavioral safety aspect

more details on these and other company initiatives taken during the fy 201415 period are discussed in the report

 conventional cooling systems demand freon heat exchanger thereby enhancing the ozone layer depletion this
 not only depletes ozone layer but also adds to energy demand due to operation of the compressor at pll we have
 eliminated most of the refrigerant consumption by using chilled water for cooling purposes this new system helps
 to conserve ozone layer as well as conserving electrical energy by eliminating the need for a compressor the
 chilled water is obtained during lng regasification into natural gas transported through a pipeline inside the plant
 and is used as cooling medium in heat exchanger connected to liquid nitrogen plant thus eliminating freon heat
 exchanger from the system

are aimed at promoting and
developing biodiversity rich belts
with focus on mangrove plantation
belts around our terminals of

mangrove is a halophyte which is
known as salt tolerant forest
ecosystem these can grow in
waterlogged clayey marshy
soils specifically in coastal
intra tidal zones  river banks

productive ecosystems available
on this planet as a result of
december 2004 tsunami there
has been a mounting call for re
establishing protective green belts
along coastlines plls efforts are
directed in this direction with
focus on establishing biodiversity
rich green belts in coastal
areas which help protect and
flourish local flora and fauna
protect local communities from
weather storms and help them
generate income through forestry
