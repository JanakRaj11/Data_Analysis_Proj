bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2016                                                     8




message from the chairman

dear stakeholders


last year we performed better than expected we recorded a double digit return on bouwinvests assets under
management of 121 improving the total return of 106 we recorded in 2015 this time it was the dutch portfolio
that delivered a strong performance especially the residential portfolio in 2015 our returns were lifted by
excellent results from our international investments arm we are satisfied with the returns we booked in 2016
both in absolute and relative terms


and i believe we were able to do this in a market that is fraught with risks and challenges precisely because we
have continued to maintain our investment discipline and stick to our guns we have always believed that we need
to invest in highquality real estate in the right locations and geared to the current and future needs of tenants all
backed with thorough market research and real estate market expertise that discipline and expertise plus our
continued belief in specific sectors in the dutch and global real estate markets even during the financial crisis is
now paying dividends


last year we also managed to invest over  800 million more than the  782 million we invested in 2015 in what
was an even more fiercely competitive market this gives us a secure pipeline of over  13 billion putting us in a
solid position for the future especially as we have made no concessions whatsoever in terms of the quality of our
portfolio assets


an example of this is our acquisition of the hourglass building in amsterdams zuidas business district which
combines offices and a hotel it fits into our strategy of acquiring multifunctional buildings and will be an
excellent addition to both the office fund and the hotel fund and that ability to divide this asset across our funds
puts us in a very competitive position as most investors want to acquire an office or a hotel but seldom both
together but what i find most pleasing is that this was a real joint effort involving a lot of hard work from people
right across the organisation the hourglass acquisition is also a testament to our confidence in the dutch office
market especially in multifunctional and multitenant assets we are seeing clear signs of recovery at prime
locations the fact that we added a third client to the office fund shows that others share our faith in this market


we welcomed six new clients in our funds last year taking the total to 17 clients  including bpfbouw  on 1
january 2017 these new clients reflect the growing interest in real estate as a whole and the confidence in our
core investment approach the new clients will have to wait a while to see their funds invested as we are investing
largely in newbuild assets but like us they have longterm investment scope and like us they want to invest in
quality assets that will stand the test of time


our investment strategy also reflects a number of megatrends that we believe will dominate the market in the
years to come these include world population growth and the urbanisation trend which will see a
further concentration of people living in cities the everincreasing growth of oneperson and twoperson
households plus the demand for student housing the ageing of the population and technology will all have a
profound impact on the demand for real estate

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2016                                                  9



anticipating and responding to these megatrends will be a key factor in our future success we are looking to
increase our assets under management to over  11 billion in the next three years including value development
from the current  85 billion a large part of that will be in international markets the demands on our
management organisation are increasing but our assets under management give us the critical mass we need to
meet all the demands of the market and of our clients


we are a relatively small organisation with 146 people 1366 ftes working from our head office in amsterdam but
we are selfsufficient we have our own investor relations team and risk management compliance tax and legal
functions as the hourglass acquisition proved we are a very effective and responsive organisation our clients see
that we are dedicated to the real estate sector that we have good portfolios take a responsible approach to
investing with a modern and handson organisation and this was borne out last year when ipe real estate voted
us the best investment manager in the benelux and we were nominated in the best global investor category


at the end of 2015 we set ourselves ambitious targets related to collaboration innovation and clientorientation
and we made progress on all those fronts last year client satisfaction has improved by 02 points since 2014 and
we scored an overall 79 last year we also set up a training programme in socalled softskills for our employees
and we set up an innovation lab to give people a chance to explore and test innovative ideas together this also
creates awareness of challenges and opportunities on the innovation front in the market because people are
looking at what is happening in the world outside and take this in account to top all of this bouwinvest was
ranked third in the best employer category for dutch financial companies with up to 1000 employees last year
something else we are proud of


last year we also saw the installation of our first fully elected works council i was impressed to see that no less
than 90 of our staff voted in this election which i believe is a clear sign that we have a committed and engaged
workforce i was also pleased to note that we now have more young people on the works council which now has
an average age of 40 compared with an average age of 56 before the election all in all i think this bodes well for
the future and i am looking forward to our close cooperation with the works council in the years ahead


this year we will continue with our corporate social responsibility csr strategy with its focus on longterm
investments plus stable and sustainable returns we will continue to invest in promising and highquality real
estate to create and maintain a portfolio that is sustainable and futureproof and meets tenants and clients
needs today and in the future with a riskreturn profile that enables us to meet very strict requirements
bouwinvest wants to stay in the leading group on the csr front for that reason i was also pleased that wtc the
hague was awarded the breeamnl inuse excellent certificate and the fact that our three dutch sector funds
retained their gresb green star ratings


the real estate market is hot right now and that brings its own challenges the market is becoming more and more
competitive but we are optimistic about our portfolios and the dutch and international real estate markets we
believe we will continue increasing our assets under management and record longterm annual returns of 57 in
the years to come with regard to the management company we expect to maintain the good level of result of 2016
 26 million


all that is left is for me to express my gratitude to our clients for their continued trust and to our supervisory
board for their efforts on our behalf and last but certainly not least i would like to thank all our employees for
their commitment dedication and collaboration over the past year

market highlights
international markets
the year started with a slowdown in chinese economic growth and a major dip in asian stock markets which did
eventually rebound growth may be slowing but china is still recording annual gdp growth between 6 and 7
putting the rest of the worlds economies in the shade the brexit vote in the uk came as another major surprise to
most and led to a great deal of uncertainty in europe and beyond testing the fragile economic recovery in most
european markets the potential impact of brexit on both the uk and its main trading partners is still very
uncertain and europewide annual gdp growth forecasts have been revised downward to an average of 17 from
a previous forecast of 19 the runup to the us elections and the surprise victory of donald trump added to the
prevailing uncertainty and this is likely to persist for the foreseeable future or at least until the political direction
the us will take under a donald trump presidency has become clearer on top of this political unrest is on the rise
with large numbers of voters in europe unhappy with the current political status quo


on a brighter note the sheer weight of capital looking for investments buoyed sentiment in the worlds real estate
markets due to persistent low interest rates and extremely volatile stock markets real estate has become a very
attractive alternative for riskaverse investors searching for stable returns like pension funds and other
institutional investors investment yields are well below their longterm average in all regions however
supported by alltime low yields on riskfree alternatives yield gaps remain healthy and are attracting more capital
to real estate real estate was set to attract some usd 1 trillion in 2016 most global markets benefited from this
movement in capital in 2016 and saw solid capital growth the favourable occupier market outlook for welllocated
assets now seems largely incorporated in todays prices and an increasing number of investors are now turning to
slightly offpitch properties


dutch market
the dutch real estate market has recovered swiftly in the last two or three years and investment appetite is still
growing dutch pension funds once again increased their real estate investments in the netherlands last year and
are looking to expand their allocation to real estate in the years ahead driven by persistent low interest rates low
returns on bond markets and overly volatile stock markets on top of this international investors have now set
their sights firmly on the dutch market and they now account for over 50 of real estate investments in the
netherlands dutch prime markets like amsterdam utrecht the hague and rotterdam are still attractively priced
compared to other key european markets such as london paris and munich where prices are already above
precrisis levels however the interest from both dutch and international investors is quickly pushing up prices
and investors are being forced to broaden their view from a strong focus on prime to include real estate in a
number of subprime locations


after several rough years the dutch residential market has recovered to precrisis levels the everincreasing
number of households and low production of housing stock during and after the crisis further boosted structural
shortage of housing driven by the ongoing urbanisation trend housing shortages in the countrys main cities
have rapidly pushed up prices with amsterdam leading the pack but closely followed by the likes of rotterdam
utrecht and the hague a combination of stable rental growth and yield shift resulted in very positive total returns
in 2016 there is a huge demand for liberalised sector rental homes this is pushing up prices and increasing
competition for highquality assets in prime locations


due to stable population growth and the ageing of the population the demand for healthcare real estate is
expected to show very solid growth in the coming decades while overall population growth will be concentrated
on the main cities of the netherlands households with residents aged 65 years and older are set to grow right
across the country the number of elderly people is forecast to grow in all 390 municipalities for at least another 15
years in total the number of elderly in the netherlands is expected to increase to 29 million households in 2030
from 20 million in 2015 this makes healthcare a very interesting sector for institutional investors

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2016                                                    18



office space demand is obviously very sensitive to economic cycles and thanks to the continued firming of dutch
economic growth and a fairly solid rise in business confidence the prospects for the office market look more
promising than they have for some time this is partly due to falling unemployment which dipped to 56 in 2016
however qualitative demand has changed driven by companies searching for cost efficiencies and the advent of
new mobile technologies tenants are focusing on specific location types but are also less bound to a single
office and are looking for more flexibility such as smaller satellite offices these days prime office locations tend
to include highquality and multitenant offices with excellent road and public transport links in regions with a
ready pool of highlyskilled employees the flip side of this is that a growing number of secondary locations are
gradually losing tenants leaving large office buildings completely vacant and with little prospect of future
tenants this polarisation between prime and secondary in terms of both locations and real estate is now evident
and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future


this polarisation is also affecting the dutch retail market the bankruptcy of several large dutch retailer chains in
late 2015 left a large number of square metres vacant other retailers were forced to renegotiate their lease terms
on a more positive note a large number of major international retail chains such as primark and zara have
adapted swiftly and now have a solid position on the dutch retail market retailer demand is focused on
highquality largescale retail units in prime locations thanks to this demand the takeup of a large part of the
retail property left vacant by the 2015 bankruptcies has been fairly swift however most experts expect to see
further differentiation in the retail landscape in terms of prime and secondary retail real estate


another real estate sector set for solid growth and stable returns is the hotel sector as tourism in the netherlands
continues to grow the number of tourists visiting the country increased by 7 in 2015 and increased by another
3 in 2016 amsterdam in particular benefitted from the increase in foreign tourist arrivals the depreciation of the
euro also helped to push tourism from outside the euro region in reaction to this strong demand from tourists the
dutch hotel market has increased in size significantly in recent years the dutch starrated hotel market consists
of approximately 2160 hotels and more than 100000 rooms with 30000 of these rooms in amsterdam thanks to
the rapid pace of hotel development in amsterdam the city is already set to add approximately 6500 rooms to its
current stock new restrictive hotel development policies will limit the development of new hotels which should
be favourable for existing stock after 2020 when the majority of new supply will have been added to the total
stock



portfolio results
international investments
bouwinvests international investments delivered a solid performance modest performance in 2016 the total
return came in at 53 excluding currency results and after management fees in 2016 unlisted investments made
the largest contribution to this result 77 however the return of the listed investments was negatively affected
by the uncertainty in global markets and amounted to 35 2015 96 despite the growing competition we
were able to make new investments of eur 279 million in 2016


unless stated otherwise all returns mentioned below are excluding currency results


europe
our european portfolio recorded a return of 27 in 2016 with returns pressured primarily by geopolitical and
macroeconomic developments these included the ecbs continued loose monetary policy immigration issues and
of course the unexpected brexit vote on top of this the uk increased stamp duty by 1 which led to a
corresponding drop in values our returns were also slightly negatively impacted by the sharp fluctuations in the
gbpeur fx rate in eur funds with exposure to sterling however the prevailing volatility in european markets 
and elsewhere  did create some excellent opportunities to enter the market at the low end of the cycle we made
some very solid investments in commercial real estate mainly offices and retail in the nordics as well as gateway
offices in main cities such as london paris berlin and frankfurt all of which have solid fundamentals lastly we
increased our listed investments in westerneuropean offices a significant part of our uk exposure is in
mezzanine finance which offers protection from initial writedowns plus we have a lot of exposure to properties
with very long leases we expect these investments to continue to contribute to solid returns in the future

north america
the us market was dominated by the presidential elections in 2016 despite the uncertainty in the runup to the
election and the victory of donald trump real estate fundamentals continued to improve last year with rental
growth above inflation and property yields still hovering around record lows although at a comfortable cushion
above us treasuries the lower deferred tax liability as a result of the recent new firpta regulations had a positive
impact on the returns at total portfolio level and also improved the net return profile for value added strategies
the northern american portfolio delivered another strong performance in 2016 ending the year with a total return
of 88 these results were bolstered by continued growth in demand and the lack of sufficient new supply this
led to rental growth in most us markets and sectors there are concerns that the us market has peaked and we
may see some cooling but there will always be opportunities on a market this large prices are high at the
moment but these are largely justified by low interest rates and persistently strong investor demand we
continued to focus on the larger us cities last year as these have the strongest fundamentals


asiapacific
the asiapacific portfolio delivered a return of 27 in 2016 the regions markets showed a certain level of volatility
due to fears of an economic slowdown in china  which is still recording annual gdp growth of 67  largely offset
improving fundamentals in countries like australia australian real estate funds with low leverage delivered solid
doubledigit growth japanese investments also performed well but singapore retail investments were hit by a
weakening market we also managed to sell office exposure at a good price we expanded the asiapacific portfolio
last year adding investments in the panasian hotel sector which is growing rapidly thanks to the huge increase in
tourist travel we also invested in australian student accommodation in a joint venture with scape and apg we
are still very bullish on the asiapacific region and we made a number of topup investments in australian and
japanese real estate funds chinese economic growth is now much more sustainable than in the past and australia
where we have a lot of investments is proving remarkably resilient with very strong fundamentals and a solid
longterm outlook the bank of japans buyup of jreits is having a major positive impact on listed real estate
investments in japan and this is set to continue for some time

dutch investments
bouwinvest manages five dutch investment funds three of which are open to thirdparty investors our main
focus is on the residential office and retail sectors in what we have identified as our core regions these regions all
have an aboveaverage economic and demographic outlook and will benefit from the abovementioned
megatrends such as the urbanisation trend the ageing of the population and the rise of new technologies we
also invest in the healthcare sector as we believe the ageing of the population will continue to increase demand
for real estate with a healthcare element the rapid rise in tourism is also increasing demand for hotels this is a
positive development for our hotel fund


residential fund
the residential fund generated a total return of 205 2015 125 with a direct return of 34 2015 38 and an
indirect return of 171 2015 86 the fund had a high and stable average occupancy rate of 977 likeforlike
rental growth for 2016 came in at 32 2015 38 while rent arrears were low at 07 2015 09 the dividend
return for 2016 came in at 34 2015 38


the residential fund once again reaped the benefits of bouwinvests growth strategy and its confidence in the
residential market in recent years and saw the completion and delivery of eight excellent newbuild projects
nearly all of which were fully let before completion we currently have a secured pipeline of 11 new residential
projects 1063 apartments and 194 family homes following investments of around  255 million in 2016 demand
for highquality homes the liberalised rental sector is still growing especially in our core markets


thanks to the continued recovery in the residential sector and the very high quality of the residential portfolio the
fund to attracted six new clients in 2016 this took the total number of clients to 16 as of january 2017


at yearend 2016 the funds property portfolio consisted of 237 properties with a total value of  39 billion


retail fund
the retail fund booked a return of 84  in 2016 2015 45 the result of a direct return of 46 2015 44 and an
indirect return of 39 2015 01 the average occupancy rate was 947 2015 942 the dividend return for
2015 was 46 2015 44

the dutch economy continued to recover in 2016 this led to a strong rise in consumer confidence furthermore
international investors boosted interest in retail real estate resulted in a yield shift this in turn led to a healthy
increase in the values of the funds retail assets in amsterdam and its other core regions in both the experience
and convenience segments the fund continued to optimise its portfolio in 2016 adding new assets and
redeveloping and upgrading existing assets while retail real estate will remain a challenging sector in the years
ahead we believe that thanks to a good balance of experience and convenience oriented retail real estate
assets the retail funds portfolio will continue to generate solid returns in the years ahead


in 2016 we saw the completion and delivery of the nowadays redevelopment at damraknieuwendijk in
amsterdam one of the largest retail redevelopments in the capital in decades we also took delivery of the
stadionplein and mosveld shopping centres in the convenience segment the retail fund invested around  31
million last year and will continue to upgrade and futureproof existing assets and look for acquisitions that meet
our quality and return requirements


the retail fund attracted three new clients in 2016 as of 1 january 2017 we welcomed an additional new client
taking the total number of clients to five we see this as an endorsement of our strategy of focusing on the
experience and convenience segments of the retail market and a clear sign that investors still believe that the
retail sector offers opportunities for stable longterm returns


in 2016 the retail fund agreed new leases and renewed existing contracts for a total of 72997 m² of space
representing a rental value of some  166 million


at the end of 2016 the funds portfolio consisted of 47 properties with a total value of  778 million

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2016                                                     21

the office fund booked a return of 55 in 2015 2015 05 the result of a direct return of 36 2015 42 and an
indirect return of 19 2015 37 the average occupancy rate was stable at around 81 in 2016 from 801 in
2015 largely due to the high proportion of properties we are currently redeveloping the dividend return came in
at 36 2015 42 the strong turnaround in the indirect return was driven by higher valuations for a number
office properties on the back of redevelopment plans


after several years of outperformance as compared to the ipd index the funds relative performance dipped
somewhat over the past two years last year was a year of portfolio optimisation for the office fund the highlight
of 2016 was the acquisition of the hourglass a mixeduse building in amsterdams zuidas business district the
fund also invested  30 million in the continued upgrade of the wtc rotterdam and launched the redevelopment
of the former citroën buildings the olympic 1931 and the olympic 1962 in amsterdam


in 2016 the wtc the hague was awarded breeamnl inuse excellent certification this is the first time this score
at building and building management level has been awarded to a multitenant asset in the netherlands active
asset management and continued investments in upgrading and updating its office assets ensured that the fund
renewed or signed new leases for a total of 15509 m² representing an annual rental income of  29 million in 2016


the fund attracted another new client in 2016 a clear demonstration of the renewed confidence in the office
sector as well as in the office funds strategy and the high quality of its portfolio as of 1 january 2017 the funds
total number of clients is three


at yearend 2016 the funds portfolio consisted of 16 properties with a total value of  503 million

fund return roe came in at 49 in 2016 24 above budget and 28 lower than in 2015 77 returns will be

was  24 million in 2016  26 million lower than in 2015 this decrease was primarily due to the increase of  29
million in operating expenses offset by a slight increase in the management fee


management fee
the management fee increased by  02 million to  307 million in 2016 2015  305 million despite the increase in
assets under management by 13 2016  85 billion 2015  75 billion the management fee was only marginally
higher due to a fee incentive of  32 million granted to bpfbouw


operating costs
operating costs rose by  29 million 114 to  283 million in 2016 compared with  254 million in 2015 these
higher costs were the result of a  13 million increase in personnel costs and a  16 million increase in other
operating costs this benefits the funds and increases the costs for the management company at a stable
management fee


the higher personnel costs were caused by an increase in the number of ftes to 1366 in 2016 2015 1311 hiring of
temporary staff and an increase in training costs this increase will enable bouwinvest to record controlled growth
of its assets under management and remain stateoftheart as an organisation


the increase in other costs was further due to an increase in costs related to nondeductible vat this was the
result of a ruling by the tax inspector as a result of which the vat exemption related to joint asset management
was applicable retroactively consequently the level of nondeductible vat increased to 70 from 50 this led to
a oneoff extra cost item of  06 million for the period 20132015 and  05 million for 2016


additional other operating costs were the rise of costs for ict  02 million related to a number of it projects eg
the renewal of the erm architecture and new planning software as well as costs related to the increase in the
number of applications furthermore to boost the companys corporate positioning and visibility
communications expenses increased with  01 million in 2016 and finally another  02 million in other operating
costs related to taking out a general professional liability insurance


fiscal result
deferred tax assets are less the calculated corporate taxes of  10 million for 2016 and an additional writeoff of
 04 million related to a recalculation of the deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognised on the basis of
losses from previous years that may be settled with the tax authorities these deferred tax assets can be realised
in the coming two years through to yearend 2018 a deferred tax liability of  04 million is accounted for regarding
the difference between the fiscal and the commercial valuation of participations


financial position
bouwinvests shareholders equity remained virtually stable at  293 million in 2016 from  294 million at yearend
2015 this was due to the addition of the net profit less the  27 million in dividend paid out to bpfbouw the
solvency ratio decreased by 10 to 79 in 2016 as a result of the fee incentive payable to bpfbouw


cash position
at yearend 2016 bouwinvest had a total of  212 million available in its current account with our house bank abn
amro this was more than sufficient to cover all outstanding liabilities and was also in line with the formal
requirements of the alternative investment fund manager directive aifmd


profit allocation and dividend policy
the management proposes to allocate the result to other reserves

outlook
in the year ahead bouwinvest expects to increase its portfolio of assets under management to  9 billion from the
current  85 billion around onethird of the total portfolio currently consists of assets in the international
portfolio managed for bpfbouw we expect international investments to account for 37 of the total portfolio in
2019


on an international level we expect more investments in the north american and asiapacific regions to give the
portfolio a more balanced geographical spread we expect global real estate investment markets to remain highly
dynamic and that investment pressure will continue to lead to yield compression in the best locations which will
in turn lead to renewed interest in secondary products at the same time we expect our longterm return to be
57 in line with our targets


in the netherlands the conditions are near perfect for real estate low interest rates population growth economic
growth growing employment the recovery of consumer confidence and high real estate transaction volumes but
we also expect to face a number challenges in the dutch market how vibrant will dutch city centres remain given
the changes we are seeing in the retail landscape how do we make sure the cities outside the top 10 remain
attractive what is likely to happen on the rental residential market how will the elections affect the current
policy for the midrental segment how do we ensure a diversified supply in our major cities and how do we make
sure there are enough affordable homes


real estate market cycles do not run concurrently and it is possible to mitigate risks by continuing to spread
investments across continents countries cities sectors and investment products we will continue to follow that
strategy our acquisition strategy will remain focused on quality assets in stable countries transparent markets
and highlymarketable sectors

financial and sustainability ambitions to create longterm stakeholder value

ethics law society compliance risks and human resources and devise a strategy to deal with them on an ongoing
basis this matrix will help us to refine our priorities and our ambitions it will also make us more aware of just how
essential it is to integrate esg criteria in our daytoday business moreover the matrix will serve as the starting
point for discussions with various relevant stakeholder groups

co2 footprint bouwinvest organisation
in 2012 bouwinvest started to improve the transparency of the management organisations co2 emissions a year
later we expressed our ambition to make our operations carbonneutral by 2020 we have already made significant
progress in reducing our emissions in recent years and we took further steps to reduce emissions in 2016 this year
our efforts had the following results
      electricity consumption in our head office fell by another 8 in 2016 taking total reduction to 42 since the
       start of active energy management in 2010
      changes in waste processing resulted in a decrease in the related emissions of 66 compared to 2015
      the use of more fuelefficient lease cars including hybrid and electric lease cars resulted in stable co2
       emissions while the number of kilometres driven increased by 2
      a sideeffect of an increase in our international real estate allocation was a 35 increase in co2 emissions
       from air travel compared to 2015


these and other measures led to a total reduction in our total co2 emissions of 1 compared to the previous year
carbon emissions intensity calculated as tonnes of co2 fte dropped by 5


within the dutch portfolio various measures are taken to reduce energy levels and co2 emissions the remainder
of the co2 emissions related to energy usage are offset by purchasing socalled guarantees of origin garanties
van oorsprong this is part of our policy to limit the negative impact on the environment and stimulate the use of
sustainable sources for more information about the environmental impact of the real estate portfolio and the
results achieved see the respective annual fund reports and the csr performance indicators set out in the annex

human resources management

introduction
the focus of bouwinvests human resources management hrm policy is to ensure the company has the optimum
number of staff consisting of highlyeducated engaged and enthusiastic professionals who work together to
realise our business goals and create value for our stakeholders we see highly enthusiastic people as the key to
our success bouwinvest can only continue to book sustained progress while remaining firmly in control thanks to
their commitment dedication and hard work


longterm strong performance
bouwinvest has 146 employees 1366 ftes and  85 billion in assets under management this means we need a
flexible organisation to achieve our goals of solid returns and controlled growth an organisation that can respond
effectively to the rapid changes in the real estate world and the laws and regulations we need to deal with for
that we need expert and engaged employees we need to recruit people who fit within our organisation with the
right skills and expertise and we need to retain those people by offering opportunities for personal and
professional growth


we have strategic personal planning and succession planning in place as part of our business planning cycle the
input for this plan comes from the reim business plan the fund plans and investment plans department plans and
the plans of individual employees bouwinvest has a development programme for team leaders and high
potentials we conduct a biannual employee engagement survey which gives our employees the opportunity to
say whether we are on the right track but also to identify potential improvements this is one of the ways we keep
pace with rapid developments and constantly make our organisation even more effective


building value
bouwinvest sets great store in being a good employer to compare our performance in the market we use a
national benchmark financial companies with fewer than 1000 employees we emerged as third in the
netherlands according to this benchmark as an employer bouwinvest has a clear policy for employment terms
hrm systems recruitment and equal opportunities and rewards we endorse the dutch central banks prudent
remuneration policy


bouwinvest believes in a healthy worklife balance and offers individually customised working hours parttime
contracts it tools to support work anytime anywhere and generous paid leave in the office itself we offer
customised flexible workspaces health programmes and sports programmes we use all of these programmes to
support the sustainable employability of our employees bouwinvest encourages employees to participate in
activities not directly related to their daytoday work and our young professionals can join young bouwinvest to
develop new skills and expand their networks


sustainable partnerships
bouwinvests results are partly thanks to the collective efforts of all our employees working together towards our
shared goals we see collaboration across the organisation as essential enhancing collaboration was therefore
one of our main corporate targets last year and to achieve this we defined and implemented a number of specific
improvements for every department


innovation was another collective target in 2016 bouwinvest set up an innovation lab last year to encourage our
employees to stay uptodate with innovations in the real estate world technological innovations have an impact
on virtually all areas of real estate and how it is used the innovation lab has led to a number of initiatives that we
are currently working on and implementing


last year bouwinvest installed its first elected works council more than 90 of our employees participated in the
elections other opportunities for employees to help shape our organisation included projects such as the
redevelopment of business tools or helping to devise a new corporate mobility concept we find that this kind of
engagement with employees increases understanding and buyin for the choices we make which in turn facilitates
the smooth implementation of organisational changes

operational control
introduction
banks insurance companies and pension funds but also specialised investment managers like bouwinvest have
to deal with ever stricter regulations and monitoring by regulatory bodies as a result institutional investors
attach ever greater importance to internal risk management compliance transparency and open reporting to
stakeholders


bouwinvest has an effective internal control framework based on the coso framework the internal control
framework provides reasonable assurance that the management company and the funds it manages will achieve
their financial and operational objectives the effectiveness and efficiency of the business the reliability of its
financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations bouwinvest is in possession of a positive
isae3402 type ii statement which was renewed for the fifth year in a row for 2016



risk management process  internal framework
bouwinvest recognises the importance of a solid process and framework for risk management aimed at identifying
and mitigating risks which in turn makes it possible for the company to achieve its goals more effectively
bouwinvest has chosen the globally recognised coso framework as the basis for its risk management this model
goes beyond internal controls and covers the entire internal management system and is known as coso ii or the
enterprise risk management framework ermf bouwinvest used this framework to draw up its own reporting
and monitoring framework with its four lines of defence model see figure below compliance risk management
control and internal audit have all been designed in line with this model this model takes an integrated approach
to compliance and risk management with policies designed to meet the requirements of regulatory bodies public
opinion and shareholders while the execution of supervisory functions are made as focused efficient and cost
effective as possible


the four lines of defence are
1 board of directors  responsible for embedding the risk and control environment in the organisations
    daytoday operations
2 the compliance risk management and control functions  responsible for riskrelated compliance and control
     policies efficient and costeffective implementation of the policies and continuous improvements

in early 2014 bouwinvest was one of the first parties in the netherlands to obtain an afm licence as required by
the aifmd this licence allows bouwinvest to manage funds that are open for other institutional investors besides
bpfbouw the aifmd specifies certain transparency and integrityrelated requirements for alternative investment
funds in 2015 bouwinvest further optimised its reporting processes in addition to this bouwinvest streamlined
its cooperation with depositary intertrust in 2016 bouwinvest conducted an assessment of the processes in place
and made any necessary improvements but discovered no major issues bouwinvest foresees no aifmdrelated
challenges for 2017


dutch financial supervision act

op het financieel toezicht bouwinvest is therefore subject to supervision of the dutch financial markets
authority afm and the dutch central bank dnb

work towards its goals more effectively the risk management department uses a risk management cycle to

description of responsibilities for the financial statements
responsibilities of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance
with part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code furthermore management is responsible for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from
material misstatement whether due to fraud or error


as part of the preparation of the financial statements management is responsible for assessing the companys
ability to continue as a going concern based on the financial reporting framework mentioned management
should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so


management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the companys ability
to continue as a going concern in the financial statements


the supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the companys financial reporting process


our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence for our opinion


our audit has been performed with a high but not absolute level of assurance which means we may not have
detected all material errors and fraud


misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements the materiality affects the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the
effect of identified misstatements on our opinion


we have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit in
accordance with dutch standards on auditing ethical requirements and independence requirements our audit
included eg
     identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to
      fraud or error designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtaining audit
      evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a
      material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve
      collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal control
     obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
      that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
      effectiveness of the companys internal control
     evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
      estimates and related disclosures made by management
     concluding on the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and
      based on the audit evidence obtained whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
      that may cast significant doubt on the companys ability to continue as a going concern if we conclude that
      a material uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related
      disclosures in the financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our opinion our
      conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report however
      future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern
     evaluating the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements including the
      disclosures
     evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner
      that achieves fair presentation


we communicate with the supervisory board regarding among other matters the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during
our audit

reporting of performance indicators
bouwinvest reports environmental data of those assets where there is management control possible operational
control approach data is provided for those assets where we have authority to introduce and implement
operating policies and are responsible for purchasing energy and water and handling waste our management
control differs greatly by asset type eg residential and office these differences affect the level of influence we
have over the sustainability performance of our assets


like for like data and changes represents assets which have been fully owned and operational for the full 24 month
period in our investment portfolio it provides insight in the performance of an indicator over time at a constant
portfolio scope the reduction in ghg emissions can be explained by the compensation of carbon emissions
through purchase of carbon certificates this follows the commitment of bouwinvest to reduce the impact its
operations has on climate change


energy emission and water intensities are reported using shared services as the numerator and lettable floor
area lfa as the denominator shared services refer to landlordobtained consumption for common parts and
any services provided to tenant areas that have not been submetered
