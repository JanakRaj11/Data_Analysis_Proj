the sdgs represent the future we all want pmi has welcomed the adoption of the
sdgs and is committed to play its part in making them become a reality this means

taking decisive action where we have the greatest impact
                                  smoking cigarettes causes serious disease
                                  by replacing cigarettes with less harmful
                                  alternatives we can significantly reduce the
                                  negative impact of our products on society

our view on tobacco
regulation
the wellknown risks of smoking have led
regulators to impose more restrictions and
higher excise taxes on cigarettes than
apply to any other consumer product
 while allowing cigarettes to remain
available to adults theres absolutely no
doubt that tobacco products should be
subject to strict rules and enforcement

at times we have forcefully objected to
regulations such as those that remove
branding from our cigarette packages
we still believe that plain packaging
inappropriately treats adult smokers as
unable to make their own decisions and
we dont agree that banning legal sales
of cigarettes makes sense for smokers
or for society at large

with comprehensive requirements in
place to control nearly every aspect of
the cigarette business the question
becomes whats the plan to address the
needs of more than one billion people
who still smoke

the answer in our view is innovation  in
products and in policies as we work to
design a smokefree future our priorities
are changing technology that we and
others have developed makes it possible
to shift the tobacco and nicotine market        a cigarette manufacturing line on the lefthand side and a
towards a future in which cigarettes are        heated tobacco unit manufacturing line on the righthand side
replaced by less harmful yet satisfying       at our factory in neuchâtel switzerland
smokefree alternatives

in this context sensible science and       the rationale for                                       our success as a business was primarily
riskbased regulation regulation of                                                                   built on offering the best smoking
smokefree combined with further             our business vision                                     experience through our top quality
restrictions on cigarettes can help          we understand that our vision of replacing              cigarette brands including marlboro
address the harm caused by smoking            cigarettes with smokefree products is                  lm and chesterfield we are convinced
more effectively  and faster  than any      unprecedented for a tobacco company                    that our continued success will depend
other traditional regulatory measure         some will question our motives and                     above all on our ability to offer men and
                                              others will question why pmi would seek                 women who smoke less harmful alternative
to be clear regulations should continue      to transform a very profitable market for               products
to dissuade people from starting to smoke     cigarettes the answer is simple our goal
and encourage cessation but its equally                                                             our business case is straightforward

clear that millions of men and women will                                                             pmi leads the smokefree category thanks

continue to smoke and they should have                                                               to sustained rd investments we are

our commercialization
efforts behind
smokefree products
developing and manufacturing
scientifically substantiated smokefree
products is only the start the next
challenge is to convince smokers to switch
we learned a great deal about the
consumer conversion journey since our
city tests of iqos in milan italy and
nagoya japan in late 2014 smokers
need time to fully switch usually one to
two weeks and they need information
about how these novel products work

the regulatory environment in which we
commercialize our smokefree products
varies substantially around the world as
a result it is easier in some countries than
others to make smokers aware of smoke
free products and how they should use
them the differences in the regulatory
environment explain to a large extent
why switching to smokefree products
varies from one geography to another

smokefree products contain nicotine are
addictive and not riskfree we understand
that any communication with adult smokers
about these products must be carried
out responsibly attuned to the local
environment and observing regulatory              an iqos flagship
                                                  store in japan
obligations our employees and third
parties acting on our behalf must follow
strict principles in the commercialization of   a substantial part of our marketing and
smokefree products which are formalized                                                  good conversion practices
                                                sales budget in countries where we have
in our good conversion practices gcps       launched iqos has been reallocated from   gcps for smokefree products
which are being implemented as smoke           cigarettes to iqos clearly to promote    1 smokefree products are for adult

note 1  safety comes first at pmi so despite our lti rate being the best in our industry and one of the lowest among our fastmoving consumer goods peer group
we continue to seek improvement by extending mission zero because we care program beyond our manufacturing facilities we believe we can beat our lti rate goal
note 2  our overall crash rate which includes cosmetic damage has increased reflecting better internal reporting our preferred indicator  collision rate collisions per
million km driven which covers higher severity road accidents has continued to decrease  we will focus on this indicator going forward
note 3  newly acquired or built factories have begun the certification process because there might be new factories we may not reach 100 but that remains our goal

our focus so far has been on our main
smokefree product iqos in 2016
pmi engaged a leading notforprofit
organization verité¹ specializing in labor
and human rights issues and which is also
our strategic partner on the agricultural
labor practices alp program to carry
out a comprehensive assessment of the
labor management systems starting with
our main ems supplier the purpose of
the assessment was to identify strengths
and gaps in the suppliers systems and
to understand the living and working
conditions of workers particularly foreign
migrant workers that make up a significant
percentage of the suppliers labor force
pmi is working with the supplier and verité
on the management action plan which will
be implemented during 2017 and 2018

in addition we started to map out the iqos
supply chain to identify human rights risks

identified all suppliers totaling more than

10 weeks from april 2017 we collected          iqos devices are sold they can also be
100000 iqos heated tobacco units              returned returned devices are then
estimated 50 of consumption  to be            disposed of responsibly the disposal and

note 1  newly acquired or built factories have began the certification process due to the potential for new factories to be developed we may not reach 100 but that
remains our goal
note 2  in 2016 there was a slight increase in the amount of co₂ emitted per unit of product manufactured this was due to process changes resulting in a temporary
increase in manufacturing complexity
note 3  at the end of 2015 we beat our target to improve our water use efficiency by 20 compared to 2010 we are now developing a broader water stewardship
strategy and will communicate new waterrelated targets in due course in the meantime we aim to continue improving our water use efficiency year on year
note 4  on achievement of our target to recycle at least 85 of our factory waste in 2015 we have switched our focus to minimizing the amount of waste that goes to
landfill or incineration without energy recovery  disposal ratio
note 5  in 2016 there was a slight increase in the amount of co₂ emitted per km driven by our fleet this was due to a change in emission factors used for previously
reported biodiesel and inclusion of some vehicles that had not been captured in prior years
