unitikas environmental effort give u first report shes found issue complex shes done legwork u talked people company tell u layman term let see sheand theyhave say also shape different crosssections shiolis first interview report example triangle tube whatever shape needed hi im shioli kutsuna im unitikas okazaki different shape never knew could plant find whats going environmental unitika next let go bundle filament effort dont really know ask yet together draw long strong filament think go well yarn unitika dont worry shioli im sure youll great let get see spin fiber make thicker filament started strong enough use clothing fabric yes okay first plant seems large unitika clothing though also cut make big actually staple fiber used make composite fabric unitika big alright 30000 square meter would go roughly area six nagoya dome trouble making wow thats pretty big youd better start showing nice long around well never finish end visit cut today little piece unitika youre right start part plant unitika kind reclaimed make fiber recycled material staple fiber used much like cotton spun textile fiber made recycled pet bottle make uniform thing like unitika make fiber facility called uniecolo using empty pet bottle see exactly many pet bottle ah see youve collected empty plastic turn bottle shredding flake right kind recycled unitika exactly melt flake spin molten polyestel fiber plastic filament forcing special tiny unitika every day recycle equivalent 600000 nozzle watch 500ml bottle thats 220 million year oh yeah see hey incredible thats cool unitika yes pet bottle used unitika filament recycled polyestel fiber also spunbond extremely fine 1100th spunbond whats width human unitika well let show let go spunbond section hair even factory though theyre thin 29 environmental report unitika okazaki plant ah clever even considered eco make spunbond nonwoven fabric check approach thing spending extra energy transport recyclables apparently make spunbond unitika spunbond technical term nonwoven fabric people use terramac make fabric without weaving unitika manufacture one unitikas representative eco product terramac unitika good question see making fabric processing weaving yarn take quite long time effort understand terramac made corn spunbond process simply pass melted resin also happens biodegradable tiny hole forcing filament unitika well informed stick together fashioned sheet fast cost effective way make fabric calendar shoot wore garment used many different purpose made terramac thats found wonderfully environmentally excellent material like make unitika fabric used unitika yes see raw material chip sort substance called polylactide way often background come corn daily life unitika corn starchy plant like potato example sweet potato weve also started researching disposable might extract polylactide material like raw diaper hand garbage waste wood pulp sludge towel agricultural raw garbage would true sheeting civil engineering project industrial recycling material various application unitika terramac actually good example come recycled pet bottle recycling eventually decomposes water carbon dioxide latter become part unitika yes spunbond material called ecomix life cycle corn made made least 51 recycled pet bottle terramac sometimes one ecomixs main us stabilize foundation help solidify earth photosynthesis cycle remember learning engineering land reclamation project science class idea pet bottle could used many unitika yes fact carbon dioxide generated way breathed new plant mean terramac considered carbon neutral meaning unitika spunbond factory headquarters scrap contribute extra co 2 atmosphere cutting used make product recycled 20 ton month see mean replacing crude oilbased plastic film terramac would help reduce even recycle scrap recycled amount co 2 released earth atmosphere material unitika yes let tell another thinga lot pet bottle actually gathered unitika employee involved program collect okazaki plant everyone unitika group actually little something recycling environment hold doesnt cost lot money transport plastic bottle unitika actually dont extra truck assigned haul use truck would already traveling anyway various unitika facility simply load bottle whenever there little extra space 30 environmental report unitika okazaki plant unitika thats right polylactidebased plastic help u remarkably reduce co 2 emission compared shioli control room move touch switch conventional petroleumbased plastic must help reduce global warming terramac used unitika hey hey touching looking okay unitika oh lot thingsgarbage bag various kind sorry amazed big machine heatresistant food container tea bag towel could controlled one little computer clothing cell phone office equipment many unitika indeed others heart might using terramac without even system right knowing seems like really diverse material terramac hope start getting wider use see japan around world bet big job keeping getting energy natural gas steam good order running unitika let finish introducing natural gaspowered properly every cogeneration system day looking would big unitika 2006 okazaki plant worked toho gas co install cogeneration system well thank showing around today work first time visit factory like half time exciting felt like scene unitika used make electricity burning oil fuel charlie chocolate factory one cogeneration use combination city gas manufacturing process another could hardly tell steam generate factory cover lot electrical need unitika trust got know little steam energy sound environmentally friendly unitika environment unitika yes eliminates sulphur oxide emission typical yes put perspective seeing raw burning fossil fuel using fuel efficiently material thing made even get 18 better energy saving mention manufacturing process energy 26 reduction co 2 used together think little help thats awesome youve really come environment impressive clever way save energy okazaki plant unitika every day year little unitika let show cogeneration system control room little might know grew australia environmental preservation really ingrained people general mother active thing
