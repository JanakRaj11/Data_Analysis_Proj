   reducing greenhouse gases by changing energy fuel sources

in addition to reducing our overall energy consumption as the                  cogeneration systems at both our uji and okazaki plants and
unitika group we have also dramatically reduced our co2 output                  changed the energy source for these from oil to the much less
through a two step of change in energy fuel sources first from coal            environmentally burdensome natural gas as a result on a co2

   logistics

to reduce the environmental impact of transportation needed for inputs of raw materials and outputs of products and waste products unitika
implements the four logistic guidelines shown below these guidelines have helped us make acrosstheboard improvements in transportation
efficiency and in reducing energy consumption and emissions gases


       we will shorten transport distances by lending borrowing or swapping generaluse products or materials of equal quality with other companies

       within japan we will use container transport by sea or rail whenever possible since these methods enable mass transport and are energyefficient

       forklifts used for work inside sites will be changed from enginedriven models to environmentallyfriendly batterydriven models with zero emissions
       gases and low noise

       we will reduce transportation energy consumption by using flexible containers that can wrap larger numbers of products instead of paper bag
       wrapping materials and by shaping containers for more efficient truck loading



in line with an april 2006 revision to japans laws pertaining to rationalized energy consumption we have started energysaving initiatives for
logistic
in fy 2006 unitika and unitika group companies were registered as the designated shippers for a total freight transport volume of 107654
thousand tonkm resulting in a co2 emissions volume of 36 thousand tons tco2

               shiolis first interview report                                             example triangles tubes or whatever shape is needed

   hi im shioli kutsuna and im here at unitikas okazaki           different shapes i never knew you could do that
             plant to find out whats going on with environmental
                                                                              unitika next lets go to where we bundle these filaments
             efforts here i dont really know what to ask yet but i
                                                                                       together and draw them into long and strong filament
             think it will go well
                                                                                       yarns
unitika dont worry shioli im sure youll do great lets get
                                                                                 i see you spin the fibers to make thicker filaments
         started
                                                                                           strong enough to use in clothing fabric yes
   okay then so first of all this plant seems very large
                                                                              unitika not only for clothing though we also cut them to make
             how big is it actually
                                                                                       staple fiber which is used to make composite fabrics
unitika its big alright its about 30000 square meters or
                                                                                 but why would you go to
         roughly the same area as six nagoya domes
                                                                                           the trouble of making
   wow thats pretty big youd better start showing me                         them so nice and long
             around now or well never finish by the end of my visit                      but then cut them into
             today                                                                        little pieces

unitika youre right so start here in the part of the plant where          unitika this kind of reclaimed
         we make fibers from recycled materials                                       staple fiber can be
                                                                                       used much like cotton
                                                                                       or spun into textiles
     fibers made from recycled pet bottles                                             to make uniforms
                                                                                       and things like that
unitika here we make fibers with these facilities called
         uniecolo using empty pet bottles                                      i see so exactly
                                                                                           how many pet bottles
   ah i see how youve collected all the empty plastic
                                                                                           do you turn into this
             bottles and are shredding them into flakes right
                                                                                           kind of recycled
unitika exactly then we melt the flakes and spin the molten                              polyestel fiber here
         plastic into filaments by forcing it through special tiny
                                                                              unitika every day we recycle the equivalent of about 600000
         nozzles watch
                                                                                       500ml bottles thats about 220 million a year
   oh yeah i see them hey
                                                                                 incredible
             thats cool
                                                                              unitika yes and these pet bottles can be used not only for
unitika these filaments
                                                                                       recycled polyestel fiber but also for spunbond
         are extremely fine
         about 1100th the                                                       spunbond whats that
         width of a human
                                                                              unitika well let me show you lets go to the spunbond section
         hair and even
                                                                                       of the factory
         though theyre
         so thin we can




                                                                         29

                                                                                                                              from the unitika okazaki plant



                                                                                ah very clever so even that can be considered an eco
 this is how they make spunbond nonwoven fabric check it out                         approach to things not spending extra energy to
                                                                                          transport recyclables
   so apparently this is where they make spunbond but
             what is it

unitika spunbond is our technical term for a nonwoven fabric
                                                                                     more people should use terramac
   how do you make a fabric without weaving                       unitika here we have the manufacture of one of unitikas most
                                                                                      representative eco products terramac
unitika good question you see making fabric by processing
         the weaving yarns takes quite a long time and effort                  as i understand it terramac is made from corn and
         the spunbond process simply passes melted resin                                  also happens to be biodegradable
         through tiny holes forcing it into filaments which then
                                                                             unitika you are well informed
         stick together and can be fashioned into a sheet its a
         very fast and cost effective way to make fabrics that                  i did a calendar shoot once where i wore a garment
         can be used for many different purposes                                         made of terramac thats how i found out about it and
                                                                                          what a wonderfully environmentally excellent material it
   like what
                                                                                          is and this is where you make it
unitika such fabrics are used
                                                                             unitika yes and here we see the raw material chips of a
         in all sorts of
                                                                                      substance called polylactide
         ways often in
         the background                                                         these come from corn
         of our daily lives
                                                                             unitika not only corn but other starchy plants like potatoes and
         for example in
                                                                                      sweet potatoes weve also started researching how we
         disposable
                                                                                      might extract polylactide from other materials like raw
         diapers hand
                                                                                      garbage waste wood pulp and sludge
         towels
         agricultural                                                           from raw garbage now that would be true
         sheeting civil engineering projects and as industrial                          recycling
         materials for various applications
                                                                             unitika terramac itself is actually a very good example of
   and all that can come from recycled pet bottles                         recycling because eventually it decomposes into water
                                                                                      and carbon dioxide and the latter can become part of
unitika yes our spunbond material is called ecomix and is
                                                                                      the life cycle of corn which can then be made into more
         made with at least 51 recycled pet bottles
                                                                                      terramac and so on
         sometimes more one of ecomixs main uses is to
         stabilize foundations and help solidify the earth in                   the photosynthesis cycle i remember learning about
         engineering and land reclamation projects                                       that in science class

   i had no idea pet bottles could be used in so many              unitika yes the fact that the carbon dioxide generated will be
             ways                                                                    breathed in by new plants means that terramac itself is
                                                                                      considered carbon neutral meaning that it does not
unitika at the spunbond factory headquarters all the scraps
                                                                                      contribute any extra co 2 to the atmosphere
         and cuttings that are not used to make products are
         recycled once again about 20 tons a month                            i see so that means the replacing of crude oilbased
                                                                                          plastics and films with terramac would help reduce the
   so you even recycle scraps from the recycled
                                                                                          amount of co 2 released into the earths atmosphere
             materials

unitika yes and let me tell you about another thinga lot of
         these pet bottles are actually gathered from unitika
         employees who are involved in our program to collect
         them here at the okazaki plant

   so everyone in the unitika group is actually doing a
             little something for recycling and the environment but
             hold on doesnt it cost a lot of money to transport all
             those plastic bottles

unitika actually we dont have any extra trucks assigned to
         haul them we use trucks that would already be
         traveling anyway between the various unitika facilities
         and simply load the bottles on whenever theres a little
         extra space




                                                                        30

unitika thats right polylactidebased plastics help us
         remarkably reduce co 2 emissions compared to
                                                                                      shioli in the control room moves to touch a switch
         conventional petroleumbased plastics

   so that must help reduce global warming so how is
             terramac used                                                   unitika hey hey no touching just looking okay

unitika oh in lots of thingsgarbage bags of various kinds                    sorry i was just so amazed that such a big machine
         heatresistant food containers tea bags towels                                 could be controlled by this one little computer
         clothing cell phones office equipment and many

             knowing it it seems like a really diverse material this                 here
             terramac and i hope it starts getting wider use in
                                                                                 i see and i

         cogeneration system                                                              day

   looking up this would be that its so big

unitika in 2006 here at the okazaki plant we worked with toho
         gas co to install this cogeneration system
                                                                                 well thank you for showing me around today it was the
   how does it work                                                             first time for me to visit a factory like this and half the
                                                                                           time it was so exciting that i felt like i was in a scene
unitika we used to make electricity by burning oil as a fuel but
                                                                                           from charlie and the chocolate factory just one
         with cogeneration we use a combination of the city gas
                                                                                           manufacturing process after another i could hardly tell
         and the steam we generate at the factory to cover a lot
                                                                                           where i was
         of the electrical needs we have
                                                                              unitika and i trust you got to know a little more about what we
   steam into energy that sounds environmentally friendly
                                                                                       do at unitika for the environment
unitika yes it eliminates the sulphur oxide emissions typical of
                                                                                 yes and it puts it all into perspective seeing the raw
         burning fossil fuels and by using fuel more efficiently
                                                                                           materials and all the things made from them even the
         we get about 18 better energy savings not to mention
                                                                                           manufacturing processes themselves and how energy is
         a 26 reduction in co 2 
                                                                                           used all together i think it does a little to help the
   thats awesome youve really come up with some                               environment very impressive
             clever ways to save energy here at the okazaki plant
                                                                              unitika we do what we can every day of the year little by
