a message from our vp of environmental health  safety
jay small
                                since becoming a public company in october 2012 we have made significant
                                investments and improvements in our environmental health and safety ehs
                                programs in this short period of time we have committed resources and put
                                in place programs to improve performance as described in this report the
                                programs are yielding positive results we have fewer injuries per hundred
                                employees we are reducing our impact on the environment

                                 at adt we take the safety of our team members and the environment seriously
                                 in fact we strive to work in an environment that is free from recognized hazards
and at the same time create minimal negative impact on the environment we believe that all injuries are
preventable and that everyone should go home from work in the same condition or better then when they came
to work as a company weve developed and implemented policies and processes that will enable us to reduce
our impact on the environment ehs goals and objectives have been developed and placed in managers annual
performance reviews each employee is expected to follow all ehs rules and requirements as well as identify or
correct unsafe actions behaviors or situations this is necessary if adt is going to meet its objectives

i hope you find the information in this report valuable and would welcome any feedback you may have at adt
environment health  safety matters




                                                                                                   page 3

since becoming a standalone company in october 2012 adt has committed significant resources to reduce
our impact on the environment we have not experienced any reportable spills or releases to the environment
in addition during 2014 adt allocated approximately 870000 us to reduce building greenhouse gasses at
our largest locations these locations before the efforts accounted for approximately 54 of our total building
greenhouse gases efficiency improvements are being made in the lighting air handling and computer operations
at these eight locations these improvements alone are expected to save 56m kilowatt hours and 3837 metric
tons of co2 we estimate that this will account for about a 4 reduction of our total greenhouse gas production

adt has implemented programs to ensure ongoing compliance with environmental
regulations and to reduce waste these include a waste recyclingdiversion program
at all of our call centers and many of our office locations since starting the recycling
effort we have seen our waste diversion percentage climb from 5 in 2012 to almost
30 in 2014 we have also developed a plan that will allow us to increase our
percentage of alternate fuel and hybrid vehicles in order to achieve our 2015 fleet
greenhouse gas goals

programs that address our largest waste streams electronic scrap and batteries
have been put in place our program requires 100 recycling of all electronic scrap
from all of our field offices as well as requiring the return of all used batteries to
our field offices electronic scrap and battery disposal are managed through the
use of adtapproved vendors

as part of our environmental communications program adt has developed and
circulated environmental absolutes which communicate four key environmental
requirements to all employees these absolutes are posted in all field offices

we have also been investigating and implementing ways to reduce greenhouse
gasses from our fleet since 2012 we have been purchasing more fuel efficient
vehicles and our average fleet miles per gallon have seen an improvement of approximately 53
this is a savings of over 300000 gallons of fuel annually or preventing over 3150 metric tons of carbon dioxide
from entering the atmosphere also as of december 2014 approximately 6 of our fleet is capable of running
on alternative fuels or are hybrid vehicles we currently have plans to order two vans by the end of fiscal year
2015 which will run on compressed natural gas additional hybrid vehicles will be purchased as well in an effort
to phase out the 74 gasonly powered vehicles used by our patrol group assuming the hybrid vehicles meet our
requirements we will order additional vehicles during the following replacement cycle




                                                                                                      page 5

adt has identified threeyear safety goals based on the 2012 baseline designed to protect our most valuable
resource  our team members while we are not yet at the end of the three year period we have seen significant
improvements in all of our metrics


   recordable         lost time            injury
    injuries           injuries           severity
       14                21                58




our proactive prevention programs that have helped us achieve these reductions
include the investment of over 1000000 us to ensure our team members have
the requisite personal protective equipment ppe and training this included the
purchase and distribution of ppe bags to all field and sales employees additionally
we have trained our field team to take a few minutes prior to the beginning of each
job to identify and control potential hazards it is these efforts and programs that
are changing the safety culture and are helping to yield quantifiable results we
have seen yearoveryear improvements in all three safety metrics as of the end
of fiscal year 2014 we have achieved a 14 reduction in our total recordable
incident rate from our 2012 baseline a 21 reduction in our lost time injury rate and a
reduction in the number of days which were lost during the same period by 52 we have reduced our lost
day severity rate by 55 we have not experienced any work related fatalities and our serious injuries have been
reduced by 20 from the 2012 baseline

in addition adt has developed nine safety absolutes which are posted in every office and carried by all adt field
employees as part of their safety equipment these absolutes are associated with nine safe behaviors that when
followed reduce the potential of serious injuries or fatalities

specific programs have been implemented to address our most common hazards and risks and our most significant
types of injuries these include
 movesmart training for all field employees this is an instructor led interactive training course movesmart
    transfers highlevel mental and physical tools people need to dramatically reduce injuries and to take personal
    control of their own safety approximately 2600 field technicians and managers have been trained to date and
    we have seen a 20 reduction in our nonmotor vehicle sprains  strains
 bulli ray  dog bite prevention training for field technicians and sales team members
 implementation of a jobsite observation process for managers which includes visiting team members while
    they are on a job and having a conversation about what was observed this may include such positive
    items as the appropriate completion of a job hazard analysis proper use of ppe or in some situations where
    concerns are identified providing coaching and corrective feedback to ensure that expectations will be met in
    the future to prevent them from being injured
 pre job planninghazard identification using job hazard analysis
 monthly incident review meetings
 distribution of safety and environmental alerts



                                                                                                     page 6

adt operates a fleet of approximately 4500 vehicles in the us and canada programs have been put in place
to address both the hazards associated with driving the vehicles and the emissions they produce as collisions
involving motor vehicles are one of our top causes of injuries special programs have been put in place to address
the issues these programs include mandatory driver safety training and our motor vehicle safety policy and
standard which includes signing the adt driver code of conduct and compliance with our motor vehicle safety
absolutes additionally we are installing reflective tape on the rear of the vehicles to increase visibility and help
reduce rearend collisions these programs are yielding results as we have seen significant improvements from our
2012 baseline year

specifically our injuries per million miles driven have been reduced by 51 collisions per million miles have
been reduced by 28 and the percent of fleet vehicles involved in a collision are down by 32 adt is constantly
reviewing our fleet safety initiatives in order to determine if there are other programs that could be implemented to
help us prevent motor vehicle incidents and injuries

the installation of drive cam cameras in 126 vehicles in two of our businesses have helped adt identify unsafe
actions and risky behavior the cameras record triggering events that allow us to analyze these events for atrisk
behaviors and address them proactively rather than reacting after a motor vehicle collision plans are underway to
expand the program into targeted installation and service vehicles

adt is also a member of the network of employers for traffic safety nets we benchmark our programs and the
three fleet metrics mentioned above to determine if there are programs that have been effective at other companies
that could be implemented within adt

recognizing that our employees are our most valuable asset adt has implemented a comprehensive wellness
program for both employees and their families this program known as healthy rewards offers cash rewards up
to 400 per year for employees and 200 per year for spousesdomestic partners upon completion of an initial
health assessment and wellnessrelated activities these activities include biometric screening and participation
in programs which may improve health we have also implemented a tobaccofree policy at all of our locations in
addition there are programs to assist in stress management weight control sleep issues and health improvement
depending on the location and size some of adts sites have fitness centers medical clinics and offer local
activities related to wellness

participation levels continue to increase in our wellness programs in 2014 we achieved over 50 of our employees
participating in the health assessment employees were also engaged in a variety of wellness programs including
biometric screenings coaching challenge and local activities as part of our healthy rewards program we expect
that this will allow us to reach our goal of a 60 participation rate in the health assessment by the end of 2015

ehs management system and compliance
adts ehs management system policy was published shortly after we became
a public company in october 2012 the policy consists of 15 elements which
describe requirements necessary to meet our ehs vision and values

adts ehs management system provides a framework to put our vision and
values into practice by clearly stating expectations for compliance accountability
sustainability and continuous improvement the success of each of these
elements is dependent on the implementation of a comprehensive approach
throughout north america senior management must clearly communicate what
is expected by every manager and employee and then we empower employees
to not only suggest and implement programs but also to intervene in order to
prevent injuries this helps us to achieve our goals and reach our vision

the management system policy is applied across north america and addresses
the specific requirements to prevent injuries to our team members environmental
incidents and achieve our shortterm goals and ultimately our vision

since october 2012 adt has received only 14 regulatory inspections and reviews
in canada and the united states combined resulting in fines and penalties
totaling just 800 us sites also perform their own ehs selfassessments as
required in the ehs management system policy these internal audits evaluate
the effectiveness of the sites implementation of the adt ehs policies standards
and any internallydeveloped programs to minimize hazards and risks the results
of these selfassessments are entered into the adt ehs reporting system and
compliance gaps are tracked to closure to prevent recurrence and mitigate ehs impacts at the site all sites were
required to have their selfassessments completed by the end of the first quarter fiscal year 2015

ehs management system and compliance audits are also being conducted by a team of two to three trained
auditors from the corporate ehs staff to date 16 area audits have been completed the auditors have visited
over 30 sales and service offices and interviewed over 300 employees and 150 managers in addition over
170 installation and service job sites were visited the audits evaluate compliance with regulatory and adt
requirements and compliance with our management system gaps in compliance require managers to develop
specific corrective action plans which are tracked to closure in adts ehs information system enablon
in 2015 we will audit another 39 sales and services offices

the ehs department helps individual locations comply with the requirements and prepare for the audits through
a comprehensive support program that includes ehs guidance documents model programs and procedures
checklists and training

                                                                                                    page 9

education and training
since 2012 the adt ehs team joined forces with the operational support group to develop a three year training
strategy the overall focus of the strategy is to assure adt provides regulatoryrequired ehs training as well as
training for nonregulated hazards that our team members may face on a daily bases eg avoiding slips trips and
falls dog bite prevention through bulli ray and movesmart




a total of 20 safetyrelated curriculums were developed and rolled out for new hires to provide a sound foundation
when starting their career at adt in addition all team members now have access to a series of courses that can
be used as part of their annual ehs refresher training curriculums are specific to the job classification and type
of work that is performed rather than a generic training program for example the risks and hazards a customer
care associate faces on a daily basis are much different than those of an installer or service technician our
training programs target hazards team members may face daily whether ergonomics at a work station ladder
work in the field or driving to make a sales call adt provides safety and awareness training

the ehs content is housed on our internal learning management system lms and is now available from
any adt workstation this provides an opportunity for our workers to access any of our ehs training programs
remotely from their pcs or laptops our ehs curriculum contains over 25 courses in the united states and an
additional 25 canadaspecific courses we offer content in english and french canadian plans are in place
to update all of our training content over the next twelve months using vendors with expertise in safety training

our required ehs training goes beyond the mandated courses in our lms system for our field personnel we
offer a weekly tool box talk that is available either electronically through our lms or can be printed out and
distributed at the local sales and service office our operation support team also distributes robust monthly
ehs training and testing collateral this training targets our installers and service technicians and is specific to
the hazards they may face while working for adt

finally if an adt team member does sustain a workplace injury the incident is evaluated if there is information
that can be shared with all of our team members to help assure they dont sustain the same type of incident the
ehs department will release a safety alert the alerts are meant to heighten awareness and remind team
members of corrective actions they take to help ensure the incident is not repeated




                                                                                                         page 10

leadership
an ehs strategy cannot be effective without the proactive support and participation of executive leadership
adts ehs council meets on a monthly basis and is chaired by our chief executive officer the council also
includes key members of the executive leadership team and senior functional leaders in addition to chairing the
ehs council the ceo provides strategic direction establishes companywide targets and practices and ensures
implementation of the overall ehs program

the adt vice president of ehs establishes companywide strategies policies and standards oversees company
wide implementation audits and performance and report results to the ceo and the nominating and governance
committee of the board of directors each quarter

this council is not unique to the corporate headquarters council meetings are conducted monthly within each
region and area and these are typically led by the regional general manager and area manager key members
of these area councils include employee representatives field management and sales managers all of the
councils follow the requirements outlined in the management systems policy which includes the communication
of minutes and tracking of action items




                                                                                                  page 11

communications




one of the foundations necessary to achieve adts ehs vision and values is a strong communications
program we have addressed this by putting in place a multifaceted communication program which requires
the support of management and employees in addition to developing the ehs branding that is used for all
produced items and correspondence safety alerts are distributed by the corporate ehs team and these are
discussed and posted at each location many sites have dedicated video screens which routinely post safety
information for general dissemination as mentioned previously key communications have also been distributed
in the form of both safety and environmental absolutes given to all employees these absolutes are some of the
most important requirements which must be complied with in order to reduce the likelihood of serious injury to
employees and environmental incidents the absolutes have been printed on luggage tags which have been
placed on the safety ppe bags
