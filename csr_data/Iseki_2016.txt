bringing agriculture to the next stage
iseki group has so far made various proposals including lowcost cultivation such as sparse planting technology to
bring about agriculture that inspires hopes for the future
on the other hand the agriculture in japan is undergoing major changes such as introduction of largescale farming
entry of companies into farm business conversion staple rice into other crops for full utilization of rice paddies etc
