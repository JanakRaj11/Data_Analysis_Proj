together with institutes from science and production fraport has been
conducting a feasibility study on the usability of exoskeletons at the
frankfurt site since 2016 worn on the body the machine supports and
enhances the movements of the wearer among other things exoskeletons
are developed for industrial applications such as for lifting heavy loads
available components are to be adapted for the work in aircraft handling
and the baggage service and a check will be made as to whether the
physical stresses of our employees can be significantly reduced

   beginning in november 2015 all airport operators air traffic controllers ground handling services and aircraft pilots in europe are now uniformly required to
   report securityrelated incidents here bird strikes
