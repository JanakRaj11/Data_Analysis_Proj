dear readers


right now you are holding in your hands our fourth sustainability report which covers the years 2012 and 2013 this report
follows the guidelines of the global reporting initiative version 40 for institutional anchoring we appointed a sustainability
manager as central point of contact in 2012


we have opened ourselves further to society and on june 17th 2014 conducted our first stakeholder dialogue with external
groups industry customers science politics and society here we received valuable indications as to which aspects are most
important to our stakeholders in january we conducted an internal dialog with a select subset of our staff and can therefore
determine the material report contents we would like to thank all parties involved for their commitment


during the preparation of this report we have once again found that the path towards a sustainable development for our institute
is an ongoing process and that we have to readjust our strategies and internal processes time and again the reasons for this are
changing political conditions keyword energy transition and changing framework conditions in the financing at fraunhofer as
such a reduced basic financing leaves less leeway to proactively approach social challenges


a social challenge is fittingly described by schneidewind and zahrnt in their book damit gutes leben einfacher wird so that a
good life becomes more simple as


    scientific insights and a multitude of personal experiences with rebound and growth effects with respect to efficiency in
    creases are leading in more and more people to a loss of trust in that a sustainable development is possible with t echnology
    alone 1


this increases our conviction that in the future we only want to establish those products and technologies on the markets
that  in addition to their function  are ecologically socially and ethically harmless


please do not hesitate to contact us  there are exciting challenges that we can a pproach jointly


best regards




eckhard weidner			                              görge deerberg

liebe leserinnen und leser


sie halten gerade unseren vierten nachhaltigkeitsbericht in den händen der die jahre 2012 und 2013 abdeckt dieser bericht folgt
den leitlinien der global reporting initiative version 40 zur institutionellen verankerung haben wir 2012 einen nachhaltig
keitsbeauftragten als zentralen ansprechpartner benannt


wir haben uns der gesellschaft weiter geöffnet und am 17 juni 2014 unseren ersten stakeholderdialog mit externen gruppen
wirtschaft kundenkreis wissenschaft politik und gesellschaft durchgeführt hier haben wir wertvolle hinweise bekommen
welche die wichtigsten aspekte für unsere stakeholder sind einen internen dialog haben wir im januar mit einer auswahl
unserer belegschaft durchgeführt und können damit die wesentlichen berichtsinhalte bestimmen wir danken allen beteiligten
für ihr engagement


bei der erstellung dieses berichts haben wir wieder festgestellt dass der weg zu einer nachhaltigen entwicklung für unser institut ein
fortlaufender prozess ist und dass wir unsere strategien und internen vorgänge immer wieder neu justieren müssen gründe dafür
sind sich wandelnde politische bedingungen stichwort energiewende und veränderte rahmenbedingungen in der finanzierung bei
fraunhofer so lässt uns weniger grundfinanzierung weniger spielraum gesellschaftliche herausforderungen proaktiv anzugehen


eine gesellschaftliche herausforderung wird von schneidewind und zahrnt in ihrem buch damit gutes leben einfacher wird
treffend beschrieben


    wissenschaftliche erkenntnisse und vielfältige persönliche erfahrungen mit rebound und wachstumseffekten bezüglich
    effizienzsteigerungen lassen bei immer mehr menschen das vertrauen schwinden dass mit technik alleine eine zukunftsfähige
    entwicklung möglich sei 1


dies bestärkt uns in unserer überzeugung dass wir zukünftig nur produkte und technologien in den märkten etablieren
wollen die  neben ihrer funktion  ökologisch sozial und ethisch unbedenklich sind


bleiben sie uns gewogen und zögern sie nicht mit uns in kontakt zu treten  es gibt spannende herausforderungen die wir
gemeinsam angehen können


es grüßen sie herzlich

     a sustainable society is technically and economically                           innovative but rather go far beyond that we want to solve
