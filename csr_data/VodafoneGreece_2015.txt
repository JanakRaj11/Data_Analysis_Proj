    managing sustainability 



as businesses face increasingly more reserved stakeholders as a result
of the economic crisis and the consequent lack of trust in large
enterprises the need for transparency has become all the more vital
vodafone greece has worked hard to rise to this challenge and to put
in place suitable management systems certified by recognised bodies
we recognise that maintaining and building trust which is of vital
importance requires unwavering dedication and constant alertness
to that end our systems continue to develop as we come face to face
with new issues we cannot avoid all ethical business issues we might
have to face but our business principles are designed so as to ensure
that our stakeholders know that vodafone greece always endeavors
to make responsible choices
