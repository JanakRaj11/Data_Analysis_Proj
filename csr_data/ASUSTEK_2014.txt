fghg emissions among the ghgs specified in the kyoto protocol the fluorinated gases have   n2o emissions based on the supplier inventory the main n2o emission source is result from
higher global warming potential gwp the hfcs and pfcs contained in fire extinguishers      burning fossil fuel such as natural gas petroleum and diesel and n2o emissions were made
are the most common sources of fghg sf6 which is the highest gwp is the second source       up of only 1 of the total ghg emission thus they were not the main emission sources
of fghg mostly coming from panel suppliers the inventory result showed that fghg
emissions made up of 44 of major ghg emission and thus they were one of the main
emission sources

     concluding the above analysis

     scope 2 ghg emission is more significant than that of scope 1 it would be more eﬃcient
                                                                                                    in both upstream and downstream supply chain
     to set reduction strategy on scope 2 as priority
     in terms of gwp the control of sf6 commonly used in the semiconductor and panel industries
                                                                                                    driven the upstream supply chain
     would be more eﬀective in scope 1 emission reduction
                                                                                                    asustek has invited our suppliers to perform ghg inventory by the end of december
     over 40 of suppliers had implemented external verification and set ghg reduction targets
                                                                                                    31 2012 we had brought over 50 suppliers to perform ghg inventory after asustek
     as ghg reduction has become a concern of industry this will benefit ghg reduction issues
                                                                                                    completed the carbon footprint project we shared our experience regarding ghg inventory
     asustek had included ghg inventory energy saving and emission reduction into supplier
                                                                                                    on various conferences many parts suppliers who receive carbon footprint requests from
     csr audit education and training these approaches will help convey asustek concern
                                                                                                    other clients had contacted asustek for further advice
     and requirements regarding this issue

we believe that this will not only help build our vendors capability in ghg inventory but also   asustek has answered cdp questionnaire annually the details of asustek ghg inventory
discover any possible reduction in carbon footprint of the product                               data of 2013 will be available at the cdp oﬃcial website after september 2014

product is where asustek can have the most impact regarding climate change issue for the
energy consumption during the use stage produces the most ghg emissions therefore
besides providing more green products to consumers we also continue to improve energy
eﬃciency of our products to help consumers save on electricity costs and reduce the use of
energy and the ghg emissions


we also educate our consumers on how to save on electricity costs through creating the
energy calculator this tool could help them to estimate their energy consumption electricity
costs and ghg emissions according to their using habits as well as promoting the idea of
energy saving and environmental protection
