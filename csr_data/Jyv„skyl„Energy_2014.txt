                     the plus points
   the use of wood reached the recordhigh level of 445  of the fuel flow of
    our power plants the use of wood will increase in accordance with the
    companys strategy
   carbon dioxide emissions fell due to the increased share of wood fuel
   almost all ashes were utilised 97
   the water business commissioned the renovated janakka water production
    plant
   the renovation of the sewage network has served to reduce the number of
    water leaks in korpilahti and tikkakoski among others
   our price of district heat was lower than the average price in the ten largest
    cities in finland
   the number of occupational accidents was recordlow
   among our new strategydriven projects are a reporting service that allows
    customers to monitor their electricity heat and water consumption and an
    expanded fault information service both of which improve the quality and
    efficiency of our customer service
   our improved telephone services are now available also in evenings and
    during weekends

                     je groups year 2013
                     the minus points
   peat has been in short supply for several years and the volume of peat
    production was low in summer 2013 as well due to the peat shortage we
    had to cut down on electricity production and use plenty of coal in district
    heat production
   the full capacity of our power plants could not be utilised because the
    market price of electricity was on such a low level for long periods of time
    that it did not pay to produce condensate electricity
   in addition to the external factors that lowered the utilisation rate the
    production of the keljonlahti power plant was reduced by a leak in the flue
    gas economiser
   the warm weather reduced the sales volume of district heat by about 6
    compared to the year 2012 despite the fact that there was an increase in
    the number of cubic metres of the buildings connected to the district heating
    network
   the prices and operating costs such as taxes of solid fuels are expected
    to keep rising in the next few years
   the maintenance and renovation of the water supply system will still require
    sizable investments for many years to come

   the groups losses for the financial period totalled 114 m compared to the previous
    year the result weakened by 675 m the groups operating profit stood at 406 m
    165 m of interests were entered as income for the owner
   the groups equity ratio has improved due to the owners investment in an unrestricted
    equity fund but it is still weak another reason for concern is the large amount of
    liabilities in relation to the turnover and profitability
   the groups significant investments in the energy production capacity in recent years
    have increased the amounts of depreciation leasing costs and interest expenses they
    will have an adverse effect on the groups profits for several years the result is
    expected to turn positive in the financial year 2015 at the earliest
   the growing costs have not been included in the sale prices in full because we want to
    ensure the price competitiveness of district heating in the long term jes district heat
    price was lower than the average in a comparison between the largest cities in finland

   the financial period was the second one in the groups history when the groups two
    power plants were operated throughout the year owing to this the use of oil in heat
    production remained minimal and the use of wood increased significantly exceeding
    44 of the fuel flow
   the group has taken and is taking several measures that will significantly increase the
    share of wood in its fuel selection and thus decrease its dependence on peat
   due to the uneven availability of peat the group invested in equipment permitting the
    use of coal in the keljonlahti power plant the equipment was taken into use at the end
    of 2013 which means that its impact on the groups profits will only show from the
    financial period 2014 onwards
   we improved the management of development projects which is important in terms of
    strategy implementation by standardising tools and training project managers
   during the financial period we continued to make investments in the groups
    comprehensive and systematic risk management particularly in the management of
    foreseeable risks as part of the strategic management of business operations
   we are involved in launching the electric vehicle charging operator activities in finland
    together with 16 other finnish energy companies

    achieved its main targets by replacing the protective relays in the hämeenlahti substation and by
    starting the modernisation planning for the savela switching substation the building work will take
    place in 2014
   distribution networks were constructed in different parts of the distribution area the most important
    new construction sites were the heinälampi and mankola residential areas
   we made replacement investments in several distribution substations and power distribution cabinets
    in the area of the distribution network
   we carried out regional renovations in the holsti and sysmälä areas
   we prepared for the building of the new central hospital in savela by cabling overhead power lines

   the energy market authority issued its decision on the second regulatory period 2008
    2011 almost 15 years later than originally expected due to this jetransmission ltd
    has only the two last years of the third regulatory period for taking the required
    measures the distribution price was reduced by 6 as early as 1 january 2012
   the authority has made several policy decisions that have had a retroactive effect on the
    calculation of a reasonable return on electricity network operations for this reason the
    net present value of the electricity network fell by about 11 due to the regulatory
    decision concerning the second regulatory period
   jetransmission ltd has lodged an appeal with the market court against the energy
    market authoritys decision concerning the second regulatory period on 21 march 2014
   the sale of electricity distribution services declined by about 2 on the previous year as
    a result of the warm end of the year

    the availability of our production machinery was 89 in the financial period
    the keljonlahti power plant was operated from 1 january to 11 april and from 28 august to to 31
     december mainly for backpressure production because a peat shortage in the spring and the low
     market price of electricity in the autumn reduced condensate electricity production
    from january to april the plant was operated normally ie according to shareholders orders
     however due to a leak in the flue gas economiser the plant was not operated at full capacity
    a service building containing a storage space and a staff room for employees was completed in
     january
    from april to the end of august there was a maintenance outage in the power plant during which a
     coal reception line was installed in it the test runs were carried out in september
    the power plant was operated normally according to shareholders orders from the end of august to
     the end of december

   the availability of our production machinery was excellent 98 during the financial period
   the rauhalahti power plant underwent a twomonth maintenance outage owing to an automation
    upgrade production fell short of the forecast remaining at the level of about 80 which was mainly
    due to the mild weather during the autumn
   the availability of peat coupled with taxes constitute a significant risk for the company the reduction
    of which requires that the share of biofuel is increased in a controlled manner towards a technical and
    financial maximum
   the research activities carried out in cooperation with vtt technical research centre of finland
    metso corporation and kuopio energy with the goal of maximising the share of wood fuels were
    completed in spring 2013
   a decision to make modernisation investments in the rauhalahti power plant in order to prolong the
    plants service life to 2030 as a result of the increasingly stringent emission requirements of the ie
    directive was made in march 2014
