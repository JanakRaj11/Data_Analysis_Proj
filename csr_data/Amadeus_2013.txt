since our site in sophia antipolis represents
more than half of the total workforce the
uniflow system implementation in that
site has had a very significant positive
impact on the overall consumption of the
top 10 sites in addition each site continues
with its own improvement measures

furthermore in our efforts to continuously
improve the accuracy of the data gathering
process we have identified previous errors
in the information reported in some sites
particularly in madrid where the data
included for previous years was incorrect
due to an error detected in the aggregation
of information and we have now included
the right data this explains the difference
in the reported data in previous years from
the data included in the table below
