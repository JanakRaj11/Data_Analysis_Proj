   drawing on lessons learned in the past that we created plans without full execution of the measures we had
   decided to take and without ample analysis all jal group staff worked to demonstrate that the jal group has
   changed and has become a company that keeps its promises to its stakeholders under the harsh business
   environment that prevailed during this twoyear period caused by factors such as the grounding of boeing 787
   aircraft and a rapid decline in the yen we nevertheless strived to introduce new products enhance our services
   and improve productivity as a result we were able to attain our target of raising our operating profit margin
   to above 10 while revenues increased however earnings decreased yearonyear and we realized that we
   needed to develop the ability to respond to severe business environments

   at the beginning of fiscal 2014 we expected extremely severe business conditions which included intensifying
   competition at tokyo metropolitan airports as a result of the dramatic increase of international flight slots at
   haneda airport negative effects to traffic demand caused by the consumption tax increase and rising fuel
   costs due to the weaker yen accordingly we began by positioning that year as a period for establishing our
   business foundation in line with our projections for higher revenues and lower profit as it turned out the higher
   consumption tax rate had only a limited negative impact on demand for air transport while robust demand for
   inbound flights and a decline in the fuel markets served to alleviate the severity of the business environment we
   also made a concerted effort to reduce costs and improve our products and services as a result we achieved
   higher revenues and profits compared to the previous year we believe that we have established the business
   foundation for growth in the form of higher earnings on higher revenues

   my challenge and speed we will strive to enhance the jal brand and improve our products and services
   in order to become the first choice of more customers and to strengthen our cost competitiveness to accom

   medium term management plan furthermore in light of the projected expansion in the capacity of metropoli
   tan airports and rise in demand for inbound flights ahead of the tokyo olympic and paralympic games in 2020
   we will also proceed with building a corporate foundation capable of responding to various social changes

   during the followup meeting held in march 2015 mr hata
mura gave a lecture on the importance of creating a culture of
taking personal initiative in thinking and actions to add another
safety layer he offered advice on citing the effectiveness of
outputbased thinking of developing a pattern of thinking in
which we draw out knowledge by thinking for ourselves ver
balizing thoughts and taking action rather than seeking only to
increase knowledge through education and training
   we have begun applying outputbased learning to some of
the training sessions for cabin attendants who take part in
roleplaying exercises that enable them to think and act on
their own under unexpected circumstances the jal group
will continue to reflect the feedback and advice offered by the
safety advisory group to the management and safety opera

them happy also i have been analyzing customer survey results to
contribute to enhancing airport services applying my strengths and

as head of the ticket group in the jal plaza office i am responsible for overseeing the entire
counter and managing the operations of about 30 employees i joined jal in 1996 and became
a manager in 2014
   after my daughter was born i took a oneyear childcare leave before balancing parenting
and my job by working shorter hours until she was three when she was small i sometimes
felt guilty going to work and frankly i still struggle to strike a balance between my job and
parenting i have come this far only because of my love for jal and belief that my workplace
allows me to reflect on myself above all i am motivated by my daughter who tells me mom
dont ever quit i like you working at jal now as a manager i often come home late so i make
up for it by cooking meals with loving care
   more employees in my workplace are having children i think they will be able to take even
greater steps forward with unique sensitivities and an awareness of women i hope to continue
working in my own way with a deep appreciation for my family and colleagues

increased by 200000 tons from the previous fiscal year as a

       in february 2015 the ambulances were received at narita airport and loaded onto a
