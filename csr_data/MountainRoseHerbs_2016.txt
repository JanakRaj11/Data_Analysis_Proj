energy usage
we are proud to have converted to 100 renewable energy by investing in solar power and offsetting our
remaining electrical usage to renewable energy sources credits and development projects through
carbonfundorg and our local utilitys greenpower program


solar array
we recognize that the majority of our carbon emissions come from operating lights and electronics in our
facility in 2015 we constructed a solar array and electrical vehicle charging station we installed a
100panel 25kwh system that will produce an estimated 32604 kwh of power in the first year over the
expected 35year lifespan of the system it is anticipated to offset 470 tons of co2 which is equivalent to
the conservation of 10980 trees or 48170 gallons of gasoline
