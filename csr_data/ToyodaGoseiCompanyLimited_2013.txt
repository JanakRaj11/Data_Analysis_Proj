   ing process was used
   but we chose an injection molding process promising more
   consistent quality because a blow molding process was known
   to cause variance in plate thickness however the shape of the
   duct hampered its being molded in one go so we had to split it
   into two parts for molding and join them later by fusion joining
   in order to ensure the reliability of fusion joining we worked
   out the best way to split the duct through repeated simula
   tions taking various fusion joining methods and conditions into
   consideration in the end we adopted vibration fusing which
   uses vibrations to cause fusion from friction heat we
   screened the fusion joining conditions such as the ampli
   tude of vibrations and fusion joining force by utilizing test
   evaluation data fully and succeeded in ensuring suﬃcient
   strength while controlling the formation of unwanted burrs
   we aim to push it for adoption in fueleﬃcient cars equipped with
   turbochargers continually in the future
