these estimated savings from these initiatives at trombay plant from these initiatives stands at approximately
3441 crore
the energy consumption outside the organizations boundary have been calculated and they have come to be
extremely miniscule as compared to that inside the organization boundary




     national energy conservation week at trombay
     we celebrated national energy conservation week at rcf trombay unit from 14th december to
     21stdecember 2015 the activity of celebrating the energy conservation week was started from
     14thdecember the energy conservation day itself with an objective to create more interest and
     awareness among all the employees about this concept slogan essay energy quiz  poster contest was
     organized the common theme of the contest was energy efficiency energy conservation and renewable
     energythe above contests got overwhelming response from all the plants as well as departments in our
     unit overall about 180 employees participated in the conteststhe valedictory function was organised
     on 21stdecember 2015 on this day a lecture by shri rv nesari freelanced energy auditor was
     organised during the presentation shri nesari who has a vast experience in the field of energy
     auditing briefed about his experiences in the energy audit field he also briefed about the process for
     marching to pat cycle2 the case studies of energy audits of ammonia and urea plants in india as
     well as outside india conducted by him were also shared during the presentation on the same occasion
     pamphlets highlighting necessity of energy conservation furnished by maharashtra energy development
     agency were distributed to all employees within the factory in order to create awareness about energy
     conservation amongst the employees




we also use renewable energy in the form of solar water heaters in rcf hospital factory canteen and in sewage
treatment plant so as to reduce energy consumption of nonrenewable sources through our solar fittings at thal and
trombay we have consumed 3120 gj of solar energy across locations leading tosaved ghg emissions with the
commissioning of 2 mw solar pv plant at trombay in january 2016 we have saved around 8416 gj till march end

our co2 emissions are minimum                                    trombay in thal the value for the same is 2453 tco2e
we initiated the exercise of carbon footprinting for             which is only 006 of the total ghg emissions
both our plants in the year 201011 and have been                 in line with the gri g4 requirements we have initiated
updating the same every year this exercise helped us             calculation of ghg emission intensity per tonne of

towards greener energy we have already installed                 to reduce ghg emissions in our operations we have
solar power generation facilities of 10 kwp each                 taken several initiatives  both inprocess improvement
two at trombay and one at thal unit two facilities of            and energy efficiency enhancement as ghg emissions
2 kwp each at two marketing offices and a 50 kwp                  are directly related to the overall energy consumption
solar power plant at thal we have also setup 2 mw               all the energy efficiency improvement measures
solar pv plant at trombay unit at thal we have setup           implemented by the company have also led to reduction

after the process of treatment is completed the effluent
which is not usable is discharged to deep sea in
conformity with maharashtra pollution control board
mpcb standards the values of quality parameters for
treated effluent discharge are well within permissible
limits of the mpcb the total amount of effluent
discharged over the last three years is depicted below

            the effluent generated in complex fertiliser ammonium nitrophosphate anpnpk
            20200 plant granulation section contains nutrients such as ammonical nitrogen nitrate
            nitrogen  phosphates in dissolved and undissolved form to recover undissolved solid
            nutrients from the effluents our rd department has installed a bench scale pilot plant at
            anp plant the installation was completed on 4th december 2015 and the commissioning
            of plant was completed on 21st december 2015
            in the system 12 m3 to 20m3 of effluent with solid nutrient content about 35 to 50
            was processed to get nutrient slurry with concentration of solid nutrients 6070 this
            leads to recovery of undissolved solids nutrients 0810 mtpd this is equivalent to
            0810mt of suphala npk product this corresponds to a saving of 22056day the
            expected annual savings are approximately 55 lakhs 250 stream days apart from
            nutrient recovery and recycle of nutrients from effluent load on effluent treatment plant is

                    foundation principle of inclusivity no material evidence is found to suggest that rcf has not applied the principle of
                    inclusivity in engaging with its stakeholders different departments engage regularly with their relevant stakeholders through
                    multiple engagement channels

                    of sustainability performance has been excluded from the report

                    principle of responsiveness rcf has applied the principle of responsiveness with respect to its stakeholders no material
                    evidence is found to suggest that responsiveness principle is not being applied in dealing with the stakeholders

                    the report meets the requirement of reporting as specified by gri g4 in accordance comprehensive guidelines

                    observations and recommendations

                    without affecting the overall conclusions on the sustainability report the following observations and recommendations are
                    made
                              the set of criteria and indicators used for identification and prioritization of stakeholders may be refined in future
                               reports
                              an exhaustive list of indicators has been provided in the materiality matrix however some material aspects being
                               broader in nature are getting overlapped with others materiality matrix needs to be improved in future reports
                              rcf recognises the increasing importance of supply chain in growth of business and has proactively initiated
                               several steps to ensure the overall sustainability of its supply chain however rcf should enhance the disclosure
                               level towards the outcome and effectiveness of these initiatives in the future reports
                              templates for data collection and questionnaires sent for stakeholder engagement exercise for materiality
                               assessments should be easytocomprehend with clear terminologies trainings on the same should be provided
                               before rolling them out
                              awareness level of onsite personnel towards gri reporting requirements needs to be enhanced on information that
                               needs to be reported in the sr
