which the state is the majority shareholder provided by the ownership steering department on october 1
2014


tax strategy
all companies in the group have committed to operating responsibly and to meeting all obligations and
requirements defined by the valid legislation of each country posti group companies pay their taxes in the
countries in which their actual business operations take place all taxes are to be paid on time without delay
the groups longterm target is to ensure that the groups effective tax rate is at the same level as the
corporate income tax rate valid in finland at each particular time

according to the groups tax strategy taxation is always a consequence of business operations which means
that tax solutions must also be based on business needs posti does not practice tax planning that would aim
at artificially decreasing the groups taxable income in taxrelated issues the group operates within the
framework of legislation and legal practice in planning the taxable profit of group companies this can
include the utilization of tax losses accrued in a subsidiary or the granting of group contributions for
example in transfer pricing between subsidiaries posti aims to always ensure that the prices are market
based to clarify taxation practices some situations may involve contacting the tax authorities for either
verbal guidance or a written decision on the taxation treatment of the planned action


management of taxrelated issues
the management of taxrelated issues is centralized to the group finance unit which is responsible for
managing and monitoring taxrelated issues at the group level decisions related to taxation are made at
the group level significant matters of principle are presented to the parent companys board of directors for
decisionmaking the groups cfo reports regularly on taxationrelated issues to the groups audit
committee the key task of the management of taxrelated issues is to ensure that all group companies
comply with the regulations of tax legislation in all countries of operation tax risk management is part of the
groups risk management process

principles observed in tax reporting
the information presented in this report is based on information collected from the groups accounting
systems taxes refer to taxes or taxlike fees paid to public sector entities whether they are paid or remitted
by the company the nature and amount of taxes vary significantly from country to country taxes payable
refer to taxes paid by the group companies which are as a rule expensed in the companys financial
statements taxes remitted refer to taxes or fees collected by the companies which are remitted to tax
collectors often on behalf of parties other than the company itself

the company has restricted its tax reporting to only cover substantial operating countries based on this
decision countryspecific tax information is only presented for finland and russia nearly 84 of the groups
net sales comes from these countries according to the groups strategy these countries are its main markets
other operating countries are grouped under scandinavia and other countries posti also uses the same
geographical categorization in its consolidated financial statements

for countries other than finland and russia information is presented on a country groupspecific basis as the
information reported is not of material importance and the presentation of countryspecific information
might jeopardize the nondisclosure of confidential information such as customer or pricing details from the
groups perspective the amount of information reported is not of material importance when the taxes
payable for an individual country do not exceed eur 5 million

the group operates in nine countries in addition posti has companies in countries where the group no
longer has business operations when assessing the materiality threshold net sales of eur 1 million for each
individual subsidiary is considered the threshold for nonmateriality nonmaterial companies are excluded
from the reporting as the amount of taxes paid by the companies is minor in proportion to the figures
disclosed by the group these companies are in the categories scandinavia and other countries

changes in group structure during the financial period are described in more detail in the groups financial
statements release

in 2015 the groups effective tax rate was 171 2014 34 the divestment of logistics operations in
scandinavia in fiscal year 2015 had a significant effect on posti groups position with regard to taxation
postis sale of postal center properties in spring 2015 resulted in significant taxable profits


tax disputes
the large taxpayers office has partly approved posti group corporations petition for the deduction of
losses by foreign subsidiaries merged into the company based on a decision made in october 2015 these
losses were approved in the amount of eur 24 million at the same time postis petition for the deduction of
losses in the amount of eur 390 million was refused posti considers the decision erroneous in this respect
and has decided to lodge an appeal regarding the tax authoritys decision with the board of adjustment of
the large taxpayers office konserniverokeskuksen oikaisulautakunta

stakeholder survey results
at the turn of the year posti surveyed its stakeholders views regarding the regulation of the postal industry
the future of the industry as well as their perceptions related to corporate responsibility the survey was sent
to consumers and business decisionmakers as well as representatives of the public administration and labor
market organizations

the results of the survey indicate that consumers business decisionmakers and influencers in the public
administration all understand the need for change in the postal industry and support the customerfocused
development of the business according to the respondents the most important objectives related to
regulatory reform in the postal industry include ensuring reasonably priced postal services throughout the
country on the one hand and easing regulation to curb the increase in delivery costs on the other hand

the respondents were asked about how to best secure the availability of postal services in the future the
most commonly held view was that services are best secured by improving the profitability of postis business
and easing the regulation of the postal industry subsidizing postal operations from the state budget or by a
separate postal tax was not a popular option among the respondents

consumers value postis comprehensive retail network and accept that posti must develop its cooperation
with partner companies to ensure the availability of postal services

with regard to responsibility the themes highlighted as the most important by the respondents included
ensuring confidentiality and information security for customers as well as ethicality and transparency in
business promoting occupational safety and the wellbeing of the personnel as well as improving energy
efficiency and reducing emissions from transport operations and properties were also rated as important
issues for postis image as a responsible company

 measuring the customer experience
 recognizing that the customer experience is key we constantly request
 feedback from our customers in order to further improve our operations
 we conduct customer satisfaction studies both on a project and incident
 specific basis and with more comprehensive customer satisfaction surveys
 that are conducted regularly once or twice a year in finland we
 conducted one extensive consumer and business customer survey in
 2015

 the consumers overall rating of posti as a whole declined from the
 previous year the overall assessment represents more than the sum of
 customer experiences as it is related to a broader view of postis position
 in society customer ratings related to parcel delivery however improved
 substantially from the previous year and remained at a high level this was particularly attributable to a
 high level of satisfaction with regard to homedelivered parcels and parcel point services the overall
 satisfaction rating for customer service decreased slightly from the previous year but the ratings for self
 services provided at posti outlets and via the online and mobile channels remained at a good level

 among business customers the net promoter score nps increased from the previous year for postal
 services as well as parcel and logistics services customers have been satisfied with postis parcel services for
 several years customer satisfaction among freight and supply chain customers in finland also improved
 from the previous year

responsible employer
posti conducts a personnel survey annually the voice survey assesses the extent to which employees are
dedicated to their work and their employer and the extent to which the employer is successful in facilitating
good performance the survey is divided into eight themes employee commitment facilitating performance
teamwork and cooperation future and leadership performance management wellbeing strategy and
cultural change

the survey was conducted in september in finland sweden estonia latvia lithuania and russia more than
11000 posti employees completed the survey which represents 62 2014 59 of all personnel

based on the results the employee dedication index was 47 2014 48 this means that slightly under
half of employees expressed a positive attitude towards the four aspects measuring dedication when
compared to the norm in the postal and logistics industry on a global scale the result can be considered low
posti is undergoing a major transformation which may be reflected in the results of the personnel survey
linking ones own role and activities to the strategy is a key factor in assessing dedication the results also
revealed clear differences between different units and employee groups the results indicate that the
implementation of strategy has reached the management supervisor and expert levels of the organization
to a good extent

at 58 2014 58 the performance facilitation index was higher than the employee dedication index it
measures the extent of an organizations commitment to producing excellent customer service and high
quality products or services and to basing its operations on the practices of continuous improvement
cooperation with ones closest colleagues in particular was rated at a good level


uusi polku program helps employees get a new start
postis business is undergoing a major transformation and in recent years we have had to carry out several
cooperation negotiations with personnel representatives based on productionrelated and financial reasons
in these difficult situations it is important for posti to operate responsibly and seek solutions related to
personnel impacts in cooperation with personnel organizations

as a responsible employer we have invested in helping our personnel to cope with the changes in the
industry in 2014 we launched the uusi polku new path support program for our personnel the support
program offers personal counseling and services to those who are interested in a new career retraining or
starting a business in addition to the services posti offers a monetary lump sum in compensation

reducing environmental impacts
postis environmental management is based on
environmental management standards particularly iso
14001 as well as legal and official requirements and the un
global compact principles our quality and environmental
policy covers all of our countries of operation

the targets for our environmental work are determined by our
corporate responsibility steering group our business groups
determine more detailed operating programs as part of their
management model environmental issues are discussed by
our management board and the audit committee at least
once a year as part of more extensive corporate responsibility reporting

our environmental program aims to reduce our carbondioxide emissions by 30 by 2020 in relation to net
sales compared to 2007 in addition we are party to a freight traffic energy efficiency agreement in
finland and have made a commitment to improve our energy efficiency in our transport by 20 by 2016
compared to 2008

transport and emissions from vehicles represent approximately 85 of our carbondioxide emissions in
finland as the largest transport and delivery company in the country we play an important role in the
development of environmentally friendly and energyefficient transport operations we improve the
environmental efficiency of transport operations primarily by planning routes efficiently ensuring a high
utilization rate combining deliveries and driving in an environmentally responsible manner

as part of our iso 14001 management system we increase our employees environmental awareness
through training and employee orientation environmental issues are also regularly discussed in our internal
communication channels at the end of 2015 our certified environmental management systems covered
88 2014 88 of the groups employees we have an iso 14001 compliant environmental management
system also in our warehouses in russia

continuous improvement in energy efficiency
between 2007 and 2015 postis carbon dioxide emissions relative to net sales have decreased by 16
absolute carbon dioxide emissions decreased by over 30000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or by 20
during the period in 2007 the international post corporation ipc set a common goal for its members to
reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the postal industry by 20 by 2020 in 2015 ipc members achieved
their collective 20 emission reduction target six years ahead of schedule

in addition to vehicles posti has also focused on buildings in its systematic efforts to improve energy
efficiency in finland electricity consumption fell by 3 and heating by 17 temperatureadjusted heat
consumption decreased by 9 postis finnish properties use electricity generated 100 by renewable
hydroelectric power

during the year posti conducted an energy audit at its properties pursuant to the requirements of the finnish
energy efficiency act an energy audit involves assessing the energy consumption profile of all the operating

locations of a company or group and identifying opportunities for energy savings

we have centralized our waste management services to a single operator in finland which helps us ensure
energy efficiency and costeffectiveness the aim of waste management is to minimize landfill waste and
increase recoverable waste with our waste management partner we have set a target of improving our
recovery rate by 1 per year in 2015 our recovery rate was 98 2014 95 and recycling rate 67 each
of our iso 14001 certified operating locations has a documented waste management plan that includes a
list of what waste fractions the property collects related operating models as well as illustrations of the
placement of waste containers at the property

with regard to the continuous improvement of energy efficiency and environmental efficiency posti is
committed to

    complying with all applicable environmental laws and standards including iso 14001
    reducing the fuel consumption of our vehicles
    reducing the energy consumption of our facilities
    improving recycling and reducing landfill waste
    considering environmental aspects in sourcing subcontracting and investment decisions
    engaging in open discussion with our stakeholders in order to minimize our environmental impact
    ensuring sufficient resources for maintaining and continually improving our environmental operations
    reporting our environmental impact annually and providing our employees with information and
    opportunities in order to operate in an environmentally efficient manner

 convenient repairs and recycling for pallets
 in order to increase our recycling rate and reduce waste volume we
 collect surplus and decommissioned pallets at our warehouses postal
 centers and terminals the pallets are handed over to lassila  tikanoja
 where they are sorted mendable pallets are repaired and delivered for
 further reuse for customers pallets that are beyond repair are chipped
 and recycled as fuel for energy production

 posti receives compensation for the pallets and at the same time the
 amount of wood waste is reduced the properties gain a cost benefit
 through lower property maintenance costs charged by posti kiinteistöt
 the service is part of postis waste reporting system by monitoring the
 reports we can verify the savings we have achieved

a pioneer of green logistics
all of postis delivery transport freight and warehousing services in finland are carbon neutral posti green
services that involve no additional cost to customers by using posti green products our customers can reduce
co2 emissions in their supply chain processes

posti green services are part of postis environmental program which is aimed at decreasing carbon dioxide
emissions by 30 by 2020 as part of postis environmental program the carbon dioxide emissions arising
from operations are actively reduced by route optimization the efficient combination of deliveries and using
an ecological driving style

the remaining emissions are neutralized through participation in climate projects in practice if transporting
a letter produces 20 grams of carbon dioxide or transporting a parcel produces approximately 900 grams
we use certified climate projects to ensure that an equal amount of emissions is reduced somewhere else

our fleet of approximately 4000 commercial vehicles in finland recorded a total of 108 million kilometers
last year posti plays a significant role in developing environmentally friendly delivery and transport we
have taken a pioneering role in this area by actively participating in the testing of alternative fuels in 2006
we were the first company in finland to roll out natural gas vehicles in delivery operations

our fleet currently includes approximately 40 biogas vehicles that run on 100 renewable finnish gasum
biogas biogas produces no harmful particles and practically no greenhouse gas emissions during its life
cycle we are also participating in the dual fuel research project by vtt technical research centre of
finland to investigate the combined use of biodiesel and biogas in heavy vehicles

in 2014 we equipped all of postis delivery and transport vehicles with driving habit monitoring devices the
devices are a daily tool used in production activities including supervisory work planning and operations
management some 10000 drivers have received training on the use of the monitoring device which
provides them with reports on their driving economy safety as well as improvement targets on their driving
habit

the driving habit monitoring devices help reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions they also
make it possible to set and monitor areaspecific targets for both consumption and emissions during the
year the monitoring devices and the improved utilization rate of our vehicles allowed us to reduce the
number of traffic accidents as well as our maintenance costs the average fuel consumption of vehicles used
in mail delivery operations increased by 08 from the previous year there were significant changes during
the review period with regard to the operating model and the use of vehicles the same vehicles were used to
carry mail parcels and freight the fill rate of vehicles improved substantially which led to an increase in the
average consumption in spite of an improvement in the driving habit index

we also deliver mail by foot and by bicycle a total of 1900 delivery routes are handled by bicycle and foot
every day which is 36 of all the routes we also use environmentally friendly electric carts 1200 electric
bicycles and electric cars increasing the number of electric cars in delivery operations has thus far been
challenging as electric cars suitable for winter conditions in finland are not available about half of the
mopeds we use are electric

cooperation is managed the sourcing policy supports postis strategy and environmental program as well as
the companys social responsibility and ethical principles it outlines decisionmaking responsibilities and
responsibility boundaries and it specifies the minimum requirements for suppliers and the sourcing
organization

as part of our approach to responsible sourcing we have defined a supplier code of conduct and require all
of our service providers and suppliers to adhere to it in addition to legality the supplier code of conduct
includes principles related to corruption human rights child labor discrimination working conditions and
environmental concerns each approved supplier must have an agreement saved in postis agreement
archive and must have conducted a selfassessment

in 2015 we harmonized our sourcing processes and systems in finland and the baltic countries which
supports the achievement of cost savings and facilitates the monitoring of compliance with the sourcing
policy we also launched a compliance project in sourcing in late spring 2015 with the aim of ensuring that
everyone in posti group complies with the common practices

during the year more than 90 of postis sourcing in finland originated from domestic suppliers we also
favored local suppliers in our other countries of operation of the suppliers approved during the year 86
were within the scope of selfassessment representing a combined purchasing volume of nearly eur 470
million
