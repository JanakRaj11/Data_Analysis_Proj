message from ceo
                                 in 2001 waterfront toronto was given a 20year mandate and 15 billion of seed capital
                                 to transform 800 hectares 2000 acres of underutilized brownfield lands into sustainable
                                 mixeduse communities but our mandate is really about more than just this in addition to
                                 revitalizing our waterfront  giving it back to the city  our objective is to make toronto a
                                 better city more economically competitive and prosperous for the longterm in an era
                                 where talent and capital chooses where to locate quality of life is a key factor in economic
                                 decisions waterfront toronto is in effect leveraging an infrastructure project to deliver
                                 key economic social and environmental benefits that enable toronto to compete
                                 aggressively with other top tier global cities for investment jobs and people

                                  we have successfully delivered a large portion of this initial mandate we have delivered
                                  beautifully designed mixeduse neighbourhoods and partnered with leading developers in
                                  the west don lands and east bayfront toronto now has spectacular new public parks
                                  such as corktown common sugar beach and sherbourne common we have
                                  improved public spaces such as the 17kilometre redesigned queens quay a new
signature street that invites residents and visitors alike to our waterfront in addition public art installations have elevated
the experience on our streets overall our work has contributed significantly to the attractiveness vitality and economic
growth of the city

strategic revitalization has resulted in momentum for realizing sustainable development excellence in urban design and
leading technology infrastructure founded in public policy objectives we are reconnecting people with the waterfront and
creating important economic environmental and social benefits toronto can be proud of the waterfront successes to
date

this is an exciting time to share a milestone update of our corporate social responsibility and sustainability report as
the president and ceo since 2003 ive had the pleasure of leading a dynamic and accomplished team of professionals
dedicated to making torontos waterfront bestinclass throughout this time and since our last report many of our
projects from our initial funding have moved from the planning and implementation phase to now being complete it is
immensely rewarding to see the impact of our work on the community and the growing recognition for our approach to
revitalizing our waterfront

we are pleased to present this report as an updated record of how we and our partners are meeting our greater social
and environmental responsibilities and how we are building more durable and beautiful spaces

this report covers the period from 2001 to spring 2015 and has been prepared using the global reporting initiative gri
framework an internationally accepted independent standard for reporting on sustainability performance our reporting is
based on gris g4 guidelines as well as the construction and real estate sector disclosure which covers key sector
specific issues the content is based on a set of performance measures that align with the three areas of sustainability
referred to as the triple bottom line the triple bottom line embraces an expanded set of standards for measuring success
by reporting social and environmental performance in addition to economic accomplishments

from these themes here are some of the results that we are particularly proud to include

        four leed gold buildings completed and several more under design and construction or under review by the
        canada green building council
        over 3600 trees planted
        108920 square metres of aquatic habitat created
        an average 90 per cent waste diversion rate for construction and demolition debris
        25 new or improved parks and public spaces
        496 affordable housing units built and another 80 units under construction
        seven public art installations completed
        attracting private sector investment including 1405 residential market units built and another 1500 units under
        construction and approximately 1 million square feet of commercial space
        more than 28 kilometres of critical infrastructure constructed including new watermains sanitary and stormwater
        sewers and
        generating 32 billion in economic output for the canadian economy 622 million in government revenues and
        16200 fulltime person years of employment
we are proud of our achievements to date even with the challenges encountered along the way construction projects on
the waterfront are faced with complex urban conditions such as contaminated and geotechnically unstable soils the result
of many decades of infilling and high water tables often outdated and unreliable drawings do not always accurately
reflect underground infrastructure during planning and design in the case of queens quay these challenges led to higher
than anticipated costs lessons learned from past projects are used to inform our approach as we carry forward with

waterfront revitalization

currently we are conducting due diligence on plans to naturalize and reroute the mouth of the don river building on the
flood protection achieved in the west don lands this project contributes to resiliency  providing regulatory flood
protection for 240 hectares 593 acres and unlocking the development potential of the port lands the flood protection
proposal addresses the fundamental challenge of transforming the underused port lands into a longterm asset that will
support torontos growth and economic competitiveness once flood protection is complete the plan is to transform the
area into resilient and sustainable mixeduse communities

with many new projects in the planning phase and underway we will continue to make strides in delivering a revitalized
waterfront we hope you enjoy this report and encourage you to share your thoughts with us

president and ceo waterfront toronto

who we are
the revitalization of torontos waterfront represents a multidecade collaboration between the three orders of government
originally established to address torontos bid for the 2008 olympics it evolved into the creation of the toronto waterfront
revitalization corporation in 2001  now known as waterfront toronto

like most modern urban waterfronts torontos waterfront is characterized by large tracts of government owned lands that
are largely vacant underutilized or zoned for industrial use the high percentage of public ownership of toronto waterfront
lands and their prime location adjacent to the financial core are important elements of torontos waterfront creating an
unprecedented opportunity to transform the face of toronto

to address this opportunity in november 2001 the city of toronto province of ontario and the government of canada
committed 15 billion 500 million each as well as land as seed capital to kick start the revitalization of torontos
lakefront they also established waterfront toronto to oversee all aspects of the planning and development of torontos
waterfront in december 2002 the government of ontario passed the toronto waterfront revitalization corporation act
the legislation which defines the corporations objectives powers obligations and authority

the project will ultimately deliver approximately 40000 new residences 40000 new jobs one million square metres of
employment space and 300 hectares of public parks making it one of the largest waterfront brownfield revitalization
projects in the world the scale of waterfront torontos two active downtown precincts is shown in the charts below which
detail the approximate proposed build out in square feet the table that follows provides unit numbers and gross floor area
of our completed building projects as well as for projects that are in the design or construction phase

waterfront torontos mission is to transform the waterfront into a series of sustainable mixeduse urban neighbourhoods
integrated with parks and open spaces that greatly expand the citys capacity for urban living employment and recreation
and reconnect people with the waterfront successful revitalization of torontos waterfront requires bringing together the
most innovative approaches to real estate development planning design and construction in a highly collaborative
manner

land under waterfront torontos jurisdiction is divided into five precincts central waterfront east bayfront west don
lands and the port lands the aim for each of these precincts is to develop high performance selfsufficient
neighbourhoods with land use functions that facilitate sustainable patterns of behaviour from residents and visitors alike
these will be new types of neighbourhoods for toronto with thoughtful consideration of neighbourhood pattern and design
linkages and connectivity to existing communities and green efficient infrastructure and buildings

in addition to these precincts waterfront toronto is transforming the wider waterfront ranging from sites in mimico in the
west to port union in the east see waterfront torontos website for further details on wider waterfront projects

                     to advance objectives of revitalization by strengthening the corporations governance practices and

business model
at our inception each level of government committed 500 million 15 billion in total as seed capital to help catalyze
waterfront revitalization in addition the province and the city committed the proceeds from the sale and lease of
government owned lands in the designated waterfront area to be reinvested back into the revitalization program

waterfront torontos funding model leverages public capital by working with public and private development partners who
purchase or lease land for development the money earned is used to further fund public infrastructure developers are
held to specific requirements concerning the design sustainability and construction of their projects through legally
binding development agreements that include financial penalties for noncompliance

the corporation is currently managing activities derived from government funding interest and short term rental income
and land salesfinancing waterfront torontos business model is predicated on the ability to phase development in order to
allow land sale revenues to pay for the incremental infrastructure investment required to remediate and service lands for
development

development approach
waterfront toronto has planning and development control over undervalued
and underutilized publicly held waterfront lands by undertaking most of
the upfront work waterfront toronto has improved building conditions
land values and attracted private sector investment this work includes
building major parks and public spaces ensuring that zoning is in place
building roads and services and remediating contaminated soil this
provides the private sector with a higher level of certainty in undertaking
development on the waterfront and leaves them with the two risks they are
best able to manage market and construction risk

waterfront torontos development approach is also based on partnering
with private sector companies that share the vision and values of
waterfront revitalization these partners are passionate and committed to
building a better city and raising the bar for development in toronto

precautionary principle
where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full
scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost
effective measures to prevent environmental degradation rio
declaration on environment and development 1992

the precautionary principle acknowledges that lack of full certainty should
not be a reason to delay decisions to secure human and environmental health waterfront toronto often errs on the side of
caution favouring decisions that protect people and ecosystem regardless of whether all the evidence is in to support that
line of action for example waterfront toronto uses policy and regulation to guide decision making on brownfield
redevelopment we conduct risk assessments that explore the likelihood that a substance has contaminated the property if
this likelihood is high further property investigations sampling and analysis is undertaken to protect ecological and
human health waterfront toronto implements risk management measures based on the outcome of the analysis

whats in our report
sustainability reporting allows organizations to collect data analyze performance identify and communicate strengths and
challenges and most importantly improve performance sustainability reporting also promotes transparency and
accountability

this is our first update to the corporate social responsibility and sustainability report initially released in 2013 it covers
the period from the establishment of waterfront toronto in 2001 to march 2015 the report provides information to
stakeholders about how we are working to deliver a revitalized waterfront a balanced triple bottom line approach is taken
quantifying success by environmental social and economic performance waterfront torontos corporate social
responsibility and sustainability report signals a significant move from project planning to implementation for many of our
projects

we report using the global reporting initiative gri sustainability reporting guidelines a widely adopted and
internationally accepted independent guideline for reporting on sustainability we used the gri g31 guidelines for our
initial report in 2013 our 2015 report is in accordance with the latest version the gri g4 core guidelines as well as the
construction and real estate sector disclosure which covers key sectorspecific sustainability issues

boundary of the report

this report covers three core boundaries which represent functions over which waterfront toronto exercises control or
influence and which generate significant impacts as displayed below




corporate operations refers to activities related to waterfront torontos internal operations and includes office
sustainability efforts and staff development

project implementation refers to projectrelated activities and makes up the core of our performance this includes
performance on our minimum green building requirements contaminated soil management flood protection and habitat
creation and restoration some of these items are designed and implemented by our development partners who undertake

work in accordance with our policy direction for example our developer partners are contractually obligated to meet our
minimum green building requirements and apply our environmental management plan

we have improved and expanded data collection requirements in contracts with all of our developer partners and
contractors this ensures we have relevant comprehensive and reliable data on which to base our continued
sustainability reporting as new developments are completed and become operational we will work with condominium
corporations and property managers to obtain information on actual performance data such as energy and water use

local community refers to the impacts of waterfront toronto on citizens such as employment generated community
investments made and parks and open spaces created

the majority of reporting relates to the east bayfront west don lands and the central waterfront however we have
also included some data from projects outside of this area namely mimico and port union where we have created parks
and aquatic habitat

defining performance measures
the process for defining report content followed the gri methodology as described in the guidance on defining report
content and the technical protocol applying the report content principles

to identify relevant topics waterfront toronto developed a sustainability framework that identified 11 key themes to
prioritize the topics waterfront toronto undertook a corporate performance management program that examined an
expanded list of priority topics based on alignment with corporate objectives these corporate objectives were identified as
both significant to waterfront toronto and to its stakeholders for the 2015 update waterfront toronto also solicited
feedback from internal and external stakeholders to refine priority topic areas finally the validation process condensed
the number of performance measures based on stakeholder feedback report scope boundary and availability of data to
produce the material set of sustainability indicators that informed the focus of this report

developing our sustainability framework
since its inception sustainability has been central to waterfront torontos mandate in 2005 we formalized our
sustainability framework in collaboration with stakeholders from the three orders of government consultants university
experts and agencies such as the toronto and region conservation authority input from global authorities and resources
such as the organization for economic cooperation and development oced city of vancouver beddington zero
energy development in england also helped establish our direction and priority focus areas

the sustainability framework identifies waterfront torontos sustainability vision and outlines the steps we aim to take to
achieve that vision it includes clear goals with specific actions and targets and supports the integration of sustainability
principles into all facets of waterfront torontos operations and decisionmaking

the sustainability framework is divided into eleven themes which were deemed to be the most material to waterfront
toronto

     1 energy
     2 land use
     3 transportation
     4 sustainable buildings
     5 air quality
     6 human communities
     7 cultural resources
     8 natural heritage
     9 water
   10 materials and waste
    11 innovation
the sustainability framework was peer reviewed by a team of swedish experts coordinated by the swedish trade
council comprised of university researchers municipal officials and sustainability practitioners which provided a
balanced and objective review they confirmed that the sustainability framework embraces leading goals and
implementation strategies

as a result waterfront toronto developed a variety of implementation tools that have set a policy framework to embed
sustainability into everything we do including our environmental management plan minimum green building
requirements parks and open space guidelines and our carbon tool

selecting performance measures
in 2007 waterfront toronto developed a corporate performance management program to align the sustainability
framework with waterfront torontos strategic business plan and six corporate objectives it assigned relative weightings to
themes set targets and identified priorities that addressed performance over time from shortterm development activities
to longer term resident and enduser actions for example 100 of waterfront toronto buildings must achieve leed gold

certification building energy efficiency must be at least 50 better than the model national energy code for buildings
and 50 of construction and demolition waste must be diverted away from landfills as other performance measures
become more material we will continue to add targets in future reports

waterfront torontos six corporate objectives

     1 sustainable development
     2 design excellence
     3 public accessibility
     4 economic prosperity
     5 fiscal sustainability and
     6 operational effectiveness
for details on our corporate objectives see the who we are section of this report

performance measures and current activities
we condensed the priority performance measures based on their significance to our stakeholders  business
governments and residents  and to our organization the status of development and data availability

for the 2015 report update waterfront toronto engaged with internal and external stakeholders to solicit feedback on what
they see as the key priorities and material issues three activities were undertaken to receive this feedback

     1 waterfront toronto hosted a town hall meeting to provide members of the public with an update on waterfront
        revitalization as well as an opportunity to share their thoughts and ask questions about our accomplishments and
        priorities
     2 waterfront toronto created a short online survey for external stakeholders to provide their feedback on the report
        as well as their satisfaction with the content and metrics in the environment social and economic sections
     3 an internal workshop was held with representatives from each waterfront toronto department to review our
        corporate reporting and metrics and rank topics to determine their materiality
the outcomes of these activities are illustrated in the materiality matrix

materiality matrix

the materiality matrix represents performance measures that were evaluated during the process for defining content
waterfront toronto reviewed its internal performance measures generated through the identification and prioritization
stages as well as performance indicators from gri that were applicable to waterfront torontos operations based on this
methodology performance measures are divided into three categories

        performance measures reported on in this report
        performance measures not reported on in this report
        significant performance measures not included in this report but to be included in the next report
through this process four performance measures were added affordable housing transportation intelligent
communities and public art in addition we updated existing performance measures with new content and data

summary of process

                                       performance measures

habitat creation and restoration
                       restoring aquatic and terrestrial habitat is an important part of waterfront revitalization improving
                       the health and diversity of the ecosystem makes for a more sustainable environment and a richer
                       waterfront experience

                       aquatic habitat toronto
as a founding member of aquatic habitat toronto waterfront toronto is committed to incorporating aquatic habitat
improvements into all projects undertaken at the waters edge aquatic habitat toronto is a consensusbased partnership
between agencies with a vested interest in improving aquatic habitat on torontos waterfront this includes fisheries and
oceans canada ministry of natural resources toronto and region conservation waterfront toronto the city of toronto
and environment canada aquatic habitat toronto helps to design suitable aquatic habitat in appropriate locations to offset
the potential impacts of waterfront projects

the wavedecks in the central waterfront
the series of wavedecks in the central waterfront were built to create more public space along one of the most heavily
used parts of torontos shoreline and have become iconic urban docks when planning the wavedecks we recognized
that underwater structures and shading could cause a potential loss of fish habitat with the help of aquatic habitat
toronto waterfront toronto installed a variety of habitat structures under the spadina rees and simcoe wavedecks such
as riverstone shoals boulders smaller aggregate root balls and tree logs together these structures provide space for
plants to take root increase shelter and improve foraging opportunities altogether 1780 square metres of aquatic habitat
has been created as part of these projects

the wavedecks were completed between 2008 and 2009 according to aquatic habitat monitoring conducted by the
toronto and region conservation authority trca an increase in the diversity and number of fish found in the spadina
rees and simcoe slips was observed




the trca also observed an increase in the native species postconstruction while the average nonnative species showed
an overall decline examples of fish species observed include

don river
as part of the work associated with the west don lands flood protection landform approximately 1100 square metres of
fish habitat was also created in the don river this was achieved by planting shrubby and herbaceous vegetation as well
as installing rocky vanes that provide cover and reduce sediment deposits under a new bridge section

mimico waterfront park
mimico waterfront park located on the shore of lake ontario in etobicoke is part of the wider waterfront constructed in
partnership with the toronto and region conservation authority the park was completed in two phases in 2008 and 2012
the park features a 11 kilometre multiuse linear trail connecting people to the lake in an area that historically lacked
public access to the water an important feature of the park included the creation of 19300 square metres of aquatic
habitat and 500 metres of linear aquatic habitat

portland slip
the portland slip is a part of the central waterfront waters edge promenade in june 2013 mandatory restoration was
undertaken to repair a dock wall at the slip when evaluating the potential disturbance to aquatic habitat as a result of this
work it was determined that creating habitat at a different location would provide more benefit and would have a greater
chance of ecological success than if efforts were made at the site of impact as a result a contribution was made to the
toronto island habitat bank project to create an equivalent of 10000 square metres of aquatic habitat

port union waterfront park
port union waterfront park located on the shore of lake ontario in scarborough is also part of the wider waterfront the
park was constructed in partnership with the toronto and region conservation authority and was completed in two phases
in 2006 and 2012

it features a 38 kilometre waterfront trail system numerous beaches pedestrian lookouts as well as important terrestrial
and aquatic habitat a principle feature of this project was to rehabilitate the waters edge by creating a cobble beach
providing structural habitat diversity and shoreline protection in total this project provided 86740 square metres of
aquatic habitat and 2633 metres of linear aquatic habitat

in total waterfront toronto projects have created or improved 108920 square
metres of aquatic habitat and 3133 metres of linear aquatic habitat




corktown common
opened in 2013 corktown common is a 73 hectare park in the west don lands built on a former industrial and
brownfield site the park is positioned atop a massive flood protection landform that protects the surrounding lands from
flooding the park features a playground splash pad athletic field open lawns a pavilion and an extensive landscape of
marshes prairies and woodlands to promote biodiversity

the landscape was designed with the following key principles in mind

        creating a place immersed in nature
        introducing ecological diversity to shelter and feed wildlife and migratory birds
        building a resilient urban landscape
        making a showcase for native southern ontario plant communities
        minimizing inputs to the municipal stormwater system
        maximizing the reuse of potable water and
        making the park a model for organic maintenance
native and torontoadapted species were used for 95 of the plant palette and over 700 trees thousands of shrubs
groundcover and aquatic plants were planted this ecological richness has encouraged plant and animal biodiversity and
supports a healthy forested area within the park the wetlands are already home to birds insects frogs and ducks

in addition an organic landscape maintenance guidelines document was created to ensure that the park is organically
managed and that the landscape remains a functional healthy and diverse ecological system some of the maintenance
principles include feeding the soil to benefit plant health rather than artificially stimulating plant growth leaving grass
clippings on the lawn to release nutrients back into the soil and using native plants for replacements or additions to the
landscape

don mouth naturalization
the port lands is a 356 hectare brownfield site that was once part of the largest wetland on the great lakes beginning in
the 1880s the area was lakefilled to support industry and portrelated activity today the land is underutilized and sits in
the don rivers flood plain creating a regulatory obstacle to revitalization

waterfront torontos flood protection plan will reroute and rehabilitate the mouth of the don river creating a healthier and
more naturalized outlet to lake ontario currently the don river makes a hard 90 degree turn into the keating channel
prior to being released into torontos inner harbour during a 100 year storm event one the size of 1954s hurricane
hazel the rivers current state would not be able to contain the heavy flows resulting in the flooding of a 290 hectare site
east and south of the don river naturalizing the mouth of the don river will protect against this flood risk and unlock the
development potential of the area while also providing opportunities for expanded greenspace biodiversity and natural
habitat

the environmental assessment for the don mouth naturalization and port lands flood protection project states that the
naturalization of the don mouth will

        improve aquatic and naturalization habitat
        improve linkages between habitats
        enhance biodiversity of aquatic and terrestrial species
        accommodate future changes in the environment
        enhance to the extent possible the low flow habitat conditions within the don narrows and
        address the publics risk of exposure to west nile virus

outer harbour recreational node

the outer harbour recreational node which opened in the spring of 2015 is an outcropping at the waters edge in lake
ontario park that offers an accessible space for recreational fishing birdwatching and natural appreciation located in
the eastern basin of the outer harbour the trails leading to the recreational node connect with the martin goodman trail
that extends across torontos waterfront

this space not only reconnects people with the waterfront and creates access for recreational activities it also provides
important ecosystem enhancements wood debris was incorporated into the shoreline to provide shading and refuge for a
variety of fish and amphibian species the node also includes submerged shoals that provide increased shoreline
irregularity and structural habitat as well as native plant species

leed gold certification
                       green buildings play an important role in sustainable development buildings account for a
                       substantial portion of canadas energy consumption natural resources extraction waste
                       generation and carbon emissions

                         in 2006 waterfront toronto developed its minimum green building requirements mgbr these
                         apply to all building projects within our waterfront precincts and support the development of
advanced high performance buildings as well as the adoption of sustainable lifestyle choices by residents and tenants
leveraging one of the most internationally recognized green building standards in the world the mgbr includes
requirements for leadership in energy and environmental design leed gold certification at the time leed was still
new to canada and gold certification was considered a stretch target intended to help transform the market our
expectation is that the success of our mgbr will showcase the economic viability of green buildings thereby driving and
inspiring municipalities and developers outside of the waterfront to also require and reach for elevated levels of
performance creating a greener real estate industry

in 2011 the mgbr was updated to better reflect current market conditions and to continue raising the bar on sustainability
our energy efficiency requirement increased from 40 reduction in design energy cost relative to the model national
energy code for buildings1 to 50 this requires that energy savings be demonstrated in terms of current utility costs
new requirements such as those supporting smart building design and electric vehicle infrastructure as well as leed
credits for water efficient landscaping water use reduction and onsite renewable energy were also added

significant operational improvements are achieved with high performance green buildings improved indoor air quality as a
result of increased ventilation and the use of nontoxic products makes for healthier occupants and increased productivity
for commercial buildings increases in energy and water efficiency result in buildings with lower maintenance and
operating costs over time

requirements for buildings

initiatives supporting energy efficiency

                        buildings
                        energy use in buildings is a key contributor to carbon emissions and global climate change as a
                        result waterfront toronto has prioritized energy efficiency and renewable energy generation for
                        our buildings and park projects this priority was set out in our sustainability framework in 2005
                        and implemented through our minimum green building requirements mgbr

since its launch in 2006 the mgbr have been updated to better reflect market leading practices and regulatory changes
we add new requirements when measures can reasonably be expected to be adopted by the real estate development and
construction industries key updates include leed credits for indoor and outdoor water use reduction higher energy
performance and smart building design features such as electric vehicle infrastructure waste management and long term
flexibility new waterfront toronto projects are required to achieve at least 50 cost savings relative to the model national
energy code for buildings mnecb1 under leed 2009 and 12 leed points or 30 cost savings relative to national
energy code for buildings2 or ashrae3 under leed version 4 this makes our projects among the most energy
efficient in the city




waterfront toronto received the 2012 award for excellence in urban sustainability from the globe foundation for the
updated minimum green building requirements the globe awards are canadas most high profile annual national
environmental awards for outstanding achievement in environmental stewardship

check out current and archived versions of the minimum green building requirements on waterfront torontos website

energy efficiency
developers in toronto have shown that a 40 energy cost savings can be achieved with current design practices and
equipment this requirement was increased to 50 in mgbr version 20 to challenge design teams and establish
waterfront toronto as a national leader in energy efficient building design

in addition a 65 reduction in peak heating demand and a 30 reduction in peak cooling demand are also required this
helps to reduce the peak demand imposed on the utilities and contributes to reduced infrastructure costs and related
energy demand charges

as of june 2015 buildings in the designated waterfront area that are complete under construction and in the design
phase have achieved the following energy cost reduction and energy use intensity4 based on energy modelling5

onsite renewable energy
waterfront torontos updated mgbr requires that 3 of a buildings annual energy cost come from onsite renewable
energy systems this may include technologies designed to capture solar wind or biofuelbased energy through
ontarios feedintariff program implementing onsite renewable energy systems is more financially viable since
electricity generated can be sold back to the grid at a premium however for buildings that do not have appropriate
characteristics to make renewable energy a viable option such as poor solar access there is an alternative compliance
path for each 1 of onsite renewable energy not provided an additional 2 increase in energy cost savings must be
demonstrated beyond the minimum cost savings

in addition to buildings waterfront toronto has also incorporated renewable energy initiatives into its parks in corktown
common nine solar panels have been placed on the pavilion to supplement the parks electricity needs producing 16 kw

net zero energy suite in aqualina at bayside
a net zero energy suite is being created by tower labs in aqualina a building currently under construction in the east
bayfront community of bayside tower labs is an organization that facilitates the adoption of green building products
technologies and practices through pilot and demonstration projects in highrise buildings

the net zero energy suite will contain its own mechanical and electrical systems along with unique building materials to
reduce heating and cooling loads all of the homes energy will be supplied by a privately owned photovoltaic and solar
thermal system installed on the roof of the building




infrastructure
district energy refers to the generation and distribution of thermal energy for heating andor cooling at a community scale
the infrastructure includes a localized centre where energy is generated and a network of buried insulated pipes that
distribute energy to buildings within a defined geographic area district energy can provide a more energy efficient and
adaptable system which could lead to significant greenhouse gas reductions through an integrated energy system

waterfront torontos district energy strategy in east bayfront focuses on developing a distribution network that can be
phased in over a number of years as commercial and residential developments are built a provider has engaged with the
corus quay building as a first customer and has plans to expand into the precinct the provider will introduce a district

energy heating hot water distribution system using local heating sources and eventually cooling

construction
waterfront toronto has an environmental management plan emp that identifies processes and procedures to mitigate
environmental effects that could result from constructionrelated activities the emp specifies the minimum standards to
which all waterfront toronto consultants and contractors are expected to adhere

the emphasis of the emp is to achieve overall best management practices beyond regulation to support environmentally
progressive practices in construction future revisions of the emp may require reductions in carbon emissions from
construction processes and associated transport the use of products that are locally sourced and sustainable and the use
of energyefficient equipment

visit waterfront torontos website to download the environmental management plan

enduser management
waterfront toronto requires that owners and occupants of buildings receive information and tools to help them maintain the
environmental performance of the building developers must create an operating manual that includes items such as the
green building features maintenance requirements and operating instructions for all insuite equipment and a list of
products that should be considered such as low voc volatile organic compound paint and energy efficient light bulbs
this requirement recognizes that occupants and operators greatly impact how buildings actually perform and that tenants
owners and building managers must be involved in maximizing efficient building operations

waterfront toronto also requires insuite submetering for electricity natural gas and water hot and cold and the
infrastructure for remote access to these meters this allows suites to be independently billed for their utilities
encouraging conservation among building residents and occupants by providing them with a means to track and control
their usage and pay for utilities based on consumption

energy data analysis project
waterfront toronto is currently conducting a study to help improve the electricity gas and water efficiency in buildings
the study will track actual electricity gas and water consumption in recently occupied residential and commercial
buildings and compare the results to modelled data

the lessons learned from this comparison will

     1 help to inform future energy and water requirements for new waterfront buildings to ensure conservation is
        achieved and consumption is reduced
     2 allow condominium corporations and building owners and managers to understand whether buildings are
        performing as expected and if not why and
     3 offer strategies to help improve building and suitelevel electricity gas and water efficiency and create cost
        savings
this site will be updated when the results and analysis of the study are complete

carbon emissions
                       waterfront toronto is doing its part to reduce carbon emissions from the construction and
                       operation of the buildings parks and neighbourhoods in newly revitalized waterfront communities

                        for example the lower don lands now part of the port lands precinct is one of the founding
                        projects of the c40 climate positive development program the program supports projects that are
                        striving to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions below zero termed climate positive this
climate positive outcome is achieved by reducing emissions onsite and in neighbouring communities

the carbon tool
in collaboration with the c40climate positive development program and with funding support from the ontario power
authority we developed a carbon tool to understand how we could achieve this target the tool analyzes and compares
the sustainability performance of projects at the design and planning phase over a baseline this is done to understand
how well a project is expected to perform over a buildasusual scenario and what additional strategies and targets need to
be applied to achieve carbon reductions the tool does this by quantifying and visualizing the relationships between
development decisions and sustainability outcomes during this process we are able to see how sustainability strategies in
energy water waste transport and materials impact carbon reductions and explore new ways of improving performance

the carbon tool produced preliminary results on projected carbon emissions for the west don lands precinct it
compared a scenario that implements waterfront torontos minimum green building requirements mgbr and best
practices with a baseline buildasusual scenario the carbon tool estimated a 29 emissions reduction potential by
applying the mgbr scenario to a neighbourhood we also ran a second scenario which assessed carbon reductions at
an elevated level of performance this showed us what sustainability strategies would be necessary to achieve carbon
levels below zero




the table and chart below demonstrate the estimated contribution of each focus area to carbon emissions in the west don
lands energy and transport contribute the greatest amount to our carbon emissions and as such we aim to focus our
efforts to reduce carbon predominately in those two areas

the following chart displays the breakdown of estimated carbon emissions by land use type buildings housing
commercialgovernment and retail represent the largest sources of carbon emissions and therefore the best opportunity
to reduce overall emissions




we will report on the actual sustainability performance and carbon reductions once the buildout of the west don lands
community is complete

villiers island

in 2015 waterfront toronto used the carbon tool for the villiers island precinct plan the carbon tool predicted an overall
carbon reduction of 24 compared to the baseline waterfront toronto is currently using the carbon tool outputs to
influence planning and policy recommendations that will help meet our climate positive goals examples include

        establishing aggressive energy use intensity targets for buildings
        implementing zero carbon energy solutions such as district heating and cooling combined heat and power
        facilities and renewable energy generation and
        reducing transportation emissions through compact development active transportation transit connectivity and
        zeroemissions vehicle
in july 2015 waterfront toronto added a feature to the carbon tool that categorizes emissions into scope 1 2 and 3
scope 1 refers to direct greenhouse gas emissions such as those associated with producing electricity heating and
cooling onsite scope 2 refers to indirect emissions such as those associated with purchased electricity heating and
cooling offsite scope 3 refers to other indirect emissions such as those associated with waste or the extraction and
production of materials the greenhouse gas protocol standard was used to categorize scope 1 2 and 3 the following
chart identifies the estimated scope 1 2 and 3 carbon reductions for villiers island


water conservation
                        water conservation and reuse is core to waterfront torontos vision our minimum green building
                        requirements include two waterrelated provisions 1 water efficient landscaping 100 of the
                        water used for landscaping must come from nonpotable sources and 2 water use reduction
                        40 reduction in potable water use for indoor flow and flush fixtures

                        waterfront toronto has also implemented water conservation and reuse efforts in its major parks

sherbourne common
sherbourne common is the first park in canada to integrate a stormwater management system in its design a
combination of collected stormwater and water drawn from lake ontario is treated in a uv facility located below the
pavilion on the south side of the park after its treatment the water is lifted nearly nine metres to the top of three dramatic
art sculptures on the north side of the park then discharged into a wetland feature and through a 240 metre long water
channel that travels the full length of the park and finally released into lake ontario the treated water is also used for
irrigation and for the washroom facilities in the park greatly reducing the need for potable water

currently only water drawn from lake ontario is being used in the system stormwater will be integrated when the
precincts are further developed

visit waterfront torontos website for details on sherbourne common




corktown common
a stormwater recycling system in corktown common minimizes the amount of treated potable water used for park
maintenance needs

all of the parks stormwater as well as the water discharged from the splash pad feature is treated using ultraviolet
sterilization equipment before being moved to underground storage cells located in the central lawn the treated water is
used for irrigation park maintenance and to flush the marsh

green infrastructure

waterfront toronto strives to integrate green infrastructure into every element of urban development green infrastructure
is defined as natural systems and humanmade vegetative technologies that provide ecological and hydrological functions
and enhance healthy and sustainability living this can take many forms such as protecting restoring and creating natural
areas developing green roofs establishing community gardens rain gardens and bioswales as well as implementing
technologies like permeable paving cisterns and soil cells waterfront toronto has implemented many of these strategies
and technologies to minimize stormwater runoff and enhance water quality

contaminated soil management
                        the revitalization of torontos waterfront is one of the largest urban brownfield remediation projects
                        in the world given the contamination after decades of infilling and industrial activity we anticipate
                        managing approximately 2000000 cubic metres of contaminated soil over the next 20 years soils
                        throughout the waterfront must be restored before the area can be developed into sustainable
                        mixeduse communities

the total area being revitalized by waterfront toronto is 800 hectares the following pie chart shows the status of
contaminated soil management for active projects only meaning lands where some level of work is currently being
undertaken projects not yet started represent projects where contaminated soil management activities have not yet been
undertaken but some level of work is underway such as planning or design

soil recycling
contaminated soil is typically trucked to a landfill site and then clean soil is brought in to replace it a process called dig
and dump to minimize this unsustainable practice waterfront toronto established a pilot soil recycling facility in the port
lands in july 2010 the pilot was an opportunity to treat soil onsite to an environmental condition that allows for its reuse
this process transforms a liability into a resource and minimizes the additional environmental impacts associated with
moving the soil

the objective of the pilot was to identify treatment options assess economic feasibility confirm that impacted soil could be
treated and reused in compliance with ministry of the environment and climate change guidelines and showcase
treatment technologies

deme environmental contractors and tetra tech canada construction were chosen to conduct the pilot both operators
treated contaminated soils from various waterfront toronto sites using soil washing processes complemented by field
trials of a number of advanced technologies approximately 20000 cubic metres of soil was processed during the three
month pilot processing period

in addition to the field tests the ontario centre for environmental technology advancement now called bloom was
retained to compare and quantify the environmental and societal impacts of the dig and dump approach versus the soil
recycling option the study results showed that the impacts of the dig and dump approach are significantly higher than the
impacts of recycling and reusing soil

the study also found that soil recycling and reuse creates societal environmental and health benefits by saving landfill
space and aggregate quarry resources reducing traffic accidents noise congestion pavement wear and tear truck
traffic and fuel consumption bloom quantified these benefits at 185tonne projected as 65 million over 10 years of
avoided costs to the public it was also estimated that soil recycling and reuse would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
36 kgtonne largely as a result of decreasing truck traffic

upon completion of the pilot project waterfront toronto supported the establishment of a private operator to run a facility
on the pilot site

waste diversion
                        with landfill space at a premium waste management is a critical issue for the city of toronto this
                        is being addressed by waterfront toronto in several ways

                          on the buildingscale our minimum green building requirements mandates that all kitchens have
                         separated cabinet space for the segregated collection of recyclables organics and waste all
                         residential buildings over three storeys must provide trisorting or separate chutes for each waste
stream on each floor a collection area for household hazardous waste such as paints batteries and electronics must also
be provided in all buildings these efforts are intended to make it easier for occupants to divert their waste away from
landfills

for constructionrelated waste waterfront toronto requires that all construction and demolition projects divert at least 50
of waste with a target of 75 this requirement is included in the environmental management plan and achieves a credit
as part of our leed for neighbourhood development gold certification below are the waste diversion results for
construction demolition and excavation activities that have been achieved in our development and public projects



environmental noncompliance orders
           waterfront toronto is proud of our record of meeting all applicable laws and regulations with zero
           noncompliance orders waterfront torontos environmental management plan identifies applicable
           laws and regulations that all projects must adhere to in order to prevent pollution environmental
           impairment and to preserve natural resources

office sustainability
                         at waterfront toronto we strive to incorporate green practices into our own office operations and
                         encourage employees to make choices to lower their environmental impact the ultimate goal is to
                         create a cultural shift towards sustainability and green living not only in the neighbourhoods we are
                         building but also in our office homes and in the community

                         tenancy in leed platinum certified office building
waterfront torontos office is located at waterpark place 20 bay street which achieved leed for existing buildings
operations and maintenance leedeb om gold certification in 2012 after just two years the building was recertified
as leed platinum in 2014 this upward recertification to platinum is a first in north america for an existing building

waterfront toronto participates in all sustainability initiatives available in the building this includes taking an active role in
the propertys green team where we along with other tenants and the property manager meet quarterly to discuss
opportunities to improve our individual and collective sustainability performance waterfront toronto has implemented
several initiatives as a result of this collaboration

for example in 2011 the building replaced all fluorescent lighting fixtures with more energy efficient light bulbs and
ballasts to supplement this effort waterfront toronto replaced the majority of the halogen pot lights in our unit with 140
led lights this replacement has saved a significant amount of electricity since being installed

waterfront toronto also revised the zones for lighting to ensure that a greater proportion of office lights are automatically
turned off at 600pm when most employees have left the office

sustainable procurement practices
waterfront toronto strives to purchase sustainable office products whenever possible for example we use 100 forest
stewardship council fsc certified paper purchase furniture with recycled content buy compostable pens and other
sustainable office supplies and recently switched to green cleaning products our office manager works collaboratively
and meets regularly with our environment and innovation group to examine how we can continually improve our
purchasing practices

waste reduction
waterfront toronto actively participates in our buildings recycling and resource reduction programs our office has blue
bins for recyclables green bins for organics a battery collection program and most recently a recycling program for
used pens and markers that are donated to terracycle for upcycling




in addition to regular paper recycling waterfront toronto also participates in the shredittm shredding and recycling
program after confidential documents are securely destroyed they are recycled into new paper products which helps
save valuable natural resources according to shredittm waterfront toronto saved 159 trees from destruction in 2014
through participating in this program

all office printers are defaulted to print doublesided to reduce paper consumption and staff are encouraged to reduce
their paper use wherever possible waterfront toronto encourages employees to recycle electronic waste including
batteries and our property manager assists with proper disposal when privacy and data security will not be impacted we
also donate used it equipment to the yonge street mission a nonprofit charity that provides emergency help and fosters

longterm change in the lives of individuals and families living in poverty in toronto

transportation
waterfront toronto encourages staff to walk cycle or take public transportation rather than taxis when attending meetings
in close proximity to our office the corporation provides ttc tokens and access to an existing shower and change room
at our office which has contributed to a rise in the number of staff who choose sustainable modes of transportation

awareness campaigns
we run a variety of awareness campaigns throughout the year to educate staff on green living this is accomplished
through quizzes videos and contests for example in 2012 we conducted a power down challenge where we
addressed workspace plug load energy use by holding afterhours inspections of workstations to see if computers and
other electronic devices were turned off for the night we also turned down the heat in the office by 1 degree to reduce
energy consumption and encouraged staff to bundle up for an ugly holiday sweater contest

in 2014 we competed in an energy reduction competition with another tenant in our building our staff collectively
achieved a 18 reduction in electricity use during the week of july 14  20 we also held a gear up and power down
for the olympics campaign which allowed staff to watch the olympics at lunch as long as they generated the electricity
necessary to power the computer monitor through a stationary bike and generator

several events are also planned around seasons and key holidays where we can support a change in behaviour for staff at
home and at work for example in december 2014 we held a green holiday initiative where we asked staff to submit
green holiday ideas that were compiled into a list to implement over the holiday season some of the ideas included
sending ecards giving services or donations instead of goods as gifts and making recycled ornaments these initiatives
are successful in drawing attention to important environmental issues in a fun and engaging way

urban greenspace
                                trees play a central role in waterfront revitalization projects not only do they provide
                                shade and habitat help clean the air and reduce stormwater runoff they also beautify our
                                public spaces to realize these benefits we are planting a large number of trees in our
                                new waterfront communities streets and parks

                                guided by our sustainability framework our waterfront will become an urban forest that
                                maximizes the diversity of the waterfront ecosystem by avoiding monocultures maximizing
                                the tree canopy and providing wind and shade protection mature trees will define our
                                waterfront and restore the natural beauty of our shoreline

planting trees
waterfront toronto follows best practice principles for planting healthy trees across all of our projects we enhance tree
environments by positioning trees carefully using appropriate soil and enabling good root growth through new
technologies we also save existing trees wherever possible and make informed choices when planting new trees for
example we choose native plant species because they generally require much less water to thrive and do not introduce
the risk of ecosystem disruption

we have planted 3685 trees and expect to plant many more by the end of our revitalization mandate

growth rate of trees
growing trees to maturity in urban environments is difficult new trees face many challenges including damage due to
exposure pollution and salt from winter road maintenance while many of these issues can be overcome with appropriate
species selection research shows that the most taxing issue for all trees in the urban environment is soil compaction

                                                 waterfront toronto is using soil cell technology to ensure that trees have an
                                                 adequate amount of soil for healthy root growth soil cells are comprised of
                                                 a tiered web of rigid boxes designed to house an average of 30 cubic
                                                 metres of soil per tree these reinforced cells provide support for the soil so
                                                 it wont compact under the weight of the pavement above the system allows
                                                 tree roots to spread and thrive resulting in healthier mature trees

                                                 as part of our commitment to creating a thriving tree canopy we monitor the
                                                 health of our treesthe table below shows the average diameter of trees
                                                 maple willow and oak at sugar beach and sherbourne common when
                                                 they were planted in 2010 and the average diameter of the trees five years

waterfront toronto is also working with the toronto parks and trees
foundation tptf an independent charitable foundation dedicated to
creating and enhancing green spaces and recreational areas together we
will identify priority projects on the waterfront that would benefit from
broader funding sources than are currently available to us through this
relationship the tptf will secure funding and manage relationships with
private sector partners and also provide an avenue for individuals to
contribute to projects

green roofs
green roofs offer a wide range of benefits such as reducing the urban heat
island effect minimizing stormwater runoff and improving air quality and
building energy efficiency to capitalize on these benefits waterfront
toronto requires all development partners to install a green roof for 601 of
available roof space or the percentage required by the city of toronto
green roof bylaw whichever is greater in addition all low sloped roofs
must be able to accommodate the loads that would be imposed by an
intensive green roof this ensures that it will be possible to install a more substantial green roof in the future without
undertaking major structural modifications

as of june 2015 buildings in the designated waterfront area that are complete under construction or in the design phase
have achieved the following average green roof coverage




waterfront parks

waterfront parks provide habitat and contribute to biodiversity create new space for social interaction foster a sense of
place and support active and healthy lifestyle they are also key to connecting people to the lakefront and to our new
waterfront communities given their importance waterfront toronto has committed to reserving approximately 25 of the
revitalization area to parks and open spaces the following table shows the size of our completed parks in hectares




1 60 green roof coverage requirement is from latest november 2014 version 21 mgbr previous versions required
50 coverage

transportation
                                  sustainable transportation and mobility are key to developing complete healthy and
                                  walkable communities and to reducing carbon emissions waterfront toronto is preparing
                                  for a cultural shift away from car dependence and towards more active and sustainable
                                  transportation choices for residents and visitors this includes walking cycling public
                                  transit and electric vehicles two of our waterfront projects highlight our mandate to re
                                  shape how we move through toronto

                                  queens quay revitalization
queens quay is torontos main waterfront street the newly revitalized stretch of queens quay between bay street and
yoyo ma lane is a complete reconfiguration of the street

prior to its revitalization queens quay acted as a barrier rather than a gateway to the waterfront it suffered from sub
standard street car platforms awkward pedestrian access and crossings as well as illegal parking activities it also lacked
a continuous trail to accommodate cyclists joggers residents and visitors

the new queens quay accommodates the needs of all users by delivering a balanced transportation plan that includes

        two lanes of eastwest traffic on the north side of the street
        a dedicated light rail transit rightofway
        a generous granite pedestrian promenade on the south side
        a new extension of the martin goodman trail flanked by a double row of trees
waterfront toronto has created a more functional and efficient space that delivers a high quality experience for residents
and visitors alike the new boulevard enhances waterfront access and creates new space for social interaction fostering a
sense of community and social wellbeing that supports active and healthy lifestyles




in addition waterfront toronto worked with the city of toronto to extend the martin goodman trail west of yoyo ma lane
to stadium road connecting with the existing trail at coronation park and creating a continuous eastwest recreational
trail along the waters edge we also completed an improved sidewalk and extended the martin goodman trail between
yonge street and parliament street in 2013 completing the connection of the train across the citys waterfront

electric vehicle charging stations at george brown college
funded by the ministry of transportation waterfront toronto installed electric vehicle ev charging stations in the
underground parking garage at the george brown college waterfront campus the three level 2 charging stations have
the ability to charge five electric vehicles concurrently the charging stations are an important transformative step towards
encouraging more sustainable modes of transportation the ev charging stations were used exclusively by the toronto
2045 pan  parapan american games electric vehicle fleet during the games and provide a legacy benefit for the public

we will collect data on the public use and energy consumption of the ev charging stations for the next three years to
monitor the technologys rate of adoption which will help us understand demand and inform the need for additional
infrastructure

staff commuting survey
according to an internal commuting survey conducting in august 2015 over 90 of waterfront toronto staff take transit
cycle or walk to work this demonstrates that sustainability is not only part of our work but is ingrained in our personal
choices as well

social performance measures
revitalization is about putting people first creating functional sustainable and beautiful communities that offer a high
quality of life for all who live and work there

our waterfront neighbourhoods are carefully designed to connect with the rest of the city through access to transit parks
open spaces pedestrian promenades cycling lanes and a diverse range of services and amenities these land use
decisions will mean sustainable choices are easy and convenient for residents employees and visitors to make each
waterfront community will also contain a mix of uses including residential commercial retail and institutional as well as
affordable housing to bring diversity and vibrancy to each neighbourhood

we plan and design with high levels of stakeholder engagement to ensure that what we build is what people want we also

communities by improving social conditions for hundreds of thousands of toronto residents


                                         performance measures

neighbourhood sustainability
                        while high performing leedcertified buildings are important for advancing sustainable
                        development there is growing recognition that the planning design construction and operation of
                        sustainable communities requires a more comprehensive neighbourhoodwide perspective
                        acknowledging this transition in green building philosophy from a singlebuilding perspective to a
                        more integrated communitywide strategy the us green building council launched the pilot
                        version of leed for neighbourhood development leed nd in 2007

waterfront toronto participated in the leed nd pilot program in order to assess its plans for sustainability by a third party
and to inform improvements to our neighbourhood strategies waterfront toronto was one of 23 canadian projects that
participated in the pilot program beyond high performing and efficient buildings the leed nd rating system addresses
communityscale and social issues such as brownfield development highdensity urban form proximity to local amenities
walkable streets affordability community involvement sustainable transportation and waste management

acknowledging the long construction period involved in developing on a neighbourhood scale leed nd has created a
three stage certification process

        stage 1 certification occurs before planning approvals are secured
        stage 2 is for projects that have received all planning approvals
        stage 3 is for completed neighbourhoods
in 2009 waterfront torontos east bayfront west don lands and north keating communities collectively achieved stage
1 leed for neighbourhood development gold level certification under the pilot program we intent to achieve stage 3
certification as our waterfront neighbourhoods are built out

waterfront toronto is currently exploring a complementary sustainability certification and rating system for infrastructure
projects called envision the envision program provides a framework for evaluating the community environmental and
economic benefits of infrastructure projects the intent is to improve the performance resiliency and efficiency of
infrastructure by identifying sustainability approaches during the planning and design phases the process can also be
applied postmortem to assess sustainability performance by a third party and learn lessons we have informally applied
the rating system to the east bayfront and west don lands stormwater management project and are investigating
opportunities to pursue certification for future infrastructure projects

public waterfront access
              creating beautiful and engaging pubic amenities by the waters edge gives residents and
              visitors opportunities to enjoy and connect with the lakefront providing easy access to the
              water is a key part of waterfront torontos vision and mandate we have created over 13
              kilometres of trails and promenades in key areas of the waterfront including extensions of the
              martin goodman trail the following table provides details of these completed projects

design excellence
                        a cornerstone of our revitalization effort is to pursue design excellence and set new standards for
                        architecture and public space in toronto

                       to achieve these goals we often host international design competitions for our major projects
                       these competitions help to attract some of the most highly regarded planners architects designers
                       and landscape architects in the world by working with premier design talent waterfront toronto is
creating a new gold standard by which all other communities will be judged learn more about the value of design
competitions by watching this youtube video  design

in 2005 we established the waterfront design review panel to act as an independent body that guides and informs our
design teams the mission of the panel is to provide objective and professional advice to designers and developers to
ensure that high quality design is a critical consideration for all development projects on torontos waterfront the panels
feedback contributes to creating a culture of highquality design among builders and architects working on the waterfront
and ultimately a better built environment for everyone competitions creative city building

public consultation and stakeholder satisfaction
                       in 2002 waterfront toronto created a public consultation strategy to formalize its commitment to
                       public engagement and outline the principles that would guide the outreach process the strategy
                       is founded on the belief that positive productive and effective relationships with the public and our
                       stakeholders are essential to fulfilling our mandate and reflect our core values of accountability and
                       transparency

going beyond what is legally required we aim to provide meaningful opportunities for the public and stakeholders to shape
our revitalization plans this enhances the quality of our designs and plans for the waterfront the durability of decisions
and the acceptance of outcomes

we identify target audiences notify interested parties issue public notices and provide an opportunity for input early in
the decisionmaking process target audiences for consultation include the general public ratepayer and neighbourhood
associations interest groups elected officials at the three orders of government business and industry institutions and
others the pubic consultation strategy is designed to encourage participation increase awareness and understanding
accurately report on the consultation results and encourage positive contributions to designs and plans for waterfront
revitalization the corporation also uses consultation opportunities to recognize and acknowledge the contributions of the
three orders of government

this following demonstrates the scale of our public consultation and communication efforts from march 2006 to march
2015




social media tools
while facetoface public consultation remains the cornerstone of our engagement efforts waterfront toronto has also
embraced digital and social media tools to expand our outreach efforts online consultation and social media enables a
broader crosssection of the community to participate in twoway communication waterfront torontos website facebook
page twitter feed youtube channel and linkedin page have attracted over 21500 followers making online and social
media tools key components of the corporations engagement and consultation strategy in addition waterfront toronto
receives over 300000 visits to its website annually as well as 15002000 email inquiries annually

the tables below demonstrate the growth in our social media outreach

online public consultation pilot project
in march 2015 we used the jack layton ferry terminal and harbour square park innovative design competition to pilot a
new public consultation process the design competition was to develop bold new concepts for torontos gateway to the

islands

the new process included exhibiting the proposals at torontos city hall making the proposals available online and
providing an opportunity for members of the public to submit their feedback online including both comment cards
submitted at city hall and online surveys completed waterfront toronto received nearly 2000 responses from members of
the public the comment cards and online survey asked people to rate the importance of seven design elements in
determining a successful proposal the responses were analyzed to produce a public feedback report with quantifiable
databacked results you can view a copy of the report by clicking here

the pilot project demonstrated that an effective public feedback and consultation process can be conducted successfully
using free online tools

associations and committees
we engage with organizations associations and committees that represent a broad array of interests for example
waterfront toronto consults extensively with the west don lands committee wdlc  a communitydriven coalition of
local residents businesses as well as environmental and heritage organizations the wdlc promotes the redevelopment
of the west don lands in a manner that is beneficial to the larger community the wdlcs extensive participation
improved the plans and designs for the area waterfront toronto received a public sector quality fair award for the west
don lands project in recognition of the quality of the consultation process

on a project basis waterfront toronto consults broadly with stakeholders interested in or affected by the undertaking we
regularly establish stakeholder advisory committees sac and construction liaison committees clc as ongoing
forums to obtain input feedback guidance and advice throughout the planning design and construction stages when
appropriate projectspecific consultation websites are also developed to provide a portal for the public and stakeholders to
learn about and participate in the project for example a website was created for gardiner expressway and lake shore
boulevard reconfiguration environmental assessment and urban design study click here to view

while the composition of each sac and clc is unique every effort is made to ensure that they are inclusive and
represent the full range of interests and perspectives membership typically includes

           community representation through neighbourhood associations condominium boards and residents associations
           business representation through business improvement associations area businesses land owners and trade
           associations and
           representatives from interest groups such as cycling associations accessibility advocates environmental groups
           as well as heritage and cultural associations

other communication tools
waterfront toronto also uses a number of other communications tools to keep the public and stakeholders informed and
engaged

           our monthly email newsletter provides regular updates on a broad range of revitalization initiatives including
           construction notices to ensure the public is notified of impacts to their communities regular detailed construction
           notices are also emailed to stakeholder databases created for largescale construction projects
           our blog is also used to communicate updates about projects underway in a visually compelling and reader
           friendly way
           the general public and stakeholders are also encouraged to attend meetings of our board of directors board
           committees and design review panel

consultation for sustainability initiatives
sustainability initiatives also undergo extensive stakeholder consultation for example when we updated our minimum
green building requirements in 2012 we reviewed the targets and requirements with stakeholders including green
building experts developers condominium residents and local power distribution companies we felt it was important to
gain insights from those directly and indirectly affected by our policies

for our first corporate social responsibility and sustainability report launched in 2013 we consulted with a variety of
stakeholders including developers government partners and subject matter experts who participated in a site mapping
visioning session to discuss functionality user needs navigation core content and design the stakeholders from this
session were also asked to review the preliminary website design their feedback was instrumental in helping us develop
our first report

in 2015 waterfront toronto engaged with internal and external stakeholders for feedback on what content should be
included in this report to ensure that it reflects their priorities for more information see the whats in our report section

stakeholder satisfaction and public opinion
in an ongoing effort to continuously improve our communications and engagement processes and to gauge stakeholder
satisfaction we hosted a town hall meeting on april 1 2015 the town hall was attended by approximately 480 people in
person and via webcast who had an opportunity ask questions share their views and raise concerns during the town
hall 130 people participated in an electronic survey here are the results


overall the survey results were very positive and suggest that stakeholders approve of what waterfront toronto has
accomplished and the way in which these accomplishments were achieved

examples of key topics and concerns raised
when we receive input from our stakeholders we often implement their recommendations here are some examples of
topics and concerns raised by stakeholders and how they were addressed

    1 to address public concerns about the potential health safety and ecological risks associated with introducing jet
       aircraft and expanding the runway at torontos island airport billy bishop toronto city airport portstoronto
       provided funding to waterfront toronto to undertake a peer review of the environmental assessment the peer
       review will determine whether the phase 1 study design and phase 2 effects assessment addresses
       stakeholder concerns aligns with relevant global and best practices and draws sound conclusions
    2 waterfront toronto addressed concerns raised by residents and business owners regarding idling tour buses on
       queens quay boulevard as part of the revitalization waterfront toronto established a bus management working
       group and developed a bus management plan to install laybys at strategic locations these laybys allow tour
       buses to stop and offload passengers which meets tourism objectives for the area in a way that does not
       negatively affect other users of the road
    3 the bayside development proposed street parking along merchants wharf a street running parallel to the waters
       edge the community expressed concerns at public consultation sessions that parking along the water is

   undesirable because the vehicles block views from adjacent parks and cafés to address this issue waterfront
   toronto met with several community members and their retail consultant to come up with a plan that reduced the
   numbers of parking spaces along the water and located spaces strategically to minimize the impact on views in
   the end the community was satisfied with the plan
4 as detailed in the whats in our report section we engaged with internal and external stakeholders for our 2015
   report update to solicit feedback on what they see as the key priorities and material issues the outcomes of the
   engagement activities shaped the content of our report

health and safety
                       waterfront toronto is committed to integrating health and safety in all we do from construction site
                       operations to officebased initiatives we work for continual improvement in health and safety
                       performance striving to achieve operational excellence and zero injuries and occupational
                       diseases our goal is to effectively manage the health and safety risks to workers including both
                       employees and contractors and to encourage safe and healthy lifestyles

waterfront toronto has a formal joint managementworker health and safety committee consisting of eight members
four representing management and four representing workers together this committee represents the entire waterfront
toronto workforce the committee is tasked to improve the health and safety conditions in the workplace by identifying and
evaluating potential problems and making recommendations for corrective action more than half of the committee
members are certified health and safety committee members and two members are certified first aid and cpr
professionals

the committee meets every three months and is responsible for conducting regular workplace inspections first aid kit
audits and fire drill procedures the committee also keeps staff informed of health and safety issues through a biannual
newsletter and through a sharepoint webpage that houses meeting minutes and important reference materials

waterfront toronto is deemed to be a large employer in the construction industry under workplace safety and insurance
board wsib policies waterfront toronto therefore qualifies for the wsib cad  7 experience rating plan through
which the wsib tracks employers health and safety performance under this plan waterfront toronto has been
recognized as an employer achieving and maintaining zero injury illness and fatalities which has resulted in a reduction
of our premiums as well as validating our internal health and safety waterfront toronto has received a rebate on insurance
coverage for employees for the past five years

planning for success
                        all waterfront toronto employees receive annual performance and career development reviews
                        through a process called planning for success pfs pfs is a continuous process that
                        encourages an open dialogue between an employee and their reporting manager on work
                        expectations and priorities the threestep process assists in translating waterfront torontos
                        business focus into individual daytoday work responsibilities and objectives and identifies our
                        employees training and development requirements

three step process
     1 work planning a critical first step that confirms core responsibilities and objectives for the upcoming business
        cycle and defines the learning plan to capture an employees learning objectives
     2 feedback  interim review of work progress a formal review of work progress to date at this stage any changes
        in responsibilities or objectives are discussed and any issues with the work or learning plan are examined

public art
                               public art is an integral feature of our new waterfront communities waterfront toronto is
                               creating landmarks that celebrate creativity as a vital part of urban life by installing art in
                               public spaces where it can be enjoyed by all our goal is to create a contemporary collection

                                what sets waterfront torontos art program apart is our approach during the
                                neighbourhood planning phase we create a public art strategy and select prominent
                                locations for the artwork in the city of toronto developers are required to set aside 1 of
gross construction costs for art which is often placed in the lobbies of buildings making it publicly inaccessible our
approach is to pool all of the public art monies and strategically place art into high profile locations providing the greatest
opportunities for public engagement this planning and funding model allows us to develop a curatorial vision for our art
program and create a neighbourhood art collection that engages the public and defines a community

                                        performance measures

flood protection
                        the west don lands east bayfront and the port lands are all within a designated regulatory
                        flood plain1 due to their proximity to the don watershed to lift the regulatory restriction on
                        developing these sites and realize the economic benefits of revitalization waterfront toronto is
                        required to remove the risk of flooding on these lands after doing so the lands may be rezoned
                        for residential and commercial development

west don lands and east bayfront
on behalf of waterfront toronto infrastructure ontario previously ontario realty corporation constructed a flood
protection landform along the don river from king street down to the rail corridor the landform spans approximately 8
hectares and consists of a clay lining surrounded by roughly 400000 cubic metres of clean soil the bank along the river
known as the wet side consists of an armoured wall providing additional protection against erosion in addition to the
landform flood protection was also provided by widening the channel of the don river so that it could accommodate a
larger flow of water this work was completed by the toronto and region conservation authority as part of the lower don
river west remedial flood protection project these measures protect the west don lands east bayfront and an
additional 210hectare area which includes torontos financial district from flooding during an extreme flood event

the topography of the flood protection landform also serves as the foundation for a new park corktown common which
has been built on top of it corktown common is a naturalized space that has become a focal point for the new west don
lands community

the port lands
the port lands is a 356 hectare site bounded by lake shore boulevard in the north torontos inner harbour in the west
ashbridges bay in the east and lake ontario and tommy thompson park in the south once part of a massive wetland
supporting a vast range of plants fish waterfowl and mammals the area was infilled to support industry in the 1880s
today this land is underutilized and is within the don rivers flood plain

to address this waterfront toronto the city of toronto toronto and region conservation authority and the toronto port
lands company have proposed to rebuild the mouth of the don river into a healthier more naturalized river outlet the
proposal would create a new river mouth between the ship channel and the keating channel and add an overflow green
spillway by investing in flood protection and infrastructure the areas development potential for vital urban growth will be
unlocked the don mouth naturalization project will remove approximately 240 hectares of land from flood risk and allow
the creation of new mixeduse communities

the first part of this project the due diligence and project planning phase is currently underway the result will provide
government funders with greater certainty on the costs schedule and risks associated with the project



1the regulatory flood plain is the approved standard used to define the limit of the flood plain in a particular
watershed within the toronto and region conservation authoritys jurisdiction the regulatory flood plain is based on
regional storms hurricane hazel or the 100 year flood whichever is greater

infrastructure investments and services
                                  when waterfront toronto was established in 2001 the government of canada the
                                  province of ontario and the city of toronto each committed 500 million in seed capital
                                  to begin the revitalization process they also gave waterfront toronto development
                                  control over public land

                                  the majority of our investments are made in infrastructure and services for the publics
                                  benefit further the revenue from the sale of public lands are reinvested into
                                  revitalization programs including infrastructure public realm and park projects

impact of investment
waterfront torontos investments in infrastructure parks and public realm projects have many positive impacts on both the
community and the economy these revitalization projects enhance waterfront access and create new spaces that foster
social interaction a sense of community and social wellbeing as well as support active and healthy lifestyles our street
revitalization projects such as queens quay are creating more functional and efficient spaces that balance the needs of
all users by accommodating dedicated recreational transit bicycle pedestrian and auto traffic while enhancing
landscape features

revitalization projects improve the public realm and enhance tourism by creating greater access and views to the lake and
by providing greater connectivity to existing cultural facilities additionally the improved quality of place in torontos
waterfront is making it an even more desirable location for employment and for attracting top talent

the following table details infrastructure investments and services provided for public benefit




completed roads and underground infrastructure
to date waterfront toronto has completed over 35 kilometres of new roads and underground infrastructure when put
together end to end this investment is the physical foundation of waterfront revitalization

indirect economic impacts
                        waterfront toronto has invested approximately 126 billion in the renewal of torontos waterfront to
                        date this investment has resulted in many indirect economic benefits such as employment and
                        government revenues these benefits are meeting waterfront torontos corporate objectives of
                        promoting employment growth and attracting and leveraging private sector development

                       an economic impact analysis was completed in 2013 by urban metrics which examined the
broader economic and value impacts generated by waterfront toronto investments this section describes the key
findings of the study

employment
between 2001 and 2012 approximately 16200 fulltime person years of employment have been generated by waterfront
torontos direct indirect and induced expenditures with more than 71 in the city of toronto the majority of the jobs
were created in the construction finance insurance and real estate sectors as well as the professional scientific and
technical sectors jobs in the latter category are largely related to design engineering and environmental services

advancing private sector development
urban metrics conducted 11 detailed interviews with real estate developers and leasing professionals involved with projects
in waterfront precincts and adjoining neighbourhoods most of the respondents indicated that much of the waterfront would
not be developed or would be delayed well into the future if not for the planning and infrastructure development efforts by
waterfront toronto

the projects with the most impact on advancing development and attracting private sector investment were cited as the
flood protection landform infrastructure investment and parks and public spaces as a result both the volume and value of
construction investment has increased at a much faster rate in recent years along the waterfront than elsewhere in
toronto

property value increases
urban metrics reviewed historic changes in property values which indicated that the rate at which resale prices have
increased in recent years is higher on average in the central waterfront area relative to elsewhere in the city for example
as of 2012 the average price of condominiums in the harbourfront area was 512ft2 furthermore the rate at which
these prices increased was also higher than elsewhere in toronto although this is likely driven by a variety of factors
waterfront revitalization is one of the major contributors

taxes and development charges generated
when fully developed it is estimated that the lands controlled by waterfront toronto in the east bayfront and west don
lands precincts will generate approximately 87 million in development charge revenues to the city to assist in funding
future growth related capital infrastructure further development of public lands in the east bayfront and west don lands
will generate approximately 335 million in municipal property taxes and some 179 million in education taxes annually
new development on private lands will contribute approximately 716 million in municipal taxes and 40 million in
education taxes annually

port lands flood protection and related infrastructure
to address the flood risk in the port lands waterfront toronto and its partners have proposed to rebuild the mouth of the
don river the proposal would create a new naturalized river mouth between the ship channel and the keating channel
by strategically investing in flood protection and infrastructure the areas development potential will be unlocked for private
sector investment

waterfront torontos direct investment in this flood protection project will generate approximately

        859 million in economic value added to the canadian economy

        7672 person years of employment

        445 million in labour income and

        327 million in revenues to all orders of government
future construction activity in the port lands as a result of this initial investment is expected to generate approximately

        54 billion in value added to the canadian economy

        51500 person years of employment

        28 billion in labour income and

       20 billion in revenues to all orders of government

       75 million in annual property tax revenues of which approximately 30 million are education taxes at full buildout
       based on a 614 billion assessed value

global reporting initiative

what
the global reporting initiative gri is a nonprofit organization that has developed one of the most widely used
sustainability reporting frameworks the framework is created through a multistakeholder consensusbased approach
ensuring that the needs of all sectors are considered the framework provides direction on how to measure and report on
environmental social economic and governance performance

as of 2015 7500 organizations used gri guidelines for their sustainability reporting including 80 percent of the largest
100 companies worldwide according to a new survey by kpmg wikipediaorg and globalreportingorg

gri vision a sustainable global economy where organizations manage their economic environmental social and
governance performance and impacts responsibly and report transparently 

why
an organization cannot effectively manage and change what they cannot measure sustainability reporting allows
organizations to collect data analyze performance identify and communicate strengths and weaknesses and most
importantly improve performance

sustainability reporting also promotes transparency and accountability gri requires disclosure of information in the public
domain allowing stakeholders to track and compare performance over time and to other similar organizations

how
