business solutions for a
sustainable planet




08 binani goa glass fibre limited  bt composites limited

our planet is currently in a state of imbalance the
current model of economic progress with
excessive dependence on fossil fuels to promote
industrial development has resulted in irreversible
changes to the physical environment through
increased emissions of certain types of gases into
the atmosphere these gases known as
greenhouse gases ghgs have the potential to
alter the earths temperature and trigger
irreversible climatic changes apart from the
physical havoc that can be caused due to the
impacts of climate change the impacts have the
potential of changing the dynamics of society and
the markets due to realigned priorities thereby
altering the current life style pattern the response
of governments worldwide would focus on
humanitarian relief and reallocating resources for
providing basic amenities rather than incentivising
businesses

according to the fourth assessment report of the
intergovernmental panel on climate change
ipcc over 56 of carbon dioxide enters the
atmosphere due to consumption of fossil fuel with
energy supply 259 and industrial uses 194
being the two major sources of ghg emissions1 
thus countering the challenge of climate change
requires a paradigm shift in the way we conduct
business the first involves improving energy and
material efficiency and reducing dependency on
fossil fuels this would mean that the industrial
fraternity will have to improve the efficiencies of
manufacturing processes the second approach
revolves around the use of alternate materials
that would reduce the dependency on resources
that require high fossil fuels for production
and manufacturing

materiality
analysis




20 binani goa glass fibre limited  bt composites limited

 the concept of materiality emerged in the financial domain but has now evolved into a tool which takes
 into account a holistic set of corporate issues under the financial social environment or governance
 domains these issues are assessed for the risks opportunities and initiatives that are considered important
 by both stakeholders and the organisation

 we attempted to identify the issues of importance to the organisation and its stakeholder groups through a
 dedicated workshop which was attended by all department heads of the respective units

 since it was a first of its kind exercise we mapped the stakeholder groups and relied on the daytoday
 interaction of company officials for capturing the more relevant issues the workshop which was
 moderated by a third party helped us to identify the key materiality issues which were then prioritised on a
 threepoint scale based on their importance levels the issues highlighted in the rightmost top four
 quadrants emerged as the most critical issues

 most of the other material issues revolve around the business risks of the respective organisations such as
 reliable availability of raw material and its suppliers energy spare parts and water competition from china in
 terms of cheaper products limitation of available technology and diversification opportunities foraying into
 new markets enhancing revenue generation sales and marketing issues etc apart from these btcl also
 identified issues of manpower management and effective capacity utilisation as material issues

performance

our customer base is spread across five continents and therefore our sales figures do get impacted by any
upward or downward trends in the world economy that includes shifts in product demand cost of raw
material and exchange fluctuations

in the reporting year ggfl recorded an increase in revenue from product sale however the increase in
operational cost resulted in a lower net margin in comparison to fy 200809 ggfl received financial
incentives from the indian government in the form of vat and export incentives to the tune of
inr 304 million and inr 250 million respectively

on the other hand when compared to the fy 200809 btcl witnessed decreased production and
subsequently the sales are also on lower side in the reporting year however when compared to the
previous year the net sales and other income has recorded an increase

ggfl since inception has adopted the stateoftheart technology
of oxy fuel combustion for melting and refining of glass thereby
savingfuel and reducing combustion emissions in comparison to
the conventional melting process
environmental consciousness is an integral part of our business dna and extends across the life cycle starting
from the design of our products to their manufacturing and use by the consumer

similarly btcl has been working with the vision to provide our customers with an alternate to the
conventional energy intensive materials like steel and aluminum along with being less energy intensive
reinforced composite displays high strength durability and resistance to water and attack from chemicals

although our manufacturing facilities are located in notified industrial zones we take preemptive action to
mitigate the possibility of any adverse environmental events we abide by all applicable health safety and
environmental laws and regulations procedures are in place to determine the cause of any environmental
incident if it occurs and preventive measures are taken to avoid recurrence

both facilities are continuously investing towards monitoring and enhancement of the environment in the
vicinity in the reporting year both units incurred an expenditure of inr 184 million towards these initiatives
ggfl has also developed and is maintaining the traffic island in panjim area of goa and made an investment
of inr 044 million in the reporting period towards the same


resource management in the manufacturing processes
we believe in efficient usage of resources to ensure the planets a better place for the
generations to come
the process of manufacturing glass fibre consists of blending raw materials melting them in a threestage
furnace extruding the molten glass through bushings in the bottom of the forehearth cooling the filaments
with water and applying a chemical the thin filaments are then gathered and shaped as per the customer
requirement

table 3 material consumption of btcl

in the near future we may explore the opportunity of reclaiming packaging material like wooden pallets and
corrugated boxes to further optimise resource consumption
we are working towards harnessing the full potential of the plants furnace capacity ie 19640 mt which will
help to reduce the production costs in the reporting year ggfl has been able to achieve a production of
12497 mt of glass fibre products which is an increase of 4231 over fy 200809 we have also introduced a
new product in our basket of offerings called wet used chopped strands for tissue manufacturing

  improving energy efficiency is a consistent endeavour across
  our units during the reporting period our specific energy
  consumption reduced by approx 20 and 25 at ggffl 
  btcl respectively thereby reducing our carbon footprint

energy management
energy is one of the essential commodities required to run our manufacturing units growing demandsupply
deficit price fluctuations and associated ghg emissions are few of the challenges associated with energy
management we have undertaken stringent efficiency measures which have improved our performance
out of the total energy requirement in glass manufacturing the melting process in the furnace accounts for
more than 75 energy consumption the fuels used for manufacturing glass fibre at our manufacturing unit
include furnace oil fo liquefied petroleum gas lpg and high speed diesel hsd electricity is also
sourced from local electricity grid to meet the energy demand a reduction in specific energy consumption
has been observed in comparison to previous years on account of our ongoing process improvements and
energy efficiency measures discussed later in the section

  fuel combustion technology

energy efficiency measures
ggfl is using oxyfuel combustion technology for melting the input material in the furnace instead of air
fuel combustion the technology has resulted in significant energy saving over time and in turn contributed
towards reduction in fuel consumption and ghg emissions similarly the rooftop design at the btcl unit
permits daylight saving thus reducing the equivalent amount of electricity requirement ggfl has
implemented several innovative projects in its endeavour to reduce energy consumption

   the oxylpg system was converted from                                                2943

   initiatives in the sector as this combustion

 solar water heater for canteen
 in order to substitute the use of electric heater a
 500 lpd solar water heater was installed in the
 ggfl canteen in the month of february 2011 the
 hot water supplied by this solar water heater
 results in reduced lpg consumption in cooking
 it is expected to save about 3110 gj of energy on

air emissions
with growing industrialisation climate change has emerged as one of the biggest challenges in addition to
environment pollution we believe that individual contributions are required to combat the issue of climate
change and treat the issue of climate change as a business challenge rather than an environment concern

as of now we do not have a formal system to monitor the emissions due to our employee travel and product
transportation but we are determined to establish a system for monitoring our environmental impact due to
employee and product transportation in the near future
in our operations air emissions are majorly attributed to boiler and dg set operations therefore the
technology installed in the dg sets was upgraded in order to lower the nox and sox emissions only a
miniscule amount of particulate matter is generated during chopping of the glass fibre we have installed
appropriate air pollution control measures in our operations and regularly conduct stack monitoring
ambient air quality and analysis air emission load from ggfl during the year was monitored as 2240 tonnes
of oxides of sulphur and 840 tonnes of particulate matter the increase in stack emissions is on account of
increase in the production there is no stack emission from btcls operation
at ggfl the ods gas r11 has been substituted with r123 in both the chilling units at present there is no
ods gas being used in either of the two units

our environmental
footprint




water management
freshwater is one of the most important and at the same time scarce natural resource we value this and
thus believe in judicious consumption of water in our manufacturing units as well as strive to spread the
awareness on conserving water among local community we have implemented a number of water
recycling and reuse projects so as to minimise the consumption of freshwater

ggfl sources its water needs from the public waterworks department pwd goa therefore no significant
impact is envisaged on the water source during the reporting period our unit sourced 104950 m3 of water
from pwd

btcl does not require water for its processes it extracts a miniscule amount 16848 m3  year of water
from bore well within the plant premises to meet only the domestic requirements since the water
consumption for btcl is negligible no significant impact is expected on the ground water in the area

towards 100 recycling of water
we are continuously looking at new opportunities to recycle and reuse water effluent for secondary
purposes within the boundary of our manufacturing units this enables us to reduce our freshwater
consumption thereby reducing our water footprint the entire effluent coming out of processes is treated
recycled and used for gardening and sanitary flushing purposes only a small amount of water is released
through the stormwater drain due to higher volume than the holding capacity therefore there is no
significant impact envisaged from the discharge of effluent from our premises




 hundred percent recycling and zero discharge at our
 manufacturing units indicate our commitment to water
 resources conservation

spill management
spill management is considered to be important for managing and minimising wastage we have taken
appropriate measures to minimise spills in our operations and have conceptualised management systems
for appropriate handling as well as transportation of material containment facilities like dike retaining wall
etc are installed for vessel and tanks in ggfl
policies are defined for storage of material and continuous training is imparted to the officials for handling
spills housekeeping preventive maintenance etc a preventive and predictive maintenance programme has
been established pump seals and other rotating equipment are periodically inspected replaced serviced
and maintained so that leakage and spillage can be prevented as a result of our stringent practices adopted
at site no cases of spillages were witnessed in the reporting period
zero cases of spillage in fy 201011
