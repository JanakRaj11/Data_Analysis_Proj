    always striving to create new value and contributing to unceasing social progress


     casios heritage of creativity making something from nothing going from 0 to 1

    casio was founded with the invention of the worlds first compact fully electric
    calculator in 1957 by completely revolutionizing the conventional technology of
    the time and offering overwhelmingly better performance this product
    immediately penetrated the market it was the first manifestation of casios
    spirit of creativity our unique capacity to make something from nothing to go
    from 0 to 1

    then in 1972 the casio mini became a big hit as the worlds first personal
    calculator it transformed the once costly electronic calculator into the now
    familiar pocket calculator and contributed greatly to the dawn of the digital age
    in 1983 the shockresistant gshock watch was born from a completely new
    idea for the time namely to create a virtually indestructible wristwatch this
    was followed by the qv10 compact digital camera with lcd display in 1995 which gained popularity as a camera requiring no film all of
    these types of products are taken for granted today but they were unheard of when casio introduced them casio has continued to produce
    products like these over the years this heritage of providing the world with revolutionary products time and again was build by using
    technology to initiate paradigm shifts and created repeated breakthroughs in thinking and engineering casio has also worked to reinvent
    products to achieve new business growth even in existing product areas

    by developing completely new products and services that never existed before casio is providing the world with new value as a result
    peoples lives have become more convenient and rewarding also when the value we provide is recognized by society it gives rise to new
    markets and new cultural phenomena this is nothing less than the realization of casios corporate creed creativity and contribution
    each and every employee at casio strives to put this creed into practice we pledge to continue to contribute to social progress by going
    from 0 to 1

    resolve social and environmental issues using our core technology competencies for making products compact lightweight slim and
    energy efficient we are reducing the environmental impact of casio products not only that we are managing our business sites using
    medium and longterm targets with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions casio is also curbing its negative impact on the
    environment by pursuing environmental activities such as biodiversity conservation we are ensuring thorough environmental management
    in order to maintain and increase our positive contributions to the environment

    casio makes over 100 million product units annually and sells them in 140 countries through worldwide logistics operations we do this

    company with global operations casio respects international standards relating to human rights labor the environment and anticorruption

    the four aforementioned areas we have incorporated them into all of our corporate activities we also identified csr issues that affect all
    casio group companies worldwide based on the international iso 26000 standard issued in november 2010 to offer guidance on socially

     about 60 of the homes in minamisanriku were destroyed or damaged by the tsunami
     after many ups and downs and with the hope that reconstruction of shops will help
     promote reconstruction of the town a large temporary shopping area was opened on
     february 25 2012 located in the shizugawa district the minamisanriku sansan
     shopping village consists of 30 stores
     although the national government paid for shop construction the shopkeepers had to
     cover the cost of everything inside we also received a lot of support from across the
     country for the opening all the shops received from casio the latest cash registers and calculators
     in addition to providing the equipment casio staff also showed each shop how to do menu setting and use the functions we
     would like to thank casio again for this support
     since the homes around the shopping area were washed away and there are few residents here now the challenge for us is
     to attract customers we would be very grateful if casio could help us create a mechanism to sell the abundant seafood of
     minamisanriku to people nationwide disseminate information and provide other support in the future

 how to deal with human rights problems

makoto teranaka gave a talk on corporate activities and human rights he was then joined
by kaori kuroda and they responded to questions and comments from the audience the
dialogue event covered the following three themes 1 how to address human rights
issues 2 criteria for determining such issues and 3 human rights problems of
employees including hiring of foreign workers the following are summaries of the points
they made


                                                                                                       stakeholder dialogue


     two experts on csr

      handling conflicts in good faith makoto teranaka

      i think the most important thing when dealing with a problem is determining how to deal
      with the conflict in good faith you must listen to what the other party is saying and try to
      resolve the problem together companies that are unable to do this cannot survive
      in regard to the problem of employee overtime work which is particularly significant in
      china like in other countries you have to look into the local context you must then
      create a better management system by taking the local environment into consideration
      japanese companies should put more effort into this field
      although not well understood in japan allowing hiring conditions to differ on the basis of
      nationality is clearly discrimination under international law the problem of discrimination         makoto teranaka
      against foreign workers must first be recognized among other issues                                visiting professor

      csr policies for globalization kaori kuroda

      the first and most important thing is to carry out due diligence based on a full
      understanding that the activities of your company may lead to human rights violation
      taking measures once a problem has occurred usually leads to other mistakes and
      difficulties it is important to actually visit the site where the problem occured and grasp
      the situation precisely overtime work can sometimes happen when the interests of
      employees wanting to work coincide with those of a company wanting long hours of
      labor in such conditions there have been cases in which long working hours have been
      improved by taking steps to create more supportive workplaces together with employees
      in addition to implementing delivery adjustments and training in human resource                      kaori kuroda
      management today it is necessary to take measures based on consideration of diverse                 codirector cso network japan
      values not just in product development but also in human rights and csr policies

        casios response to the dialogue

         while respect for human rights is an important issue for companies it is a topic that tends to
         be overlooked
         it was good to approach this issue directly and to hear these persuasive speakers with
         extensive expertise in the field of human rights it gave me an opportunity to reaffirm the
         importance of this issue
         based on todays discussion of the degree of preparation required and how to use the
         decisionmaking criteria once confronted with a problem i will continue to strengthen my due
         diligence efforts

management committee as the steering body to implement management programs with an emphasis on compliance risk

in the committees first year fiscal 2008 it identified 70 laws relating to casios businesses and listed measures being taken to comply with
each law regarding laws where casio had deficiencies relating to management cycle operation and manual preparation the committee
analyzed the importance of each risk based on the occurrence possibility and its impact on company management measures were then
prepared to deal first with the risks of higher importance


casio transferred the risk management function from the risk management committee to the csr committee in fiscal 2011

department with responsibility for the risk the department with responsibility formulates a risk action program the csr committee
secretariat manages the implementation of the program and the internal audit department conducts an internal audit which the csr
committee secretariat then follows up with confirmation of the final status of the program

    expectations visits were made to the sales sites in the disaster area and interviews conducted by verifying emergency response activities
    and assistance programs at the headquarters and local sites from the victims perspective casio was able to identify various points for
    improvement these points were reflected in a revised crisis management manual based on the premise of responding to a major
    earthquake with tokyo at its epicenter casio also produced the disaster handbook for the families of its employees to deepen
    understanding of disaster countermeasures in the home and promote disaster readiness



       information system disaster response measures

       with the risk of power interruptions following the great east japan earthquake that struck in march 2011 disaster response
       measures are more important than ever before in addition to an internal data center casio utilizes a secure external data center that
       features seismic construction and selfcontained power generation

       casio has also lowered its disaster risk by actively utilizing public cloud computing infrastructure for some of its business content and
       services as well as having its own internal cloud computing network in june 2010 the indirect materials purchasing system was
       moved to an external service in october 2011 casio also moved its email system an important means of communication for
       employees to a professional external provider

 whistleblower hotline

as a way to help ensure compliance casio set up a whistleblower hotline in april 2006 the hotline has been functioning with neutrality
and fairness across all of its internal and external contact points


operating on a basis of impartiality the hotline follows up on all whistleblower reports and consultations and takes resolute measures
against any improper behavior discovered effort is put into preventing issues before they grow into real problems


there were seven whistleblower reports in fiscal 2012 in each case the callers were interviewed and based on the content of their
reports investigations were made and correction measures implemented to resolve the problems


the number of whistleblower reports has been decreasing each fiscal year it is important to verify whether this is because there are no
problems that actually need to be reported or whether it is because anxiety about reporting is concealing real problems in fiscal 2013
casio plans to further improve the content of its whistleblower protection website and make efforts to increase understanding about
whistleblower reports among its employees with the aim of fully establishing the system at the same time the company will look into the
reasons for the decrease in the number of reports

    and technology that could be diverted for the development of weapons of mass destruction or other weaponry the regulations are
    designed to prevent such goods and technology from reaching countries and regions of concern or terrorist organizations

    in 1987 the export control security program of casio computer co ltd a compliance program was established in order to make sure
    proper measures are taken to ensure the security of exports the program has since been continually updated along with changes in the
    japanese export control regulation


    casio has appointed employees responsible for export control in relevant departments as part of an internal system to ensure observance
    of the program

product planning that accurately targets customer needs and the advanced technologies required to realize
those plans these are the two driving forces behind casios pursuit of innovative products that generate new
demand


 product development for social progress and better living

casios product development concept involves going from 0 to 1 since its inception the company
has consistently sought to improve peoples lifestyles by providing products that did not exist before
and thereby supporting social progress casios aim is always to develop products that generate
their own demand casio has been relentlessly pursuing its own advancement by building the
outstanding product planning abilities ideas and creativity it needs to achieve this aim
nevertheless the creation of products with new value based on latent customer needs cannot be
achieved by armchair thinkers sometimes product development engineers need to experience
                                                                                                          product developers conduct
challenging product usage environments and actually assess for themselves the true value of their
                                                                                                          verification in the field
products



while maintaining a global perspective casio is also developing and providing
products that precisely target particular national and regional needs casios
calculator with selectable indian number display was the fi rst to adopt the traditional
indian method of inserting a comma after the thousand position and then after every
subsequent two digits ie hundred thousand ten million etc the company also
launched an oriental electronic keyboard featuring the 54 tones and 83 rhythms
                                                                                            mj120d                  display with indian
characteristic of the major musical regions of the middle and near east namely the
arab  maghreb khaleeji iran and oriental regions thousands of different products                                digit grouping

have been launched by casio the world over including dynamic product proposals for highgrowth newly emerging markets

in order to translate unique product concepts like these into competitive products a high level of technical expertise is needed only a
technology leader can overcome the various hurdles involved this is why casio constantly works to develop advanced technologies and is
taking on the challenge of pioneering new fields



 creating originality with new ideas and technologies

casio is constantly developing its five core technologies to make it possible to turn groundbreaking ideas into actual products

     going beyond universal design to humancentered design

    casio works to develop products using humancentered design hcd in conformity with iso
    13407 processes with the objective of improving product ease of use as part of the products
    overall quality in the hcd process casio seeks optimal ease of use by determining important
    issues from customer feedback and observation of product use in realworld situations through
    repeated evaluation and verification casio works to develop highly desirable products


    in developing the dtx8 a handheld scanner terminal that is widely used at logistics and retail
    sites casio focused on a shockresistant design to achieve ease of use in the tough working
    conditions in the real world of distribution in addition to 3meter drop resistance the dtx8 is also    dtx8 a handheld scanner terminal
    ip67 dustproof and splashproof and functions at 20c making it ready for the most challenging
    realworld conditionsin dusty sites in the rain and in cold storage
    the dtx8 also features highly ergonomic operation the shape of the key tops and the pitch of the
    keys is finely crafted to make it easy to identify the keys by feel even when wearing work gloves
    which facilitates reliable input




     digital design data shared on a network

    casio products are all designed in 3d using computer software and are stored as digital data these
    files are centrally managed along with circuit diagrams component data specifications and
    production schedules and are shared via network with production sites and logistics facilities this
    system was established to enable casio to flexibly adapt to changing conditions such as changes in
    user needs and the economic environment
    by sharing this data throughout the company casio can ensure that circuits and parts that work the
    same way even if used in different product areas are standardized achieving lower procurement
    costs and greater efficiency in assembly if any problems arise in relation to quality or the
    environment casio can efficiently go through its past product lineup to determine if there is a need to
    replace a certain part or can work across departmental lines to examine the total environmental
    impact for instance calculating the amount of designated chemical substances contained in products
    design data is also used in the creation of catalogs and instruction manuals since design data can
    be used to create 3d diagrams and crosssection diagrams there is no need to start drawing new
    diagrams from scratch this accelerates the production process and keeps costs down



     platform design for flexible production

    casios electronic dictionaries come in a variety of models and in a wide array of colors to meet the needs of todays diverse users to
    efficiently produce product lineups that span a wide range of configurations casio integrates all the common parts of each product to create
    a single platform unit this allows casio to keep costs down by ordering parts in large quantities and to improve manufacturing efficiency
    by standardizing production processes

    casio determines how many of each product to ship by looking at the market conditions immediately before shipment inserting different
    types of content into the platform units assembling the exterior and then packaging the products this allows casio to supply only the
    number of models necessary in the shortest period of time

                                                                       49

    casios primary mission is to deliver the products desired by customers at the right time the company is
    working to strengthen its global supply chain and to continue providing cuttingedge products without
    interruption


     approach to stable product supply

    delivering a stable supply of products to consumers is one of the most important responsibilities of a manufacturer and is required to
    ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty

    as part of casios mission to provide delight happiness and pleasure to customers through its innovative products the company is
    promoting the following policies



          policies on stable product supply

             1 we strive to shorten production leadtime and improve planning and execution accuracy by using it to streamline the
                supply chain procurementproductionlogisticssalesservice
             2 we build good relationships with component suppliers to ensure stable procurement
             3 we maintain the flexibility needed to address various risks involved in manufacturing by
                 building a production system with at least two production sites for each product
                 producing multiple products at each casio group production site
                 maintaining inhouse production and inlining of key devices and components




     supply network is highly responsive to changes in demand

    since sales for products such as electronic dictionaries for education for schools teachers and students are concentrated in the early
    spring when the japanese school year starts this makes accurate sales planning more difficult on the other hand the components at the
    core of these products such as semiconductors and display devices have a procurement lead time that is determined by the market this
    means longterm planning is required


    accordingly casio has taken various measures to minimize the loss of sales opportunities and has worked to expand its market share

    one such measure is the operation of parallel supply chain management systems scm at the headquarters procurement division and a
    production site in order to enhance capacity simulation speed

    production sites carry out simulations based on sales plans provided by the sales department and calculate the personnel and equipment
    levels needed for production before making the necessary arrangements the materials procurement department adjusts the procurement
    quantities every week by looking at information on materials to be received and the models prioritized by the sales department these
    efforts help ensure timely production delivery


    in the case of electronic dictionaries by using common platforms as base models and performing primary assembly production it is
    possible to add individual model specifications such as dictionary content display panels and keyboards during secondary assembly just
    prior to delivery this enables casio to rapidly meet changes in customer demand

    in the past all parts procurement was carried out three months in advance however through the use of model platforms the lead time for
    final product specifications determination has been shortened to just two weeks in advance which also helps minimize surplus production

    casio responds to the competitive and rapidly changing market for digital cameras by using weekly supply chain management in all
    divisions for sales procurement and production

 diversifying production risk and producing core components inhouse

casio maintains a stable supply of products by having each production site manufacture multiple product items and by ensuring that two
different sites can produce any given casio product


he company is also increasing the internal production of components in order to protect newly created technologies and to reduce parts
procurement risk


production sites for individual products




casios plant in nava nakorn industrial park of pathum thani province in thailand was damaged by the october 2011 flooding moving
quickly the casio group was able to meet its supply obligations by switching production to manufacturing sites in japan and china at the
same time casio brought forward the opening date of its new plant in nakhonratchasima province a different part of thailand where
preparations for operation had been underway this new thai plant is located on high ground not vulnerable to flooding looking ahead
casio plans to increase the manufacturing functions at the plant making it one of the main production sites in the casio group by
expanding the number of products manufactured as well as producing components on site

although casio was able to adapt in 2011 the recent flooding in thailand has brought a range of issues into sharp focus the casio group
is currently addressing these issues in a review of its business continuity plans at the companys production sites outside japan




                                                                                                    casio sustainability report 2012

          casio aims to fulfill its social responsibilities including compliance with relevant laws and social norms and protection of the

          3 environmental protection

          5 policies on supplier selection and transaction continuation

          compliance with laws and social norms environmental protection proper information security respect for intellectual property
          sound and stable corporate management superior technological development ability right price and quality stable supply
          capabilities and electronic transaction systems

          6 securing right price and quality
          casio endeavors to secure right price and quality in order to provide its customers with stable supply of optimal products
          which ensures that casio gains the full confidence of customers around the world

properly fulfilled




  disseminating supplier guidelines

casio carries out the majority of its production outside japan at casio plants and manufacturing subcontractors electronic manufacturing
services every year casio holds briefings on its procurement policies in southern china and thailand

in the past these briefings simply involved casio explaining its business policies to suppliers and asking them to undertake initiatives
starting in fiscal 2010 however casio is using these briefings as an opportunity for interaction for instance by having a selected supplier
present its own exemplary csr initiatives through joint efforts with suppliers casio is aiming for continued improvement in the level of
csr performance

since fiscal 2011 casio has been asking suppliers whose sites it had audited for csr performance to present examples of their efforts to
improve csr activities it is proving highly effective to share case studies and knowhow when addressing csr issues




                 briefing on procurement policies                 award ceremony at                                 presentation of exemplary

    section of the program on connection with life seeks to give children opportunities to feel a connection with life and experience living
    through the senses by using equipment to listen to the beating of the heart the final segment on todays world provides a forum for
    children to share and discuss their ideas about the global environment that supports human life and on the various problems children face
    around the world this helps to encourage awareness and action on such issues as the life peace poverty and the environment the
    program has been spreading around the country in fiscal 2012 casio provided learning opportunities to a total of 4841 students at 57
    schools


    the classes offered at the hachioji rd center one of the casio groups most advanced ecofriendly business sites focus mostly on

    environment by allowing them to experience familiar environmental efforts such as energy conservation and sorting of garbage but in a

   message from a partner
   my npo the japan esd promotion forum has been holding the national meeting of unesco associated schoolseducation for
   sustainable development esd forum in conjunction with japans ministry of education culture sports science and technology
   since fiscal 2010 this event provides a forum for unesco associated schools and educators from all over japan to come together
   to achieve a proper understanding of how to develop and practice esd in schools
   casio computer co ltd has provided assistance since the beginning as a company that is training the next generation of
   employees to be the leaders of a sustainable society every year the company gives the participants a presentation on its class on
   life initiative mr hisashi wakao from casio computer co ltd is in charge of the class on life initiative and his uniquely earnest
   and authentic approach to speaking about the program has made an emotional impact on a large number of teachers class on life
   programs at some schools have emerged out of the national meeting i am also extremely pleased to have been able to assist in the
   expansion of the program
   teachers often tell us that although the expression education for sustainable development is
   becoming better known they still do not know how best to incorporate esd perspectives and
   approaches into classes the creation of school education programs in which companies utilize their
   own principles and cuttingedge technology surely assists with the development of more concrete
   and practical esd in the classroom
   looking to the future my npo will continue to serve as a gobetween linking industry government
   and schools as we continue working in partnership on initiatives that help children to be educated by
   society as a whole

       message from a grant recipient

       i am extremely grateful to have received this prestigious research grant casio understood my
       challenging research proposal for an inorganic semiconductor chip that reduces co2 using sunlight
       at a time when i had only just set up my research laboratory and was still in the process of collecting
       parts and assembling equipment with my students based on this technology we have created
       innovative energy devices and blazed a trail to new applications of electronics in the fields of
       environment and energy during this process i have been determined to teach my students about
       the impact that casios fx7000g calculator made on me when i was a student and the
       overwhelming importance of technology i hope that casio will continue to provide me with help and
       support in the future                                                                                                        mutsuko hatano professor

   message from a teacher at an affiliated school

   the practical training at casio zhongshan allows students to turn the theoretical knowledge they have studied into more concrete
   skills by actually experiencing operations at a plant this in turn helps them acquire some perspective on the work world
   in this respect both the school and the students are satisfied and we are extremely grateful to casio zhongshan as it has also
   helped to reduce their economic burden including tuition fees
   we are further deepening our relationship of cooperation and we hope that casio will continue to employ many of our graduates and
   train highly skilled workers

 environmental management at casio the road to 2050




 top commitment

casios goal is to help build a more sustainable world while contributing to the creation of
new markets and cultural phenomenon by developing compact lightweight slim and
energyefficient products


the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant operated by tokyo electric power company tepco
received major damage from the great east japan earthquake and subsequent tsunami that
originated off the coast of miyagi prefecture on march 11 2011 several reactors at the plant suffered
fire core meltdown and radiation leakage more than a year later the crisis there is still not under
control

in may 2012 all nuclear power plants across japan were shut down for safety checks at this point
only reactors 3 and 4 at kansai electric powers ohi nuclear power plant have been restarted so
there are still concerns about a power supply shortage across the country

at a press conference yukio edano minister of economy trade and industry stated his intention not
to implement power usage restrictions at the present time like those that were implemented in the
summer of 2011 in the regions served by tepco and tohoku electric power based on the electricity            yukio kashio
business act thus we do not believe that it is currently necessary to take measures such as                executive vice president
staggering work days and operation hours however we will continue to carry out energysaving
measures without impairing business operations

meanwhile in the region served by tepco a hike in electricity rates has been implemented along with existing powerrate increases
arising from the introduction of feedin tariffs for renewable energy further rate hikes are needed to cover fuel costs for increased thermal
power generation caused by the shutdown of nuclear power plants since a 17 corporate rate increase began in april taking effect from
the time of power contract renewal we will look into additional ways to conserve power and introduce renewable energy equipment when it
can yield a fair return on investment



  worldwide trends
two main thrusts were decided at cop17 the un climate change conference held in durban south africa in december 2012 regarding
the kyoto protocol which established targets to be achieved by 2012 and as postkyoto protocol measures to begin in 2013 cop17
adopted the durban platform this agreement involves the extension of the kyoto protocol past 2012 and the implementation of a new
framework in 2020 that includes china and the us japan however has expressed opposition to the extension of the kyoto protocol
refraining from joining the extended framework japan has decided to work on its own emissions reduction measures starting in 2013

following cop10 the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity held in nagoya two years ago cop11 will be



                                                                                                      casio sustainability report 2012

    held this year in hyderabad india at the meeting the delegates plan to discuss evaluation methods based on strategic target indicators to
    be achieved by 2012 and sustainable use of resources

    in addition the rio20 united nations conference on sustainable development was held in rio de janeiro brazil in june 2012 the
    meeting was held to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1992 earth summit held in the same city when countries signed the united nations
    framework convention on climate change and the convention on biological diversity this time the delegates discussed institutional
    frameworks for sustainable development and future green economies

    these trends will lead to major global developments casio understands how important it is to predict how these developments will affect its
    future and how it can contribute to the preservation of the global environment



      industry association trends
    as part of the fight against climate change japans electrical and electronics industry is now ascertaining greenhouse gases emitted
    indirectly due to corporate activities eg greenhouse gas emissions by manufacturerssuppliers of parts as well as emissions in the
    product disposal and recycling stages the industry has started looking into measures that emphasize reducing these emissions known as
    scope 3 category emissions

    as part of an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2013 the japan business foundation has a new commitment to a low
    carbon society that goes a step beyond its voluntary action plan currently effective through 2012 keidanren has decided to launch its new
    plan which includes penalties for failure to achieve targets the target for the electronics industry is an annual emission reduction of 1 per
    unit of production casio will participate in the federations plan

    in the area of biodiversity protection electronics companies have been sharing information on their best practices this fiscal year the
    industry association has decided to establish activity guidelines in this area

    meanwhile the small appliance recycling program administered by japans ministry of the environment is gradually taking shape
    manufacturers will be responsible for making products easier to disassemble and be expected to use more recycled materials casio
    products will be subject to the program as small appliances we will therefore closely watch this trend and take the necessary measures as
    many of our products will be affected

    these industry association trends are closely related to casios environmental management so we will actively pursue our efforts in
    accordance with association policies



      corporate rating trends
    every year casio participates in three corporate rating surveys the dow jones sustainability index djsi the carbon disclosure project
    cdp and the nikkei environmental management survey casio makes the most of its participation to identify specific issues it can better
    address in its environmental initiatives

    in fiscal 2012 casio was selected again after two years for inclusion in the djsis asia pacific index also casio was moved up one notch
    from the cdps middle level for information disclosure assigned in the previous fiscal year to the high level on the other hand under a
    cdp performance score system introduced this fiscal year casio received a d ranking on a fivepoint scale from a to e improvements
    are necessary

    according to the nikkei environmental management survey casio rose from the 33rd position two years ago to the 27th position last year
    in a ranking of 475 companies

    in order to maintain and improve the companys positive ratings casio needs to take further action starting with the highest priority issues
    including 1 independent efforts against climate change including capital investment 2 expansion of the scope of its environmental
    management system and 3 ensuring completeness comparability and timeliness in environmental reporting



       future policy
    our aim is to improve the strength of the casio brand and ensure people see casio as a leading environmental company we will continue
    to contribute to environmental preservation and improve the casio brand by creating products that are compact lightweight slim and
    energy efficient while also providing products that facilitate the paperless lifestyle

in order to ensure that the next generation inherits this irreplaceable planet casio has established and is
implementing climate change action with medium and longterm targets to be achieved by fiscal 2051


 approach to setting medium and longterm targets

with the establishment of these medium and longterm targets casio intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions significantly
moreover the company is emphasizing its goal of becoming carbon neutral1 which means reducing casios net greenhouse gas emissions
to zero accordingly casio has adopted the following environmental management policy


       casios goal is to become carbon neutral by leveraging its ability to develop compact lightweight slim and
       energyefficient products to create new markets and cultural phenomenon


1 casio defines carbon neutral as offsetting its direct co2 emissions with co2 emissions reduction and absorption through other methods


scope of emissions reduction targets
when casio established its medium and longterm emissions reduction targets it also announced the target scope as greenhouse gas
emission from business activities at casios production sites and offices in japan and around the world furthermore casio is aiming to
become a carbon neutral company by offsetting its total volume of greenhouse gas emissions including the co2 emissions resulting from
logistics product usage employee travel and consignment production with the reduction effects of casios ecoproducts such as data
projectors electronic dictionaries and other products that promote paperless lifestyles

in addition to the co2 emissions reduction achieved by the efforts of the casio group the target co2 emissions reduction also includes
reductions due to the availability of cleaner energy such as electricity and due to carbon reduction in the entire social infrastructure see
diagram

co2 emissions reduction targets




switching to totalvolume emission reduction targets
with the setting of global medium and longterm targets totalvolume emissions reduction targets for greenhouse gases have been
established in japan and around the world including reduction targets and emission trading systems casio has now finished the move to
totalvolume emissions reduction targets

casio had already set targets for the total volume of greenhouse gas reduction at its offices worldwide however with the establishment of
its recent medium and longterm targets casio has now set worldwide targets for reductions in the total volume of co2 emissions which is
a change from previous targets for reduction per unit of production

the base year for casios medium and longterm targets is fiscal 2006 decided based on changes in casios business structure as well as
the scope and accuracy of data acquisition




                                                                                                                       casio sustainability report 2012
                                                                                  81

    carbon neutral calculation examples
    casio is looking into trial calculations for its reduction of greenhouse gases based on the use of casios ecoproducts and in particular
    products encouraging the transition to a paperless society

    casios current target products for this paperless initiative are data projectors and electronic dictionaries casio calculates the amount of
    co2 emitted during the manufacture and use of these products as well as the amount of co2 absorbed by the trees not harvested to make
    the paper saved by these products when these two amounts are equal the products are considered carbon neutral




       when using a data projector

       if meetings of ten people each given 10page information packets are held twice a week or 100 times a year and this continues for
       five years a total of 50000 sheets of paper will have been used using a data projector for the same meetings would prevent the
       logging of trees to make the 50000 sheets of paper enabling the trees to continue absorbing co2 it would also avoid co2 emissions
       from the manufacture of the 50000 sheets of paper and the emissions from operating the printer to make the 50000 copies
       however assuming that each meeting using the data projector is about 35 hours the emissions from the resulting electrical usage
       also need to be taken into account



    calculating using the above approach use of the casio data projectors sold in fiscal 2012 would result in an annual reduction of about
    38000 tons of co2


       when using an electronic dictionary

       most casio electronic dictionaries today contain as many as 100 dictionaries in one unit without one of these electronic dictionaries
       it would be almost impossible for the average person to assemble the same number of dictionaries in paper form accordingly it can
       be assumed that the typical japanese consumer would actually only use the following paper dictionaries a japanese dictionary an
       englishjapanese dictionary and a japaneseenglish dictionary any other paper dictionaries would probably be used at a library
       therefore the co2 reduction benefit of an electronic dictionary would be the co2 emissions from paper manufacturing and the co2
       no longer being absorbed by the trees logged to make the paper dictionaries on the other hand assuming that the electronic
       dictionary is used for an hour a day 100 days a year for five years the corresponding amount of emissions from electrical use also
       has to be taken into account



    calculating using the above approach use of the casio electronic dictionaries sold in fiscal 2012 would result in an annual reduction of
    about 7900 tons of co2




     medium and longterm targets


          casio groups medium and longterm targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction

             mediumterm target to reduce the total volume of global greenhouse gas emissions from business activities by 30
             compared to fiscal 2006 by fiscal 2021
             longterm target to reduce the total volume of global greenhouse gas emissions from business activities by 80
             compared to fiscal 2006 by fiscal 2051
           business activities this indicates activities of production sites and offices in japan and overseas and does not include co 2 emissions from logistics
          product usage or employee travel

                                                                                       82

 managing risks and opportunities

as a result of the great east japan earthquake in march 2011 and the ensuing fukushima nuclear accident nuclear power plants across
japan were shut down in may 2012 this has led to a rise in electricity rates in japan and the risk of power shortage s starting this
summer moreover due to the drop in the nuclear power generation rate the greenhouse gas emission factor for electricity is very likely to
increase which could lead to a jump in the amount of actual co2 emissions as a result there is a greater risk of emissions trading costs
under the tokyo metropolitan ordinance on environmental preservation also in 2011 there was major flooding in thailand which may be
partially attributable to global warming and upstream deforestation consequently global risks have become apparent including threats to
the value chain for production and parts

in order to avoid these risks casio plans to expand the introduction of renewable energy and secure alternatives in the value chain

in addition casio sees the greenhouse gas emissions reduction effect of using data projectors and electronic dictionaries as a great
opportunity to help combat climate change and become carbon neutral the company will focus on expanding this business area

in order to minimize the various risks mentioned above and expand opportunities casio must contribute to the sustainability of the planet
and its human societies casio recognizes that this is an extremely important issue for further strengthening its business foundation and will
make even more strenuous efforts in the fight against climate change




 measures for achieving medium and longterm targets

casio has set medium and longterm targets for achievement by 2020 and 2050 among the three areas that the casio environmental
declaration 2020 focuses on casio will put the highest priority on realizing a lowcarbon society

realizing a lowcarbon society
the casio group will provide products and services that make an even greater contribution to the reduction and absorption of co2
emissions in addition to expanding products and services that use energy sources that are friendly to people and the planet including
solar wind and hydro power casio will incorporate these renewable energy sources into its own business operations

casio europe has been operating geothermal cooling and heating in its office building since january 2009 in fiscal 2013 casio will also
begin investigating initiatives for the use of renewable energy including solar

regarding other indirect co2 emissions ghg protocol scope 3 emissions casio will work to expand the scope of disclosure of other
indirect co2 emissions generated during distribution and product usage which it already discloses based on the calculation guidelines
being considered currently by the electrical and electronics industry associations




                                                                                                     casio sustainability report 2012

     measures for 2020

    casio is studying the potential of the following initiatives to achieve the mediumterm target for 2020 it will also strive to assess as quickly
    as possible their potential to help meet the 2050 target

      1 response to social environment changes after the great east japan earthquake
         responding to energy issues
         introducing renewable energy sources

      2 environmental contribution through product usage
         reducing the amount of electricity used by products
         minimizing and optimizing the amount of product packaging
          increasing the percentage of products that run on solar cells

      3 utilizing carbon offsets
         co2 absorption effect based on the expansion of paperless products reducing demand for logging etc
         purchasing carbon offsets for products
         promoting tree planting and greening
         emissions trading clean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation ji
      4 reduction of co2 emissions in various business activity processes
         materials procurement product manufacturing transport and distribution product usage recycling and disposal
          expansion of the scope of co2 emission data gathering on logistics transport efficiency improvement and modal shift
          making production facilities more energy efficient and improving production processes

      5 increasing the percentage of non fossilfuels used at sites
         installation of led lighting
         installation of solar panels
         installation of highly efficient air conditioning equipment




     fiscal 2012 performance

    during fiscal 2012 casio micronics was transferred kofu casio was closed down and energysaving activities were carried out by the
    entire casio group as a result co2 emissions fell by 182 compared to fiscal 2011 which represented a 665 reduction compared to
    fiscal 2006

    casios green star products offer even greater environmental performance than casios conventional
    products


     green star product concept

    in order to minimize the environmental impact of its products casio is promoting the development of environmentally friendly products in
    every aspect of planning and design


    in 1993 casio began product assessment in order to systematize and promote its development of eco products new products had to
    undergo a preliminary assessment for their environmental impact and meet certain criteria in order to be certified as casio green products
    prior to fy2008 casio worked towards an initial green product sales target of 80 of total sales and in that year the company achieved
    84 now the company promotes to continue target of 80


    with the achievement of this target casio decided to create even stricter criteria and implement more specific detailed assessments
    qualifying products are certified as green star products representing the best of casio green products this ensures that casios
    products continue to set the bar higher and drive the realization of a sustainable society


    for green star certified products the environmental features are listed in catalogues and on the product packages

    this page provides an overall picture of the environmental impact of the casio groups business activities


     what is a material balance

    a material balance shows the amount of resources used and the amount of materials with environmental impact that are produced outputs
    in business activities from rd to aftersales collection and recycling inputs


     fiscal 2012 performance

    in fy2012 casio micronics was transferred out of the casio group and kofu casio was closed down now in the process of liquidation
    as a result both inputs and outputs for business activities at production sites in japan were reduced furthermore due to the loss of
    records at casio thailand during the major flooding there data from this company could not be included the inputs and outputs for
    production sites outside japan decreased as a result

    in order to cope with the need for summertime power saving in japan after the great east japan earthquake that struck in march 2011
    large casio group offices and production sites in japan carried out measures such as reporting hourly power consumption data to
    employees on the company intranet casio will continue working to reduce its environmental impact by improving production equipment and
    business processes as well as making casio products even more energy efficient and resource conserving

    1 ozone depleting substances have been fully phased out

in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations casio is carrying out frontline environmental protection activities based on the
establishment of internal standards mainly for sites with iso 14001 certification with the aim of helping to realize a lowcarbon society the
company is also complying with the voluntary action plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions established by the industry association
casio is pursuing environmental management in earnest by setting casio environmental action plan targets for the entire casio group



 co2
reducing co2 emissions
sites in japan
fy2012 marked the fourth year of the target period five years from fy2009 to fy2013 for co2 emissions from sites in japan the
performance figures using comparisons with the base year are average values for the initial year fy2009 through the fourth year
fy2012


  production sites in japan
the target for production sites in japan was a 35 reduction in co2 emissions per unit of actual production compared to fy1991 in
fy2012 emissions were about 469 lower than in fy1991 this also represented a reduction of about 104 compared to the previous
fiscal year the reason for this significant reduction was the transfer of a company out of the casio group and its removal from the scope of
computation along with a decrease in production activities following a business closure


   office sites in japan
the target for office sites in japan was a 9 reduction in the total amount of co2 emissions compared to fy1991 in fy2012 emissions
were about 313 lower than in fy1991 resulting in target achievement for the second consecutive year this was a reduction of about
74 compared to the previous fiscal year the reason for the significant emissions decrease was the implementation of powersaving
measures following the great east japan earthquake


sites outside japan
fy2013 is the target year for all sites outside japan

  production sites outside japan
the target for production sites outside japan was a 30 reduction in co2 emissions per unit of production compared to fy2005 in
fy2012 emissions were about 95 lower than in fy2005 despite an increase of approximately 32 from the previous fiscal year due to
the loss of records at casio thailand during the major flooding there data from this company could not be included in this overall result

  office sites outside japan
the target for office sites outside japan was a 3 reduction in the total amount of co2 emissions compared to fy2005 in fy2012
emissions were about 422 higher than in fy2005 but there was a reduction of about 33 from the previous fiscal year although
emissions had increased each year from fy2005 to fy2011 the company finally achieved a yearonyear reduction in fy2012 the main
drivers of the increased emissions over time were a major increase in floor space of casio europe offices in fy2010 and inclusion of a
broader scope of data in the computation building on the turnaround in fy2012 casio will aggressively pursue further energysaving
activities for lighting heating and cooling


logistics in japan
the target for co2 emissions from logistics activities in japan was a 22 reduction per unit of domestic sales compared to fy2006 by
fy2013 in fy2012 emissions were 244 lower than in fy2006 in august 2011 the logistics center was relocated from suzuka city mie
prefecture to toda city saitama prefecture in january 2012 the eastern distribution center in kotoku tokyo was consolidated with the
logistics center through this staged effort casio reduced the number of consumer distribution centers in japan from five to four this
transition not only shortened transportation distances but also promoted a modal shift from truck to rail helping to further reduce co2
emissions

logistics outside japan
no specific co2 emissions reduction target has been set for logistics activities outside japan cargo shipped from china to north america

cargo has been shipped from china direct to the various central logistics centers of clients which is helping to reduce co2 emissions

    although the input and emissions of sf6 were zero certain spray cans used in production contain hfcsthese emissions were
    approximately 995 lower than in fy2001 and 989 down from the previous year due to the external transfer of the tftlcd business
    in fy2011 there was zero usage or emissions of sf6 in fy2012 that leaves only emissions of hfcs contained in sprays used for in
    production casio will continue to reduce these emissions by switching to alternative hfcfree sprays in the future

 waste
reducing waste
casio evaluates its waste reduction efforts including waste and valuable reusable resources against the target year of fy2013


sites in japan
the target for reducing waste produced from sites in japan was a 50 reduction in waste per unit of actual production compared to
fy2001 in fy2012 waste was about 396 lower than in fy2001 but there was an increase of approximately 63 from the previous
year although the total waste amount was down to 1775 tons from 2017 tons in fy2011 the figure per unit of sales worsened due to a
drop in sales


production sites in japan
the target for reducing waste from production sites outside japan was a 30 reduction per unit of production compared to fy2005 in
fy2012 emissions were about 739 lower than in fy2005 representing a decrease of about 622 from the previous fiscal year due to
the loss of records at casio thailand during the major flooding there data from this company could not be included production increases at
other sites to compensate for the shutdowns at casio thailand also contributed to this overall result casio will continue to work to reduce
waste by revising production processes

     water resources
    reducing input of water resources
    production sites in japan
    water resource input is evaluated using fy2013 as the target year the target for production sites in japan was a 25 reduction in water
    resource input per unit of actual production compared to fy2001 in fy2012 water input per unit of actual production was about 612
    lower than in fy2001 which also represented a reduction of about 337 from the previous fiscal year the reason for this significant
    reduction was the transfer of a company out of the casio group and its removal from the scope of computation along with a decrease in
    production activities following a business closure


    production sites outside japan
    the target for production sites outside japan was a 15 reduction in water resource input per unit of production compared to fy2005 in
    fy2012 the figure was about 45 higher than in fy2005 but approximately 91 lower than the previous year due to the loss of records
    at casio thailand during the major flooding there data from this company could not be included production increases at other sites to
    compensate for the shutdowns at casio thailand also contributed to this overall result the company will work to reduce waste in the future

 paper resources
reducing usage of paper resources
the reduction target for the usage of office paper at sites in japan was a 10 reduction compared to fy2008 by fy2013 per unit of sales
the result for fy2012 was about 371 higher than in fy2008 this increase was due to a drop in sales as the total volume of office
paper used fell from 115 tons in fy2008 to 683 tons in fy2011 along with the increased promotion of green it casio will reinforce its
efforts to reduce paper usage

reducing prtr substances
the target for reduction of usage and releases of substances specified by japans prtr act was a 40 reduction per unit of actual
production compared to fy2004 by fy2013 in fy2012 the figure was approximately 888 lower than in fy2004 also down 614 from
the previous year the reason for this significant reduction was the transfer of a company out of the casio group and its removal from the
scope of computation along with a decrease in production activities following a business closure casio will continue striving to reduce the
use of these chemicals

    reducing vocs
    the target for reducing atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds vocs from production sites in japan was a reduction of
    45 compared to fy2001 by fy2016 in fy2012 casios emissions of vocs were about 946 lower than in fy2001 which also
    represented a reduction of approximately 880 from the previous fiscal year the reason for this significant reduction was the transfer of a
    company out of the casio group and its removal from the scope of computation along with a decrease in production activities following a
    business closure by adjusting settings and practicing indoor temperature management casio also intends to further reduce emissions of
    atmospheric pollution generated by air conditioning equipment such as hot and chilled water generators

    and 2 tons respectively emissions in fy2012 were dramatically lower at 11 tons 22 tons and 02 tons respectively the reason for
    these significant reductions was the transfer of a company out of the casio group and its removal from the scope of computation along
    with a decrease in production activities following a business closure by adjusting settings and practicing indoor temperature management

 overview of fiscal 2012 performance

in fy2012 the casio groups environmental accounting was largely influenced by extraordinary factors such as the unprecedented natural
disasters of the great east japan earthquake and the flooding in thailand other major factors included the transfer of the wlprelated
business out of the casio group and a substantial drop in the co2 unit price that is the basis for economic effect calculation as a result
investment and expenses in environmental conservation and economic benefits of environmental conservation were both down compared to
the previous fiscal year
casios investments in environmental conservation including energysaving equipment were valued at 51 million in fy2012 the
expenses of casios environmental conservation activities including recycling of products parts and supplies such as toner cartridges
were 1486 million meanwhile there was a real economic benefit of 1085 million from recycling activities and an estimated economic
benefit of 311 million from the reduction of distribution costs through environmental protection initiatives and environmental impact
reduction achieved by paperless products the fiscal years total economic benefits were 1396 million
casio will continue to properly identify and report on its environmental management activities in economic terms and will promote initiatives
for even more efficient and effective environmental conservation

    the estimated benefit is calculated as the co2 reduction amount from business activities plus the reduction from power savings during
    product use by customers it also includes the environmental benefit of paperless products such as electronic dictionaries and data
    projectors as well as distribution cost reductions achieved by a modal shift from air to sea transport and the resource saving benefit from
    water recycling
    regarding the reduction of power consumption during product use by customers the monetary value of the environmental impact reduction
    effect is calculated as follows
    reduction of power consumption during product use by customers  annual power consumption of the previous model  annual power
    consumption of the new model x number units sold in the year x electrical power unit price
    the following statistical sources are used to perform these calculations
    co2 unit prices are the average values for fy2011 8950ton based on the nikkeijbic carbon quotation index
    electrical power unit prices are based on the fy2009 results published by the agency for natural resources and energy of the ministry of

     carbon offset initiative

    as an initiative to help combat climate change casio began selling toner cartridges featuring a carbon offset in july 2008 in general
    carbon offset works like this an organization purchases a credit equivalent to a reduction of emissions of certain gases thought to
    contribute to climate change in order to cancel out its own emissions even though casios products are compact and energyefficient
    which in itself reduces emissions casios toner initiative seeks to offset co2 emissions equivalent to the amount generated to produce the
    electric power the printer uses during the life of the toner cartridge this unique initiative is an industryfirst
    in the initial fiscal year casio performed offsetting using carbon credits from clean development mechanism cdm projects outside japan
    registered with the un cdm executive board in fy2010 casio also began using japan verified emission reduction jver a newly
    created carbon credit system in japan casio signed a contract with kochi prefecture which received the initial certification of jver and
    the offsetting was performed the applicable proceeds from toner cartridges sold in kochi prefecture went towards the purchase of carbon
    credits from greenhouse gas reduction projects within the prefecture this is known as local production for local consumption carbon
    offsetting
    casio will continue to introduce unique initiatives to address the challenge of climate change

    this section describes casios environmental protection initiatives in the area of general packaging

    casios special committee on packaging spearheads the companys effort to revise and improve general packaging
    specifically the committee promotes efforts to improve transport efficiency reduce co2 emissions during transportation and reduce the
    amount of material used in packaging by making packages more compact and lightweight for all products


    here are three examples of the progress made in fiscal 2012

     1 watch packaging eliminated an extra step of distribution processing by standardizing packaging that had been different for each
     customer and further reduced the packaging size
     2 electronic dictionary packaging realized more compact packaging with fewer package components by improving the shock resistance
     of the products themselves
     3 digital camera packaging in consideration of actual customer usage eliminated some included items accessories and revised
     specifications of others thereby reducing packaging weight




     watch packaging

    casio redesigned three different packaging formats c ring stands that had been used for north american customers by standardizing the
    packaging format the packaging volume was reduced by about 17 in addition a step of distribution processing was eliminated

 electronic dictionary packaging

one of the packaging components the product tray was eliminated by improving the shock resistance of the products themselves also by
redesigning the box construction a place for putting the included product accessories was created in total the box volume was reduced by
about 13

     digital camera packaging

    in consideration of actual customer usage some included items accessories were eliminated and the specifications of others were revised
    to reduce packaging weight for instance

     simplified user manual content with further details provided online
     changed the manual from cd size to a7 size
     eliminated the cdrom

casio is working to ensure its logistical operations have as low an environmental impact as possible by
improving its intersite partsshipment routes and switching to more efficient modes of product
transportation


 logistics process initiatives

casio is actively reducing its environmental impact by striving to reduce co2 and waste emissions arising from logistics
in order to reduce co2 emissions in the logistics process casio is promoting the following three action plans

  shortening transport distances promoting direct shipping to customers from logistics centers in and outside japan
  promoting a modal shift actively using modes of transport with low environmental impact such as rail for transport between sites
  improving loading efficiency and reducing transport volume improving the packaging design of digital cameras electronic
  dictionaries musical instruments electronic cash registers and other products and reducing the volume of packaging


relocation and consolidation of logistics centers in japan
casios logistics center in mie prefecture was moved to saitama prefecture and then its distribution center in tokyo was ultimately
consolidated with the logistics center a transition that was achieved in stages
in august 2011 the logistics center was moved from suzuka city mie prefecture to toda city saitama prefecture then in january 2012
the companys eastern distribution center in kotoku tokyo was consolidated with the logistics center
with this change casio reduced the number of consumer product distribution sites in japan from five to four this transition not only
shortened transport distances but also promoted a significant shift from truck to rail shipment and has contributed greatly to co2 emissions
reduction

promoting modal shift and reducing intermediate transport




 results of the transfer and consolidation

    1 elimination of intermediate transport
       shortened the distance from the logistics center to the hokkaido distribution center in sapporo
        intermediate transport no longer required from the logistics center to the eastern distribution center in tokyo
    2 promotion of modal shift
       partial shift to rail between the logistics center and the western distribution center in osaka
       switch to rail between the logistics center and the kyushu distribution center in fukuoka
    3 transport distance shortened
       shortened the transport distance in the kanto tokyo region which accounts for about 46 of direct shipments from the logistics
        center delivery direct to customers without going through a distribution center
 based on the results above co2 emissions have been reduced by approximately 330 tons annually 20 reduction



                                                                                                     casio sustainability report 2012

    promoting direct delivery to north america
    casio is promoting direct delivery from logistics centers to corporate customers

    in the past products shipped from china to north america were sent to a warehouse of casio america inc in chicago before being
    delivered to the logistics centers of corporate customers in 2009 however casio began shipping directly to the central logistics centers of
    customers thereby helping to reduce co2 emissions in fiscal 2011 about 1800 tons of co2 emitted by the casio group and its customers
    were eliminated in this way

    in fiscal 2012 casio will promote further direct delivery efforts investigating direct shipment not just to the central logistics centers of
    customers but also to their regional centers

introduction of reusable shipping cartons in asian distribution
to reduce packaging material casio is working to introduce the use of reusable
shipping cartons in its asian distribution operations

in an effort to switch to plastic reusable shipping cartons in its air freight shipments
between japan hong kong and thailand casio launched the use of new cartons in
september 2009

these cartons can be used to ship parts made in japan to hong kong for use at
chinese production sites and to ship timepiece parts from vendors in china from hong                a reusable shipping carton employed for distribution in asia
kong to thailand by then transporting finished timepieces or timepiece parts from
thailand to japan the cartons never have to travel empty between the three countries

unlike traditional cardboard boxes these cartons do not have to be discarded and instead can be used many times over thereby reducing
environmental impact

casio has now begun to introduce even larger shipping cartons the large shipping cartons are mainly used for ocean transport packaging
damage can be avoided through the use of lcl shipping freight from different companies in one ocean shipping container which also
eliminates the need to use air transport when the shipping volume is small
starting in fiscal 2012 the reusable large shipping cartons are also being used to transport products




eco rail mark certification
on october 29 2009 casio was certified by the japanese railway freight association as a company carrying out eco rail mark initiatives

the eco rail mark indicates that a product or company is actively engaged in efforts to alleviate environmental problems through the use of
rail freight transport rail transport has a smaller environmental impact producing about 17th the co2 emissions of commercial trucking

casio actively uses rail for shipping from its logistics center in mie prefecture to its distribution centers in hokkaido and tokyo

casio will continue working to reduce its environmental impact by pursuing environmentally friendly transport

    in compliance with global laws and standards casio is striving to achieve environmentally compliant product
    design and green procurement


     green design and green procurement

    as a company with operations around the world casio must comply with the laws and standards of many different countries

    this is why casio starts with the design and procurement stages to ensure that its products comply with restrictions on specified chemical
    substances in parts and materials while complying with obligations for labeling information provision and energysaving standards for
    finished products

    in the procurement stage casio regularly updates its green procurement standards to ensure compatibility with all the current laws and
    standards in countries around the world thus by procuring parts and materials that meet its own strict standards casio can be confident
    that its product development meets legal requirements worldwide casio also ensures the compliance of its products by scientifically
    verifying and analyzing the content of chemical substances in parts and materials used

    in the design stage the company confirms that all parts and materials that will go into a completed casio product meet the casio green
    procurement standards products are approved for production only after confirmation using a database of the chemical substances
    contained in procured materials

    casio selects recyclable materials and provides symbol marks and the necessary information to ensure separate collection complying with
    the relevant laws and standards worldwide on product recovery and recycling as well as on chemical substances contained in products

    the company has also established internal standards to comply with laws for energysaving design such as europes energyrelated
    products erp requirements

this section describes casios environmental protection initiatives in the area of general production


 saving resources by eliminating defects

at yamagata casio which boasts the most advanced manufacturing technologies of any casio
facility a computersimulated system is adopted for the design process in an effort to eliminate the
creation of defective products even before the trial production stage

they calculate the flow of resin inside a mold and try to predict and resolve any problems that
might occur in the manufacturing process this enables production to begin without a test
production phase thereby minimizing the waste of resources




                                                                                                         simulation display




                                          in the mass production stage the condition of the molds used to form components is analyzed
                                          digitally using acoustic emission ae technologies that yamagata casio developed itself this
                                          technology detects even slight deformations or cracks that appear in the mold over the course of
                                          manufacturing many tens of thousands of parts sounding an alarm before such problems can
                                          have an impact on product quality this prevents the generation of defective products

                                          as an indication of the success of these initiatives the factory is now using parts per million ppm
mold diagnostic system using ae           rather than a percentage  as the index to manage its defective product production rate

    all casio office sites are engaged in efforts to reduce co2 emissions and cut resource use by upgrading
    office equipment and improving work processes


     reducing power consumption through server integration

    casio has vastly reduced its energy consumption by integrating the servers that had once been disparately located across the group


    server integration results
    815 servers had been integrated by march 2012


    effects of reducing power consumption through server integration
    this server integration effort is resulted in a total reduction in power consumption of 1220000 kwh yielding a reduction in co2 emissions
    of 444 tons

     casio europes energyefficient building

    casios office sites have shifted from focusing on reducing co2 per unit of production to cutting
    the total volume of co2 emitted across the entire casio group in january 2009 casio europe
    integrated its offices distribution center and service center which had previously been separately
    located around germany into a new energyefficient building




                                                                                                                             casio europe


                                    this building has an innovative air conditioning system that uses geothermal exchange equipment 130m below
                                    ground to pump water through pipes embedded in the concrete ceiling and floor of the building the system
                                    pumps cool water in the summer and hot water in the winter to either cool or heat the building
                                    energy consumption in the building is further reduced by controlling room temperatures using blinds that open
                                    and close automatically according to the weather as well as proper ventilation in fiscal 2012 co2 emissions
                                    were reduced by about 45 compared to fiscal 2009 before relocation to the new building based on a total floor

 hachioji rd center takes on the challenge of climate change and environmental preservation

the hachioji rd center was designed and constructed to reduce co2 emissions in order to contribute to the
fight against climate change the center continues to take on the challenge of environment protection some
of its innovations are highlighted below

 ongoing powersaving activities

designed as an environmentally friendly building the hachioji rd center was completed in november 2003 the center is equipped with
energysaving features such as highefficiency vertical thermal storage tanks a natural ventilation system automatic blinds lighting control
and equipment control based on weather forecasting with the participation of the construction and building management companies the
center holds ongoing meetings to consider powersaving measures thus instead of just relying on its hardware the center has been
enthusiastically pursing other improvements such as finely tuned temperature control and the revision of operation methods based on
actual daily data

as a result of these efforts in fiscal 2010 five years after the base year of fiscal 2005 the center was able to reduce co2 emissions by
275 in fiscal 2011 the organization and number of employees at the center were streamlined but then in fiscal 2012 the number of
employees increased this brought about a corresponding significant decrease and then increase in co2 emissions however co2
emissions for both years were still about one third of that in the base year

 the hachioji rd center  environmentally friendly since the design stage

                                                                    the airconditioning system at the hachioji rd center features large vertical

                                                                  that is cooled during the night and then used to enable indoor climate control during
                                                                  the day although the system can operate entirely on its own it is actually run with
                                                                  human guidance for semiautomatic operation in other words by having human

thermal storage tanks
the water in the tanks is chilled using cheaper power at night
and the tanks are then used to cool the offices in the daytime
these distinctive thermal storage tanks are noticeable even
from a distance and have become an energysaving symbol
for the entire hachioji rd center


 natural ventilation system maximizes use of outside weather conditions

no heating equipment is needed at the hachioji rd center this is because the building has comprehensive protection against cold
weather which prevents interior heat from escaping and improves thermal efficiency since room temperatures increase even in winter due
to body heat and heat from equipment such as computers the interior is cooled by letting in the right amount of outside air thereby
maintaining optimal temperature control mechanical ventilation is employed to bring in outside air only when air circulation from natural
ventilation becomes insufficient this helps to minimize power costs




                                                                                                                   casio sustainability report 2012

     making the most of sunlight with automatic blinds

      the opening and closing of the blinds is controlled automatically by calculating the
    position of the sun and using sensors to detect its intensity at the same time thanks
    to this technology a comfortable interior environment is maintained there are also
    sensors to detect room brightness and human movement for automatic control of
    interior lighting this helps eliminate unnecessary electrical usage through these
    measures the hachioji rd center is contributing greatly to the reduction of co2
    emissions thereby helping in the fight against climate change and protecting the
    environment while fully utilizing the environmentally friendly functions of this energy
    saving building the center is implementing cycles of improvement operation results

casios environmental management system is driven by the biannual casio environmental conferences the
company makes the most of this system to implement its environmental management strategy


 implementation framework

the biannual casio environmental conferences decide on the companys specific environmental plans including its environmental policies
and action plan targets positioned within the conference are special committees that deal with environmental issues shared by all group
companies each business site and group company then implements the policies and plans
the international environmental management standard such as iso 14001 has been adopted at each casio site and group company and
993 of all group employees now work at sites with iso 14000 certification the smaller business sites where it is difficult to implement this

worldwide environmental regulations are being strengthened to preserve the beauty of the earth whether
global or local compliance with environmental regulations has become an integral part of the corporate
mission companies today recognize the need to address issues such as risk management and
environmental information disclosure while complying with greenhouse gas emissions regulations the
prohibition of products containing harmful chemical substances and iso 14001 legal requirements here is an
overview of casios environmental compliance initiatives


 standards management and audits regular internal audits and thirdparty audits

there are 14 casio sites which have obtained iso 14001 certification


each of these sites regularly implements conditions management and improvement activities by measuring concentrations of dust sox and
nox in exhaust emissions based on voluntary standards and standards established by national and local governments they also measure
wastewater quality water containing harmful substances moreover the sites measure and report usage conditions for harmful
atmospheric pollutants as well as handling quantities and atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds vocs


each site trains internal environmental auditors and environmental provisional auditors in addition to carrying out internal audits thirdparty
audits by external organizations are also regularly performed and improvement activities are carried out

going forward casio will work to improve the environmental risk detection skills of its internal environmental auditors as a way to improve

training in worldwide laws relating to chemical substance control and information management casio intends these auditors to lead the way
in environment compliance starting at the local site by discovering issues and proposing ways to improve



 compliance relating to product development design and manufacturing

in recent years laws and regulations on the environmental performance of products have become stricter in addition to stricter regulations
in eu nations and us states stronger laws are also being discussed and enacted in the newly emerging economies of asia and latin
america referencing those already established by developed countries in some cases the newer laws are based on the established ones
but they often have small differences in the specific requirements it is vital for casio to interpret these regulations properly and make
whatever product adjustments are needed


accordingly casio always obtains the latest news from each region and specialized information services while also exchanging information
with other companies in the same industry the information is used to check that casio products meet legal requirements the company
analyzes the text of laws including those under deliberation and establishes specific product response policies immediately after new laws
are officially announced ensuring that all casio products are legally compliant

casio has established a product environment law study working group within its new green product development council the working
group includes representatives from the environmental management technology developmentdesign and sales departments and
investigates measures for product compliance the group members share information establish reasonable response policies and confirm
response progress for efforts relating to both current and future laws they also offer support to the development design manufacturing
and sales departments

the working group performs the following

  1 gathering and sharing legal information from and with sources such as industrial associations sales companies in each region
     information services and other companies in the same industry
  2 analyzing and interpreting legal information
  3 ensuring obligations are met by manufacturing import export and sales entities
  4 creating development and design standards and conducting inspections
  5 improving the usage efficiency for design support tools database of chemical substances contained in products etc

     initiative to save otoguro cherry trees

    otoguro cherry trees scientific name cerasus serrulata or komatsunagi are a type of wild
    cherry that comes into full bloom in mid april they have white blossoms measuring 5 to 6 cm and
    the leaves emerge at the same time as the blooms
    in the late 19th century and early 20th century this cherry tree variety was growing along the banks
    of the fuefuki river which flows through presentday chuo city in yamanashi prefecture the
    otoguro cherry gets its name from the otoguro embankment in the otoguro district where the
    trees used to bloom this variety of cherry tree has long been a favorite of the people in that
    region

    however with the improvement of the fuefuki river in 1932 the otoguro cherry trees were cut
    down mr matsuhiko tanaka of otoguro district grew grafted seedlings from a few remaining
    descendent trees in order to bring back the historic otoguro cherry his activities eventually came
    to fruition and a volunteer group for saving the otoguro cherry was established in 2002 the
    tamahocho now chuo city board of education lifelong learning center led the whole community
    in efforts to save and cultivate otoguro cherry trees this was achieved through cutting and                   otoguro cherry trees on the grounds
    grafting methods using a few remaining descendents of the original trees

    as part of kofu casios environmental activities the company offered to participate in the cultivating of this endangered type of cherry tree
    for the purpose of preserving the variety and beautifying the landscape around the plant kofu casio received a donation of trees from
    tamahocho now chuo city in 2004 and over the three subsequent years the company planted more than 30 otoguro cherry trees all
    the transplanted trees took root and every spring they provide a beautiful display of blossoms for people to enjoy on the grounds of the

    the opinion presented here was written based on the content of this report website version and interviews
    with casio personnel responsible for environmental procurement human resources and csr initiatives
    casio is now at a stage where the plandocheckact pdca management cycle with a focus on reducing the
    companys environmental impact should be used to expand csr initiatives groupwide


     commendable efforts by casio

     regarding its medium to longterm environmental management policy casio has set greenhouse gas targets for fiscal 2021 and 2051
     with the aim of helping to realize a lowcarbon society the fact that the company received product of the year a new award
     established by eco mark in fiscal 2012 shows that the company is putting its policies into practice in addition to efforts within the group
     and supply chain i have strong expectations that casio will develop initiatives that cover the entire product lifecycle including the
     customer stage such as providing instructions on optimal product usage and improving the recycling rate at the time of disposal as well
     as disclose information on the progress of those initiatives
     as an initiative to improve supplier csr casio conducted a questionnaire using a fivepoint scale on issues such as reducing
     environmental impact and protecting the human rights of employees and responses were received from 178 suppliers by providing
     feedback on the results and making audit visits to some suppliers casio sought to ascertain and quantify the situation of csr at its
     suppliers in the future i recommend that casio ask suppliers to provide objective proof for the grounds for their selfassessment of
     initiatives and work towards making the specific measures and issues even more readily visible i also hope that casio will further
     advance its system for sharing effective measures giving awards to outstanding suppliers and fostering communication to solve
     problems


     points for improvement while commending progress to date

     as part of the csr promotion system  it is admirable that casios csr committee has established nine initiative themes however the
     theme targets will not bring casio up to a strategic level to realize the companys desired position several years from now therefore it is
     strongly advisable that casio set targets based on the global economy and the trends at competitors particularly for globalization in the
     human resources division and the utilization of human resources diversity while verifying issues and putting measures into practice
     based on clear indicator setting
     regarding the fostering of a csr culture throughout the group it is commendable that casio maintains a csr series in its inhouse
     magazine casio in the future i hope that csr messages from senior management will be issued frequently and that they will be
     translated into multiple languages and distributed to casio sites around the world i urge casio to make active use of the inhouse
     magazine and social network services in order to increase opportunities for ensuring that employees on the frontlines at headquarters
     and at sites around the world get a rapid and detailed understanding of the companys initiatives
     thanks to efforts to create more supportive workplaces for employees 472 of employees made use of casios leave and reduced
     working hours programs for childcare and nursing care with an expected increase in employees that continue to work while caring for a
     family member at home the company needs to provide more opportunities for users of these programs to share their awareness of issues
     and how they overcame them

points for improvement

concerning the utilization and improvement of human resources diversity throughout the group it is essential that casio promote further
globalization in future business development looking at the entire group ten years from now there should be a portfolio of global human
resources that can move across divisional and company boundaries a global human resources officer needs to be appointed who can
oversee and promote employee hiring training and exchange human resources databases should also be constructed for a
comprehensive picture of staff in each country using efforts such as these casio is strongly recommended to create systems and
strategies for the active utilization of human resources diversity as a truly global company
in the area of employing persons with disabilities casios performance for the consolidated group in japan fell below the legally
mandated rate of employment although the reason as the transfer of a group company as i have pointed out before casio must promote
community creation efforts based on disability and job types again i strongly urge the company to continue making workplaces more
supportive
regarding the environmental impact reduction data in this report it is commendable that details are provided on the principal sites in and
outside japan including group companies my hope however would be that casio will continue to increase the level of accuracy of group
reporting not only for environmental data but also for personnel and procurement initiatives and data
