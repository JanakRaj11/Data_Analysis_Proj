dear shareholders
dear business partners and tenants
dear sir or madam




                              business with real estate could be assumed to be inherently sustainable due to
                              its longterm planning horizons a property is normally used over a number of
                              years even in the commercial sector additionally the social and energyrelated
                              aspects of the running costs and potential usage of a property are of great
                              significance

                              contemporary sustainable property management involves far more than the
                              compilation of economic ecological and social data and gradually improving
                              them in line with a plan this is due to a factor that in its current form is new to
                              property markets  flexibilisation brought about by the underlying changes in the
                              worlds of work and commerce property markets have become significantly more
                              flexible and therefore unpredictable

                              with an even greater sense of priority this raises more questions in connection
                              with the properties in our portfolio and potential acquisitions that have always
                              been important to us as a qualityoriented portfolio and asset manager


                                   will the location of the property still be in demand in ten years
                                   how can our properties still serve the utilisation concepts of tenants
                                     in the long term
                                    will
                                         it be possible to manage the building itself profitably in 20 years

                              in the future we aim to address these and similar issues in more depth and
                              ensure that we remain on track

                              the publication of this sustainability report should underline our intentions it
                              should signal that we aim to report on our longterm strategy regularly and
                              transparently for our shareholders and partners by adhering to the relevant
                              sustainability reporting standards we are also making ourselves comparable with
                              the rest of the sector we are publishing this sustainability report on a voluntary
                              basis  as due to our number of employees  we will not be subject to the eu

outlook and targets

we see sustainability reports less as
reflections of what we have achieved
in the previous year and more as reflections
of our progress towards our targets
they show us what we have done already
and allow us to identify room for
improvement we want to tap this
potential with clear targets
