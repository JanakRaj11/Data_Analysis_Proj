      l assess the suitability of the criteria for reporting in relation to their relevance completeness reliability neutrality and understandability
        taking into consideration if relevant industry standards
      l verify the implementation of the process for the collection compilation processing and control for completeness and consistency of the
        csr information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the csr information
      we determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the csr information in relation
      to the characteristics of the company its social and environmental issues its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry
      best practices
      for the csr information which we considered the most important1
      l at the level of the consolidated entity we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative
        information organization policies actions etc we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified on a
        test basis the calculations and the compilation of the information and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other
        information presented in the management report
      l at the level of the representative selection of sites that we selected2 based on their activity their contribution to the consolidated
        indicators their location and a risk analysis we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook
        detailed tests on the basis of samples consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation the
        sample selected therefore represented on average 5 of the fixedterm contract and permanent contract personnel and between 8
        and 14 of the quantitative environmental information
      for the other consolidated csr information we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company
      finally we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided if appropriate in the partial or total absence of certain information
      we consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to
      express a limited assurance conclusion an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work due to the
      necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system the
      risk of nondetection of a significant anomaly in the csr information cannot be entirely eliminated

      conclusion
      based on our work we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the csr information taken together
      has not been fairly presented in compliance with the criteria
      observations
      without qualifying our conclusion above we draw your attention to the fact that methodological changes presented in section  26

          water used for consumption and water used for cooling and restituted to the environment schneider electric plans to expand this
          differential reporting to all sites concerned
      4 from 2013 only the sites that emit more than 1000 kg of voc per year are reporting as well as some smaller sites on a voluntary basis
      5 the co2 emissions linked to energy consumption are considered estimates because the indirect emissions are calculated on the

          l the composition of the board which includes 71 independent directors within the meaning of the
            afepmedef code
          l the economic environment which requires responsiveness by the leadership and clarity in naming the person in
            charge of directing the group this clarification given by the use of the title of chairman président is
            particularly necessary visàvis employees customers and partners in france and abroad
          l provisions to ensure accurate information and effective functioning by the board of directors in particular the
            appointment of an vicechairman independent lead director the principle of holding an executive session at
            each meeting of the board presided by the vicechairman independent lead director and the creation of four
            board committees
          l the requirement for the board to deliberate each year on the unification of the functions of chairman and chief
            executive officer
