                                     fiscal 2013 we are working to improve safety and health management and curtail
                                     minor and major accidents by further expanding and bolstering the measures carried
                                     out in the previous fiscal year
                                           one example of our efforts in this area is the introduction of a patrol relay system
                                     to generate a variety of perspectives on workplace conditions these patrols by the

                                     our employees by promoting worklife balance as we have in previous fiscal years
                                     kajima continued offering courses to educate employees on managing work hours
                                     and taking leave in order to further reduce overtime hours and encourage more

                                     introduced elearning training courses designed to prevent harassment
                                           kajima has developed engineer training programs for each engineering profession
                                     and also conducts themebased training as needed across professions in particular
                                     as intellectual property law has become more stringent in recent years kajima has
                                     added content addressing this issue to all of the professionspecific programs

     kajima has operations in 1900 locations across japan although the head office and
     branch offices have mostly been at the same locations for many years the offices at
     construction sites only remain temporarily until each project is completed compared
     to the ordinary finished buildings the construction offices have a very short existence
     nevertheless each site office strives to support the local community as much as possible
