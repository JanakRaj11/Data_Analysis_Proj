for several consecutive years reflecting recent poor financial
performance the group has reduced the amounts paid out
in incentives to staff at the end of 2015 a large portion of
the groups senior management left the bank as part of our
restructuring the successful execution of our strategy over the
coming years will rely on the dedication and commitment of the
remaining staff who are highly sought after by our competition
it is therefore important that we pay competitively while
maintaining the discipline of only rewarding good performance
and good behaviours the groups remuneration decisions
have been made in light of these factors accordingly the
annual incentive payments for 2015 are down by 22 per cent
yearonyear with no payments to the executive directors for
2015 since 2011 annual incentives have fallen by 41 per cent
the successful execution of our strategy will allow us to improve
shareholder returns significantly from a strengthened capital
base to help drive this outcome the group has introduced a
new longterm incentive plan for our senior management staff
including the management team we believe it is right that our
most senior staff are not rewarded for the performance in 2015
but clearly incentivised to execute our strategy and to create
real sustained shareholder value the value of the plan will only
pay out if the group has made substantial progress towards
our returns and other strategic objectives by 2018 we believe
that this will link closely the remuneration of the groups senior
management to the value generated for shareholders specific
proposals in relation to executive directors will be presented to
shareholders for their approval at the annual general meeting
on 4 may

summary
there remains a broad range of macroeconomic uncertainties
and challenges in the global economy including the rebalancing
of chinas economy the impact of lower commodity prices and
ongoing geopolitical tensions while we cannot control many
of these developments you should expect us to continue to
reduce our sensitivity to adverse trends while we support our
clients and invest in improving the groups systems staff
resources and processes in part so that we can be a leading
force in the fight against financial crime

manufacturing sector which is facing pressure but we think        growing in the world
this misses the bigger picture of chinas economic rebalancing
the services sector which now contributes more than
50 per cent of chinas gdp is robust
following the rate hike in december 2015 we expect no further
fed rate increases in 2016 making the fed tightening cycle very
shallow we expect the fed funds rate to peak at 05 per cent
by the first quarter of 2016 lower than the market anticipates
and for the fed to cut rates again in late 2016 as us growth
slows this suggests that beyond the initial period when markets
reprice risk interesting opportunities will arise for investors
meanwhile we expect oil prices to stay low in the first half
of 2016 before rising in the second half due to nonopec
production constraints low oil prices in the near term should
boost growth in all the major economies including the us

investment securities
investment securities rose by 25 billion as we repositioned

highlyrated corporate debt securities the maturity profile of
these assets is largely consistent with prior years with over
40 per cent of the book having a residual maturity of less
than 12 months

notional values decreased compared to 2014 as client demand
for interest rate hedging declined as a result the unrealised
positive marktomarket positions were 27 billion lower at
63 billion the marktomarket was also impacted by an
increased charge in respect of credit and funding valuation
adjustments as we adapted our approach to reflect changing
market practices the groups risk positions continue to be
largely balanced resulting in a corresponding increase in
negative marktomarket positions of the 63 billion markto
market positions 39 billion was available for offset due to
master netting agreements

deposits
customer accounts fell 55 billion or 13 per cent and deposits
by banks fell 17 billion reflecting lower liquidity requirements
as we reduced assets and exited highercost time deposits
across a number of markets casa continues to be the core
of the customer deposit base constituting 54 per cent of
customer deposits

debt securities in issue subordinated liabilities
and other borrowed funds
debt securities in issue and subordinated debt fell 13 billion
compared to december 2014 largely due to lower levels
of shortdated securities reflecting the reduced funding
requirements subordinated liabilities reduced 1 billion largely
due to exchange rate fluctuations

equity
total shareholders equity was 18 billion higher at
485 billion reflecting the 33 billion rights issue 51 billion
and the issuance of 2 billion of additional tier 1 instruments
during the period offset by the loss for the year of 22 billion
dividend payments net of scrip of 09 billion and the negative
impact of foreign currency translation of 23 billion

time commitment
we expect our independent nonexecutive directors to commit
sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities in general
we estimate that each independent nonexecutive director
spent approximately 35 to 50 days on boardrelated duties
and considerably more for those who chair or are members
of multiple committees this years strategy discussions and
additional board meetings demonstrated the independent
nonexecutive directors ability to provide additional time
commitment at short notice when required

and advances goodwill impairment testing and valuation of          riskmanagement credentials and an indepth knowledge
financial instruments and the impact of the strategic review      of asian markets
the committee has also had deeper discussions on the
enhancements to specific areas of the groups control
environment and the groups compliance under the
requirements of the volcker rule this report also sets out how
the committee reached a position whereby it was satisfied that
the disclosures made in the annual report and accounts meet
                                                                    naguib kheraj

made by the board and how the committee has satisfied itself
as to the quality of the audits conducted by the groups
statutory auditors and by its group internal audit function
the committee has also spent time discussing the control
environment and operational risk there is an overlap between
the work of the audit committee and the board risk
committee while the board risk committee has considered
issues relating to operational risk management the audit
committee has considered the issues from a practical point
of view to gain greater insight into the lessons learned from
operational risk the information provided by group internal
audit has been refined so as to increase the concentration on
actions being taken to address weaknesses and ensuring that
there is clear accountability for actions required to be followed
up to close audit findings one of the observations made as
part of the 2014 committee effectiveness review was that in
discussing audit findings explanation tended to be provided
by those in control functions rather than line management
responsible for the activity during 2015 this has been
addressed by inviting line management to be present when
issues are being discussed so as to enable greater engagement
between operational management and the audit committee

in 2015 the group spent 88 million on nonaudit services
provided by kpmg
the groups policy on the award of nonaudit services to
auditors the policy explicitly states that the auditors should
only be used when there is evidence that there is no alternative
in terms of quality and cost whether knowledge and experience
of the group is required to deliver an efficient and effective
solution or where they are required to be used by regulatory

linkages between the committee and subsidiary board
audit committees
while being mindful of the need to not adversely impact the
independence of the groups subsidiary audit committees
there are documented processes in place that define the
linkages between and roles of the audit committee and the
audit committees of subsidiary companies another way in
which the committee strives to ensure appropriate linkages
between the committee and the groups subsidiary audit
committees is by holding an annual call hosted by naguib as
committee chair and attended by the chairs of the subsidiary
audit committees in 2015 the group head of internal audit
group head of legal and compliance deputy group chief
financial officer and lead audit partner of the groups statutory
auditor also participated on the call this call provides the
opportunity to share among other things the committees
priorities for the year ahead and to discuss ways in which the
linkages between the subsidiary audit committees and the
committee can be further strengthened and enhanced without
comprising independence

ongoing training and development
as detailed on page 74 and as part of the independent
nonexecutive director engagement and ongoing development
plans for those independent nonexecutive directors who are
members of the committee a joint session was held with the
board risk committee on credit valuation adjustment and
prudential valuation adjustment

committee effectiveness review
in keeping with the approach to committee effectiveness
reviews adopted by other board committees in 2015 an
internally facilitated effectiveness review was conducted
this review facilitated by group corporate secretariat
involved each committee member providing their thoughts
on the committees effectiveness the feedback was then
formally discussed by the committee and an action plan
designed to address the key observations

board diversity policy
the board remains committed to its board diversity policy

which includes our general approach to diversity and
specifically sets out the intention to increase the representation
of women on the standard chartered plc board to 25 per cent
by 2017 while we set out our clear ambition in respect to
gender representation the policy is intended to ensure that
diversity in its broadest sense remains a central feature of the
board reaching this objective remains front of mind while
ensuring that all appointments continue to be made on merit
with the prime consideration of maintaining and enhancing the
boards overall effectiveness we believe that a highly effective
board is about chemistry and the right behaviours underpinned
by robust processes the board comprises individuals who
have diverse skills knowledge and experiences that combine
to provide different perspectives
     to review our board diversity policy visit sccom


the committee made good progress in overseeing plans
to achieve its gender diversity objective as a result of both a
reduction in the overall size of the board and the appointment
in april 2015 of gay huey evans and jasmine whitbread
despite the retirement of ruth markland from the board at the
end of december 2015 the representation of women on the
board has increased from 11 per cent at the end of 2014 to
20 per cent at 23 february 2016
the committee will consider the board diversity policy in the
lead up to 2017 to assess its progress and in light of lord
davies recent fiveyear summary report on the representation
of women of ftse 100 boards we are mindful of the
recommendation that voluntary targets be increased to
33 per cent by 2020
the representation of women on the new management team
the most senior leadership positions in the group below the
board is very encouraging at 33 per cent
in making recommendations for appointment to the board the
committee supported the search firms voluntary code of
conduct the committee worked with lygon group and russell
reynolds associates during the year both search firms are
signatories to the voluntary code of conduct and are committed
to supporting us in achieving our objectives and wider board
composition ambitions

remuneration


qa on our new directors remuneration policy
why are you changing the policy
the group has set out a clear strategy with a comprehensive set of actions to improve returns we want to incentivise the new
executive director team to deliver the new strategy it is also impractical to meet the new pra regulatory requirements within
the existing policy
as a consequence we have reviewed our directors remuneration policy and intend to propose a new policy at our agm in
may 2016 the policy will increase simplicity transparency and longterm focus in the structure of directors remuneration

how does the new policy support the strategy
the targets for both the annual incentive and the ltip will be a combination of financial and strategic measures linked to the new
strategy this approach will ensure executive directors are incentivised to deliver the strategy both in the shortterm and over the
longer term

what are the key features of the new policy
 incentivises executive directors to deliver the new strategy and improve shareholder returns
 overall variable remuneration opportunity remains unchanged at 200 per cent of fixed remuneration
 increases longterm focus at least 60 per cent of variable remuneration subject to longterm performance measures
 ensures the policy is in line with changing regulatory requirements
 provides transparency to key decisions made by the committee including how annual incentives are determined using an
  annual scorecard and the vesting of ltip awards based on threeyear performance measures
 performance assessed on both short and longterm basis
how will the policy be implemented
reflecting the groups circumstances the committee will focus incentives on the ltip over a multiyear period during the early
years of the turnaround
the ltip opportunity will be higher in the early years of the policy and always higher than the annual incentive opportunity
ie 200 per cent of fixed remuneration in 2015 160 per cent in 2016 and 120 per cent for 2017 onwards
this approach ensures executive directors are incentivised to deliver the strategy and are aligned with longterm returns for
shareholders while allowing for the reintroduction of annual performance measures to ensure shortterm performance is also
robustly managed

what awards are being made now
given the groups financial performance the committee decided that there would be no payment of annual incentives for 2015
to incentivise the new executive director team and align them with the turnaround the committee recommended a 201618 ltip
award of 200 per cent of fixed remuneration under the proposed policy
the ltip will be a share award subject to forwardlooking performance measures measured over three years ie for may 2016
awards performance will be measured over 201618 inclusive the vesting will be over seven years 50 per cent after three years
and the balance evenly over four to seven years shares will be subject to a sixmonth holding period after vesting

directors remuneration policy



consideration of shareholder views
the committee chair maintains regular contact with the groups major shareholders about remuneration and ensures the
committee is kept informed of their views
in light of the outcome of the vote on the directors remuneration policy at the agm in may 2014 the committee sought to address
shareholders concerns in relation to that policy their feedback was reflected in the committees decisions in relation to how
variable remuneration was delivered in 2014 and how the policy was operated in 2015 for example by introducing a new
scorecard and increasing the proportion of variable remuneration subject to performance measures
since the agm in may 2015 the committee has continued to consult with shareholders representing over half of the share register
and meeting representative bodies and proxy voting bodies with a view to introducing a new directors remuneration policy once
the regulatory position was clearer shareholders feedback has been reflected in the new remuneration policy in particular by
ensuring the variable remuneration structure is simpler and reflects longterm performance
the committee did not consult with employees when determining the directors remuneration policy the committee reviews
annually the remuneration trends across the group including the relationship between executive directors remuneration and the
remuneration of other group employees the committee oversees the remuneration structures for material risktakers and works
with the human resources team to ensure consistency of approach throughout the group and compliance with relevant
legislation and regulation

remuneration approach on recruitment of an executive director
the groups approach to remuneration reflects the fact that many of its employees bring international experience and expertise
and that the group recruits from a global marketplace the committees approach to recruitment is to pay competitive
remuneration that reflects the groups international nature and enables it to attract and retain candidates

2015 report on remuneration



2015 group total variable remuneration
determining 2015 discretionary annual incentives
in determining 2015 annual incentives the committee considered the following factors
 recognition that the groups financial performance in 2015 has been poor and as a consequence the share price has suffered
  and the dividend cut in november 2015 the group chief executive set out the groups new strategy with the intention of
  addressing the declining performance the group has taken a comprehensive range of actions including raising capital
  reducing risk concentrations managing expenses and laying out a business investment programme
 that the historical remuneration levels of the group have generally been below competitive levels in the markets in which it
  operates and that this position has deteriorated further over the past few years this has in part contributed to a rise in the level
  of voluntary attrition to 167 per cent 2014 151 per cent
 the need to reposition remuneration in the group to contribute to improving shareholder returns whilst enabling the group
  to ensure that good performers are paid competitively
 the material risk events that have impacted the group in 2015
in determining the groups total annual incentives the committee has had to use its judgement to establish the right balance
between the financial performance of the group and our ability to attract and retain talent that will drive the groups new strategy
on this basis the committee determined that the total annual incentives for continuing employees for 2015 should be 855 million
22 per cent lower than in 2014 as shown below the committee concluded that any lower amount would present a material risk

reduced over the past five years

for at least nine months of the year totalling 45 million

relative expenditure on pay and allocation of earnings
when considering group variable remuneration the committee considers shareholders concerns about relative expenditure
on pay and makes the determination on the allocation of earnings to expenditure on pay carefully the committee concluded
that the group has approached this allocation in a disciplined way over the past five years

executive directors variable remuneration awarded in respect of 2015 audited
approach to determining individual variable remuneration awards
the committees performance management framework was outlined in the 2014 directors remuneration report at its meetings
in december 2015 and january 2016 the committee considered group performance the performance of each executive director
and risk and controlrelated matters with input from group risk and other control functions and made its determinations
the committee followed a threestep process for determining annual incentive awards
step 1 consider eligibility
step 2 evaluate performance against the groups priorities
step 3 assess personal performance and finalise annual incentive and ltip awards for each executive director

1 consider eligibility
the committee considered the groups risk position and its forwardlooking capital position and concluded that it was appropriate
to consider the granting of incentives

2 evaluate performance against the groups priorities
at the end of 2015 the committee reviewed both financial performance and achievement against the groups strategic priorities
as outlined at the start of the year in the 2015 annual incentive scorecard published in last years remuneration report the
committees assessment of performance against the targets is disclosed in the table on page 117
in relation to financial performance the committee concluded that the financial performance had been poor and did not meet the
expectations set at the start of the year the committee noted that progress had been made against the strategic aspirations and
the other group priorities
however in light of the groups broader performance the committee concluded that it would not be appropriate to award annual
incentives in 2015 to executive directors but that there was a need to incentivise the new executive director team so ltip awards
should be granted subject to shareholder approval of the proposed remuneration policy

noted that both had supported the transition to the new organisation positively and were professional in terms of the handover
to their successors under the terms of his leaving agreement v shankar was not eligible to be considered for a discretionary
variable remuneration award

1 normalised roe will be based on profit attributed to ordinary shareholders adjusted on a taxaffected basis for profits or losses of a capital nature amounts consequent to
   investment transactions driven by strategic intent and infrequentexceptional transactions that are significant or material in the context of the groups normal business earnings
   for the period this includes material oneoff changes to valuation methodologies to align with market practice and restructuring charges normalised roe would normally
   exclude regulatory fines but for remuneration purposes this would be subject to review by the remuneration committee

the measures have been chosen to align with the new strategy and in consultation with shareholders the equal weighting of the
measures provides a balanced set of metrics giving an appropriate focus on execution of the new strategy investor interests and
prudent risktaking
the target levels for ltip awards are designed to be challenging but realistic the committees starting point for determining target
levels was to review the financial plan and the groups strategic priorities
as part of the remuneration policy review and setting of performance measures the peer group used for the calculation of the
relative tsr performance measure has been adjusted the criteria used to select the peer group are companies with generally
comparable business activities comparable size or geographic spread to standard chartered or companies standard chartered
competes against for investor funds and talent in aggregate the comparator group is intended to be representative of standard
chartereds geographic presence and business operations the constituents of the peer group shall continue to be reviewed
annually as a result of this review the following changes were made to the peer group listed on page 122
 rbs and unicredit were removed from the peer group
 anz which has growing presence in asian markets and ubs which has significant corporate  institutional private and
   wealth businesses were added

new executive directors and former executive directors remuneration
recruitment arrangements for bill winters
in may 2015 bill winters joined the group and was appointed as the new group chief executive with effect from 10 june 2015
in line with market practice and as would be expected in the recruitment of a senior individual of this nature the remuneration
package included a buyout of share interests foregone by bill in order to take up employment with the group
the committees approach in structuring the remuneration package including the buyout award was to ensure that the structure
was in accordance with the groups policy on recruitment of an executive director furthermore the committee ensured that
careful judgement was applied on where to position the group relative to international banking peers so that bills remuneration
was competitive reflected his individual experience and was appropriate for such a role
each of the elements of bills ongoing remuneration package are summarised in the table below followed by a description of his
buyout award

      element                        details

      salary                         1757335


      fixed pay allowances           1757335 paid in shares released over five years

      benefits                       will be provided in accordance with the remuneration policy

      pension                        40 per cent of salary

      variable remuneration          maximum variable remuneration opportunity of up to 200 per cent of fixed remuneration
                                     no provisions for any guaranteed annual incentive or guaranteed variable remuneration amount in respect
                                     of 2015 were included in bills remuneration package
                                     the absence of any guaranteed variable remuneration amount has enabled the committee to retain the
                                     flexibility on the determination of the amount and structure of variable remuneration payable to him for 2015

on joining bill suffered an immediate loss in value by way of share interests foregone at his previous employer it was agreed
that bills entitlement to a buyout award would be limited in his contract to the lower of i an award with a maximum value of
993 million and ii the value foregone at his previous employer
the terms of his buyout award were then determined following his appointment to the board giving careful consideration of the
value foregone at his previous employer the group undertook a thorough process to quantify the value of the share interests
forfeited which determined that the value foregone was in excess of 993 million as such the committee approved a restricted
share award of 993 million as at the date of grant 22 september 2015 the maximum agreed under the joining arrangements



122     standard chartered annual report 2015                                    contents          previous page           back                forward

although the value foregone by bill was an actual immediate and measurable loss in value suffered by him it was determined that
the buyout award would be granted in the form of restricted shares vesting in three equal portions after two three and four years
the restricted shares will lapse if bill ceases employment with the group prior to the relevant vesting dates other than in limited
eligible leaver circumstances this approach provides alignment with shareholders and retention on the basis that no performance
measures applied to the shares constituting the value foregone by bill no performance measures were attached to the vesting of
the restricted shares
as a result of the analysis carried out prior to the grant of the buyout award the committee was satisfied that the buyout award
was significantly lower in value than the value of the share interests foregone at bills previous employer

2016 annual incentive scorecard
the measures in the scorecard have been determined to be aligned with the groups strategy and in consultation with shareholders
the targets are set annually by the committee and take into account the groups annual financial plan and its priorities for the next
few years within the context of the economic environment the committee considers such targets to be commercially sensitive
and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the group to disclose them before the end of the financial year targets will be
disclosed in the 2016 directors remuneration report alongside the actual level of performance achieved
the committee will review the scorecard annually and may vary the measures weightings and targets each year

                                       circumstances to apply malus and clawback at its discretion

      sharesave                       sharesave is an all employee plan where participants are able to open a savings contract to fund
                                       the exercise of an option over shares
                                      the option price is set at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the share price at the date of invitation
                                       or such other discount as may be determined by the committee
                                      an equivalent cash or share plan is offered in countries where sharesave may not be offered
                                       typically due to tax regulatory or securities law issues

competitive level of fixed pay reflecting the skills and experience of the individual while complying with the variable remuneration
requirements introduced by regulators the committee reviewed their use in light of revised regulatory guidance in 2015 and
from 1 january 2016 fpas have been eliminated other than for executive directors in total these amounted to 28 million in 2015

approach to risk adjustment at an individual level
at an individual level risk adjustment can potentially be applied through the following expost adjustments
 proportion of variable remuneration delivered in the form of deferred awards in 2015 the group considers the balance of
  variable remuneration which was deferred and not deferred as well as ensuring senior employees take a longerterm view
  expost adjustments are effective because appropriate levels of deferral apply
 performance adjustment potential diminution in the value of any deferred variable remuneration award through nonvesting

pension risk unaudited
pension risk is the potential for loss due to having to meet an
actuarially assessed shortfall in the groups pension schemes
standard chartered offers defined contribution pension plans
for new hires in most locations and only maintains defined
benefit plans where required by law contract or for closed
groups of longserving employees the group monitors and
manages both the pension financial risks stemming from its
legacy defined benefit schemes and the operational and
reputational risks of all its pension arrangements in doing
this the group has primary regard to its capital position and
the relative costs and benefits of reducing or removing its
risk exposure
the groups primary pension risk measures are updates
at least quarterly of the accounting balance sheet position
the 1in200 year stress test required annually by the pra and
the funding position of the uk fund over 60 per cent of the
groups pension liabilities the group mitigates pension risk via
a group pension risk policy which requires all new plans to be
defined contribution where possible and mandates standards
around investments benefit changes funding documentation
actuarial valuations accounts and auditing adherence to these
standards is assured by an annual governance review
the group pension risk committee is the body responsible
for governance of pension risk and it receives its authority from
the group risk committee from 2016 the risk control owner
of pension risk will assume these responsibilities directly

strategic risk unaudited
strategic risk is the potential for opportunity loss from failure
to optimise the earnings potential of the groups franchise




                                                                             review

opportunity losses could arise because a business decision
does not deliver the expected profit and returns or because
a decision is not taken which leads to lost opportunities
strategic risk can give rise to differences in the groups
earnings as compared with market expectations and competitor
performance this can significantly impact the groups share
price if strategic risks materialise we have the ability to take
mitigating actions by adapting execution of the strategy andor
managing the groups capital position
as the ultimate governance body for the group the board
challenges the groups strategy and highlights potential
underlying risks the global head of strategy is the risk control
owner for strategic risk given that strategic risk primarily arises
from the failure to make well made and timely decisions
strategic risk is managed where decisions are made the
regional country and segment ceos and the heads of
functions are responsible for the identification of strategic risks
group level strategic risks are systematically reviewed during
the groups annual strategy review process and followup
deep dives throughout the year on topics agreed with the
board a major group level strategic review was undertaken
in 2015 execution of the strategic plan is managed through
the groups performance management process

2 our assessment of the risks of material misstatement
the starting point for our audit was a consideration of the inherent risks to the groups business model and how these have been mitigated
this included understanding the strength of the groups capital and liquidity position the diversification of its asset and the flexibility and tenor
of its balance sheet
we assessed and challenged the inherent risks with reference to
 international monetary fund imf economic forecasts and commentary
 the perspectives of our incountry audit teams on their local economies particularly the banking sector
 the views of our specialists in a number of areas including bank regulation it tax and financial crime prevention
 the views of the prudential regulatory authority pra and regulators in other key geographies
 the results of the pras stress tests published on 1 december 2015
 the groups budgets regular forecasts stress testing reporting to the audit board risk and group risk committees and the many
  discussions we have with senior management of the group as well as country management teams
following the new strategic plan announced in november 2015 we evaluated its impact on our audit approach and the inherent risks that were
identified at the planning stage earlier in the year
we also considered the groups control environment and in particular whether its systems were processing transactions completely and
faithfully and included appropriate controls designed to prevent fraud our work included testing the key controls over the processing of
transactions and the key intersystem bank and custodial reconciliations as well as trade confirmations
finally we considered the potential impact of regulatory investigations see pages 201 to 203 on the group including considering the views
of the groups external and internal counsel
these assessments enabled us to form a judgement on going concern and to determine the key areas of financial statement risk on which
our audit should be focused thereafter by looking at both broad risk themes across the group and particular concerns in specific geographies
and businesses we were then able to calibrate our work to financial statement risk more precisely

3 risks and response
the principal procedures we performed over these significant risks were as follows
impairment of loans and advances
risk and areas of focus
the risk is that the carrying value of loans and advances to banks and customers held at amortised costs may be misstated
refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements in note 1 the audit committee report on pages 79 to 84 and managements
commentary on the disclosures of credit risk on pages 161 to 186
summary areas of focus
 indian corporate  institutional clients and commercial clients loan exposures due to the slow progress in policy reforms and increased
  refinancing pressures
 chinese corporate  institutional clients and commercial clients loan exposures due to the slowdown and rebalancing of the economy
   and the devaluation of renminbi rmb
 commodities and related exposures as commodity and oil prices continue to decline
 commercial client exposures particularly due to certain exposures to rmb in china slowdown in india and the sensitivity of the exposure
   to decreases in commodity prices
 liquidation portfolio due to the judgement required to assess a price at which the group could sell impaired loans
with regard to the groups retail portfolio in south korea which we identified as a focus area in 2014 the risk of losses has continued to reduce
in 2015 partly as a result of reduced claims by customers to restructure debt accompanied by continued portfolio reduction accordingly it has
not been an audit focus area in 2015
                                                                                                                                                            and notes
                                                                                                                                                            financial statements
india
the group has reduced its india exposures to 30 billion at 31 december 2015 2014 35 billion the slowdown observed in 2014 has continued
into 2015 and the macroeconomic backdrop continues to be challenging with slow progress in reforms which were promised by the new
government in 2014 continued high indebtedness in some sectors and tightening in refinancing by local banks consequently impairments have
risen significantly in 2015 mainly driven by counterparties who were already stressed in 2014 present on either early alert or in credit grades
12 to 14 in addition there was also a change in underlying assumptions regarding prospects of recovery on available collateral due to the
challenging market conditions and recent experience from recoveries on impaired accounts
additionally there has also been an increase in impairments as a result of the new strategic plan announced in november 2015 whereby a small
number of impaired exposures have now been identified to be in the liquidation portfolio where additional impairment was taken based on
discounting revised cash flow projections based on expected sales value
china
china exposures amount to 50 billion 2014 71 billion and the group has continued to take riskmitigating actions in this portfolio this has
resulted in the commodities and related exposures in china reducing and exposure to banks reducing to 239 billion 2014 345 billion china
remained a challenging market with growth slowing to 69 per cent in 2015 from 73 per cent in 2014 continued rmb devaluation against the us
dollar and volatility in chinese equity markets in particular the group experienced increased losses within the commercial clients portfolio as
counterparties struggled with increased levels of debt lower commodity prices and the rmb devaluation

commodities and related exposures
the group continued to take riskmitigation actions during the year commodities and related exposures have reduced to 54 billion 2014
706 billion comprising 203 billion of traders 193 billion of producers including 96 billion of oil and gas producers 59 billion
of petroleum refineries 70 billion of support activities and 15 billion of other corporate clients with oil and gasrelated hedges
the sustained fall in commodity prices including oil price has impacted a number of the groups customers and translated into increased
impairments for the year the majority of these impairments have arisen from customers who were already stressed in 2014
it should be noted that a fall in commodity prices may not necessarily result in a pervasive adverse impact on the entire commodities and related
exposures but may impact certain pockets that are more exposed to a sustained fall in prices for example energy producers and some
oil support services
commercial
the total commercial clients loan portfolio of 112 billion 2014 147 billion is a small portfolio representing 3 per cent 2014 4 per cent of total
loans and advances however the impairment charge on this portfolio increased to 599 million in 2015 from 212 million in 2014 mainly due to
increased impairments in india china africa and korea
the group has also revised its assumptions regarding recovery rates on impaired exposures downward leading to higher impairment this is
mainly based on recent recovery experience and more stressed market conditions
liquidation portfolio
as part of the announcement of the new strategic plan in november 2015 the group identified 79 billion of loans which were outside
the groups risk tolerance levels and plan to liquidate this portfolio this included 75 billion of gross nonperforming which carries a provision
of 35 billion 968 million of this provision was taken for a small number of counterparties where the recovery was based on discounting revised
cash flow projections based on expected sales values
our response
overview
corporate  institutional clients commercial clients private banking clients and loans and advances to banks collectively larger clients
represents 71 per cent 233 billion of the groups net loan exposure while retail clients represent 29 per cent 95 billion the larger clients
exposure comprises larger loans that are monitored individually based on the knowledge of each individual borrower however the retail clients
exposure comprises much smaller value loans to a much greater number of customers accordingly loans are not monitored on an individual
basis but are grouped by product into homogeneous exposures exposures are then monitored through delinquency statistics which also drive
the assessment of loan loss provisions
procedures performed
our audit procedures in all inscope components included
 for both larger clients and retail clients our incountry teams used their local knowledge to assess the trends in their local credit
  environments and considered the likely impact on the groups exposures to focus their testing on key risk areas
 for larger clients our procedures included
   testing the key controls over the credit grading and monitoring process to assess if the risk grades allocated to counterparties were
    appropriate and loans were appropriately identified on a timely basis into early alert or credit grades 12 to 14
   performing credit assessments of all loans with a carrying value above 40 million in credit grades 12 13 and 14 see pages 172 and 173
    and loans above 75 million on the groups early alert report see page 209 together with a selection of other loans selected by country
    teams based on local materiality levels for these selected loans we assessed the reasonableness of the forecast of recoverable cash flows
    realisation of collateral and other possible sources of repayment we compared key assumptions to progress against business plans and
    our own understanding of the relevant industries and business environments we also compared them where possible to externally derived
    evidence such as commodity prices business performance and real estate valuations
   substantive testing of a selection of credit grade one to 11 counterparties in each scoped component to test the appropriateness of the
    credit grade
 for retail clients the impairment process is based on projecting losses based on the prior historical payment performance of each client
  adjusted for current market conditions our procedures included
   testing the accuracy of the key inputs into the models
   for a selection of models using our own valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of the impairment calculation methodology
    and reviewing the results of the groups validation of such models
   where model adjustments were made to reflect recent loss experience and current market conditions we assessed the appropriateness
    of such adjustments

 for portfolio impairment provision pip our procedures included
   testing the key management controls over the input of underlying data into the models
   using our modelling specialists to evaluate the methodology and the key assumptions used in determining the estimate for both the retail
    clients and the larger clients and wherever possible we compared the key assumptions used to externally available industry financial and
    economic data
   assessing the appropriateness of the emergence period and management adjustments to the output from models for changes in economic
    factors and specific risks to the exposure
   overall assessment and reasonableness of the pip balance with respect to the qualitative and quantitative changes in the underlying
    loan portfolio
 for the key underlying systems used for the processing of transactions we involved our information technology specialists to test a selection
  of automated controls within these systems we also tested the key controls over these underlying systems for example controls over access
  to systems and data and change management
 assessing whether the financial statement disclosures appropriately reflect the groups exposure to credit risk
 our additional procedures in the particular risk areas of the portfolio ie india commodities china and commercial exposure included
   reading managements own stress tests and riskmitigation actions to identify areas of focus
   extending our audit coverage over the stressed sectors and geographies and in particular to certain components within these portfolios
    for example infrastructure and telecoms in india as well as lowerrated oil producers within commodities and related exposures in doing so
    we focused on the grading of the counterparties assessed the quality of the ongoing portfolio monitoring controls the tenor of the debt and
    the rate at which counterparties were moving into early alert and credit grades 12 to 14
   increasing the extent of group audit team oversight over work done by the component team for example the senior statutory auditor
    visited greater china and her delegate visited india
 for the liquidation portfolio our additional procedures in respect of the impaired exposures involved assessing the key judgements relating
  to recovery namely the likely price and expected time to sell
valuation of financial instruments
risk and areas of focus
the risk is that the valuation of financial instruments may be misstated due to the application of valuation techniques which often involve the
exercise of judgement and the use of assumptions and estimates refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements in note 1 the audit
committee report on pages 79 to 84 and the disclosures of valuation risk in note 15
of the financial instruments that are held at fair value through profit and loss or as availableforsale in the groups balance sheet 985 per cent
2014 985 per cent qualified as being measured using level 1 or 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 december 2015 this means they
were valued using prices that were observable in the market place or through models with market observable inputs resulting in the valuation risk
being low however given the past experience of liquidity rapidly disappearing from emerging and developing markets it is important to ascertain
that prices are liquid enough to be genuinely observable in the market and this has been our focus for level 1 and 2 instruments the remaining
15 per cent 3 billion of financial instruments are classed as level 3 because significant pricing inputs to them are unobservable the
determination of these prices is inherently more subjective in 2015 the level 3 instruments mainly comprised unlisted private equity investments
and a small number of illiquid thinly traded loans debt securities and derivatives
the other notable change during the year related to valuation adjustments on derivatives whereby the group adopted a revised methodology
for calculating its estimate of the credit and funding valuation adjustments to be in line with market practice the revised methodology for credit
valuation adjustments uses marketimplied spreads for estimating loss rates rather than historical or internally modelled loss rates which were
used in the past further revised modelling capabilities were used to estimate the expected derivative exposures including the application              and notes
                                                                                                                                                         financial statements
of netting exposures on a counterpartylegal entityjurisdiction level the total adjustment for the year due to this change in estimate amounted
to 863 million
the audit risk lies in the main judgements in the calculation of this estimate those related to the modelling assumptions used in measuring
expected exposures of derivatives and the appropriateness of the proxies used for estimating loss rates for counterparties where directly
observable market spreads could not be obtained

our response
our audit procedures included
 testing of the groups controls over the identification measurement and management of valuation risk including independent price verification
  control governance over valuation models model validation and management reporting of valuation risk
 testing for a selection of pricing inputs used that they were externally sourced and were correctly input into pricing models
 using our valuation specialists to assess whether for a selection of models the model valuation methodology is appropriate
 valuing a selection of the groups debt securities and derivative positions independently using our valuation specialists and comparing their
  valuation to the groups valuation
 testing a selection of instruments to establish how many institutions contributed to pricing inputs and how wide the ranges of observable
  quotes were this allowed us to assess the liquidity of the prices for level 1 and 2 instruments
 assessing for a selection of investments within level 3 key inputs assumptions and models considering alternative valuation methods and
  sensitivities to key factors
 for the key underlying systems used for the processing of transactions in relation to financial instruments we involved our information
  technology specialists to test a selection of automated controls within these systems we also tested the key controls over these underlying
  systems for example controls over access to systems and data and change management
 particularly for level 3 we assessed whether the financial statement disclosures including sensitivity to key inputs appropriately reflect the
  groups exposure to financial instrument valuation risk
 we also performed a range of additional procedures on the credit and funding valuations adjustments which included
   using our valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of the methodology and to assess the key underlying models used
   checked a selection of counterparty exposures to assess whether these were appropriately netted in arriving at the final exposures
   checked that for a selection of counterparties directly observable spreads agreed to available market data
   for counterparties where proxies were used because directly observable spreads were not available we used our valuation specialists to
    evaluate the appropriateness of the methodology used for determining proxies and checked a selection of these to available market data
    for example sector proxies of relevant industries
impairment of goodwill
risk and areas of focus
the risk is that goodwill in the balance sheet may not be supported by the future cash flows of the underlying business refer to the critical
accounting estimates and judgements in note 1 the audit committee report on pages 79 to 84 and the disclosures of goodwill in note 25
preimpairment goodwill in the balance sheet is 41 billion but approximately 15 billion of this relates to businesses where postacquisition
growth in cash flows provides substantial headroom over the goodwill balance we regard these as low risk from a misstatement perspective
our work was therefore focused on the acquisitions where the headroom is lower amounting to 26 billion of goodwill or businesses which are
likely to be substantially impacted by the change in strategy announced in november 2015
our response
our audit procedures included
 we used our valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of the groups valuation approach and its derivation of discount rates we also
  compared the latter to external sources
 challenging the cash flow forecasts including confirming the internal consistency of assumptions and comparing them to progress against
  business plans and our knowledge of the local banking environment comparing forecasts to past performance and to gdp forecasts from the
  imf and assessing nonfinancial assumptions
 finally we assessed whether the financial statement disclosures including sensitivity to key inputs are appropriate
provision for redundancy and other restructuring costs
risk and areas of focus
the risk is that restructuring costs may not meet the relevant accounting standards criteria for recognition and therefore are inappropriately
recorded as costs in the period refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements in note 1 the audit committee on pages 79 to 84 and
the disclosures of restructuring costs in note 8
the group has recognised a number of impacts in the financial statements as a result of decisions linked to the new strategic plan announced
in november 2015 these impacts include redundancy and related expenses associated with enacted or committed headcount reductions
our response
our audit procedures included
 assessing the recognition of redundancy provisions required as a result of the staff reduction measures announced particularly to validate
  whether costs were recorded in the appropriate reporting period
 assessing the recognition of onerous lease contracts and other restructuring charges
 assessing the adequacy of disclosures contained within the financial statements

4 our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of the audit
the scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality we set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality these together with
qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate
the effect of misstatements both individually and on the financial statements as a whole
based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statement as a whole as follows

overall group materiality                150 million 2014 300 million
how we determined it                     with reference to a benchmark of the normalised average profit or loss before tax for the past three years
                                         materiality represents 34 per cent of the benchmark absolute values of profit for 2014 and 2013 and
                                         loss for 2015 were considered after normalisation adjustments for the impairment of goodwill for 2015
                                         2014 and 2013 as disclosed in note 25 and the civil penalty from the us branch for 2014 as disclosed in
                                         note 8 as these items are discrete
rationale for benchmark applied          this approach mitigates undue volatility in determining our materiality and provided a more stable basis
                                         for determining materiality focusing on the underlying profitability of the group over the past three years

we reported to the audit committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements affecting group profit and loss or group shareholders
funds of more than 75 million and any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements affecting group assets and liabilities only of more than
75 million in addition we reported to the audit committee other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds
5 how we scoped our audit

component scoping                                  for the purpose of planning our audit we identified a branch or a subsidiary as components
                                                    in the group audit 36 components 2014 34 components were identified in 30 countries
                                                    2014 27 countries
                                                   audits for group reporting purposes were performed at 33 components a further three
                                                    components were scoped as they either hold significant quantities of liquid assets or because
                                                    they process significant volumes of transactions specific audit procedures were performed
                                                    primarily to cover these areas
                                                   the group operates eight central hubs which perform many financial processes the outputs
                                                    of which are included in the financial information of the reporting components processes
                                                    within these hubs are subject to audit procedures predominantly the testing of transaction
                                                    processing and information technology controls
                                                   the components scoped included all significant dealing room activities
component materiality and coverage                 the audit work undertaken for group reporting purposes at these components and hubs
                                                    was performed by the component and hub auditors to materiality levels set by or agreed with
                                                    the group audit team these materiality levels were set individually for each component or
                                                    hub having regard to the size and risk profile of the group across the components and hubs
                                                    and ranged from 1 million to 40 million
                                                   reporting components represent 95 per cent 2014 96 per cent of profit of group loss or
                                                    profit measured on an absolute basis per component before tax and 97 per cent 2014
                                                    97 per cent of total assets
group audit team procedures and oversight          as part of determining the scope and preparing the audit plan and strategy the group audit
of component auditors                               team led a global planning conference to discuss the key audit risks and obtain inputs from          and notes
                                                    the component teams                                                                                  financial statements
                                                   thereafter group audit instructions were sent to component auditors with respect to the
                                                    significant areas to be covered including the relevant risks detailed above and the information
                                                    to be reported back
                                                   a particular focus was managing the audit work at the hubs which require component and
                                                    hub audit teams to cooperate effectively common audit objectives were coordinated through
                                                    common global audit programmes which set out the responsibilities of each component
                                                    team on a testbytest basis this process was overseen by the group audit team and senior
                                                    partners based in each of the groups key regions who oversaw their region in more detail
                                                    and helped to ensure that the audit approach was fully understood and that key issues were
                                                    properly addressed
                                                   the group audit team performed the work on valuation of financial instruments and goodwill
                                                    impairment in addition it performed quality assurance checks on loan loss judgements made
                                                    by component auditors for all loans above 40 million in credit grades 12 13 and 14 see pages

commercial clients private banking clients and retail clients the products offered to these client segments are summarised under income by
product below the focus is on broadening and deepening the relationship with clients rather than maximising a particular product line hence
the group evaluates segmental performance based on overall profit or loss before taxation excluding corporate items not allocated and not
individual product profitability product revenue information is used as a way of assessing client needs and trends in the marketplace the
strategies adopted by the client segments need to be adapted to local market and regulatory requirements which is the responsibility of country
management teams while not the primary driver of the business country performance is an important part of the groups structure and is also
used to evaluate performance and reward staff corporate items not allocated are not aggregated into the client segments because of the oneoff
nature of these items
the groups entitywide disclosure which includes profit before tax net interest margin and structure of the groups deposits comprises
geographic areas classified by the location of the customer except for financial market products which are classified by the location of the
dealer
transactions between the client segments and geographic areas are carried out on an armslength basis apart from the entities that have
been acquired in the past two years the groups central expenses have been distributed between the client segments and geographic areas in

valuation of financial instruments
all financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of recognition as described within the accounting policies in note 1
wherever possible fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the
group where quoted market prices are not available or are unreliable because of poor liquidity fair values have been determined using valuation
techniques which to the extent possible use market observable inputs but in some cases use nonmarket observable inputs
valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and where appropriate comparison to instruments with                      and notes
                                                                                                                                                               financial statements

valuation control framework
the valuation control function is responsible for independent price verification oversight of fair value adjustments and escalation of valuation
issues independent price verification is the process of determining the valuations incorporated into the financial statements are validated
independent of the business area responsible for the product the valuation control function has oversight of the fair value adjustments to ensure
the financial instruments are priced to exit these are key controls in ensuring the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial
statements in inactive markets direct observation of a traded price may not be possible the market data used for price verification may include
those sourced from recent trade data involving external counterparties or third parties such as bloomberg reuters brokers and consensus
pricing providers valuation control performs a semiannual review of the suitability of the market data used for price testing
price verification uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market the instruments trade in to determine the
quality of the market data inputs factors such as independence relevance reliability availability of multiple data sources and methodology
employed by the pricing provider are taken into consideration
formal committees for the business clusters consisting of representatives from group market risk product control valuation control and the
business meet monthly to discuss and approve the valuations of the inventory the business cluster valuation committees fall under the valuation
benchmarks committee vbc as part the of the valuation governance structure
valuation hierarchy
assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the observability
of the significant inputs used to determine the fair values

notes to the financial statements




15 financial instruments continued

changes in the observability of significant valuation inputs during the reporting period may result in a transfer of assets and liabilities within the fair
value hierarchy the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy when there is a significant change in either its principal
market or the level of observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques as at the end of the reporting period
level 1
level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
level 2
level 2 valuations are those with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable
level 3
level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable

valuation techniques
loans and advances
these include loans in the global syndications underwriting book which are not syndicated yet these loans are generally bilateral in nature and
their valuation is primarily based on recent trades or proxies ie comparable loans with similar credit grade or sector products are classified as
level 2 in cases where observable credit spreads applicable to those products are available where there are no recent transactions and reliable
comparable loans to proxy from the valuation of these loans is based on unobservable inputs resulting in them being classified as level 3
debt securities  asset backed securities
due to the lack of liquidity in the market and the prolonged period of time under which many securities have not traded relying on external prices
only is not a strong enough measure to determine whether an asset has an observable price or not therefore once external pricing has been
verified an assessment is made whether each security is traded with significant liquidity based on its credit rating and sector if a security is of
high credit rating and is traded in a liquid sector it will be classified as level 2 otherwise it will be classified as level 3 where thirdparty pricing
is not available the valuation of the security will be estimated from market standard cash flow models with input parameter assumptions which
include prepayment speeds default rates discount margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage collateral type and credit
ratings these securities are also classified as level 3

other debt securities
these debt securities include convertible bonds corporate bonds credit and structured notes where quoted prices are available through pricing
vendors brokers or observable trading activities from liquid markets these are classified as level 2 and valued using such quotes where there
are significant valuation inputs which are unobservable in the market due to illiquid trading or the complexity of the product these are classified
as level 3 the valuation of these debt securities is implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads these input
parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer if available or proxied from comparable issuers or assets
equity shares  private equity
the majority of private equity unlisted investments are valued based on earning multiples  pricetoearnings pe or enterprise value to earning
before income tax depreciation and amortisation evebitda ratios  of comparable listed companies the two primary inputs for the valuation
of these investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies in
circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced
from reliable external sources alternate valuation techniques for example discounted cash flow models which use predominantly unobservable
inputs or level 3 inputs may be applied even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from thirdparty
sources for example bloomberg and those inputs can be deemed level 2 inputs all unlisted investments excluding those where observable
inputs are available for example otc prices are classified as level 3 on the basis that the valuation methods involve judgements ranging from
determining comparable companies to discount rates where the discounted cash flow method is applied
derivatives
derivative products are classified as level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are observable from
independent and reliable market data sources derivative products are classified as level 3 if there are significant valuation input parameters
which are unobservable in the market such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying variable examples are
foreign exchange basket options equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying indices and interest rate products with
quanto payouts these unobservable correlation parameters could only be implied from the market through methods such as historical analysis
and comparison to historical levels or benchmark data
debt securities in issue
these debt securities relate to structured notes issued by the group where independent market data is available through pricing vendors and
broker sources these positions are classified as level 2 where such liquid external prices are not available valuation of these debt securities are
implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads and are classified as level 3 these input parameters are determined
with reference to the same issuer if available or proxied from comparable issuers or assets

1 includes own debit valuation adjustments on derivatives


bidoffer valuation adjustments
where market parameters are marked on a midmarket basis in the revaluation systems a bidoffer valuation adjustment is required to quantify
the expected cost of neutralising the business positions through dealing away in the market thereby bringing long positions to bid and short
positions to offer the methodology to calculate the bidoffer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves netting between long and short
positions and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy where long positions are marked to bid and short positions
marked to offer in the systems
credit valuation adjustments
the group makes a credit valuation adjustment cva against the fair value of derivative products cva is an adjustment to the fair value of the
transactions to reflect the possibility that our counterparties may default and we may not receive the full market value of the outstanding
transactions it represents an estimate of the adjustment a market participant would include when deriving a purchase price to acquire our
exposures cva is calculated for each subsidiary and within each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure and takes
account of any collateral we may hold the group calculates the cva by applying the probability of default pd on the potential estimated future
positive exposure of the counterparty using marketimplied pd where marketimplied data is not readily available we use market based proxies
to estimate the pd the methodologies do not in general account for wrongway risk wrongway risk arises when the underlying value of the
derivative prior to any cva is positively correlated to the probability of default by the counterparty the group continues to include wrongway
risk in its prudential valuation adjustments the cva calculation was previously based on an expected counterparty loss calculation using
historical default probabilities as at 31 december 2015 the calculation was revised to use marketimplied pd the change in estimate reduced
net trading income by 712 million

own credit adjustments
the group calculates own credit adjustments to reflect changes in its own credit standing the groups own credit adjustments are calculated on
its derivative liabilities and issued debt designated at fair value including structured notes the groups own credit adjustments will increase if its
credit standing worsens and conversely decrease if its credit standing improves the groups own credit adjustments will reverse over time as its
liabilities mature
for derivative liabilities an own credit adjustment is determined by applying the groups probability of default to the groups negative expected
exposure against the counterparty the groups probability of default and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on internally
assessed credit ratings and market standard recovery levels the expected exposure is modelled based on simulation methodology and is
generated through simulation of underlying risk factors over the life of the deal booked against the particular counterparty this simulation
methodology incorporates the collateral posted by the group and the effects of master netting agreements the methodology used to determine
an own credit adjustment on derivative liabilities is consistent with the methodology used to determine credit valuation adjustment cva on
derivative assets
for issued debt and structured notes designated at fair value an own credit adjustment is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows
using a yield curve adjusted for market observed secondary senior debt issuance spreads above average interbank rates
model valuation adjustments
valuation models may have pricing deficiencies or limitations that require a valuation adjustment these pricing deficiencies or limitations arise
due to the choice implementation and calibration of the pricing model
funding valuation adjustment
the group makes a funding valuation adjustment fva against derivative products fva reflects an estimate of the adjustment to its fair value that
a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs that could arise in relation to the exposure fva is calculated by determining the net
expected exposure at a counterparty level and then applying a funding rate to those exposures that reflect the market cost of funding the fva
for collateralised derivatives is based on discounting the expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap ois rate after taking
into consideration the terms of the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty the fva for uncollateralised including partially
collateralised derivatives incorporates the estimated present value of the market funding cost or benefit associated with funding these
transactions the fva calculation was previously based on the banks internal funding rates as at 31 december 2015 the calculation was
revised to use market based rates the change in estimate reduced net trading income by 151 million
day one profit and loss
a financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value which is generally its transaction price in cases where the value obtained from the
relevant valuation model differs from the transaction price we record the asset or liability based on our valuation model but do not recognise that
initial difference in profit and loss unless the inputs to the valuation model are observable

1 the ranges of values shown in the above table represent the highest and lowest levels used in the valuation of the groups level 3 financial instruments as at 31 december
   2015 the ranges of values used are reflective of the underlying characteristics of these level 3 financial instruments based on the market conditions at the balance sheet date
   however these ranges of values may not represent the uncertainty in fair value measurements of the groups level 3 financial instruments
2 weighted average for nonderivative financial instruments have been calculated by weighting inputs by the relative fair value weighted average for derivatives has been
   provided by weighting inputs by the risk relevant to that variable na has been entered for the cases where weighted average is not a meaningful indicator

the following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the valuation technique table
credit spreads
credit spreads represent the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument
recovery rates
recovery rate is the expectation of the rate of return resulting from the liquidation of a particular loan as the probability of default increases for a
given instrument the valuation of that instrument will increasingly reflect its expected recovery level assuming default an increase in the recovery
rate in isolation would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the loan
comparable priceyield
comparable pricing is a valuation methodology in which a price of a comparable instrument is used to estimate the fair value where there are no
direct observable prices yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash flows in a discounted cash flow model valuation using
comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield or spread over a liquid benchmark from the price of a comparable
instrument then adjusting that yield or spread to derive a value for the instrument the adjustment should account for relevant differences in the
financial instruments such as maturity andor credit quality alternatively a pricetoprice basis can be assumed between the comparable
instrument and the instrument being valued in order to establish the value of the instrument eg deriving a fair value for a junior unsecured bond
from the price of a senior secured bond an increase in price in isolation would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the asset an
increase in yield in isolation would result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the asset
correlation
correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable an equity correlation is the correlation
between two equity instruments while an interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates
volatility
volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument parameter or index will change in value over time generally the higher the
volatility the more expensive the option will be
interest rate curves
interest rate curve is the term structure of interest rates and measure of future interest rates at a particular point of time
evebitda ratio multiples
this is the ratio of enterprise value ev to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation ebitda ev is the aggregate market
capitalisation and debt minus the cash and cash equivalents an increase in evebitda multiple in isolation will result in a favourable movement
in the fair value of the unlisted firm
priceearnings pe multiples
pe multiple is the ratio of the market capitalisation to the net income after tax the multiples are determined from multiples of listed comparables
which are observable an increase in pe multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm
liquidity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments
a liquidity discount is primarily applied to the valuation of unlisted firms investments to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded an
increase in liquidity discount will result in unfavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm

sensitivities in respect of the fair values of level 3 assets and liabilities
sensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs we apply a 10 per cent increase or decrease on the values of
these unobservable reasonably possible alternatives that could have increased fair values of financial instruments inputs in order to generate a
range of reasonably possible alternative valuations the percentage shift is determined by statistical analyses performed on a set of reference
prices based on the composition of our level 3 assets favourable and unfavourable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the
value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters this level 3 sensitivity analysis assumes a one way
market move and does not consider offsets for hedges

the following sets out the groups basis of establishing fair values of amortised cost financial instruments and their classification between levels
1 2 and 3 as certain categories of financial instruments are not traded there is a significant level of management judgement involved in
calculating the fair values
cash and balances at central banks
the fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their carrying amounts
loans and advances to banks and customers
for loans and advances to banks the fair value of floating rate placements and overnight deposits is their carrying amounts the estimated fair
value of fixed interestbearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing money market rates for debts with a similar credit
risk and remaining maturity
the groups loans and advances to customers portfolio is well diversified by geography and industry approximately a quarter of the portfolio
reprices within one month and approximately half reprices within 12 months loans and advances are presented net of provisions for impairment
the fair value of loans and advances to customers with a residual maturity of less than one year generally approximates the carrying value
                                                                                                                                                         and notes
                                                                                                                                                         financial statements
subject to any significant movement in credit spreads the estimated fair value of loans and advances with a residual maturity of more than one
year represents the discounted amount of future cash flows expected to be received including assumptions relating to prepayment rates and
where appropriate credit spreads expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value the group has a wide
range of individual instruments within its loans and advances portfolio and as a result providing quantification of the key assumptions used to
value such instruments is impractical
investment securities
for investment securities that do not have directly observable market values the group utilises a number of valuation techniques to determine fair
value where available securities are valued using inputs proxied from the same or closely related underlying for example bond spreads from the
same or closely related issuer or inputs proxied from a different underlying for example a similar bond but using spreads for a particular sector
and rating certain instruments cannot be proxied as set out above and in such cases the positions are valued using nonmarket observable
inputs this includes those instruments held at amortised cost and predominantly relate to asset backed securities the fair value for such
instruments is usually proxied from internal assessments of the underlying cash flows the group has a wide range of individual investments
within the unlisted debt securities portfolio given the number of instruments involved providing quantification of the key assumptions used to
value such instruments is impractical with no one assumption being material
deposits and borrowings
the estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand the estimated fair value of fixed interestbearing
deposits and other borrowings without quoted market prices is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing market rates for debts with a
similar credit risk and remaining maturity following the adoption of ifrs 13 the group also adjusts the fair value of deposits and borrowings for
own credit adjustment using the principles described above

debt securities in issue subordinated liabilities and other borrowed funds
the aggregate fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices for those notes where quoted market prices are not available a
discounted cash flow model is used based on a current market related yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity
reclassification of financial assets
in 2008 the group reclassified certain nonderivative financial assets classified as held for trading into the availableforsale afs category as
these were no longer considered to be held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term at the time of transfer the group identified
the rare circumstances permitting such a transfer as the impact of the credit crisis in financial markets particularly from the beginning of 2008
which significantly impacted the liquidity in certain markets the group also reclassified certain eligible financial assets from trading and available
forsale categories to loans and receivables where the group had the intent and ability to hold the reclassified assets for the foreseeable future or
until maturity there have been no reclassifications since 2008
the following tables provide details of the remaining balances of assets reclassified during 2008

repurchase transactions
the group enters into collateralised repurchase agreements repos and securities borrowing and lending transactions these transactions
typically entitle the group and its counterparties to have recourse to assets similar to those provided as collateral in the event of a default
securities sold subject to repos continue to be recognised on the balance sheet as the group retains substantially the associated risk and
rewards of the securities the counterparty liability is included in deposits by banks or customer accounts as appropriate assets sold under
repurchase agreements are considered encumbered as the group cannot pledge these to obtain funding

notes to the financial statements




 17 derivative financial instruments continued

fair value hedges
the swaps exchange fixed rates for floating rates on funding to match floating rates received on assets or exchange fixed rates on assets to
match the floating rates paid on funding
for qualifying hedges the fair value changes of the derivative are substantially matched by corresponding fair value changes of the hedged item
both of which are recognised in profit and loss in respect of fair value hedges net losses arising on the hedging instruments during the year were
192 million 2014 net gains of 1272 million compared to net gains arising on the hedged items of 198 million 2014 net losses of
1301 million
cash flow hedges
the group uses interest rate swaps to manage the variability in future cash flows on assets and liabilities that have floating rates of interest by
exchanging the floating rates for fixed rates it also uses foreign exchange contracts currency swaps and options to manage the variability in
future exchange rates on its assets and liabilities and costs in foreign currencies
gains and losses arising on the effective portion of the hedges are deferred in equity until the variability on the cash flow affects profit and loss at
which time the gains or losses are transferred to profit and loss

a structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the
entity structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and welldefined objective with restrictions around their activities the group
has involvement with both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities which may be established by the group or by a third party as                     and notes
detailed below                                                                                                                                                  financial statements
interests in consolidated structured entities
in accordance with the groups accounting policies discussed in note 1 a structured entity is consolidated into the groups financial statements
where the group controls the structured entity in determining whether to consolidate a structured entity to which assets have been transferred
the group takes into account its ability to direct the relevant activities of the structured entity which is evidenced through a unilateral right to
liquidate the structured entity investment in a substantial proportion of the securities issued by the structured entity or where the group holds
specific subordinate securities that embody certain controlling rights

interests in unconsolidated structured entities
unconsolidated structured entities are all structured entities that are not controlled by the group the group enters into transactions with
unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities
the table below presents the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities recognised in the financial statements relating to variable interests held
in unconsolidated structured entities the maximum exposure to loss relating to those interests and the total assets of the structured entities
maximum exposure to loss is primarily limited to the carrying amount of the groups onbalance sheet exposure to the structured entity for
derivatives the maximum exposure to loss represents the onbalance sheet valuation and not the notional amount for commitments and
guarantees the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses

the main types of activities for which the group utilises unconsolidated structured entities cover synthetic credit default swaps for portfolio
management purposes managed investment funds including specialised principal finance funds structured finance and asset backed
securities
principal finance funds
the groups exposure to principal finance funds represents committed or invested capital in unleveraged investment funds primarily investing in
panasian infrastructure real estate and private equity
portfolio management
for the purposes of portfolio management the group purchased credit protection via synthetic credit default swaps from noteissuing structured
entities that the group sponsors the referenced assets remain on the groups balance sheet as they are not assigned to these structured
entities the group continues to own or hold all of the risks and returns relating to these assets the credit protection obtained from the
regulatorycompliant securitisation only serves to protect the group against losses upon the occurrence of eligible credit events and the
underlying assets are not derecognised from the group balance sheet the group does not hold any debt or equity interest in the structured
entities the proceeds of the notes issuance are typically held as cash collateral in the issuers account operated by a trustee or invested in
aaarated governmentbacked securities to collateralise the structured entities swap obligations to the group and to repay the principal to
investors at maturity the structured entities reimburse the group on actual losses incurred through the use of the cash collateral or realisation of
the collateral security correspondingly the structured entities write down the notes issued by an equal amount of the losses incurred in reverse
order of seniority all funding is committed for the life of these vehicles and the group has no indirect exposure in respect of the vehicles liquidity
position the group has reputational risk in respect of certain portfolio management vehicles and investment funds either because the group is
the arranger and lead manager or because the structured entities have standard chartered branding

testing of goodwill for impairment
an annual assessment is made as to whether the current carrying value of goodwill is impaired for the purposes of impairment testing goodwill
is allocated at the date of acquisition to a cash generating unit cgu and the table below sets out the goodwill allocated to each cgu goodwill
is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant cgu exceeds its recoverable amount the recoverable amounts for all the
cgus were measured based on valueinuse the key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amounts are set out below and are
solely estimates for the purposes of assessing impairment of acquired goodwill

methodology for determining valueinuse
the calculation of valueinuse for each cgu is based on cash flow projections over a 20year period including a terminal value which is
determined based on longterm earnings multiple consistent with available market data these cash flows are discounted using a pretax
discount rate which reflects current market rates appropriate to the cgu as set out in the table above
the cash flow projections are based on budgets and forecasts approved by management covering the five years to 2020 except for financial
institutions and smaller cgus disclosed within other which cover one year to 2016 management forecasts project growth rates greater than
longterm gdp rates but which are in line with past performance as adjusted to reflect the current economic climate for the period after
management approved forecasts the cash flows are extrapolated forward using steady longterm forecast gdp growth rates appropriate to the
cgu
outcome of impairment assessment
the group has performed its annual impairment assessment on the level of the goodwill that has been assigned to the groups cgus for
indicators of impairment considering whether there were any reduced expectations for future cash flows andor fluctuations in the discount rate
or the assumptions at 31 december 2015 the results of this assessment indicated that the carrying amount exceeded the recoverable value by
362 million for the taiwan cgu arising principally from a slowdown in the local market and 126 million for the thailand cgu arising as a
consequence of management actions to reposition the business following the strategic review and has been classified as restructuring
an impairment charge of 488 million has been recognised to write down the goodwill attributable to these cgus to their recoverable values the
pretax discount rate applied to the taiwan cgu was 163 per cent and 174 per cent in respect of the thailand cgu
for all other cgus the recoverable amounts exceed the carrying amounts against the key assumptions
it continues to be possible that certain scenarios could be constructed where a combination of reasonably possible changes in the discount rate
coupled with a reduction in current business plan forecasts or the gdp growth rate would potentially result in the carrying amount of goodwill
exceeding the recoverable amount in the future for the taiwan and thailand cgus

these assumptions are likely to change in the future and this will affect the value placed on the liabilities for example changes at the reporting
date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions holding other assumptions constant would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the
amounts shown below
 if the discount rate for the uk fund increased by 25 basis points bps the liability would reduce by approximately 60 million
 if the rate of inflation and pension increases for the uk fund increased by 25 bps the liability would increase by approximately 60 million
 if the rate salaries increase compared to inflation for the uk fund increased by 25 bps the liability would increase by approximately 5 million
 if longevity expectations increased by one year for the uk fund the liability would increase by approximately 45 million
although this analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the uk fund it does provide an approximation
of the sensitivity to the main assumptions while changes in other assumptions would also have an impact the effect would not be as significant

2011 standard chartered share plan
approved by shareholders in may 2011 the 2011 standard chartered share plan the 2011 plan is the groups main share plan applicable to
all employees with the flexibility to provide a variety of award types the 2011 plan is designed to deliver various types of share awards including
those subject to longterm performance conditions giving the group sufficient flexibility to meet the challenges of the changing regulatory and
competitive environment share awards are a key part of both executive directors and senior managements variable compensation such
awards ensure that there is an appropriate return for the risk taken and that the measure is aligned with the groups risk appetite
 performance shares are subject to a combination of three performance measures relative total shareholder return tsr earnings per share
   eps growth and return on riskweighted assets rorwa the weighting between the three elements is split equally onethird of the award
   depending on each measure assessed independently performance share awards form part of the variable compensation awarded to
   executive directors
 deferred awards are used to deliver the deferred portion of total variable compensation in line with both market practice and regulatory
   requirements these awards are subject to a three or fiveyear deferral period vesting equally on each anniversary of the award date deferred
   awards are not subject to any plan limit this enables the group to meet regulatory requirements relating to deferral levels and is in line with
   market practice
 underpin shares are subject to a combination of two performance measures eps growth and rorwa the weighting between the two
   elements is split equally onehalf of the award depending on each measure assessed independently underpin shares formed part of the
   variable compensation awarded to executive directors and senior management in respect of 2014 performance
 restricted share awards which are made outside of the annual performance process as additional incentive retention mechanisms or
   as replacement awards to new joiners who forfeit awards on leaving their previous employers are provided as restricted shares under the
   2011 plan these awards typically vest in equal instalments on the second and third anniversaries of the award date in line with similar plans
   operated by our competitors restricted share awards are not subject to an annual limit and do not have any performance conditions

valuation  performance shares
the fair value of the tsr component is derived by discounting onethird of the award by the loss of expected dividends over the vesting period
together with the probability of meeting the relative tsr condition which is calculated by the area under the tsr vesting schedule curve the
eps growth fair value is derived by discounting onethird of the award respectively by the loss of expected dividends over the vesting period the
same approach is applied to calculate the rorwa fair value for onethird of the award in respect of the eps growth and rorwa components
the number of shares expected to vest is adjusted for actual performance when calculating the sharebased payment charge for the year the
same fair value applies to all employees including executive directors
the remaining life of the plan during which new awards can be made is five years

notes to the financial statements




41 legal and regulatory matters

the group seeks to comply with all applicable laws and regulations but may be subject to regulatory actions and investigations across our
markets the outcome of which are generally difficult to predict and can be material to the group
further details on regulatory compliance reviews request for information investigation and risk of fraud and other criminal acts are set out in
pages 200 and 201 of the risk and capital review
in addition to these matters the group receives legal claims against it in a number of jurisdictions arising in the normal course of business the
group considers none of these claims as material
where appropriate the group recognises a provision for liabilities when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources embodying
economic benefits will be required and for which a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation the uncertainties inherent in legal and
regulatory matters affect the amount and timing of any potential outflows with respect to which provisions have been established
42 postbalance sheet events

tax
on 8 july 2015 the uk government announced changes to tax rates these changes have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date
but take effect in future periods the changes were as follows
 corporation tax surcharge
  an 8 per cent corporation tax surcharge applies to uk profits of banks with effect from 1 january 2016 management estimates that the impact
  of this change will not be material to the group
 uk bank levy
  a phased reduction in the rate at which the uk bank levy is charged on qualifying liabilities is introduced the current rates of 021 per cent for
  shortterm liabilities and 0105 per cent for longterm liabilities will be gradually reduced over the next six years the rates applicable from
  1 january 2021 will be 010 per cent for shortterm liabilities and 005 per cent for longterm liabilities in addition the scope of the bank levy
  will be restricted to the balance sheet of uk operations only from 2021 onwards the restriction of scope is currently in the process of
  consultation

the same period rather than the calendar year used in financial reporting this is consistent with international carbon reporting practice
measured data is collected from global environment management system gems properties defined as all properties that are over 10000
square feet for energy and water for paper and business travel it is defined per fulltime employee
scaledup data is an extrapolation made from measured data to account for 100 per cent of the groups occupied property footprint for energy
and water for paper and business travel it is defined per fulltime employee as at the end of the reporting period
carbon abatement benefit from indirect renewable energy is not taken into account
total energy use is normalised to reflect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period
net internal areas used for water use intensity do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas
warehouses empty land car parks unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes residential properties space occupied by automated
teller machines vaults and space sublet to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation
scope 3 emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 36 countries based on seating class and distance flown
as we operate largely outside of the uk all flights domestic or international with flight distance of less than 463km labelled by the department for
environment food and rural affairs defra as domestic flights have been classified as short haul all flights with distance flown ranging from
463 to 1108km labelled by defra as short haul have been classified as medium haul
