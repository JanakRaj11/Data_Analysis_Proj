    officers report
    objectives and listing of astoria
    astoria investments ltd astoria or the company is an investment company with permanent capital its primary objective which
    reflects the way we think about the investment of its capital is to achieve strong usd capital appreciation over the medium to longterm by
    investing in global equity dominated holdings of primarily direct high quality listed businesses this will be augmented when appropriate
    by investing in niche funds other funds and global private equity opportunities the highlights of the year for astoria were the stock
    exchange of mauritius sem listing and the south african private placement undertaken on the altx of the johannesburg stock exchange
    jse as further detailed below


    astoria placed 125817402 of its shares with invited investors at the point of listing on the jse at an issue price of zar 1423 per share
    the issue price per share was the zar equivalent of usd 100 per share being the spot exchange rate at 1200 sa time on wednesday
    18 november 2015 a total of 126809944 astoria shares comprising the shares issued in terms of the listing on the jse and the existing
    shares in issue that were already listed on the sem were listed on the altx of the jse and the sem with effect from the commencement of
    trade on the jse on wednesday 25 november 2015 astoria was subsequently listed on the main board of the namibian exchange by way
    of a secondary listing on 10 february 2016




    results
    the company reported a loss of usd 167 million for the period ended 31 december 2015 while there was a small net gain from financial
    assets there was a net foreign exchange loss of usd 145 million arising principally from adverse movements in foreign currency this
    reflected the difference in exchange rates of zar to usd applied in the private placing as against the average exchange rate at which those
    zar proceeds were converted to usd in addition there were costs of usd 01 million representing professional fees associated with the
    structuring and listing services provided to the company in respect of its listing on the sem and altx of the jse


    the currency loss referred to above should not be viewed as an operating issue the zar has been volatile since the listing but astorias
    zar exposure is now less than 1 as astorias accounting currency is the usd the exchange rate of the zar to the usd should not impact
    astorias operating performance it will remain relevant to the price at which the companys shares trade on the jse moreover future
    capital raisings by astoria would likely be conducted in zarthe nav per share at 31 december 2015 was usd 097 at 31 december 2015
    astoria had invested 32 of its assets the balance was held predominantly in usd cash subsequent to year end and as at 31 march 2016
    astoria had invested an approximate additional 10 of its capital




     the nav per share at 31 december
     2015 was usd 097

                                                                         000

     net asset value                                                     usd 123191

     shares in issue                                                     126810

     nav per share                                                       usd 097

operations
the company is run from its office in mauritius the companys assets
are managed by anchor capital mauritius ltd in terms of a discretionary
mandate as set out in the investment management agreement the
details of this agreement are set out in the jse prelisting statement
issued on 16 november 2015


commentary
given the primary objective of the company detailed above we
believe that our investment performance should be measured over
time this is the benefit of having permanent capital to invest we
do not look to trade shortterm market or individual share price
movements we seek to make well researched investments in high
quality businesses which we prefer to hold for the longterm to
achieve strong compound returns there are well known benefits to
this approach we believe that there are also benefits to the astoria
structure for shareholders resident in specific jurisdictions these
issues are dealt with in the documents which are available on our
website wwwastoriamu



changes to the board
of directors
mr lourens geldenhuys resigned as a nonexecutive director with
effect from 31 january 2016 in order to focus on his other business
interests mr peter todd was appointed as a nonexecutive director
to replace mr geldenhuys with effect from 31 january 2016


prospects
looking at 2016 global markets turned volatile with the new year
as emerging markets and emerging market currencies began
reflecting heightened concerns about us interest rates global
growth and commodity markets there is little doubt that global
economies and monetary policy are in unchartered waters
with the long shadow of the global financial crisis still evident in
economic performance and monetary policy yet while these issues
are relevant to astoria and its investment manager they are not the
drivers of our investment approach or our investment policy


there will likely be tactical shifts from time to time in astorias asset
allocation we have for example stated that current conditions may
be more conducive to a higher weighting in private equity than
previously anticipated this will also depend on the opportunity set
and the attractiveness of specific opportunities any such tactical
shifts if and when made do not change the primary objective of
astoria stated at the outset


the new year is challenging for investors generally but with that
opportunities arise we believe that taking advantage of selected
opportunities has the potential to establish a solid base for medium
to long term performance our strong board of directors the
experience of our investment manager the exciting opportunities
we are seeing and our access to permanent capital create a                  darryl kaplan
platform to pursue our primary objective of achieving strong usd
capital appreciation over the medium to longterm

                                 collaboration with the walt disney company will in our opinion serve

                                 china and japan almost 13 of the global jewellery market represent

market for that instrument a market is regarded as active if transactions
for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to
provide pricing information on an ongoing basis the company measures
instruments quoted in an active market at a midprice because this price
provides a reasonable approximation of the exit price


if there is no quoted price in an active market then the company uses
valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs
and minimise the use of unobservable inputs the chosen valuation
technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would
take into account in pricing a transaction


impairment
nonderivative financial assets


financial assets not classified as at fair value through profit or loss are
assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective
evidence of impairment


objective evidence that financial assets are impaired include


    default or delinquency by a debtor
    restructuring of an amount due to the company on terms that the
     company would not consider otherwise
    indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy
    adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers
    the disappearance of an active market for a security
    observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the
     expected cash flows from a group of financial assets


the company considers evidence of impairment for these assets at both
an individual asset and a collective level all individually significant assets
are individually assessed for impairment those found not to be impaired
are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred
but not yet individually identified assets that are not individually significant
are collectively assessed for impairment collective assessment is carried
out by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics


in assessing collective impairment the company uses historical information
on the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred and makes an
adjustment if current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual
losses are likely to be greater or lesser than suggested by historical trends


an impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised
cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the
present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets
original effective interest rate losses are recognised in profit or loss and
reflected in an allowance account when the company considers that there
are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset the relevant amounts
are written off if the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
impairment was recognised then the previously recognised impairment
loss is reversed through profit or loss


provisions
a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the company has
a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation                                                              38

the sensitivity analysis has been determined assuming that the change in foreign exchange rates had occurred at the reporting date and had
been applied to the companys exposure to currency risk for financial instruments in existence at that date and that all other variables in
particular interest rates remain constant


the stated changes represent managements assessment of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates over the period until the
next annual reporting date results of the analysis as presented in the above table represent the effects on the companys profitsreserves
measured in foreign currencies translated into usd at the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date




                                                                                                                                                42

     interest rate risk


     the companys income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates the companys interest
     bearing financial assets are cash at bank interest income may fluctuate in amount in particular due to changes in interest rates but this is
     monitored on an ongoing basis the impact of interest rate risk is considered to be immaterial


     sensitivity analysis on interest rate risk


     the company is exposed to interest rate risk only to the extent that it earns bank interest on cash and cash equivalents since the directors
     consider interest rate risk to be insignificant no sensitivity analysis on interest rate risk has been presented


     other market price risk


     other market price risk is the risk that the fair value of the financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices other
     than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk whether caused by factors to individual investment or its issue or factors affecting
     all instruments traded in the market the company is exposed to price risk on its investments which are listed on new york stock exchange
     six swiss exchange nasdaq copenhagen stock exchange nasdaq and london stock exchange group



     the board of directors monitors the companys overall market positions on an ongoing basis the investment manager moderates the risk
     through careful selection of securities the boards best estimate of the effect on profit or loss and equity due to a reasonably possible change
     in equity prices of its investment securities with all other variables held constant is as follows



                                                                                                                               figures in 000

     the sensitivity analysis has been determined assuming that the reasonably possible changes in the stock market index had occurred at the
     reporting date and had been applied to the exposure to equity price risk in existence at that date it is also assumed that the fair values of the
     equity instruments held by the company would change in accordance with the historical correlation with the relevant stock market index that
     none of the companys investments would be considered impaired as a result of a reasonably possible decrease in the relevant stock market
     index and that all other variables remain constant the stated changes represent managements assessment of reasonably possible changes
     in the relevant stock market index over the period until the next annual reporting date

     repurchases may take place pursuant to the general authority for a period of 12 months after the date of notice of this annual general
     meeting
        the company will in the ordinary course of business be able to pay its debts
        the assets of the company fairly valued in accordance with international financial reporting standards will exceed the liabilities of the
         company fairly valued in accordance with international financial reporting standards and
        the companys share capital reserves and working capital will be adequate for ordinary business purposes
