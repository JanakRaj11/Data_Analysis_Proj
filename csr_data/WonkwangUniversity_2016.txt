     jeong sojeong                                 in my opinion what is most important for wonkwang university is to attract students
                                                    because schools do not exist without students in order to lure students aggressive

plans for green energy specialization
wonkwang university carries out its plan for successful green energy specialization
by categorizing it into education research and industryuniversity cooperation areas
the plan aims to the creation of an education system for the training of experts in
green energy creation of a green energyrelated research center and the building of a
specialization support system through the formation of a cooperative network the plan
especially focuses on wind power photovoltaic energy fuel cell led biotechnology
green car energy saving and smart grid

      gas which belong to the building category were given a binding target for
      reduction as a result


      wonkwang universitys approach  strategy
      although it is not subject to the binding national target for emissions reduction
      wokkwang university has voluntarily managed its emissions and reduced its use
      of energy its efforts are also concentrated on talent development and research
      in the area of green energy to help address climate change and environmental
      degradation meanwhile rare and endangered plant species designated by the
      government are protected in the universitys botanical garden
