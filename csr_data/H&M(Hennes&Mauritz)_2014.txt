commitment five  reduce reuse recycle


focus close the loop on textile fibres


our mission                              our strategy
we have set the goal to close the loop   we teamed up with one of the world
for textile fibres and turn unwanted     leaders in textile recycling ico to
clothes into new creations in the       collect unwanted clothes  from any
short term this will help keep fash    brand and in any condition from hm                                            5
ion from ending up in landfills in      customers in all of our markets we                                         transport
the long run this can change the        provide an easy solution not to let                       4
way fashion is made and massively        fashion go to waste rewarding cus                    garment                                   6
reduce the need for extracting virgin    tomers with discounts as thanks all                  production                                sales
resources from our planet it will       collected clothes are then reused or
also give us direct access to environ   recycled at the moment for example
mentallyconscious resources for our     as second hand clothes or recycled
designs to ensure that this happens    into your next cleaning cloth but
we need to make it easy and attrac      also the first new yarn to make new           3                                                         7
tive for our customers to drop off any   clothes nothing goes to the landfill      fabric                                                      use
clothes they no longer want or need      we work with suppliers and other          production
at hm another challenge is that        stakeholders to increasingly recycle                                  closed loop
the yarn made from recycled natural      collected garments that are not suit                          avoid waste and use no longer
                                                                                                        wanted clothes as resource for
fibres is currently not strong enough    able for reuse and use these fibres in
                                                                                                            new products instead
to make highquality fabrics without     making new products currently we
being blended with virgin material      can blend in about 20 of such fibres             2
so we need to help finding innova      without any loss of quality or longev          raw
tions to overcome this challenge and     ity to increase this share and enable        materials
also find new ways to recycle other      large scale production we are creating
kinds of materials too                 demand for and investing directly in
                                         the required technical innovation                                   1
