                                             for us
                                     sustainability is both
                                    an idealistic quest and
                                  a competitive advantage
                               we are clear that businesses
                           today cannot pursue nancial growth
                          that comes at a cost of environmental
                          and social capital for us sustainability
                           is not just good corporate citizenship

                  it is the only viable

                           this year was a year of introspec on innova on and integra on we upgraded the
                           mahindra sustainability framework and rear culated the endgoals of its three
                           pillars  people planet proﬁt to reﬂect our shi from conserva on to rejuvena on
                           we granulated our roadmaps from divisionlevel roadmaps to individual roadmaps
                           for each material issue such as employee and community dealer sustainability and
                           supplier sustainability this will help each func on to track progress on material
                           issues and help us to drive a larger impact




                                        to inform
                                  our stakeholders how                           ir
                               sustainability is embedded
                           into every aspect of our business
                         we have transitioned from the regular
                        form of sustainability reporting to the
                        paradigm of integrated reporting this
                          is a paradigm which brings out the
                        interplay of business with the six types
                                of capital employed by it

                      relationship

                           through all these changes what has remained constant is the focus on nurturing our

individuals and the planet in general we at mahindra are aware of
these impacts and believe in taking responsibility and ownership of
our ac ons we are steadfast in adhering to all statutory norms and

in accordance with the revised na onal ambient air quality standards
naaqs 2009 the par culate ma er pm10 size less than 10 µm 
pm25 size less than 25 µm sulphur oxides sox and nitrogen
oxides nox are regularly monitored across our manufacturing 
service loca ons some manufacturing plants also monitor more
speciﬁc pollutants applicable to their processes like respirable
suspended par culate ma er rspm carbon monoxide co
methane ch4 ozone o3 lead pb among others
the sox and nox emission count of all our businesses is well below
the permissible limit even the par culate ma er emission is below
the limit except for the nashik plant division 2 which has devised an
ac on plan to reduce the same by installing scrubbers ﬁlters etc


ozone depleting substances
we are persistently conscious about the discharge of ozone
deple ng substances ods which can adversely aﬀect the
natures balance our processes are con nuously monitored and
improved to reduce consump on of resources and emission of
