ceos review
focus on cloud growth
i am very excited to have been given the opportunity to lead basware
starting from september 2016 when i became ceo we are very lucky
as baswareans to work in a company that is operating in a fast moving
market with significant growth potential




cloud revenue growth is baswares primary strategic objective and where the long term value in our
business will be created during 2016 our key focus was to pursue this and we witnessed strong
outcomes cloud revenues grew 269 percent and accounted for almost half of our total net sales at
the end of 2016 also our saas growth was very strong in 2016 up 95 percent for the full year



cloud revenue growth is baswares
primary strategic objective

baswares network continued to hit new highs in 2016 with november having 104 million
transactions the highest monthly total yet the full year volume was 108 million representing
volume growth of 15 percent we believe that we can grow our network even faster in the long run
and we have taken a series of measures to achieve this

with more than 100 million transactions going through our network every year basware has a
unique and valuable data asset a core part of baswares strategy is to expand new innovative value
added services that utilize the data in our network in 2016 we were recognised by industry analysts
as having market leading capabilities in providing innovative analytics for our customers based on
this data we also invested in maturing our financing services solutions which use the einvoice
and other information in our network to provide working capital solutions for customers




                        basware annual report 2016  7

with the market leader recognition  clear cloudfocused
strategy basware is well positioned to capture the
opportunities ahead of it

while our cloud businesses grew strongly in 2016 the growth was partially offset by our uk public
sector cloud business which declined driven by brexit and exchange rates baswares total net sales
were impacted by our business model transition with license and maintenance revenues declining in
every quarter and alliance fee income in the comparison period in 2015 as our fast growing cloud
revenues continue to become a larger proportion of baswares total net sales the impact of non
cloud revenue types will be felt less strongly in future

2016 was a year of investment for basware focused on expanding our sales and marketing
capabilities headcount in sales and marketing grew by 24 percent in 2016 and we appointed new
leaders to run these teams we also continued to innovate and invest in our global market leading
networked purchasetopay solutions and services

basware has identified the key markets where it sees the greate t potential to grow its cloud based
revenues as the us uk and germany in 2016 basware significantly expanded its us presenc
after acquiring verian a leading cloudbased eprocurement solution provider the integration has
proceeded well with the first crosssell network deals already ade the market potential in the uk
and germany remains strong however sales from these markets in 2016 were impacted by brexit in
the uk and a competitive job market in germany holding back the pace of recruitment



in november we launched a programme that will make basware more competitive and agile i
would like to thank our shareholders for their support our customers for their business and all of our
employees for their hard work in 2016 in recognition of our superior offering basware continued
to be cited as a market leader by key industry analysts in 2016 with this recognition and our clear
cloudfocused strategy i am confident that basware is well positioned to capture the opportunities
ahead of it and help our customers to realize tomorrows financial goals toda

  annual net sales greater than eur 220 million
  recurring revenue approximately 80 of net sales
more information about strategy is available on the companys investors pages at wwwbaswarecominvestors

shortterm risks and uncertainty factors
basware has a growth strategy with high net sales growth expectations for the cloud business executing the strategy for
20172020 requires significant investments in sales and marketing and related resources as well as continued investments
in product development at the same time the industry transformation from an onpremise licensebased business model to
a saas model will accelerate the decline of certain basware revenue streams including license sales and maintenance
the transformation will also make professional services revenues more volatile until the transformation is complete this
will act as a drag on group net sales growth

baswares net sales growth might fall below expectations if the company is not able to add qualified sales and marketing
resources according to its planned timetable this applies especially to baswares highest growth markets in the us the
uk and germany additionally even higher than expected pace in the license to saas transformation would have a
negative impact on expected net sales in the short term in addition to saas basware expects high growth rates in its
networkbased transaction services which will besides successful sales effort also require an improved onboarding
process sales from baswares third growth business area financing services are dependent on baswares ability to
bring innovative and attractive products to the market according to its planned timetable and move customers quickly to a
phase where they are using the services extensively enough to provide meaningful revenue to basware

the fact that close to 50 percent of the companys sales are expected to come from noneuro countries exposes the
groups net sales growth to foreign exchange rate movements in case there is a significant depreciation of gbp usd
nok sek or aud against the euro reported net sales may be affected despite good performance in local currencies the
result of the referendum held in june 2016 to determine if the uk will remain in the eu has had an impact on the gbp to
eur exchange rate in addition there is a risk that the uncertainty caused by this event leads to uk public sector bodies
and uk private companies delaying decisions to implement p2p and network services


                                               basware annual report 2016  35

execution of the growth strategy and going through constant change puts new demands on the organization as well as its
management and leadership capabilities the companys ability to attract retain and develop the right type of talent to
deliver on its strategy is critical as well as management focus and ability to drive change
basware considers acquisitions as part of its strategy acquisitions entails risks such as failure in integrating acquisitions
or in ensuring that the planned financial benefits and synergies of the acquisitions materialize

baswares biggest operational risks relate to service disruption as a result of for example data center failures various data
security threats and noncompliance risks related to baswares solutions and services the companys activities or its
employees behavior operational risks are actively managed by continuous improvement in risk monitoring and protection
practices as well as internal training of baswares personnel

basware operates in a market where technological and business model innovation play a key role while basware is
recognized as a leader within its segments by independent analysts it is critical that basware continues to innovate and
develop its offering

operating environment and market outlook
companies of all sizes globally are under pressure to improve their cash flows find new innovative payment strategies
and automate their financial processes and functions the company expects this to continue and the demand for services
to remain at a favorable level among its customers

companies portfolios according to industry research einvoicing has become more common and the number of einvoices
has grown substantially in europe and the rest of the world public sector ecommerce initiatives launched particularly
across the eu and the us are expected to drive further adoption of einvoicing the growing einvoicing market and
companies interest in other payment and financing added value solutions will offer excellent growth opportunities in future
years

  measurement presentation and disclosure of leases the standard provides a single lessee accounting model ifrs 16s

  future a compensation cost pursuant to ifrs 2 will be recognized for such payments based on the entire scheme being
  an equitysettled payment the compensation cost is thus recognized based on the number of gross shares awarded in

  ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers effective date january 1 2018 the standard provides a fivestep
  revenue recognition model revenue is recognized when control of the good or service sold is transferred to the customer
  the recognition model includes clearly more detailed instructions than the currently valid standards ias 11 construction
  contracts and ias 18 revenue which ifrs 15 will replace the new recognition model emphasizes identifying the
  performance obligations in customer contracts and the allocation of the transaction price to the identified performance
  obligations in addition the requirements for notes are significantly expanded

the groups estimate of the adoption of ifrs 15
an entity must apply either retrospective application or a modified approach for the financial period beginning on january 1
2018 the groups preliminary plan is to use retrospective application the group made a preliminary analysis of the impacts
of ifrs 15 during 2016 the impacts were assessed in joint meetings reviewing customer contracts in relation to the ifrs 15
revenue recognition model the understanding of the impacts will be detailed further based on extended analyses and
discussions with the management of the groups business areas the group will also take into account the further
specifications published by the iasb in april 2016 and continue to monitor the development of ifrs 15 in 2017

current revenue recognition principles of the group

the groups revenue streams are comprised of diverse transaction and monthly fees of einvoicing solutions license
consulting and service fees of purchasetopay software solutions and services and alliance fees of value added services
relating to financing services the group also provides customer support services to its customers

the group has assessed the customer contracts based on the above revenue streams based on the current revenue
recognition principles transaction revenue is recognized on the basis of actual transaction volumes and usage charges on a
monthly basis during the contract period startup fees are recognized as revenue when the work related to the startup
procedure has been completed and the customer has been connected to the service environment

license income relating to software deliveries are recognized when there is a binding contract proceeds from the contract
can be reliably specified the financial gain will benefit the company with sufficient probability and significant benefits and
risks related to ownership or rights of use of the product have been transferred to the buyer upon delivery maintenance
revenue is allocated over the contract period

service revenue is recognized at the time of delivery alliance fees from financingrelated value added services are
recognized as revenue when the related obligations have been performed revenue and costs of fixedprice consulting
projects are recognized as revenue and expense on the basis of the percentage of completion when the outcome of the
project can be reliably estimated

basware has identified the revenue streams with a significant risk of change when ifrs 15 is adopted and their revenue
recognition principles based on the preliminary analysis of contracts

the group will take into account the following matters in preparing for the adoption of ifrs 15

with regards to the sales of services identifying the performance obligation in the application of ifrs 15 requires that the
goods or services specified in the customer contract must be assessed at the time of concluding the contract and they must
be identified as performance obligations each performance obligation is based on a promise to transfer to the customer
either a a good or service or a bundle of goods or services that is distinct or b a series of distinct goods or services that
are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer

with regards to services and bundles of services transferred to customers the group takes into account that based on the
preliminary analysis some of the performance obligations currently considered distinct may form an entity recognized
together with another performance obligation no other significant impacts are expected to arise from the application of ifrs
15 in terms of revenues already recognized over the contract period or based on service use in these cases the customer
simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit from the entitys obligation as the entity performs the group expects that
a service is recognized over the contract period in the case of a fixedterm consulting contract but it will continue the analysis
of the terms and conditions of consulting service in general

the application of ifrs 15 also specifies the recognition of variable consideration in more detail the standard requires
estimating the probability of variable consideration already at the time of concluding the contract the group will continue to
analyze the timing of recognition of variable consideration from contracts

the adoption of ifrs 15 is not expected to result in significant changes in the timing of recognizing license revenues the
software licenses provided by the group are technically offtheshelf solutions

basware will continue the analysis of customer contracts in 2017 focusing on contracts in which the most significant risks of
changes relating to the adoption of ifrs 15 were identified to be able to quantify the impacts on the financial statements
during 2017 the group will also plan and implement the process for collecting the new disclosures required by the standard


                                                  basware annual report 2016  42

for the 2017 financial statements

with regards to the following standards amendments to standards and their interpretations the changes will not have a
significant impact on the groups future financial statements according to the groups current estimate and it will continue its
assessment of the impact of the changes

  ifrs 9 financial instruments effective date january 1 2018 ifrs 9 will completely replace the existing ias 39 financial
  instruments recognition and measurement standard in accordance with the ifrs 9 section on classification and
  measurement financial assets are classified and measured based on the entitys business model and contractual cash
  flows of financial assets the classification and measurement of financial liabilities primarily complies with the principles of
  the current ias 39 standard the hedge accounting model provides more opportunities for the application of hedge
  accounting thereby allows entities to reflect their risk management practices in more detail in financial statements the
  hedge effectiveness testing rules were revised and the new principles are based on financial dependence the impairment
  model pursuant to ias 39 was based on credit losses incurred while the new impairment model takes into account
  expected credit losses entities recognize the expected credit losses and changes in them in each reporting period so that
  changes in the credit risk after initial recognition are taken into consideration the standard will provide new disclosure
  requirements concerning the entitys risk management practices the group estimates that the changes will not have a
  significant impact on the groups future financial statements and it will continue to assess the impacts in 2017
  amendment to ias 12 income taxes recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses estimated effective date
  january 1 2017 the amendments concern the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses relating to
  changes in the fair value of availableforsale debt instruments the eu has not yet approved the amendments

  in the entitys cash flows from financing activities concerning both cash and noncash changes such as exchange gains
  and losses the eu has not yet approved the amendments

  standards are collected and adopted in the annual improvement procedure once a year the effects of the changes vary by
  standard the eu has not yet approved the amendments
  interpretation ifric 22 foreign currency transactions and advance consideration estimated effective date january 1
  2018 the interpretation clarifies the exchange rate to be used in receipt or in payment of advance consideration and in
  recognising equivalent nonmonetary asset or nonmonetary liability arising from the receipt or payment of advance
  consideration the nonmonetary asset or liability is valued by using the exchange rate when the nonmonetary balance
  sheet item is recognized the eu has not yet approved the amendments

recoverable amount of each cash generating unit cgu to which the goodwill relates when the recoverable amount of the
cgu is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised an assets recoverable amount is the higher of
cgus fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the entity specific risks impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods

borrowing costs

are due to an asset whose completion for the intended purpose or sale necessarily requires a considerably long time the
borrowing costs are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of the asset

leases

are to be held for less than 12 months they are disclosed as current assets financial assets measured at fair value through
profit or loss are classified as current assets

transaction costs are included in the acquisition cost of the financial assets when the item in question is not recognized at
fair value through profit or loss all purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized at the transaction date which is
the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the financial instruments

a financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired the group has transferred
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset

financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
a financial asset is grouped into the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category if it is acquired as held for
trading or it is designated as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition derivatives that are not eligible for
hedge accounting are classified as held for trading the assets are valued at fair value at the balance sheet date and the
change in value is recognized under finance income on the income statement

heldtomaturity investments
heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that
the group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity they are measured at amortized cost using the effective rate
method

loans and other receivables

quoted in an active market and are not held by the group with the intent to sell loan receivables and other receivables are
valued at amortized cost using the effective rate method they are included in current or noncurrent loan receivables trade
receivables and other receivables category on the balance sheet in accordance with their nature

availableforsale financial assets
availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets specifically designated to this group or not categorized
otherwise availableforsale financial assets are measured at fair value when the fair value cannot be reliably determined
they are measured at acquisition cost

changes in the fair value of availableforsale financial assets are entered in other comprehensive income and presented in
the fair value reserve taking into account the tax effect changes in fair value are transferred from other comprehensive
income to the income statement as adjustments when the instrument is sold or its value has decreased so that an impairment
loss has to be recognized for the instrument

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash shortterm bank deposits that can be withdrawn on demand and other current
highly liquid investments that can be exchanged to an amount of cash assets that is known in advance and with a low risk of
changes in value items classified as cash and cash equivalents have a maximum maturity of three months from acquisition

impairment of financial assets
the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial
assets is impaired an impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial recognition of the asset has
an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset that can be reliably estimated evidence of impairment
may include indications that the debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty default of payments the likelihood of
bankruptcy and delay of more than 180 days of a payment or other observable data indicating that there is a measurable
decrease in the estimated future cash flows if the amount of the impairment loss is decreased during a subsequent period
and the decrease can be objectively considered to be associated with an event after the impairment was recognized the
recognized loss is reversed through profit or loss

financial liabilities
financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value net of transaction cost subsequently financial liabilities excluding
derivative liabilities are valued at amortized cost using the effective interest method financial liabilities are classified as
noncurrent liabilities if they mature in more than 12 months liabilities maturing in less than 12 months are classified as
current



                                                   basware annual report 2016  46

derivates

measurement are treated in accounting as specified by the purpose of the derivative contract

at the inception of a hedge relationship the group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which it
wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge for cash flow
hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in oci in the cash flow hedge
reserve while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss amounts recognised as oci
are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss

goodwill is tested according to ias 36 basware does not possess any other intangible assets than goodwill that has
indefinite economical life unfinised intangible assets are also subjected to impairment testing during reporting period
impairment testing is carried out at group level as the basware has centralised steering model and reporting structure that
this goodwill is monited at group level internally

goodwill has been tested for impairment in the last quarter of 2016 the recoverable amounts from the cash generating
unit cgu are determined based on valueinuse calculations the calculations are prepared on a discounted cash flow
method basis derived from the management approved estimates for the following year and subsequent development
derived from the strategic plans cash flows beyond the 5year period are calculated using the terminal value method the
terminal growth rate of 2  used in projections is based on managements assessment on conservative long term growth
key driver for the valuation is the revenue growth based on groups performance and future strategic growth plans market
position as well as the potential in key markets

the applied discount rate is the weighted average pretax cost of capital wacc the components of the wacc are
riskfree rate market risk premium company specific factor and industry specific beta cost of debt and debtequity ratio
the wacc of 105  1038  has been used in the calculations there were no major changes in the assumptions
behind the calculation

as a result of the impairment test no impairment loss for the cgu were recognized for the financial periods ended 31
december 2016 and 2015 respectively the recoverable amount exceeds the total carrying amount of fixed assets

sensitivity analysis was conducted and there is no indications that the changes in the assumptions could be so substantial
that the carrying amount would exceed the recoverable amount in the future impairment testing is influenced by how the
group will meet the targets set for year 2020 in sensitive analysis was assessed the impacts of substantial changes in the
most significant assumptions like revenue growth ebit percentage as well as the discount rate

in determining the fair values of the financial assets andliabilities the following price quotations assumptions
and valuationmodels have been used

availableforsale financial assets
availableforsale financial assets consist of unlisted share investments valued at cost less any impairment therefore the
fair value of the investments cannot be specified reliably unlisted shares do not have an active market and the group
does not intend to give up these investments for the time being

trade and other receivables
the book value of trade and other receivables corresponds to their fair value as the effect of discounting is not substantial
taking into account the maturity of receivables

derivatives
the fair value of derivatives is determined on the basis of available market information

financial liabilities
the floating interest rates of bank loans are based on 1month euribor depending on the maturity of the loan therefore
the fair value of floating rate loans is considered to correspond to their book value

the fair value of finance leases is based on discounting future cash flows using an interest rate corresponding to the
interest rate of corresponding lease agreements

the maturity distribution of financial liabilities is presented in note 20

auditors report

to the annual general meeting of basware corporation


report on the audit of financial statements

opinion

we have audited the financial statements of basware corporation oyj business identity code 05925424 for the year ended
31 december 2016 the financial statements comprise the consolidated balance sheet statement of comprehensive income
statement of changes in equity statement of cash flows and notes including a summary of significant accounting policies as
well as the parent companys balance sheet income statement statement of cash flows and notes

in our opinion

  the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the groups financial position as well as its financial
  performance and its cash flows in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the
  eu
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the parent companys financial performance and financial position in
  accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in finland and comply with
  statutory requirements
basis for opinion

we conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in finland our responsibilities under good auditing
practice are further described in the auditors responsibilities for the audit of financial statements section of our report

we are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
applicable in finland and are relevant to our audit and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements

we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion

key audit matters

key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a
whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters

we have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section
of our report including in relation to these matters accordingly our audit included the performance of procedures designed to
respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements the results of our audit
procedures including the procedures performed to address the matters below provide the basis for our audit opinion on the
accompanying financial statements

we have also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls this includes consideration of whether there
was evidence of management bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud

goodwill impairment assessment

refer to accounting principles note 1 and goodwill note 4

at the balance sheet date the value of goodwill amounted to eur 97 million representing 43  of total assets and 73  of
total equity we focused on this area due to the size of the goodwill balance and because the managements annual
impairment test involves judgments about the future results of the business and the discount rates applied to future cash flow
forecasts

our audit procedures included amongst other

  comparing the groups accounting policies of impairment testing with applicable accounting standards
  involving valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the group including
  those related to forecast revenue cost and discount rates by adjusting for future events and corroborating the key market
  related assumptions to external data
  reviewing the sensitivity in the available headroom by cash generating unit and focusing on whether any reasonably


                                                 basware annual report 2016  87

  possible change in assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount
  comparing the historical forecasting of the group with actual outcome and comparing projections to the latest board
  approved budgets
  checking the mathematical accuracy of the underlying calculations
we compared the groups disclosures related to impairment tests in note 4 in the financial statements with presentation
requirements in applicable accounting standards

recognition of revenue

refer to accounting principles note 1 and operating segments note 2

we focused on this area as a key audit matter due to the risk of incorrect timing of revenue recognition revenue is
recognized when the risk and rewards of the underlying products or services have been transferred to the customer due to
the multitude and variety of contractual terms across the groups markets there is a risk that revenue may be misstated the
group focuses on revenue as a key performance measure

our audit procedures included amongst other

  comparing the groups accounting policies over revenue recognition with applicable accounting standards
  obtaining understanding of the revenue recognition processes and their consistent application and testing groups controls
  on revenue recognition
  assessing the correct period for the revenue recognized by testing cutoff with substantive analytical procedures
  supplemented with test of transactions either side of the balance sheet date
we compared the groups disclosures over revenue recognition in note 2 with presentation requirements in applicable
accounting standards

acquisition of verian

refer to accounting principles note 1 and acquired businesses note 3

 during the financial year 2016 group acquired verian for purchase consideration of eur 32 million this was considered a
significant purchase for the group

we focused on this area as a key audit matter as the accounting for transaction was complex and included judgmental
matters like determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities in particular determining the allocation of purchase
consideration to separately identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts and relationships and goodwill

our procedures included amongst others

  comparing the groups accounting policies over business combinations with requirements in applicable accounting
  standards
  evaluating the assumptions and methodology of managements value in use model such as forecast revenues operating
  costs and contributory assets which were used to determine the value of verian contracts and relationships to the group
  engaging valuation specialists to compare these valuation assumptions with external benchmarks for example discount
  rates and to assess underlying assumptions based on our knowledge of the group and its industries
we compared the groups disclosures related to business acquisitions in note 3 in the financial statements with presentation
requirements in applicable accounting standards

responsibilities of the board of directors and the managing director for the financial statements

 the board of directors and the managing director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements
that give a true and fair view in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the eu
and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the
preparation of financial statements in finland and comply with statutory requirements the board of directors and the
managing director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error

in preparing the financial statements the board of directors and the managing director are responsible for assessing the
parent companys and the groups ability to continue as going concern disclosing as applicable matters relating to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting the financial statements are prepared using the going concern
basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or cease operations or there is
no realistic alternative but to do so


                                                 basware annual report 2016  88

auditors responsibilities for the audit of financial statements

our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if individually or in aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of the financial statements

as part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit we also

  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to fraud or error design and
  perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
  basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
  from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal
  control
  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
  the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent companys or the
  groups internal control
  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
  disclosures made by management
  conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors and the managing directors use of the going concern basis of
  accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
  that may cast significant doubt on the parent companys or the groups ability to continue as a going concern if we
  conclude that a material uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related
  disclosures in the financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our opinion our conclusions are
  based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report however future events or conditions may
  cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern
  evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements including the disclosures and whether
  the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and
  fair view
  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within
  the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements we are responsible for the direction supervision
  and performance of the group audit we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion



we communicate with those charged with governance regarding among other matters the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit

we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to
bear on our independence and where applicable related safeguards

from the matters communicated with those charged with governance we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters we describe
these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when in
extremely rare circumstances we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication

other reporting requirements

statements and our report thereon we obtained the report of the board of directors prior to the date of the auditors report
