im viewing company initiatives from the perspective
of consumers and i feel that the retail industry plays
the largest role in educating consumers as to why csr
activities are important and why they are being carried
out consumers shop at stores on a daily basis if aeon can
convey social issues and its initiatives simply and concisely
so as to help consumers select certain products it can
change consumption patterns and change lifestyles this is
the kind of huge potential the retail industry has
sueyoshi
every day millions of consumers are buying millions
of things when it come to food for example it is very
important to inform consumers about todays problems
facing the earth which provides us with sustenance
through nature at the same time such efforts should also        in kpi up to 2020 and a plan known as big challenge 2020
be important for aeons approach to business sustainability       see p10 this includes actions for which efforts will be
as a retailer earlier we heard how aeon intends to integrate     bolstered in the future and actions we have not been able
csr activities with corporate management a story is a key        to focus on despite their importance of these we selected
in this instance such as aeon is carrying out these activities   the aeon eco project sustainable procurement the next
because its own business model would not survive without          10 million trees and zero waste as actions on which to
a sustainable society                                            concentrate our efforts

thank you for pointing that out decisions are made based         i believe that aeons csr activities having passed through
on various discussions and debate that take place within          the phase of individual initiatives for each issue following
aeon when we share things with people outside the                the aeon basic principles and aeon sustainability principle
company we tend to say things like we will do this or we     are currently in the phase where solutions to environmental
did that i think we get a little weak in the knees if someone   and social issues are beginning to be incorporated into core
questions whether our activities really incorporate holistic      business processes or the phase where certain initiatives
medium to longterm perspectives on environmental                are beginning to be utilized as the core of a differentiation
and social issues well reflect this in our future information   strategy to further accelerate this trend aeon has decided
sharing                                                          to tackle the challenge of integrating csr activities with

     as disasterprevention facilities                                 meeting on the revised freon act where i heard that little
     edahiro                                                           progress has been made in introducing this equipment
     i believe its a great aeonlike initiative but i feel having    because the cost is too high this is why i would like aeon
     the role of disasterprevention facilities included within the     to take the lead and show others its possible
     realm of eco seems a bit out of place                           kanamaru
     kanamaru                                                          thank you we announced the aeon natural refrigerants
     we were also concerned about how this would fit so we             declaration see p42 in november 2011 it states that we
     set up the framework called smart aeon to introduce our            will use natural refrigerants in every new stores to open
     efforts                                                           from fy 2015 onward and steadily changeover to natural

     i have a proposal ive recently spoken a lot about resilience     few manufacturers that offer this equipment which has
     as an initiative to defeat global warming and mitigate             contributed to the problem of high costs but the ministry
     natural disasters aeon should organize activities around          of the environment has a subsidy program in place that we
     this key word as it develops the ability to flexibly overcome      will utilize
     any situation in each community                                   edahiro
     sueyoshi                                                          id like aeon to help lobby other manufacturers to begin
     disasterprevention facilities originated from the great east      using this technology
     japan earthquake when aeon stores were made available              partⅳ sustainable procurement
     to the public as evacuation shelters a gesture much               formulating policy based on both business
     appreciated by local communities from my perspective
                                                                        and the environment
     as an outside director the aeon eco project is a condition
     for being competitive as aeon competes with other stores
     in each community what kind of competitive advantages             next lets look at the theme of sustainable procurement
     can aeon leverage traditionally this has taken the form          in 2014 aeon announced the aeon sustainable
     of prices taste and design but now aeon is marketing its        procurement principles and aeon sustainable seafood
     value in terms of the environment and disaster mitigation         procurement policy
     aeon will truly achieve its goal of csr activities integrated
     with corporate management when this value is recognized            kanamaru
     by consumers and translates into improved business                 a little earlier mr sueyoshi pointed out that the loss of
     performance                                                       natures bounty is a serious issue for aeon this is the truth
     oishi                                                             and using the example of seafood today the stock of many

13   aeon environmental and social report 2015

in europe and north america highend grocery stores carry
a large number of ecofriendly product and consumers
too know a lot about these issues which has formed a
consumer trend in contrast i feel that japanese retailers
tend to place lowpriced items in highly visible places
placing msccertified items in highly visible locations is
something positive for both raising consumer awareness
and increasing revenues over the medium to long term
yamanashi
that certainly seems like the case the retail industry is a
world where you can tell whether you win or lose against
the competition in a matter of hours this tends to focus           reforested areas we have had to carry out thinning to some
your attention only on whats in front of you such as the          extent this is why we have begun developing products
inclination to compete on prices therefore i believe a great      from this thinned wood and have worked with npos on a
challenge for the retail industry to overcome is how we             trial basis to develop successors for the forestry business see
can surmount the dilemma presented by the gap between               p52 as part of our use of forest resources we are building
eternal principles and daytoday reality                          stores for ministop using fsccertified materials sourced

given this dilemma aeon has been working on carrying               stores built to date
certified products since back in 2006 this is something i can      sueyoshi
commend and i really hope that other retailers will mimic           id like more people to know about this initiative what
                                    aeons approach at the         if you made it possible for customers to see the inside
                                    same time i want to know       structure of a store
                                    just how much the sales of      edahiro
                                    certified seafood products      that would help to raise awareness and serve as
                                    contribute to reducing          environmental education incidentally about how much
                                    resource depletion and          co2 does one tree absorb id like to know just how positive
                                    the extent to which we          the effects of 10 million trees over 20 years can have on

                                    considered to face              kanamaru
                                    depletion i believe aeon       we ask a thirdparty to calculate this and regularly report
                                    can gain further trust if it    the results aeons trees are intended to help fulfill our basic
                                    issued a report detailing its   principles by sharing the importance of nature and peace in
activities because of our dependence on marine resources            society with the local community instead of just reducing
and the impacts of certified products as well as the                co2 this is why we havent really emphasize the numbers
achievements made to date                                          overall
kanamaru                                                           sueyoshi
thank you we will continue to expand the number of                 after becoming an outside director i found out that the
certified products going forward and try our best to                roots of aeons tree planting efforts could be traced back to
report on the impacts of these efforts i feel that sharing         the 1980s when honorary chairman okada was scared by
information on dependence and impacts needs to be                   the prospect of losing the natural environment
utilized in other initiatives too                                 oishi

moving on lets examine the topic of the next 10 million          this threat has continued for 20 years it can easily be said
trees since planting its 10 millionth tree in 2013 aeon           that this now forms a part of aeons dna therefore if there
has been bolstering its efforts to develop and utilize              was a new meaning from our efforts for the next 10 million
these resources                                                    trees it would not be for biodiversity or preventing global

     of plastic bags and collection of recyclables of more              with community stakeholders to grow together therefore

     initiative because this is such a great initiative i
     would like aeon to share its definition of waste
     the extent to which its activities cover the
     supply chain and what is the overall progress
     that has been made which i touched upon
     earlier

     i would also like aeon to be more consumer
     centric such as providing clear information to

     different from zero waste how is aeon
     addressing the issue of food waste

to conserve energy generate energy and provide disaster                  japan as a whole and especially its rural areas is heading
prevention facilities for the community while products are                into a time period of declining population where certain
of high quality and safety rooted in sustainability and the                sectors will not be able to succeed businesswise therefore
lifestyle of the community human resource development                     i thought it was rather compelling to hear the words
and governance provide something else in this manner                     emphasize the community of course this is more difficult
each of aeons efforts can be categorized                                 to achieve than the words indicate nevertheless i would

i agree with the view that aeon overall is getting smarter                such a large role as a form of social infrastructure
earlier i spoke about resilience and the power to overcome                 yamanashi
challenges in a flexible manner resilience in terms of the                today we heard about the perspective of why we do
tangible and intangible as mr yamanashi spoke about                      something and why we share the results the perspective of
connections with stakeholders i would like aeon to further                providing information to consumers and the perspective
emphasize its relationships with people in the community i                that aeon should get smarter and become a resilience
hope smart aeon with its tangible and intangible forms of                 center based on these views i hope to help aeon move
resilience can become a resilience center for communities                 closer to realizing its vision of an ecosystem thank you very

     targets for fy2020 and is carrying out various initiatives to                          strategies for reducing energy use
     achieve those targets the aeon eco project was formulated and
     published in september 2012 based on power saving measures                            aeon stores consume a large volume of energy mainly in
     implemented by various means in order to accommodate the                              airconditioning and lighting as well as freezer and refrigeration

     due to the march 2011 great east japan earthquake the project                        well as other countries in asia reducing co2 emissions from stores
     incorporates a protection strategy in addition to targets that aim                    plays a key role in reducing emissions for the entire company that
     to conserve energy and save power such as strategies for                             makes it all the more important for us to focus on reducing co2 in
     reducing energy use that promote smart use of energy to                               our stores therefore we are actively promoting measures such as
     conserve it and strategies for generating energy to produce                          converting store lighting to led and improving energy
     renewable energy primarily solar power generation this aims to                      conservation management based on an energy conservation
     turn stores into disaster prevention facilities to function as                        checklist as we strive to reduce energy consumption

     realization of a lowcarbon society
     management approach

     recognition of challenges
     global warming which is causing the temperature of oceans to rise and airborne temperatures around the world to increase is having
     serious consequences on our environment including ecosystem change coastal erosion caused by rising water levels and abnormal
     weather the cause of global warming is greenhouse gases and among them carbon dioxide co2 accounts for a major share aeon
     operates 18740 stores in 13 countries around the world and uses a large amount of energy for this reason we are working through
     various activities with the realization of a lowcarbon society with fewer co2 emissions set as one of our key issues

     aeons approach
     the largest source of co2 emissions from aeons business activities is store operations therefore aeon is devoting efforts to reducing
     its co2 footprint by curbing energy usage with the use of more efficient air conditioners lighting and refrigeratorfreezer cases
     currently the entire aeon group is carrying out the aeon eco project established in september 2012 in order to reach its energy
     saving and energy generating targets set for fy2020
      energy saving strategy reduce energy usage 50 compared to fy2010 by rolling out nextgeneration eco stores called smart aeon
        establishing the energy advisor system and striving to improve the ability of stores to manage their energy usage
      energy generation strategy create renewable energy in the amount of 200000 kw of output using mainly solar power systems by
        fy2020 by installing solar power systems onsite at stores
          we are also working on the visualization of co2 emission amounts and using joint shipping with other companies in an effort to
     decrease co2 emission during the distribution phase

     future initiatives
     in july 2015 the government of japan finalized a goal to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26 compared to fy2013 by the
     year 2030 to contribute to reaching this goal aeon will continue to engage in the aeon eco project and will begin sharing its energy
     management expertise developed in japan at its subsidiaries in china and asean




           aeon eco project

           in the form of our aeon eco project aeon set in september 2012 environmental targets for                                                              aeon
           fy2020 and is carrying out various initiatives to achieve those targets with current
           increasing needs for energy use efficiency and power conservation and with the experience                                                              project
           of the great east japan earthquake aeon has added perspectives of reducing energy use
           and developing renewable energy to environmental protection and has additionally taken
           on a clear role as a lifeline center protecting the community in disasters and emergencies                                     reduction             generation               protection

     key issue 2


     conservation of biodiversity
     management approach

     recognition of challenges
     all companies harness ecosystem services leveraging the resources produced by our ecosystem in each phase of the lifecycle from
     the sourcing of raw materials to production sales use and disposal at the same time however the world continues to lose its tropical
     forests while the number of fauna and flora found on the red list of endangered species continues to grow unabated also aeons
     business operations cannot be sustained without the ecosystem services of agricultural produce and marine products which is why
     aeon continues to work on various initiatives for the sustainable use of resources with biodiversity conservation considered one of the
     key issues

     aeons approach
     in march 2010 aeon established the aeon biodiversity principle in order to continually promote the sustainable use of resources while
     conserving biodiversity following the action guidelines stipulated for this principle aeon is working together with customers through
     its products and stores
      initiatives for products we have been working to source and sell products that are mindful of ecosystem sustainability such as
        offering msc certified products from 2006 and selling notepads made from fsc certified paper from 2008 in order to further
        reinforce these activities in february 2014 we devised the aeon sustainable procurement principle and the aeon sustainable seafood
        procurement policy for the sourcing of sustainable sources of marine produce
      initiatives at stores biodiversity has been incorporated into the standards for smart aeon nextgeneration eco stores and aeon is
        expanding its use of fsc certified wood products as construction materials for ministop stores these efforts form our commitment to
        create stores that have a minimum impact on the ecosystem as well as the surrounding environment
          the aeon hometown forests program launched as an activity to share the importance of nature and world peace with members
     of the local community has continued for more than two decades since 1991 under this initiative whenever we open a new store we
     plant trees on the site of the store together with customers thus far we have planted more than 10 million trees and we are working
     on activities under the themes plant nurture and thrive aimed at the next 10 million trees

     future initiatives
     environmental agencies and the conference of parties cop under the convention on biological diversity are working to make
     biodiversity mainstream through various social and economic activities promoting the protection of biodiversity and its sustainable
     use from a worldwide to local community consequently aeon will utilize its business characteristic of coming into contact with
     vast numbers of consumers on a daily basis to continually highlight the importance of biodiversity through the familiar platforms of
     stores and products as part of this in fy2015 aeon steadily expanded its lineup of topvalu gurinal products and is now working on
     devising a procurement policy for forest resources following the aeon sustainable seafood procurement policy

     management approach

     recognition of challenges
     the worlds population continues to grow many believe it will increase from the current 7 billion to 9 billion by the year 2050
     meanwhile the issues of hunger and poverty continue to plague developing countries the only way to improve the living standards
     of people around the world in a sustainable manner is to make sure that the earths limited resources are used effectively and
     responsibly aeon generates food waste through its business and is also tied to waste produced by customers after the use of plastic
     bags and food containers this is why we are working on various activities for the better use of resources as one of our key issues

     aeons approach
     aeon launched the bring your own shopping bag campaign back in 1991 and has changed the specifications and formats of
     packaging materials as part of its ongoing efforts aimed at the responsible use of resources in 2000 the bring your own shopping bag
     campaign developed into the my basket campaign where customer bring their own shopping basket and in 2007 aeon was the first
     nationwide retailer to eliminate free plastic bags at the register illustrating its many pioneering initiatives over the years as a result of
     these initiatives as of february 28 2015 some 675 of aeon customers decline plastic shopping bags greatly exceeding the industry
     wide average of 513 as of march 2015 aeon established a goal to achieve zero waste reduction of landfill waste to zero at its
     stores by fy2020 given the rising demand in society to reduce waste and began stepping up its initiatives food waste a growing
     social issue has also been established as a priority kpi

     future initiatives
     the reduction of garbage and food waste was included as a goal within the sustainable development goals report issued by the
     united nations in 2014 additionally japan is set to tighten related regulations as well including the food recycling law and waste
     management and public cleansing act given this rising demand from society the aeon group will consolidate the individual activities
     of its companies and regions during fy2015 and establish a common aeon group infrastructure after organizing the basic approach
     case studies and indicators of these activities starting in fy2016 aeons subsidiaries will begin to set individual targets and carry out
     efforts to achieve them
