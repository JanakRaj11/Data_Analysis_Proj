chairmans statement

dear distinguished shareholders

it is with great pleasure that i present to you our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 a year in which we
made significant progress on the successful implementation of our transformation strategy

for the second consecutive year we recorded improved earnings well above the industry average across key indices we also
recorded exponential growth in our profit before tax pbt and profit after tax pat performance enablingthe board to fulfil
the commitment made to shareholders at our 2014 annual general meeting and recommend a dividend payment for approval at
this meeting


global economic environment
the year 2015 recorded declining global output growth with both advanced and emerging economies suffering deteriorating
economic conditions the united states of america usa and the united kingdom uk however stood out as notable economic
growth nodes both the international monetary fund imf and the world bank had to make downward revisions to their growth
forecasts particularly given the sustained fall in crude oil prices which reached its lowest level in over a decade


operating environment
the decline in economic growth largely driven by the fall in crude oil prices which began in 2014 continued into 2015 with gross
domestic product gdp falling to a low of 235 in the fourth quarter of 2015

the financial markets responded negatively to the central bank of nigerias protectionist stance vis a vis the naira leading to
significant volatility in the equity and debt markets bearish sentiments dominated activities on the nigerian stock exchange all
share index which declined by 1737 to close at 2864245 for the year inflationary pressures began to reflect in consumer prices
with analysts predicting that inflation rates will close above 10

following his historic electoral victory in the march  2015 presidential elections president muhammadu buhari resumed office
demonstrating a strong resolve to address issues of corruption and insecurity in nigeria the president also began to effect changes
in the leadership of key public institutions including the national insurance commission naicom where alhaji mohammed
kari was appointed as the commissioner for insurance in july 2015 the new commissioner has intensified regulatory supervision
adopting a zero tolerance approach to compliance infractions during the year naicom introduced the prudential guidelines for
insurers and reinsurers in nigeria and the market conduct and business practice guidelines for insurance institutions in nigeria
which took effect in 2015


financial performance
you will be pleased to learn that despite the inclement operating environment our market share growth continued to outpace the
industry average our gross written premium gwp grew by 36 from n52billion in 2014 to n71billion in 2015 the drivers of
this performance include the following


growth in market share

     we have completed a detailed consumer research survey which we commissioned to gain deep insight and better understanding
     of consumer needs and opportunities within nigeria and ghana insights from this consumer research survey are being used to
     develop innovative products for our customers across specific segments simultaneously we have enhanced the features benefits
     and branding of our entire bouquet of compulsory products

     branding

     following the launch of our new corporate identity in 2014 we have implemented a number of initiatives to make our brand
     more recognizable and appealing to our target market we have also taken steps to ensure our brand values are internalized by all
     employees and key partners


     underwriting performance
     operational efficiency

     we recorded a 12 improvement in our underwriting performance this was driven largely by our new risk based pricing and
     efficient risk selection criteria we continue to maintain high solvency margins well above regulatory requirements as well as
     robust reinsurance arrangements

     claims payment

     in 2014 we initiated a comprehensive review of all outstanding claims in our books with a view to ensuring that by december
     2014 they had all been paid this meant that wapic was well ahead of naicoms 2015 directive for insurance companies to ensure
     payment of all outstanding claims by september 2015 we believe that insurance companies have a moral and fiduciary duty to
     ensure customers claims are processed and paid in the shortest time possible


     investment performance
     we recorded very strong investment performance in 2015 whilst our investment strategy ensures that our insurance liabilities
     are matched against investments in highly liquid assets our shareholders funds are invested in a slightly more aggressive portfolio
     of assets which include public and nonpublic equity investments structured to deliver above market returns this strategy has
     seen us become the largest shareholder in coronation merchant bank limited an emerging leader in the merchant and investment
     banking subsector which is generating outstanding returns to your company

     chief executives statement

     introduction

     the chairman distinguished shareholders ladies
     and gentlemen it is my pleasure to be present
     at this occasion and to present a report on the
     activities of wapic insurance plc however
     before doing so i will like to give a brief report
     on the economic and regulatory environment in
     which the company operated in the twelve 12
     months of 2015

     the year 2015 posed serious challenges for the
     nigerian business environment as it witnessed
     the conduct of a general election that heralded
     the transition of political power from the ruling
     party to the opposition the heightened tension
     and obvious retraction of business within the
     first quarter of the year posed serious concerns
     however there was a little reprieve as the change
     of power went on smoothly without violence or
     business disruption

     this period was followed by uncertainty within
     the economy the fall in the price of crude oil at
     the international market and its impact on the
     revenue earnings of the federal government and
     its abilities to meet the import requirements in
     terms of foreign exchange posed serious concerns

     in spite of these challenges your companys gross written premium gwp growth of 37 was well above the industry
     average of 12 the company also showed its sustained strength with the am best rating of b on financial strength fsr
     and bb on issuer credit rating strength with a stable outlook this makes wapic the 3rd nigerian insurer to achieve an
     international rating

     regulatory environment

     the regulatory environment has been very supportive  since the enforcement of the no premium no cover policy by national
     insurance commission naicom operators in the industry have experienced improved cash flow as customers begin to align
     their business decisions with the policy guidelines

     the regulator has established minimum operating standards in the conduct of insurance business in nigeria with the release of
     the revised operational and business conduct guidelines in july 2015 this is intended to harmonize and bring greater sanity into
     the insurance business operations in the country

     in line with the vision to prepare the nigerian insurance industry for the leadership positon in the emerging market the
     regulators are in the process of reviewing the insurance act in order to align the insurance industry with the expectations
     of the global economies

     risk management

     introduction and overview
     wapic insurance plc recognizes the role of enterprise risk management practices in achieving her strategic vision of being
     a leading insurance company in nigeria the group has a wellestablished risk governance structure and an experienced
     risk team our risk management framework provides essential tools to enable us take timely and informed decisions to
     maximize opportunities and mitigate potential threats

     our approach to risk management
     risk is an inherent part of wapic insurance plc the company and its subsidiary companies the group business
     activities wapics overall risk tolerance is established in the context of the groups earning power capital and diversified
     business model effective risk management is critical to any insurance company for achieving financial soundness based
     on the foregoing aligning risk management to the companys organizational structure and business strategy has become
     an integral part of our business wapic insurance plcs risk management framework and governance structure are intended
     to provide comprehensive controls and management of the major risks inherent in its business activities it is also intended
     to create a culture of risk awareness and personal responsibility group wide

     in addition to the monitoring of the risk types the risk correlation between risk types is also being monitored to ensure
     that the interrelationships between risk types are kept within moderate level where appropriate underwriting and
     investment standards have been tightened to mitigate against higher level of market volatility and economic uncertainty
     the group regularly subjects its exposures to a range of stress tests across a wide variety of products currencies portfolios
     profitability and customer segments

     the groups risk management architecture is carefully crafted to balance corporate oversight with welldefined risk
     management functions which fall within any of the three categories where risk must be managed lines of business
     governance and control and corporate audit the board of directors and management of the company are committed
     to constantly establishing implementing and sustaining tested practices in risk management to match those of leading
     international insurance companies we are convinced that the longterm sustainability of our group depends critically on
     the proper governance and effective management of our business as such risk management occupies a significant position
     of relevance and importance in the group

     the board of directors determines wapic insurance plcs overall risk objectives by issuing risk policies these policies
     define acceptable levels of risk for daytoday operations as well as the willingness of wapic to assume risk weighed against
     the expected rewards the umbrella risk policy is detailed in the enterprise risk management erm framework which is
     a structured approach to identifying opportunities assessing the risk inherent in these opportunities and actively managing
     these risks in a costeffective manner it is a toplevel integrated approach to events identification and analysis for proper
     assessment monitoring and identification of business opportunities specific risk policies are also in place for managing
     risks in the different core risk areas of underwriting claims credit market and operational risks as well as for other key
     risks such as liquidity strategic and reputational risk

     the evolving nature of risk management practices and the dynamic nature of the insurance industry require regular review
     of the effectiveness of each enterprise risk management component in the light of the above the groups erm framework
     is subject to continuous review to ensure effective and cuttingedge risk management the review is done in either or both
     of the following ways via continuous selfevaluation and monitoring by the risk management and compliance functions
     in conjunction with internal audit and through independent evaluation by external auditors examiners and consultants
     the groups management has primary responsibility for risk management and the review of the erm framework and to
     provide robust challenge based on quantitative and qualitative metrics all amendments to the groups erm framework
     require board approval the risk management division is responsible for the enforcement of the groups risk policy by
     constantly monitoring risk with the aim of identifying and quantifying significant risk exposures and acting upon such
     exposures as necessary

     overall we view risk not only as a threat or uncertainty but also as a potential opportunity to grow and develop the
     business within the context of our clearly articulated and board driven risk appetite

                                                                                                           annual report  accounts




hence our approach to risk management is not limited to considering downside impacts or risk avoidance it also
encompasses taking risk knowingly for competitive advantage wapic insurance plc approaches risk capital and value
management robustly and we believe that our initiatives to date have positioned the group at the leading edge of risk
management



risk management philosophy culture appetite and objectives


risk management philosophy and culture
risk management is at the core of the operating structure of the group we ensure that we limit adverse variations in
earnings and capital by managing risk exposures within our moderate risk appetite our risk management approach
includes minimizing undue concentrations of exposure limiting potential losses from stress events and the prudent
management of liquidity

in 2015 our risk management practice continued to achieve desired results despite the increase in size and scale of
operations hence management has remained closely involved with risk management initiatives which have focused on
preserving appropriate levels of capital and liquidity as well as managing the risk inherent in the portfolios

risk management is integral to the groups decisionmaking and management process it is embedded in the role of all
employees to ensure congruence with organizational culture thus enhancing the quality of decision making across board
the group considers risk management philosophy and culture as the set of shared beliefs values attitudes and practices
that characterize how the group considers risk in everything it does from strategy development and implementation to its
daytoday activities in this regard the groups risk management philosophy is that a moderate and guarded risk attitude
ensures sustainable growth in shareholder value and reputation

the group believes that enterprise risk management provides the superior capabilities to identify and assess the full
spectrum of risks and to enable staff at all levels better understand and manage risks this will ensure that

     risk acceptance is done in a responsible manner

group risk oversight approach
our oversight starts with the strategy setting and business planning process these plans help us articulate our appetite for
risk which is then set as risk appetite limits for each business unit to work within

the groups risk management division provides a central oversight of risk management across the group to ensure that the
full spectrum of risks facing the group are properly identified measured monitored and controlled in order to minimize
adverse outcomes

the division is complemented by the financial control strategy pmo and compliance group in the management of capital
management strategic and compliance risks respectively

the chief risk officer coordinates the process of monitoring and reporting risks across the group internal audit has the
responsibility of auditing the risk management and control function to ensure that all units charged with risk management
perform their roles effectively on a continuous basis audit also tests the adequacy of internal control and makes appropriate
recommendations where there are weaknesses


strategy and business planning
risk management is embedded in our business strategy and planning cycle testament to this is the inclusion of risk
management as one of our strategic priorities by setting the business and risk strategy we are able to determine appropriate
capital allocation and target setting for the group and each of our businesses

all business units are required to consider the risk implications of their annual plans these plans include analysis of the
impact of objectives on risk exposure throughout the year we monitored business performance regularly focusing both
on financial performance and risk exposure the aim is to continue the process of integrating risk management into the
planning and management process and to facilitate informed decisions

through ongoing review the links between risk appetite risk management and strategic planning are embedded in the
business so that key decisions are made in the context of the risk appetite for each business unit


risk appetite
risk appetite is an articulation and allocation of the risk capacity or quantum of risk the company is willing to accept in
pursuit of its strategy duly set and monitored by the executive committee and the board and integrated into our strategy
business risk and capital plans risk appetite reflects the groups capacity to sustain potential losses arising from a range
of potential outcomes under different stress scenarios

the group defines its risk appetite in terms of both volatility of earnings and the maintenance of minimum regulatory
capital requirements under stress scenarios




                                                                                                                                       43

 wapic insurance plc annual report  accounts 2015




     our risk appetite can be expressed in terms of how much variability of return the group is prepared to accept in order to
     achieve a desired level of result it is determined by considering the relationship between risk and return we measure
     and express risk appetite qualitatively and in terms of quantitative risk metrics the quantitative metrics include earnings
     at risk or earnings volatility and related to this the chance of regulatory insolvency chance of experiencing a loss and
     economic capital adequacy these comprise our group level risk appetite metrics in addition a large variety of risk limits
     triggers ratios mandates targets and guidelines are in place for all the financial risks eg credit market and asset and
     liability management risks

     the groups risk profile is assessed through a bottomup analytical approach covering all of the groups major businesses
     subsidiaries and products the risk appetite is approved by the board and forms the basis for establishing the risk
     parameters within which the businesses must operate including policies concentration limits and business mix

     prompt corrective actions key issues were also escalated to the board risk management committee

     we seek to minimize exposure to operational risk subject to cost tradeoffs operational risk exposures are managed through a
     consistent set of management processes that drive risk identification assessment control and monitoring

     the goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of our businesses the markets in which we
     operate our capital and liquidity and the competitive economic and regulatory environment notwithstanding these controls
     wapic group incurs operational losses

     our operational risk strategy seeks to minimize the impact that operational risk can have on shareholders value


     the companys strategy is to

          reduce the likelihood of occurrence of expected events and related cost by managing the risk factors and implementing
           loss prevention or reduction techniques to reduce variation to earnings
          minimize the impact of unexpected and catastrophic events and related costs through risk financing strategies that
           will support the companys long term growth cash flow management and balance sheet protection
          eliminate bureaucracy improve productivity reduce capital requirements and improve overall performance through
           the institution of well designed and implemented internal controls

     in order to create and promote a culture that emphasizes effective operational risk management and adherence to operating
     controls there are three distinct levels of operational risk governance structure in wapic insurance plc

       level 1
       refers to the oversight function carried out by the board of directors board risk committee and the executive management
       responsibilities at this level include ensuring effective management of operational risk and adherence to the approved
       operational risk policies

       level 2
       refers to the management function carried out by operational risk management group it has direct responsibility for
       formulating and implementing the groups operational risk management framework including methodologies policies
       and procedures approved by the board

       level 3
       refers to the operational function carried out by all business units and support functions in the group these
       unitsfunctions are fully responsible and accountable for the management of operational risk in their respective units
       they work in liaison with operational risk management to define and review controls to mitigate identified risks internal
       audit provides independent assessment and evaluation of the groups operational risk management framework this
       periodic confirmation of the existence and utilization of controls in compliance with approved policies and procedures
       provide assurance as to the effectiveness of the groups operational risk management framework importantly the
       tools used to assess measure and monitor operational risks in the group include but not limited to a loss database of
       operational risk events an effective risk and control selfassessment process that helps to analyze business activities and
       identify operational risks that could affect the achievement of business objectives and key risk indicators which are used
       to monitor operational risks on an ongoing basis


     the groups operational risk framework
     the groups current operational risk framework was implemented to meet internal and regulatory requirements there has been
     significant investment in the implementation of improved measurement and management approaches for operational risk to
     strengthen control improve customer service improve process efficiencies and minimize operating losses the group recognizes
     the fact that it is neither costeffective nor possible to attempt to eliminate all operational risks


     events of small significance are thus expected to occur and are accepted as inevitable with relevant budgeting for these losses
     being exercised where appropriate events of material significance are limited and the group seeks to reduce the risk from these
     extreme events in a framework consistent with its agreed risk appetite processes are in place to monitor management and future

     trade receivables are shortterm in nature consisting of a large number of policyholders and are subject to moderate credit
     risk the group categorizes its exposure to this risk based on business sources namely agents brokers and insurance
     companies and periodically reviews trade receivable to ensure credit worthiness

     credit risk exposure to trade receivables arises from the 30 days window given by naicom in the no premium no cover
     npnc policy this gives brokers the latitude to withhold premiums collected from insured for 30 day however they
     are expected to issue their credit note and remit the premiums at the expiration of the 30 days grace period brokers who
     fails to remit are reported on quarterly basis to naicom and are subject to the downgrading process in the groups credit
     policy guide the groups risk exposure to credit risk is low as the receipt of insurance premium from the insured is a pre
     condition for the issuance of insurance cover

fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
the group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss therefore
a change in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would not affect profit or loss

fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
the group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss therefore
a change in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would not affect profit or loss

or decreased by 100 basis points with all other variables held constant

foreign exchange risk
foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in
foreign exchange rates

foreign exchange risk exposure of the groups financial condition is due to adverse movements in exchange rates the
group is exposed to foreign exchange currency risk primarily through transactions denominated in foreign currency the
group is also exposed to foreign currency fluctuation in its investments in unquoted equity dollardenominated bond
instruments fixed deposits and bank balances in other foreign currencies

the groups foreign exchange risk is considered at a group level since an effective overview of such risk is a critical element
of the groups assetliability risk management the board of directors defines its risk tolerance levels and expectations for
foreign exchange risk management and ensures that the risk is maintained at prudent levels

both the central bank of nigeria and bank of ghana came up with different foreign exchange restriction policies due to the
persistent weakening of the naira and cedi in 2015 prominent of these policies are the highly debated 41item list banned
from obtaining foreign exchange at the interbank segment and the embargo placed on foreign currency denominated cash
deposits these policies increased the volatility in the parallel market as almost all transactions tangible and invisible
were technically denied access to foreign exchange

the group was adversely affected by these policies as it had to source us dollars in the parallel market to recapitalize wapic
ghana additionally wapic ghanas performance was also adversely affected because of the depreciation of the cedi and
translation losses reported upon consolidation

foreign exchange risk is quantified using the net balance of assets and liabilities in each currency and their total sum
the group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through cash balances maintained in foreign currency the group is not
exposed to significant risk of adverse movements in foreign exchange rates the financial position of the company has no
significant sensitivity to foreign exchange risk

liquidity risk management
liquidity risk is the risk that a company may be unable to meet short term financial demands this usually occurs due to
the inability to convert a security or hard asset to cash without a loss of capital and  or income in the process the group
mitigates this risk by monitoring cash activities and expected outflows the groups current liabilities arise as claims are
made and clients request for termination of their investmentlinked products the group has zero tolerance for liquidity
risk and is committed to meeting all liabilities as they fall due

the board approves the groups liquidity policy and contingency funding plan including establishing liquidity risk tolerance
levels the board and its committees monitors our liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our
liquidity liquidity positions are measured by calculating the groups net liquidity gap

below is a summary of the contractual repricing or maturity dates whichever is earlier of financial assets matched with
financial liabilities

quantifications
wapic insurance plc adopts both qualitative and quantitative approaches to measuring liquidity risk specifically the
company uses the following techniques

  a funding and liquidity plan
  b gap analysis and
  c ratio analysis

the funding and liquidity plan defines the groups sources and channels of utilization of funds the funding liquidity
risk limit is quantified by calculating liquidity ratios and measuringmonitoring the cumulative gap between our assets
and liabilities the liquidity gap analysis quantifies the monthly and cumulative gap in a business environment the
gap for any given tenor bucket represents the liabilities to or placements made the market required to replace maturing
liabilities or assets the company monitors the cumulative gap as a 20 of the total risk assets and the gap as a 20 of
total liabilities

basis of their earliest possible contractual maturity the gross nominal inflow  outflow disclosed in the table is the
contractual undiscounted cash flow on the financial asset and liability

c company life products

underwriting on companys business is much less stringent than for individual business as there is typically less scope
for antiselection the main reason for this is that participation in the company schemes is normally compulsory and
members have limited choice in the level of the benefits

companys policies are priced using standard mortality tables the price for an individual scheme is adjusted for the
following risk factors

     region
     salary structure
     gender structure and
     industry

for large schemes a schemes past experience is a crucial input in setting rates for the scheme rates are guaranteed for
one year and reviewable at the renewal of the policy

d shortterm insurance general insurance products

underwriting on shortterm insurance products takes the form of the insurance applicant completing a proposal form the
company used identified risk factors to classify the risk and charge the appropriate premium

where the value of the items to be insured exceeds a prespecified limit the underwriting consideration becomes more
stringent this is particularly the case for marine and aviation cover in this case the company makes use of specialist to
assess the risks and set an appropriate premium for cover


mortality and morbidity risks
the risk that actual experience in respect of the rates of mortality and morbidity may vary from what is assumed in pricing
and valuation depending on the terms of different products the material classes of business most affected by these risks
are discussed below

a individual life products  term assurance and savings plan

products are sold directly to individuals providing a benefit on death the main insurance risk relates to the possibility that
rates of death may be higher than expected

for contracts with fixed and guaranteed benefits such as the minimum death benefits available on savings plan policies
and fixed future premiums the company employs additional underwriting controls and measures to manage its exposure
to mortality risk this includes but not limited to

     ensure that only acceptable risks are accepted
     claims assessment processes to ensure only valid claims are paid
     purchased reinsurance to limit liability on particularly large claims or substandard risks and
     concentration risk is reduced by diversification of business over a large number of independent lives as well as by
      taking out catastrophe reinsurance

b company life products

employe benefit products provide life cover to members of a company such as employees of companies or members of
trade unions

an aggregate stoploss reinsurance agreement is in place to ensure that the companys exposure to the aggregate mortality
risk in its company life business is managed and limited to a specified limit

in addition there is a catastrophe reinsurance treaty in place for both company business and individual business such
a treaty is particularly important for the companys life business as there are considerably more concentrations of risks
compared to individual business



                                                                                                                                        63

     c deposit administration

     deposit administration contracts provide a guaranteed life annuity conversion at the maturity of the contract the mortality
     risk in this case is that the policyholders may live longer than assumed in the pricing of the contract this is known as the
     risk of longevity

     the company manages this risk by allowing for improvements in mortality when pricing and valuing the contracts the
     company also performs more detailed actuarial experience investigations and adjust assumptions in pricing for new
     contracts and valuation of existing contracts when necessary


     outstanding claims
     this represents the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims arising from incidents occurring as at the date of the
     statement of financial position

     claims management risk
     this is the risk that the insurer may be unable to manage the settlement process by which insurers fulfil their contractual
     obligation to policyholders the company has in place a claims management policy and procedure for ensuring that claims
     are handled fairly and promptly in establishing and maintaining effective claims handling systems and procedures the
     company considers the following factors

          appropriate systems and controls to ensure that all liabilities or potential liabilities notified to the insurer are recorded

           for each notified claim
          suitable controls are maintained to ensure that estimates for reported claims and additional estimates are
           appropriately made on a consistent basis and are properly categorized
          regular reviews of the actual outcome of the estimates made is carried out to check for inconsistencies and to ensure
           that procedures remain appropriate the reviews include the use of statistical techniques to compare the estimates
           with the eventual cost of settling the claims after deducting the amounts already paid at the time the estimates were
           made
          a functional system is in place to ensure that claim files without activity are reviewed on a regular basis
          appropriate systems and procedures are in place to assess the validity of notified claims by reference to the underlying
           contracts of insurance and reinsurance treaties
          suitable systems are adopted to accommodate the use of suitable experts such as loss adjusters lawyers actuaries
           accountants etc as and when appropriate and to monitor their use and
          appropriate procedures are in place to identify and handle large or unusual claims including system to ensure that
           senior management are involved from the outset in the processing of claims that are significant because of their size
           or nature


     claims experience risk
     in terms of the shortterm insurance contracts held by the company the claims experience risk for these policies is that
     the number of claims andor the monetary claim amounts are worse than that assumed in the pricing basis the company
     manages this risk by charging premiums which are appropriate to the risks under the insurance contracts

     under the shortterm insurance products the company also holds a concentration risk which is the risk of a large number
     of claims from a single event or in a particular geographical area the company reduced this risk by diversification over a
     large number of uncorrelated risks as well as arranged catastrophe reinsurance cover


     reinsurance risk
     this is the risk of inadequate reinsurance cover which may be triggered by a situation such as the insolvency of a reinsurer
     omission to cede risk to the treaty wrong cession to the treaty assumption of risks without reinsurance cover acceptance
     of risks above automatic capacity and there is already market saturation and nonpayment of reinsurance premium as at

     sensitivity analysis
     sensitivity analyses are performed to test the variability around the reserves that are calculated at a best estimate level the
     estimated claim amounts can never be an exact forecast of future claim amounts and therefore looking at how these claim
     amounts vary provides valuable information for business planning and risk appetite considerations a sensitivity analysis
     was done to determine how the ibnr reserve amount would change if we were to consider the 75th percentile as opposed
     to our best estimate figures included in reserve reviews as at 31 december 2015 the 75th percentile is a generally accepted
     level of prudency the results based on fitting a normal distribution to the best estimate ibnr reserves as at 31 december
     2015 are as follows

an entity uses the revaluation model the carrying amount of the asset is restated to the revalued amount the split between
gross carrying amount and accumulated depreciation is treated in one of the following ways

        either the gross carrying amount is restated in a manner consistent with the revaluation of the carrying amount and the accumulated
         depreciation is adjusted to equal the difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount after taking into
         account accumulated impairment losses or

        the accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross

that entities no longer had the ability to measure shortterm receivables and payables at invoice amounts where the impact
of not discounting is immaterial the iasb has amended the basis for conclusions of ifrs 13 to clarify that it did not intend
to remove the ability to measure shortterm receivables and payables at invoice amounts in such cases this is consistent
with the companys current accounting policy and thus this amendment did not impact the companys accounting policy

business acquisition thus this amendment did not impact the accounting policy of the group




                                                                                                                                                     111

      the following new or revised standards and amendments which have a potential impact on the company are not yet
      effective for the year ended 31 december 2015 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements however
      the companys assessments of the new standards and amendments is that they are not expected to have significant impact
      on the its operations and financial position



       financial assets                              summary of the requirements and possible impact on consolidated financial statements


        ifrs 9 financial instruments                ifrs 9 addresses the classification measurement and derecognition of financial
                                                     assets and financial liabilities and introduces new rules for hedge accounting in july
                                                     2014 further changes were made to the classification and measurement rules and also
                                                     introduced a new impairment model these latest amendments now complete the new
                                                     financial instruments standard

                                                     while the company has yet to undertake a detailed assessment of the debt instruments
                                                     currently classified as availableforsale financial assets it would appear that they would
                                                     satisfy the conditions for classification as at fair value through other comprehensive
                                                     income fvoci based on the current business model for these assets hence there will
                                                     be no change to the accounting for these assets

                                                     there will also be no impact on the companys accounting for financial liabilities as the
                                                     new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated
                                                     at fair value through profit or loss and the company does not have any such liabilities
                                                     the new hedging rules align hedge accounting more closely with the companys risk
                                                     management practices as a general rule it will be easier to apply hedge accounting going
                                                     forward as the standard introduces a more principlesbased approach the new standard
                                                     also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation

                                                     the new impairment model is an expected credit loss ecl model which may result in
                                                     the earlier recognition of credit losses the company has no hedging arrangements and
                                                     is yet to assess ifwheter it would be affected by the new impairment provisions rules

                                                     the company will adopt the standard when it becomes effective on 1 january 2018

        ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with          the is the issued new standard for the recognition of revenue this will replace ias
        customers                                    18 which covers contracts for goods and services and ias 11 which covers construction
                                                     contracts the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when
                                                     control of a good or service transfers to a customer  so the notion of control replaces
                                                     the existing notion of risks and rewards the standard permits a modified retrospective
                                                     approach for the adoption under this approach entities will recognise transitional
                                                     adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application eg 1 january 2017 ie
                                                     without restating the comparative period they will only need to apply the new rules to
                                                     contracts that are not completed as of the date of initial application

                                                     management is currently assessing the impact of the new rules and has identified that
                                                     the standard is not expected to have significant impact on the companys financial
                                                     statements the company will adopt the standard on its mandatority effective date of 1
                                                     january 2017

           a    classification


                 the companys financial assets include cash and short term deposits commercial loan quoted and unquoted equity
                 instruments treasury bills and bonds the classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the
                 assets were acquired or originated the company classifies its financial assets into the following categories

                    financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
                    heldtomaturity
                    loans and receivable and
                    availableforsale


           b    initial recognition


                 all financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value which includes directly attributable transaction costs
                 for financial instruments not classified at fair value through profit and loss financial instruments are derecognized
                 when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial instruments have expired or where the company has
                 transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership


           c    subsequent measurement


                 subsequent to initial recognition financial assets are measured either at fair value or amortised cost depending on
                 their categorization as follows

                 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

                 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets
                 designiated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss

                 financial assets classified as held for trading are acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term for
                 profit purposes

                 subsequent to initial recognition financial assets as fair value through profit or loss investments are remeasured
                 at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in this value recognized in the profit or loss in the period
                 in which they arise

                 the fair values of quoted instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices while those of unquoted
                 instruments are determined by reference to an active markets or valuation techniques interest earned and dividends
                 received while holding trading assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the profit or loss

                 the company holds financial assets designiated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss in addition
                 to those financial assets held for trading

heldtomaturity

heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed determinable payments and fixed
maturities that management has both the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity other than

   those that the company designates as available for sale

   those that upon initial recognition has been designated as at fair value through profit or loss and

   those that meet the definition of loans and receivables

such instruments as government bonds corporate bonds and treasury bills are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method less impairment allowance if any

held to maturity investments are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective
interest ratethe company consider tainted any financial assets classified as held to maturity if during the current
financial year or the two preceding financial years it has sold or reclassified more than an insignificant amount of
the heldtomaturity investments before maturity more than insignificant in relation to the total amount of held
tomaturity investments other than sales or reclassifications that

   are so close to maturity or the financial assets call date for example less than three months before maturity
    that changes in the market rate of interest would not have a significant effect on the financial assets fair value

   occur after substantially all of the financial assets original principal has been collected through scheduled
    payments or prepayments or

   are attributable to an isolated event that is beyond the companys control is nonrecurring and could not have
    been reasonably anticipated by the company

availableforsale

available for sale financial investments include equity and debt securities the company classifies as available
forsale those financial assets that are generally not designated as another category of financial assets and strategic
capital investments held for an indefinite period of time which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or
changes in interest rates exchange rates or equity prices

availableforsale financial assets are carried at fair value fair values for quoted instruments are determined in the
same manner as those of instruments at fair value through profit or loss the fair values of unquoted equities and
other instruments for which there is no active market are established using valuation techniques corroborated by
independent third parties these inputs may include reference to the current fair value of other instruments that are
substantially similar in terms of underlying cash flows and risk characteristics

available for sale equity instruments for which fair value cannot be reliably determined are carried at cost less
impairment allowance if any

unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of availableforsale financial assets are recognised
in other comprehensive income while the investment is held and are subsequently transferred to the profit or loss
statement upon sale or derecognition of the instrument when available for sale instruments are impaired the
result of loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss

dividends received on availableforsale instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the companys right
to receive payment has been established interest income on available for sale instruments are recognised in the
statement of profit or loss

loans and receivables

loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted
in an active market other than those classified by the company as at fair value through profit or loss or available
forsale




                                                                                                                                 115

             loans and receivables consist primarily of staff loans premium debtors due from reinsurers other debtors

             loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment
             losses loans granted to staff at below market rates are fair valued by reference to expected future cash flows and
             current market interest rates for instruments in a comparable or similar risk class and the difference between the
             historical cost and fair value is accounted for as employee benefits under staff costs where these are considered
             material

       d    impairment of financial assets


             the carrying amounts of these assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective
             evidence of impairment a financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or
             more events that have occurred since the initial recognition of the asset have had a negative effect on the estimated
             future cash flows of that asset and can be reliably estimated


             observable data or evidence that the company uses to determine if an impairment allowance is required on a
             financial asset include

                significant financial difficulty of a counter party
                a breach of contract such as default of contractual terms or delinquency in interest or principal payment
                it is probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization
                observable data which indicates that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flow from a company
                 of assets since the initial recognition of those assets although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual
                 financial assets

             in addition for an availableforsale financial asset a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost
             is also considered objective evidence of impairment while the determination of what is significant or prolonged is
             a matter of judgment in respect of equity securities that are quoted the company is guided by the following

                 a decline is generally regarded as significant if it represent substantial fall in value below cost and

                a decline in quoted price is considered to be prolonged if decline persists for more one financial year

             loans and receivables and heldtomaturity financial instruments

             for financial assets measured at amortised cost the group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists
             individually for financial assets that are individually significant and or collectively for the entire portfolio or class of
             financial assets individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis the remaining
             financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics

             when there is objective evidence of impairment the amount of the impairment loss determined is measured as the
             difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future
             credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate ie the effective
             interest rate computed at initial recognition the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through an allowance account
             the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss

             impairment reversals in a subsequent period arising as a result of decreases in the amount of the impairment loss is
             recognised where the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the
             previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account the reversal is reinstated as far it
             does not result in the carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the amortised cost would have been had
             the initial impairment not been recognised

          available for sale instruments

          availableforsale financial assets are impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment resulting from one or more
          loss events that occurred after initial recognition but before the reporting date that have an impact on the future cash
          flows of the asset

          all impairment losses are recognized through profit or loss if any loss on the financial asset was previously recognized
          directly in equity as a reduction in fair value the cumulative net loss that had been recognized in equity is transferred to
          the statement of profit or loss and is recognized as part of the impairment loss the amount of the loss recognized in the
          statement of profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost in the case of equity instruments or amortised
          cost in the case of debt instruments and the current fair value less any previously recognized impairment loss in the profit
          or loss

          for debt instruments subsequent decreases in the amount relating to an impairment loss that can be linked objectively
          to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in the profit or loss is reversed through the statement
          of profit or loss an impairment loss in respect of an equity instrument classified as availableforsale is not reversed
          through the statement of profit or loss

          when an availableforsale financial instrument is carried at cost because fair value is not reliably measured an
          impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
          cash flows discounted at current market rate of return for similar instruments

ii      financial liabilities

          the companys financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities at amortised cost they include investment
          contract liabilities trade and other payables

          subsequent to initial recognition financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value while
          other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost

          in accordance with ias 39 all financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments have to be
          recognized in the financial statements and measured in accordance with their assigned categories the table below
          represents the companys classification of all its financial assets and liabilities


                         category                                    classes as determined by the company                         subclasses

      iii   fair value measurement

              fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
              between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or in its absence the most advantageous market
              to which the group has access at that date the fair value of a liability reflects its non performance risk

              when available the group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that
              instrument a market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and
              volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis

              if there is no quoted price in an active market then the group uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of
              relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs the chosen valuation technique incorporates
              all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction valuation techniques include
              using recent arms length market transactions between knowledgeable willing parties if available reference to the
              current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing
              models where an appropriate and reliable valuation technique can not be achieved the instrument is carried at cost

              the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price ie the
              fair value of the consideration paid or received if the group determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs
              from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical
              asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets then the financial
              instrument is initially measured at fair value adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value at initial recognition
              and the transaction price subsequently that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over
              the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the
              transaction is closed out if an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price then the group
              measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price or at the price that best
              present the financial instrument

              the fair value of a demand deposit is not less than the amount payable on demand discounted from the first date on
              which the amount could be required to be paid the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy
              as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred

      iv     writeoff policy

              the group writes off a financial asset and any related allowances for impairment losses when it determines that the
              assets are uncollectible this is determined after consideration of information such as significant changes in the issuers
              financial position such that the issuer can no longer pay the obligation or charge off decisions generally based on specific
              past due status considerations


      iv     trade receivables

              trade receivables are loans and receivables financial instruments specifically arising from insurance contracts and
              constitutes premium debtors with determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and the group has
              no intention to sell trade receivables on insurance contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently
              measured at amortised cost less impairment trade receivables are recognised for insurance cover for which payments
              have been received indirectly through duly licensed insurance brokers or lead insurers in coinsurance arrangements
              premium collected on behalf of the group are expected to be received within 30 days from insurance brokers and lead
              insurers trade receivables that are individually identified as impaired are assessed for specific impairment all other
              trade receivables are assessed for collective impairment


      33    reinsurance assets and reinsurance liabilities

      trade receivables are loans and receivables financial instruments specifically arising from insurance contracts and

received indirectly through duly licensed insurance brokers or lead insurers in coinsurance arrangements premium
collected on behalf of the group are expected to be received within 30 days from insurance brokers and lead insurers trade
receivables that are individually identified as impaired are assessed for specific impairment all other trade receivables are
assessed for collective impairment


35   deferred acquisition costs dac

acquisition costs comprise insurance commissions brokerage and other related underwriting expenses arising from the
generation and underwriting of insurance contracts deferred acquisition costs represent a proportion of commission and
underwriting expenses which are incurred during a financial period and are deferred to the extent that they are recoverable
out of future revenue margins


the proportion of these acquisition costs that correspond to the unearned premiums are deferred as an asset and amortised
over the life of the associated insurance contracts on a basis consistent with the related unearned portion of the premiums


for non life business and shortduration life insurance contracts the group amortises the deferred acquisition costs over
the terms of the policies as premium is earned on the underlying insurance contracts by applying to the acquisition expenses
the ratio of unearned premium to written premium for longterm life insurance contracts no assets are established in
respect of deferred acquisition cost however an allowance for acquisition cost loading is provided for in the valuation of
the insurance contract liabilities using assumptions consistent with those used in calculating future policy benefit liabilities
as well as historical and anticipated future experience and is updated at the end of each accounting period


35   other receivables and prepayments

other receivables are stated after deductions of amount considered bad or doubtful of recovery these are loans and
receivables other than investment securities insurance trade receivables and reinsurance assets when a debt is deemed
not collectible it is writtenoff against the related provision or directly to profit or loss account to the extent not previously
provided for any subsequent recovery of writtenoff debts is credited to profit or loss


prepayments represent prepaid expenses and are carried at cost less amortisation expensed in profit or loss


36   basis of consolidation

      a subsidiaries

      investment in subsidiaries are carried in the companys separate financial statements at cost less allowance for
      impairment


      subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group the group controls an entity if it is exposed to or has rights to
      variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power
      over the investee the consolidated financial statements include the assets liabilities and results of the group and
      subsidiary undertakings the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements
      from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases the financial statements have been prepared
      using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances


      investment in subsidiary are carried at cost in the groups separate financial statements and are reviewed for
      impairment annually an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds
      its recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use


      the results and financial position of all the group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary
      economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation
      currency as follows



                                                                                                                                            119

 wapic insurance plc annual report  accounts 2015




          assets and liabilities for statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting
           date

          income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income are translated at average
           exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing
           on the transaction dates in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions
           and

          all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred to equity


           on the disposal of a foreign operation the group recognises in profit or loss the cumulative amount of exchange
           differences relating to that foreign operation when a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation is partially disposed
           of or sold the group reattributes the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences
           recognised in other comprehensive income to the non controlling interests in that foreign operation in the case of
           any other partial disposal of a foreign operation the group reclassifies to profit or loss only the proportionate share
           of the cumulative amount of exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income


           b transactions eliminated on consolidation

           intragroup balances and transactions and any unrealized gains or losses arising from intragroup transactions are
           eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as
           unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment


           c associates

           investment in associates are carried in the companys separate financial statements at cost less allowance for
           impairment and consolidated in the groups consolidated financial statements under the equity accounting
           method


           associates are entities over which the group has significant influence but not control generally accompanying a
           shareholding of between 20 and 50 of the voting rights investment in associates are accounted for using the
           equity accounting method under the equity accounting the method the investment is initially recognised at cost
           and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investors share of the postacquisition profit
           or loss and other comprehensive income of the investee the groups investment in associates includes goodwill
           identified on acquisition while gains realised on purchase below fair value are recognised in profit or loss


           the groups share of postacquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement and its share of the
           postacquisition movement in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with
           corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment when the groups share of losses in an associate
           equals or exceeds its interest in the associates including any unsecured receivables the group does not recognise
           further losses unless it has incurred constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate


           the group determine at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the
           associate is impaired the amount of impairment is determined as the difference between the recoverable amount of
           the associate and its carrying value this amount is recognised against the share of profit or loss of associates in the
           income statement


           on disposal of ownership interest in an associate which reduces holding but where significant influence in retained
           only a proportionate share of the amount previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit
           or loss where appropriate where significant influenced is lost the investment is reclassified as equity investment and
           the amount previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss

      d elimination of upstream and downstream transactions

      profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the group and its associate are
      recognised in the groups financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associate
      unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction present evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred
      accounting policies of the associate are reviewed and aligned to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
      group dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in income statement


37 investment property

investment property comprises investment in land or buildings held primarily to earn rentals or capital appreciation or
both


investment property is initially recognized at cost including transaction costs the carrying amount includes the cost of
replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met and
excludes cost of day to day servicing of an investment property investment property is subsequently measured at fair value
with any change therein recognised in profit or loss fair values are determined individually on a basis appropriate to the
purpose for which the property is intended and with regard to recent market transactions for similar properties in the same
location


fair values are reviewed annually by independent valuer registered with the financial reporting council of nigeria and
holding a recognized and relevant professional qualification and with relevant experience in the location and category of
investment property being valued subsequent expenditure on investment property is capitalized only if future economic
benefit will flow to the group otherwise they are expensed as incurred


investment properties are disclosed separate from the property and equipment used for the purposes of the business the
group separately accounts for a dual purpose property as investment property if it occupies only an insignificant portion
and the related value can be separately identifiable and measured reliably otherwise the portion occupied by the group
is treated as property and equipment


38   intangible assets

      software

      recognition of software acquired is only allowed if it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to this
      intangible asset will flow to the company

      software acquired is initially measured at cost the cost of acquired software comprises its purchase price including
      any import duties and nonrefundable purchase taxes and any directly attributable expenditure on preparing the
      asset for its intended use after initial recognition software acquired is carried at its cost less any accumulated
      amortization and any accumulated impairment losses maintenance costs should not be included

      internally developed software is capitalized when the company has the intention and demonstrates the ability to
      complete the development and use of the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits and can
      reliably measure the costs to complete the development the capitalized costs include all costs directly attributable
      to the development of the software internally developed software is stated at capitalized cost less accumulated
      amortization and impairment

      subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits
      embodied in the specific asset to which it relates all other expenditure is expensed as incurred amortization is
      recognised in profit or loss on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software from the date that it
      is available for use

      the estimated useful life of software is five years subject to annual reassessment




                                                                                                                                          121

      39   property and equipment
            recognition and measurement

            all items of property and equipment except land and buildings are initially recognised at cost and subsequently
            measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses cost includes expenditures that are directly
            attributable to the acquisition of the asset

            land and buildings are initially recognised at cost and subsequently carried at revalued amounts being fair value at
            the date of revaluation less subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any

            when parts of an item of property or equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items
            major components of property and equipment

            the gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from
            disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment and are recognised net within other income in profit
            or loss

            subsequent costs

            subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset as appropriate only
            when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of
            the item can be measured reliably all other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the profit and loss account
            during the financial period in which they are incurred

            subsequent costs on replacement parts on an item of property are recognized in the carrying amount of the asset and
            the carrying amount of the replaced or renewed component is derecognized

            depreciation

            depreciation is calculated on property and equipment on the straight line basis to write down the cost of each asset to
            its residual value over its estimated useful life depreciation methods useful lives and residual values are reassessed
            at each reporting date no depreciation is charged on property and equipment until they are available for use

            land                                                                                 over the lease period

            revaluation of land and building

            land and building is accessed for impairment at each reporting date but valued on an open market basis by qualified
            property valuers at the reporting date at minimum of once within three financial years

            when an individual property is revalued any increase in its carrying amount as a result of revaluation is transferred
            to a revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same property previously
            recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss

            when the value of an individual property is decreased as a result of a revaluation the decrease is charged against any
            related credit balance in the revaluation reserve in respect of that property however to the extent that it exceeds any
            surplus it is recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss

      workinprogress property and equipment

      this represent property and equipment under construction and are carried at the cost incurred until completion
      workinprogress property and equipment are transferred to the appropriate class of property and equipment upon
      completion when they are ready for use and are depreciated from the date of transfer when they are brought into use
      decognition

      an item of property and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or where no future economic benefits are
      expected from its use or disposal gains and losses arising on derecognition are calculated as the difference between
      the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss as other income
      where a revalued asset is disposed or scrapped the revaluation reserve balance in respect of that asset is transferred
      as a reserve reclassification from other reserves to retained earnings


310 leases

      operating leases

      leases where the lessor retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset are classified as operating
      leases payments made under operating leases are charged against income on a straightline basis over the period of
      the lease

      finance leases

      leases of equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
      leases finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or
      the present value of the minimum lease payments each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance
      charges so as to achieve a constant interest rate on the outstanding balance of the liability


      the corresponding lease obligations net of finance charges are included in liabilities the finance cost is charged
      to profit or loss over the lease period according to the effective interest method the equipment acquired under the
      finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term if ownership does not
      pass at the end of the lease term leased assets under finance leases where ownership is expected to pass to the group
      at the end of the lease term are treated in the same manner as property and equipment


311 impairment of nonfinancial assets

the carrying amounts of the groups nonfinancial assets are considered to be impaired when there exist any indication that
the assets recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount and are at a minimum assessed for impairment annually
the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use for the purposes of assessing
impairment assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which they are separately identifiable cashflows cash generating
units impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss


impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has
decreased or no longer exists an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine
the recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that
the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or
amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised reversals of impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss


312 deferred tax

deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements however if the deferred tax arises
from initial recognition of the asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss it is not accounted for deferred tax is determined using the
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to
apply when the related deferred asset tax is realisable or the deferred tax liability is payable

                                                                                                                                         123

 wapic insurance plc annual report  accounts 2015




      deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is possible that future profit will be available against which the
      temporary differences can be utilised


      deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the
      group controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will
      not reverse in the foreseeable future


      deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
      current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
      authority on either the taxable entity or different entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis
      the tax effects of carryforwards of unused losses or unused tax credits are recognised as an asset when it is probable that
      future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised


       deferred tax related to fair value remeasurement of availableforsale investments which are charged or credited directly
      in other comprehensive income is also credited or charged to other comprehensive income and subsequently recognised
      in the consolidated income statement together with the deferred gain or loss


      313   life insurance contract liabilities
      the group issues contracts that transfer insurance risk or financial risk or both insurance contracts are when the group
      the insurer has accepted significant insurance risk from another party the policyholder by agreeing to compensate
      the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event the insured event adversely affects the policyholder as a general
      guideline the group defines as significant insurance risk the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of the
      insured event that are at least 10 more than the benefit payable if the insured event did not occur


      nonlife insurance contracts are issued to indemnity against property and liability insurance risk and are generally annual
      in tenor although some contracts can be beyond one year these are short term insurance risks


      life insurance contracts are issued to indemnify the insured life the dependent or other thirdparty of the insured life in
      the even of death permanent disability loss of job or on survival to maturity of the contract with the sums assured


      investment contracts are those contracts that transfer financial risk and no significant insurance risk financial risk is
      the risk of possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rate financial instrument price commodity price
      foreign exchange rate index of price or rates credit rating or credit index or other variable provided in the case of a non
      financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract


      once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract it remains an insurance contract for the remainder of its
      lifetime even if the insurance risk reduces significantly during this period unless all rights and obligations are extinguished
      or expired investment contracts can however be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if the terms are
      amended to include significant insurance risk


      receipts and payments under investment contracts are not classified as insurance transactions in the income statement
      but instead are accounted for in the statement of financial position in accordance with ias 39 the liability recognised in
      the statement of financial position represents the expected amounts payable to the holders of the investment contracts
      inclusive of allocated investment income insurance contract liabilities are determined in line with the provisions of section
      20 21 and 22 of the insurance act of nigeria to the extent that they do not conflict with the requirements of ifrs as follows

             a general insurance contracts measurement of insurance contracts liabilities

             i reserve for unearned premium and unexpired risk

             the reserve for unearned premium is calculated on a time apportionment basis in respect of risk accepted during the
             year a provision for additional unexpired risk reserve is recognised for an underwriting year where it is envisaged
             that the estimated cost of claims and expenses would exceed the unearned premium reserve

                                                                                                      annual report  accounts




ii reserve for outstanding claims


the reserve for outstanding claims is maintained at the total amount of outstanding claims incurred and reported
plus claims incurred but not reported ibnr at the reporting date

reserving methodology and assumptions
data segmentation

the data used for reserving is segmented into the 8 classes as per the insurance act 2003 of nigeria
 motor vehicle insurance business
 fire insurance business
 general accident insurance business
 marine aviation and transport insurance business
 oil and gas insurance business
 engineering
 bonds credit and suretyship
 miscellaneous

valuation methods and assumptions

the following valuation methods are used as appropriate in calculating the reserves

i the basic chain ladder method

this model assumes that past experience is indicative of future experience ie that claims reported to date will
continue to develop in a similar manner in the future an implicit assumption is that for an immature accident year
the claims observed thus far tells something about the claims yet to be observed a further assumption is that it
assumes consistent claim processing a stable mix of types of claims stable inflation and stable policy limits

this method is used for cases where there are extremely large losses that have been reported but not paid and therefore
will not influence the development patterns the ibnr was calculated as follows the reserving was determined
as ultimate claim amount excluding extreme large losses minus claims paid to date excluding extremely large
losses minus claims outstanding excluding extreme large losses this method was used for the following classes of
business motor vehicle fire general accident marine engineering and miscellaneous


ii loss ratio method adjusted for assumed experience to date

this model assumes that the average delay in the payment of claims will continue into the future if it is expected that
these delay assumptions no longer hold an adjustment needs to be made to allow for this change in payment delay
if the delay period in payment is expected to have increased from previous years the results shown in this report will
be understated additionally an estimate of the average ultimate loss ratio was assumed the assumption for the
ultimate loss ratio was based on estimated average loss ratio on claims experience to date for accident years 2006 to
2015 the loss ratio method was used for three classes namely oil and gas bonds and aviation which had very limited
data and where use of the basic chain ladder method was inappropriate

the model allowed for expected experience to date within the assumed delay period and the assumed average ultimate
loss ratios in carrying out the calculation the average delay is the average number of months that it takes for a claim
to be paid after the loss incident occurred the ibnr was calculated as follows expected average ultimate loss ratio
for the assumed average delay period x earned premium for the assumed delay period current experience to date
relating to the accident months that the delay implies

discounting

no allowance has been made for discounting as these reserves are for short term contracts the effect of discounting
is not expected to have a significant impact on the reserves


                                                                                                                                 125

 wapic insurance plc annual report  accounts 2015




           sensitivity analysis

           sensitivity analyses are performed to test the variability around the reserves that are calculated at the best estimate
           level the sensitivity analysis is done to determine how the ibnr reserve amount would change if a 75th percentile
           is considered as opposed to the best estimate figures included in reserve reviews as at 31 december 2015 the 75th
           percentile is a generally accepted level of prudency


           b life insurance contracts measurement of insurance contracts liabilities

           i life fund

           this is made up of net liabilities on policies in force as determined by qualified actuaries at the reporting date surplus
           or deficit arising from the periodic valuation of the life insurance contracts are recognised in the income statement


           this is made up of liabilities on life policies in force as determined by qualified actuaries at the reporting date
           surplus or deficit arising from the periodic valuation of the life insurance contracts are recognised in profit and loss

           the reserves include incurred but not reported ibnr and unearned premium reserve upr

           the group does not have contracts with discretionary participating features

           data segmentation

           the data used for reserving is segmented into the 2 classes as follows

            individual business
            group business

           methodologies and assumptions

           the valuation for both the individual business and group business utilises various assumptions which include

            the valuation age is taken as age last birthday at the valuation date

            the period to maturity is taken as the full term of the policy less the expired term

            full credit is given to premiums due between valuation date and the end of the premium paying term


           for all individual risk business the gross premium method of valuation was used reserves were calculated via a
           cashflow projection approach taking into account future office premiums expenses and benefit payments future
           cashflows were discounted back to the valuation date at the valuation rate of interest

           an unexpired premium reserve upr was included for group life business after allowing for acquisition expenses at
           a ratio of 20 of premium the upr is tested against an additional unexpired risk reserve aurr for adequacy
           and an aurr may also be held to allow for any inadequacies in the upr for meeting claims in respect of the unexpired
           period the claim rates underlying the aurr were based on pooled historical scheme claims experience allowance
           was made for ibnr incurred but not reported claims in group life to take care of the delay in reporting claims
           this was based on a loss ratio approach which uses historical claims experience to estimate the expected claims from
           which the ibnr portion is determined


           c general insurance insurance contracts revenue recognition

           the recognition and measurement of the insurance contracts in the groups general business are set out as follows


           i premiums income

           premiums on insurance contracts entered into during the year irrespective of whether they relate in whole or in part
           to a later accounting period

premiums on reinsurance inward from facultative reinsurance arrangement are included in gross written premiums
and accounted for as if ceded business was direct business taking into account the product classification of the
reinsured business

outward reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the related
direct insurance or reinsurance business assumed

the earned portion of premiums written is recognized as revenue premiums are earned from the date of attachment
of risk over the indemnity period based on the pattern of risk underwritten outward reinsurance premiums are
recognized as an expense in accordance with the pattern of the indemnity

ii unearned premiums

unearned premiums are those proportions of premiums written in the year that relate to periods of risks after the
reporting date it is computed separately for each insurance contract using a time proportionate basis or another
suitable basis for uneven risk contracts

iii reinsurance cost

on policies written premium ceded comprise written premiums ceded to reinsurers adjusted for the reinsurers
share of the movement in the provision for the unearned premiums the prepaid reinsurance cost reinsurance
arrangements do not relieve the group from its direct obligations to its policyholders subsequently premium ceded
claims reimbursed and commission recovered are presented in profit or loss and the statement of financial position
separately from the gross amounts reinsurance recoverable are recognized when the group records the liability
for the claims and are not netted off claims expense but are presented separately in profit or loss as part of claims
expenses recoverable

iv fees and commission

fee and commissions are recognized on ceding business to reinsurance commissions are amortised and credited to
the profit or loss account over the period of the reinsurance contract

iv claims incurred

movement in the provision for outstanding claims and these are recognised in the profit or loss the provision for
outstanding claims represent the groups estimate of the ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the
reporting date whether reported or not the provision includes an allowance for claims management and handling
expenses

the provision for outstanding claims is estimated based on current information and the ultimate liability may vary
as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided
adjustments to the amounts of claims provision for prior years are reflected in the profit or loss in the financial period
in which adjustments are made and disclosed separately if material

claims on general insurance contracts are payable on a claimsoccurrence basis the group recognise liability for all
insured events that occurred during the term of the contract there are several variables that affect the amount and
timing of cash flows from these contracts these mainly relate to the inherent risks of the business activities carried
out by individual contract holders and the risk management procedures they adopted

the estimated cost of claims includes direct expenses to be incurred in settling claims net of the expected subrogation
value and other recoveries the group takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has appropriate information
regarding its claims exposures however given the uncertainty in establishing claims provisions it is likely that the
final outcome will prove to be different from the original liability established

the reserves held for these contracts comprises a provision for ibnr a provision for reported claims not yet paid and
a provision for unearned premiums at the end of the reporting period




                                                                                                                                   127

            and have little price transparency fair value is less objective and requires varying degrees of judgement depending
            on liquidity concentration uncertainty of market factors pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific
            instrument

      ii   depreciation and carrying value of property and equipment

      fair value hierarchy

      the groups accounting policy and basis of fair value measurements are disclosed under notes 32d and 4 the
      determination of fair value for financial and other assets as well as financial and other liabilities for which there is no
      observable market price requires the use of certain valuation techniques for financial instruments and other assets and
      liabilities that trades infrequently and have little price transparency fair value is less objective and requires varying
      degrees of judgment depending on liquidity concentration uncertainty of market factors pricing assumptions and other
      risks affecting the specific instrument the group measures fair value using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects
      the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement

         level 1
         the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market price in an active market for
         an identical instrument at the balance sheet date

         level 2
         the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by using valuation
         techniques based on observable inputs this category includes instruments valued using quoted market prices in active
         markets for similar instruments quoted prices for similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active or
         other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data
         level 3
         this includes financial instruments and other assets and liabilities the valuation of which incorporates significant inputs
         that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs unobservable inputs are those not readily available
         in an active market due to market illiquidity or complexity of the product these inputs are generally determined based
         on inputs of a similar nature historic observations on the level of the input or analytical techniques

      determination of fair value of financial instruments
      i valuation techniques used to derive level 3 fair values
      level 2 and level 3 fair values of investments have been generally derived using the adjusted fair value comparison approach
      quoted price per earning or price per book value enterprise value to ebitda ratios of comparable entities in a similar
      industry were obtained and adjusted for key factors to reflect estimated ratios of the investment being valued adjusting
      factors used are the illiquidity discount which assumes a reduced earning on a private entity in comparison to a publicly
      quoted entity and the haircut adjustment which assumes a reduced earning for an entity located in nigeria contributed by
      lower transaction levels in comparison to an entity in a developed or emerging market below is a table showing sensitivity
      analysis of material unquoted investments categorised as level 2 fair values

an additional acquisition of equity shareholding in january 2015 which increased the holding of the company to 2374

the company acquired additional 450338194 units of cmbl shares for n17 billion which brought its equity holdings in
the investee to 1151522568 units representing 2374 of the issued and fully paid ordinary shares of the investee

the entire equity holding in cmbl was therefore revalued to the fair value n436 billion at the acqusition date and
appropriately reclassified to investment in associate and the company accounted for this investment using the equity
accounting method

      6 framework for complaint management
      framework for complaint management

      complaints can be managed

           at point of service

           through a staged process

           through referral to an external bodyagency


      61 point of service complaints
      ideally most complaints will be dealt with directly and quickly at the point where the problem arises escalation of
      complaints may be avoided where staff have clear authorization to resolve complaints at first contact often no changes to
      procedures are required as many complaints involve an acknowledgement of the complainants perspective an explanation
      of events and validation of the complainants satisfaction with the explanation

      complaints should be referred to a line manager if they

           remain unresolved

           involve serious consequences

           involve complex medical issues or a number of different staff

           need action that is beyond the responsibility of the staff at point of service

           require escalation or reporting to an external body under the securities and exchange commissions rules relating to complaints
            management


      62 escalation process
      complaints are referred to the next level of management when the matter is outside delegation or is unresolved

      the escalation process proceeds as follows

           immediate line manager

           facility manager andor patient liaison officer as appropriate

           senior complaints officer

      in cases where the complainant does not feel comfortable in making a complaint to those directly delivering the service
      the appropriate line manager should be sought to speak to the complainant if the complainant will not speak with a line
      manager they must be offered alternative ways to make their complaint such as to the company secretary the recipient
      of the complaint must then inform the complainant of the course of action that will be taken next

      complaints should be dealt with by the unit involved where possible with support from a complaints manager however
      for more serious matters or those with broader implications for the company senior management and the executive must
      be notified and participate in the resolution

      depending on the type of complaint it may be necessary to alert the securities and exchange commission or obtain legal
      advice this should not interfere with the aim of resolving the complaint quickly and amicably


      7 complaint handling consideration

      71 anonymous complaints
      anonymous callers should be advised that an investigation is made more problematic if they do not divulge identities as
      this severely limits the services ability to obtain information




210

                                                                                                                      annual report  accounts




they should then be informed of confidentiality as applied to the complaint management process to encourage them to
reveal their own andor the subjects identity

the complainant needs to be informed

     there will be disclosure of information to any respondents identified

     there is nothing off the record in information provided to the service

     what will happen with the information given to the service

however the complainants wishes should be respected as an assurance of absolute confidentiality cannot be given
anonymous written complaints may reveal the identity of the complainant or it may be apparent from the complaint
details an inquiry may still be possible and may be warranted if the complaint raises public health and safety concerns or
where external agencies may need to be notified


72 declining to deal with a complaint
the company may decide to decline to deal with a complaint because it is

     vexatious or frivolous

     the subject matter of the complaint or part has been or is under investigation by some other competent person or body or has been
      or is the subject of legal proceedings

     complaints on matters that are subjudice or in arbitration

     complaints falling outside the purview of the securities and exchange commission

     care needs to be taken in assessing these complaints to ensure that every effort is made to understand the information the
      complainant is attempting to convey


if a complaint has been declined complainants should be advised of the reasons for the decision as well other agencies that
may be able to assist them with their concerns


73 unresolved complaints
if a complainant remains dissatisfied following the services response they have several options available to them which
may include

     review by another senior member of staff or the company secretary

     independent review by external agencyperson

     referral to the securities and exchange commission 2 working days after the ten days time frame


complainants have the right to pursue their complaint until it is resolved to their satisfaction however there are reasonable
limits in terms of dealing with continued contact and correspondence with dissatisfied complainants and matters that
might be frivolous or vexatious complaints


8 complaint register
the company shall maintain an electronic complaints register that would be updated monthly the complaints register
shall contain the following details

     name of the complainant

     date of the complaint

     nature of complaint

     complaints details in brief
