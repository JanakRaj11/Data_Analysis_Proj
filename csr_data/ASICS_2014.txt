 targets around the areas where we have the greatest impact we set these priorities in several
 ways including listening to our stakeholders and identifying the issues of greatest concern to them

our continuous improvement approach to retail sustainability looks at two key areas store
design and store operation because the retail side of our business is growing so fast we
are focusing on integrating sustainability into store design to ensure that it is a key
consideration in any new retail project
to support this we created our retail sustainability guidelines in 2013
                                                                                                                            2012           2013

 training suppliers

 in 2013 the asics csr  sustainability team undertook a detailed needs assessment
 of suppliers capacities as part of continuous improvement profiling during the course
 of the audits it became clear that many of the suppliers lacked the knowledge and
 skills to implement management systems that enable continuous improvement of labor
 and environmental standards at their facilities in many cases the lack of awareness
 and structured systems identified in the needs assessment were resulting in poor health
 and safety and failure to comply with our policy of engagement which is our supplier
 code of conduct
