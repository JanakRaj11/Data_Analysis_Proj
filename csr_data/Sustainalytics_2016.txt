in december the landmark agreement reached in paris resulted in 195 countries agreeing by        nevertheless we humbly acknowledge that sustainalytics has a long way to go in meeting our
consensus to reduce their carbon output as soon as possible and to do their best to keep        goal of becoming an sme leader with respect to integrating sustainability considerations into

the unrelenting pace of esg mainstreaming continued unabated as well aided by a variety of
public policy shifts for example the us department of labor released guidance in october         michael c jantzi

                 sustainability context 
                 our place in the world
                 sustainalytics mission  to provide the insights required for investors and companies to make more
                 informed decisions that lead to a more just and sustainable global economy  means that through
                 our core work we strive to improve economic environmental and social conditions at a global level


                 clearly given our relatively small size and operational footprint this objective is well beyond the
                 capability of sustainalytics to achieve alone even so we acknowledge that sustainalytics success
                 is dependent on how well we do things and sustainability is a key component within that scope
                 as highlighted in last years report management believes it is critical to embed sustainability
                 parameters into our decisionmaking and reporting because it improves our understanding of the
                 business and helps us to achieve attractive financial performance


                 it is through our relationship with hundreds of clients who manage trillions in assets that sustainalytics
                 has a more significant opportunity to have an impact while sustainalytics financial success depends
                 on the companys ability to deliver high quality esg and corporate governance insights and tools to our
                 clients they are also critical in supporting the allocation of capital in a manner that leads to sustainable


sustainability   outcomes over the longterm accordingly the risk and opportunities associated with sustainability
                 remain central to our thinking across all aspects of the business including product development

  context        delivery support and service in other words sustainability is at the core of what we do


                 as highlighted in previous reports sustainalytics objective has been to develop a way to measure
                 how clients use our work to support the transition to a more just and sustainable global economy
                 this years report highlights a change in focus as weve decided to leverage the united nations
                 2030 agenda for sustainable development or more specifically the new sdgs as a framework to
                 evaluate the impact of our contributions as highlighted in the impact on clients section a selection
                 of these 17 themes provides sustainalytics with the ability to measure impact at the productproject
                 level  at least initially  more effectively than in the past


                 sustainalytics understands that the need to consider systemic impact is undeniable recently some
                 leadingedge asset owners have publicly articulated that they have a fiduciary duty not only to focus
                 on financial security for members or safeguarding the pension promise but also to ensure that they
                 work to secure a world into which their plan members wish to retire as peter borgdorff managing
                 director of pensionenfonds zorg en welzijn pfzw has noted a good pension is worth nothing in a
                 polluted and unsafe world moving forward sustainalytics will focus increasingly on contributing to a
                 collective dialogue about how best to address systemic risks that threaten the resiliency of systems
                 upon which we all depend


                 and finally experience shows that publishing a report such as this ensures that we track and manage
                 sustainability issues appropriately the discipline of highlighting both our successes and challenges
                 helps to keep us humble and accountable to our most important stakeholders as well



                                                                                                                                 11

            our reporting approach
            sustainalytics reporting process is designed to identify track and manage material sustainability
            issues appropriately our reporting framework is based on the gris principles for defining
            reporting content sustainability context stakeholder inclusiveness materiality completeness
            as well as information and input from various stakeholders this comprehensive process
            ensures we are continually measuring and monitoring key sustainability performance metrics


            our stakeholders
            as part of sustainalytics commitment to integrating sustainability into decision making
            management interacts with our staff and other stakeholders in a variety of ways doing our
            best to incorporate feedback and address challenges as they arise below is a sampling of how
            sustainalytics engaged with some of our stakeholders in 2015

            material issues
            how we do things
            the second area of discussion encompasses those material indicators that inform
            sustainalytics decisions with respect to managing the company how we do things as
            highlighted previously we firmly believe that it is critical to integrate sustainability parameters
            into our management decisionmaking and reporting because it improves our understanding
            of our business in addition to being the right thing to do


            we have reported on these issues through a human capital and operations framework
            focusing on five sustainability themes identified through the materiality assessment process 
            three under human capital professional growth opportunities worklife integration and
            equity and diversity and two in the operations category energy use and greenhouse gas

            human capital
            our ability to attract talented staff nurture their career development and provide them with
            a safe and progressive working environment is a competitive advantage this is increasingly
            important as a mainstreaming market needs esg providers that can provide high quality
            research insightful analysis and timely and meaningful client service these are the primary
            reasons that sustainalytics continues to build its own team of experts globally as opposed to
            producing research through a network of partnerships or leveraging outsourcing firms
            enabling us to have full control over quality and service finally managing our human capital
            efficiently is a critical ingredient in the longterm success of sustainalytics given that personnel
            costs represent approximately 79 of our annual cost base on that front sustainalytics had a
            very successful year managing expenditures to budget
