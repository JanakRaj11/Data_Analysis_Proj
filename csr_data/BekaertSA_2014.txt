our responsibility towards the environment
better together for a cleaner world is one of bekaerts ambitions we continuously strive to use
fewer materials cut energy consumption and reduce waste
bekaerts concern for the environment is threefold

first we seek to develop new ecofriendlier production processes for our plants worldwide in
2013 we continued to work on the new environmental technologies project this project was
launched in 2011 in order to build up knowledge and expertise in environmental technologies
and thereby boost the environmental performance of plants worldwide practical solutions that
have been developed include the installation of a new evaporator type to treat the rinsing
waste water and the installation of spray dryers which use recuperated heat

in 2013 95 of our consolidated plants worldwide were iso 14001 certified bekaerts full
worldwide certification is an ongoing goal and an element in the integration process of newly
acquired entities and of companies that are added to the consolidation perimeter

bekaerts concern for the environment also involves investing in product innovations that allow
for process improvements at the production sites of our customers our new generation tire
cord types such as the ultratensile range enable our customers to simplify their production
processes and make them more environmentally friendly our dramix steel fibers used in the
construction sector lead to less usage of steel compared to traditional concrete reinforcement
products less energy consumption and faster processing

lastly bekaert develops products that contribute to a cleaner environment to name a few
our super and ultratensile steel cord for example answer the need for lightweight materials in
cars other examples are stainless steel wedge wires used for oil and water filtration cable
armoring solutions for green power transmission and substitutes for solventbased coatings
