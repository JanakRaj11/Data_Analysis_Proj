                                                businesses should approach these issues in the course of their                area that is why many people feel that japan is ahead of the us

                                                by earnings and financial position but the important factor going           would be in the orix groups best interest to debate the nature of
                                                forward will be whether a company has a plan for adapting to a low           risk internally as soon as possible and immediately begin to move

shifts such as introducing an environmental tax or changing the             emissions there will be a considerable gap by 2020 this goes
distribution of public funding by linking them with the message that        beyond the issue of co2 emissions however as it will place japan at
everyone must work together to address global warming to avoid              a disadvantage in terms of its ability to endure an energy crisis
disaster                                                                   reducing co2 emissions is tied to issues of future security
yanase your idea is for us to think beyond just the orix groups           companies need to think about how they will rise above these new
business to identify the issues and hammer out a clear plan for how the    dimensions of global competition
orix group will change                                                     yanase the companies youve cited as examples are all global blue
sueyoshi companies need to consider remedies to cope with the very         chip firms youre saying that what they have in common is an
real phenomenon of global warming not by conventional means of             exceptional ability to adapt to changes while addressing problems
selling products that address the symptoms of global warming but by        sueyoshi the other day a western fund manger told me that
transforming their organizations so as to pave the way for a society        while addressing global warming was extremely important
unlike any that has existed before those that dont will be unable to      what the fund really focused on was a companys ability to
overcome the difficulties ahead                                            adapt to new values and business environments the most

new dimensions of global competition                                        to the heart of a problem and respond appropriately

for the orix group to determine its stance plant its flag ahead of the     needs to recognize that it is being left behind and take action quickly
change and marshal all employees to work as one to make an                 yanase youve given us a lot to think about thank you for your time
impact on society                                                          today
the term earthfriendly for example gives everyone a good feeling
but it doesnt mean anything rather than repeat empty phrases
companies should call on society to face the reality of changes that
no one has ever experienced this is that co2 emissions are bad
and not emitting them is good companies need to urge the world to
action with these values
yanase i would like to act on your advice i have a fairly clear
picture of how this would work in such fields as real estate but
there are serious difficulties in finance
sueyoshi one example is the chemical company basf which uses
the term carbon balance to express the idea that although it
generates 87 million tons of co2 in the manufacturing process for its
products when consumers use those products it reduces co2 by
250 million tons ultimately benefiting society id like to see the orix
group hold a debate not just inhouse but across its widespread
business operations and send a positive message that the problems
it is unable to resolve on its own will be worked out together with
consumers and society
yanase germany has stated its intentions clearly by abandoning
nuclear power generation and in other ways companies need to
clarify their positions as well
sueyoshi germany has set a target of cutting co2 emissions 40 by
2020 so if japan continues to drag its feet and says it cant cut

along with reducing the amount of waste initiatives like these
are leading to greater operational efficiency by expediting

moreover orix rentec is striving to curb energy usage by
monitoring airconditioner usage online for approximately 90
of the airconditioning units found at the tokyo technology
center this centralized management system enables
electricity to be conserved more efficiently by allowing usage
schedules to be set on a daily hourly or block basis the
company is also promoting greater energy efficiency by for
example installing ice thermal storage units for its air
conditioners which utilize offpeak electricity available during
nighttime hours
