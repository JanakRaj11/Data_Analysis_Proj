helping customers reduce emissions
mge is committed to providing customers with tools they need to make wise energy choices we work with
customers who want to reduce their individual carbon footprints

   green power tomorrow gpt participating in our green pricing program is an effective way for cus
    tomers to buy more of their energy from renewable sources and offset their ghg emissions today
    about 11000 customers buy green power from mgeabout 60 of them choose to buy 100 of
    their energy from renewable sources in 2013 mge customers purchased enough renewable energy
                            to meet the annual energy needs of 18000 homes

                            mges gpt program ranks among the top investorowned utilities nationwide
