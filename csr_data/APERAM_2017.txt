the site is on an island in the centre of a lake surrounded by open parkland and in view of wormsley house and the opera
pavilion it offers 360 degree views from around the estate the pavilion is designed and located to maximise panoramic views

temporary opera pavilion the island pavilion and bridge are permanent structures fabricated using high quality durable
materials and finishes  stainless steel as opposed to galvanised steel
matt uginox top stainless steel was selected for construction it was picked for its beadblasted effect and reputation for being a
long lasting maintenancefree material  a sharp contrast to the highly polished stainless steel finish of the permanent sculpture

                                           in 2016 to address what is called the thirdparty risk aperam launched a
                                           first exercise to assess our risk level regarding the external agents used to
                                           support our own commercial forcesbased on an internal audit of all external
                                           agents conducted by our combined assurance department the survey
                                           collected data relating to these agents markets served ownership

                                           thus the initiative not only led to more focused action plans for the years to
                                           come but also raised awareness across our sales staff educating them on
