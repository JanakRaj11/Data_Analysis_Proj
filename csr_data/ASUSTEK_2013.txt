of the ghg emissions during the product life cycle therefore improving the energy eﬃciency at
the use stage could not only help consumers save on the electricity fees but also reduce the carbon
footprint of the product the carbon footprint ratio of the product will vary depending on product

materials and printed with soy ink as opposed to traditional petroleumbased inks soybased
ink is more environmentally friendly with the following characteristics                               reduce            to develop a reasonable package size and strength of the packaging
 vegetablebased inks which are biodegradable
                                                                                                        reuse            to best use of packaging materials to maximize the reuse
 reduce the use of fossil fuel resources
 reduce the emission of volatile organic compounds vocs thus mitigating                            recycle
   the harms to human and environment
 the soybased inks are easier for deinking process than the traditional
   petroleumbased inks during the recycling process thus the recovered
   materials will have less injuries and can be made into highquality recycled paper
 petroleumbased inks will generate secondary pollutants during deinking
   process thus the use of soybased inks can avoid this situation

the data showed that in terms of total volume analysis scope 2 ghg emissions were more          advice we believe that this will not only help build our vendors capability in ghg inventory but also

significant than scope 1 ghg emissions reduction strategies targeted at scope 2 ghg             discover any possible reduction in carbon footprint of the product

emissions will therefore offer the best returns further analysis according to supplier type

by an individual event organization or product throughout its product life cycle after analyzing
the carbon footprint caused by human activities we could plan the carbon reduction and oﬀset the

yellow emperors inner canon first proposed the concept that the best doctor treats diseases
that havent occurred the average doctor treats diseases that are about to occur and the worst
doctors treat diseases that have already occurred the best doctor is therefore not the one that
is most adept at treating illness but the one that can prevent illnesses from happening in the
first place in reality taiwans healthcare service can only care for 5 of people that are already
sick the other 95 of healthy and subhealthy people usually lack medical attention and so
many miss some of their bodys warning signs

the general public through digital cloud technology and the concept of preventive healthcare
