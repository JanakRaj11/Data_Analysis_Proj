    overseas events  such as the reduced consumer spending lukewarm growth of employment rate and a decrease in corporate investment due to
    the prolonged international recession

    ment of proﬁt generation through the hard work of all its employees we focused on achieving our longterm goal of becoming the company that
    provides the best insurance coverage to customers by 2015 as a result kyobo life became more competent in creating proﬁt and maintaining
    ﬁnancial soundness and subsequently earning greater level of trust from you i am deeply grateful for our stakeholders unfailing trust and faith in

pledge we will become a company that is good at providing insurance coverage to customers
the continued promotion of the lifelong care project started in 2011 to boost our competitiveness in providing insurance coverage to custom
ers improved the quality of our insurance service throughout all processes including subscription persistency and payment resulting in earning a
higher grade in the customer complaint evaluation by the financial supervisory service this grade however is still not as high as we wish it to be
we will work harder to listen to the various opinions of customers and swiftly apply them to our service policies


pledge we will become a company that succeeds together with its financial planners
we accepted the requests of financial planners aspiring to become the expert in providing insurance coverage to customers and built training cen
ters that offer programs that will help them develop the ability to design insurance coverage and sell and service the insurance policies in addition
i the ceo myself frequently visited the ﬁelds of sales service and gathered their suggestions for improvements for better communication to pro
vide a greater opportunity to the financial planners and support their development into the experts


pledge we will become a company that grows together with its employees
we endeavored to cherish our human resources and build a company where employees are rewarded according to their performance and sup
ported for their growth so that they would enjoy working for the company to this end we strengthened our training on the marketing of insur
ance to help employees better understand the life insurance business and promoted the rotation and expansion of positions to provide greater
opportunity for the employees to develop their careers


pledge we will become a company that is attractive to investors
kyobo life has consistently increased its investment in longterm bonds in anticipation of prolonged low interest rates and focused on securing
a steady ﬂow of proﬁt by increasing investment in highyield assets within the limit of manageable risk as a result kyobo life earned an a rat
ing from fitch ratings one of the three major international credit rating agencies kyobo life has also maintained a rating of a2 for six consecu
tive years from moodys and the aaa rating the highest rating by nice rating a korean credit rating agency for seven consecutive years we will
maintain the momentum of growth supported by a healthy proﬁtability by securing new growth engines and more precise risk management


pledge we will become a company that grows together with the government and communities
in order to materialize the sprit of neighborly love inherent in the insurance business we labored to practice the wisdom of coexistence focusing
on social contribution activities to help the less fortunate to overcome the difﬁculties caused by illnesses ﬁnancial hardship and lack of education
we will strengthen our partnership with expert and transparent nonproﬁt organizations and promote with them the projects that local communi
ties need and at which kyobo life can excel

kyobo lifes diligent work over the past year received much recognition earning the top place among all life insurance companies for four consec
utive years in the korean sustainability management competition sponsored by the ministry of commerce industry and energy and korean stan
dards association we were also awarded the 2013 consumer grand award from the korean society of consumer studies and recognized as the
best familyfriendly corporation these accomplishments encourage us to faithfully and continually honor our pledges with stakeholders and push
ourselves to a higher standard

additionally kyobo life would like to express its enduring support of the 10 principles involving human rights labor environment and anticorrup
tion suggested by the un global compact as a member of the compact the volatility of the global economy has risen higer than ever since the
global economic crisis especially in the life insurance business the negative spread due to prolonged low interest rate will have a negative impact
for the next several years kyobo life however is determined to keep its business policy of growing together with all stakeholders under any cir
cumstances in pursuit of sustainable development we will continue our journey to becoming an admired company that will thrive for hundreds
of years to come with the help of all stakeholders

inclusivity  has kyobo life included the stakeholders during its process of strategically dealing with sustainability management
   the assurance provider has conﬁrmed that kyobo life has recognized the importance of core stakeholder participation within its pursuit of sustainability man
   agement and is putting efforts into the creation of a participation process it has selected core stakeholder groups such as customers ﬁnancial planners employ
   ees investors government and local communities and has operated customized channels for each stakeholder trait and we would like to speciﬁcally give credit
   to how the committee regarding sustainability management is operated so that collecting the boards opinions and supporting its decisionmaking process is
   carried out on a periodical basis the assurance provider has not found a major group of stakeholders excluded from the participation process of stakeholders
   operated to promote kyobo lifes sustainability management

materiality  has kyobo life incorporated material information so that stakeholders can make sound decisions
   the report has examined the issues that need to be considered in the promotion of sustainability management through internal and external environmental
  analysis and drew major issues according to the core groups of stakeholders and 10 principles of sustainability management the assurance provider has decided
  that kyobo life has not omitted nor excluded any important information from the stakeholders as a recommendation kyobo life should precisely complement
  the materiality test process so that it reﬂects daily tasks in the current business and sustainability trends that can create future value appropriately to promote
  kyobo lifes sustainability management strategies in connection with such issues

responsiveness  has kyobo life appropriately responded to stakeholders demands and interests in the report
   the assurance provider has conﬁrmed that kyobo life has carried out diverse activities to appropriately respond to issues related to sustainability management
  and they were adequately stated in the report it is worth noting that sustainability management tasks were reported by connecting them to pledges
  principles and kpis for individual stakeholders and dma disclosure on management approach performances were reported in a time series devel
  opment which is worth highly positive remarks in that kyobo life continuously responds to stakeholder opinions and interests as a recommendation
  we believe that kyobo life lacks the connectivity between reporting issues to stakeholders and suggest building the structure of future stakeholders
  expectations and demands pledges responsibilities and accomplishing plans to publish reports based on stakeholders principles


opinions by area and recommendations for improvement
in order for kyobo life to further pursue its companywide sustainability management strategically and to create a basis for continued responses toward core issues we
would like to give recommendations to review the following


sustainability management processes
  we think highly of kyobo lifes efforts in its promotion of companywide sustainability management by establishing major sustainability management issues in
  terms of pledges to the core groups of stakeholders principles and kpis to produce and disclose results and future plans we advise kyobo life to include global
  sustainability management trend issues in the selection of future reporting issues and engage in more indepth communication with stakeholders to reﬂect their
  demands directly and publish the results in the reports for the completion of a twoway reporting process

sustainability management results
  kyobo life obtained an a credit rating from the fitch ratings for the ﬁrst time among domestic life insurance companies by maintaining a sound ﬁnancial structure
  we advise kyobo life to publish objectives and rate of accomplishment in each ﬁeld to reveal their efforts in honoring their pledges with stakeholders in the reports

  in consideration of the promotion of ﬁnancial corporations sustainability from the point of esg an explanation of the governance structure is essential kyobo
  lifes sustainability management is based on the ceos strong resolve and the founders philosophy which is different from other domestic corporations and it is
  advisable to be more speciﬁc and to put more emphasis in the reporting and reporting standard of the governance structure

  kyobo life is not directly related to the industry dealing with greenhouse gas and energy but is leading efforts to manage energy consumption and co2 emission
  we hope to see kyobo life develop and manage quantitative indexes for the reduction of greenhouse gas as part of direct regulatory measures to strengthen its
  position as the leader in the ﬁeld of climate change
