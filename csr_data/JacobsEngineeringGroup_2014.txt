medmerry is a unique and outstanding project which required a forward thinking
 approach to delivery the project team have continuously demonstrated innovation
 in responding to the many challenges regularly exceeding my expectations from
 an early stage they took a different approach ensuring they had a common vision
 they have listened to and engaged with people locally to overcome initial resistance
 and worry delivering landscapescale changes that the community really value

the new defences performed exceptionally well during last winters storms
 preventing signiﬁcant damage and economic loss to homes and businesses

this is an exceptional project made possible by a dedicated team of people which
 leaves a fantastic legacy for future generations

                         only 161 landslides hit hong kong in 2012 almost
                         half the previous annual average a reduction due

                         the nearby river thames also helped by
                         accommodating barges to carry 14000 metric tons
                         of materials to the site and remove 8000 tons
                         this saved the equivalent of 2000 lorry journeys
                         on londons roads and prevented the release of

                         wider 55 billion thameslink program which is
                         improving stations building new crosslondon
                         routes and adding longer and more frequent
                         trains to one of the busiest and fastestgrowing
                         stretches of railway in europe
                         accomplishing this while making it an example of
                         modern sustainable design required attention to
                         every small detail and an appetite for using and
                         improving worldwide best practices for stations
                         and other large infrastructure projects
                         jacobs succeeded to such a degree that the

                         awarded a ceequal outstanding achievement

                         carbon category
                         the true winners are londoners and their visitors
                         who beginning in 2018 can take advantage of
                         longer more frequent trains arriving at modern
