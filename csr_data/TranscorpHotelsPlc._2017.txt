212   changes in accounting policy and disclosures

         a new and amended standards adopted by the group
         the group has applied the following standards and amendments for the rst time for their annual reporting
         period commencing 1 january 2016

         clarication of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation  amendments to ias 16 and ias 38

         annual improvements to ifrss 2012  2014 cycle and

         disclosure initiative  amendments to ias 1

         the adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the current period or any prior period and is
         not likely to affect future periods

         other standards amendments and interpretations which are effective for the nancial year beginning on 1
         january 2016 are not material to the group

         b new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
         certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31
         december 2016 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the group the groups assessment
         of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below

          title of standard   ifrs 9 financial instruments

          nature of           ifrs 9 addresses the classication measurement and derecognition of nancial assets and
          change              nancial liabilities introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for
                              nancial assets

          impact              while the group has yet to undertake a detailed assessment of the classication and
                              measurement of nancial assets debt instruments currently classied as availableforsale
                              afs nancial assets would appear to satisfy the conditions for classication as at fair value
                              through other comprehensive income fvoci and hence there will be no change to the
                              accounting for these assets
                              the other nancial assets held by the group include
                              i equity instruments currently classied as afs for which a fvoci election is available
                              ii equity investments currently measured at fair value through prot or loss fvpl which would
                              likely continue to be measured on the same basis under ifrs 9 and
                              iii debt instruments currently classied as heldtomaturity and measured at amortised cost
                              which appear to meet the conditions for classication at amortised cost under ifrs 9
                              accordingly the group does not expect the new guidance to have a signicant impact on the
                              classication and measurement of its nancial assets
                              there will be no impact on the groups accounting for nancial liabilities as the new
                              requirements only affect the accounting for nancial liabilities that are designated at fair value
                              through prot or loss and the group does not have any such liabilities the derecognition rules
                              have been transferred from ias 39 financial instruments
                              recognition and measurement and have not been changed
                              the new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on
                              expected credit losses ecl rather than only incurred credit losses as is the case under ias 39 it
                              applies to nancial assets classied at amortised cost debt instruments measured at fvoci
                              contract assets under ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers lease receivables loan
                              commitments and certain nancial guarantee contracts while the group has not yet
                              undertaken a detailed assessment of how its impairment provisions would be affected by the
                              new model it may result in an earlier recognition of credit losses
                              the new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in
                              presentation these are expected to change the nature and extent of the groups
                              disclosures about its nancial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new
                              standard


                                                                              transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016              51

         title of standard   ifrs 9 financial instruments contd


         mandatory           must be applied for nancial years commencing on or after 1 january 2018
         application         based on the transitional provisions in the completed ifrs 9 early adoption in phases was only
         date date of       permitted for annual reporting periods beginning before 1 february 2015
         adoption by         after that date the new rules must be adopted in their entirety
         group               the group does not intend to adopt ifrs 9 before its mandatory date


         title of standard   ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers

         nature of           the iasb has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue this will replace ias 18 which
         change              covers contracts for goods and services and ias 11 which covers construction contracts

                             the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or
                             service transfers to a customer

                             the standard permits either a full retrospective or a modied retrospective approach for the
                             adoption



         impact              management is currently assessing the effects of applying the new standard on the
                             groups nancial statements and has identied the following areas that are likely to be
                             affected
                             iaccounting for the customer loyalty programme  ifrs 15 requires that the total consideration
                             received must be allocated to the points and goods based on relative standalone selling prices
                             rather than based on the residual value method this could result in different amounts being
                             allocated to the goods sold and delay the recognition of a portion of the revenue

                             ii accounting for certain costs incurred in fullling a contract  certain costs which are currently
                             expensed may need to be recognised as an asset under ifrs 15 and

                             iii rights of return  ifrs 15 requires separate presentation on the balance sheet of the right to
                             recover the goods from the customer and the refund obligation

                             at this stage the group is not able to estimate the impact of the new rules on the groups nancial
                             statements the group will make more detailed assessments of the impact over the next twelve
                             months


         mandatory           mandatory for nancial years commencing on or after 1 january 2018 expected date of
         application         adoption by the group
         date date of       1 january 2018
         adoption by
         group



       there are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material
       impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions

22   consolidation
       a subsidiaries
       subsidiaries are all entities including special purpose entities over which the group has control control
       exists when the group has power over the investee is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its
       involvement with investee and has the ability to use its power to affect the returns subsidiaries are
       accounted for at cost in the separate nancial statements of transcorp hotels plc in the consolidated
       nancial statements subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the
       group they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases

       business combination
       the group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations the consideration
       transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred to
       the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group the consideration transferred
       includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and the
       fair value of any preexisting equity interest in the subsidiary

       identiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
       with limitations measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date the group recognises any non
       controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisitionbyacquisition basis either at fair value or at the present
       ownership instruments proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquirees identiable net assets
       for components that are present and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of net assets in the events
       of liquidation all other components of noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value

       acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred

       if the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers
       previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date any gains
       or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in prot or loss

       any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition
       date subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or
       liability is recognised in accordance with ias 39 either in prot or loss or as a change to other comprehensive
       income

       contingent consideration that is classied as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is
       accounted for within equity

       the excess of the consideration transferred the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and
       the acquisitiondate fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the
       identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill

       if the total of consideration transferred noncontrolling interest recognised and previously held interest
       measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain
       purchase the difference is recognised directly in the income statement

       intercompany transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies
       are eliminated unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
       impairment of the transferred asset

       accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the
       policies adopted by the group



                                                                           transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016          53

         when the group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control joint
         control or signicant inuence any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the
         change in carrying amount recognised in prot or loss

         in addition any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are
         accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities this may mean that
         amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassied to prot or loss

         c common control transactions
         the group applies predecessor values method in accounting for business combination under common
         control the nancial statements are prepared using predecessor book values ie the book values of the net
         assets of the acquiree company in the consolidated accounts of transcorp hotels plc before the transaction
         without any step up to fair value the difference between any consideration given and the aggregate book
         value of the assets and liabilities as of the date of the transaction of the acquired entity is recorded as an
         adjustment to equity this is recorded in retained earnings no additional goodwill is created by the
         transaction

25   property plant and equipment

       property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
       impairment losses cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset

       subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as
       appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the
       group and the cost can be measured reliably

       all other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of prot or loss during the nancial period in
       which they are incurred

       increases in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and buildings are recognised net of tax in
       other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in shareholders equity

        as often as it occurs the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the
       asset charged to prot or loss and depreciation based on the assets original cost net of tax is reclassied
       from the property plant and equipment revaluation surplus to retained earnings

       freehold land is not depreciated depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to
       allocate their costs or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows

        leasehold buildings              2                plant and machinery                                   10 
        furniture and ttings            20               computer equipment                                    33 
        motor vehicles                   25

       the group allocates the amount initially recognized in respect of an item of property plant and equipment
       to its signicant parts and depreciates separately each such part the carrying amount of a replaced part is
       derecognized when replaced residual values method of amortization and useful lives of the assets are
       reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate

       where an indication of impairment exists an assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its
       recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount

       the gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the
       sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in other income or expense  net in the
       statement of prot or loss for the period

26   intangible assets

       a goodwill
       goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred
       over transcorp hotel plcs interest in the net fair value of the net identiable assets liabilities and contingent
       liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree for the purpose of
       impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating
       units cgus or groups of cgus that is expected to benet from the synergies of the combination each unit
       or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the
       goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes goodwill is monitored at the operating segment
       level




                                                                       transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016        55

notes to the financial statements contnd


       goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in
       circumstances indicate a potential impairment the carrying value of goodwill is compared to the
       recoverable amount which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell any impairment is
       recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed

       the goodwill in the books arose from the purchase of transcorp hotels calabar limited which operates the
       transcorp hotel calabar

       for purposes of impairment testing the entire business is treated as one cash generating unit cgu

       b computer software
       costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as
       incurred development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identiable and
       unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets when the following
       criteria are met
        it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use
        the directors intends to complete the software product and use or sell it
        there is an ability to use or sell the software product
        it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benets
        adequate technical nancial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
         software product are available
        the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured

       directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software
       development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads

       other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred
       development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent
       period

       computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives
       from the point at which the asset is ready for use the estimated useful lives of the software of the group is
       between three to eight years

27   investment properties

       properties that are held for longterm rental yields or for capital appreciation or both and that are not
       occupied by the entities in the consolidated group are classied as investment properties

       recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future economic benets
       that are associated with the investment property will ow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably
       this is usually the day when all risks are transferred

       investment properties are measured initially at cost including transaction costs in the year of acquisition the
       carrying amount includes the cost of replacing parts of an existing investment property at the time the cost
       was incurred if the recognition criteria are met and excludes the costs of daytoday servicing of an
       investment property subsequent to initial recognition investment properties are stated at fair value which
       reects market conditions at the date of the consolidated statement of nancial position

       gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in the consolidated
       income statement in the year in which they arise subsequent expenditure is included in the assets carrying

         amount only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the group
         and the cost of the item can be measured reliably all other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to
         the consolidated prot or loss during the nancial period in which they are incurred

         the fair value of investment properties is based on the nature location and condition of the specic asset
         the fair value is obtained from professional third party valuers contracted to perform valuations on behalf of
         the group the fair value of investment property does not reect future capital expenditure that will improve
         or enhance the property and does not reect the related future benets from this future expenditure these
         valuations are performed annually by external appraisers

         if entity owns property that is leased to and occupied by another entity in the same group the property
         does not qualify as investment property in consolidated nancial statements that include both entities this is
         because the propertyis owneroccupied from the perspective of the group as a whole however from the
         perspective of the individual entity that owns it the property is investment property

28     impairment of nonnancial assets

         assets that have an indenite useful life  for example goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested
         annually for impairment assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever
         events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable an
         impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
         amount the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use for the
         purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
         identiable cash ows cashgenerating units nonnancial assets other than goodwill that suffered an
         impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date

29     financial assets

         the group classies its nancial assets in the following categories at fair value through prot or loss loans and
         receivables and available for sale the classication depends on the purpose for which the nancial assets
         were acquired management determines the classication of its nancial assets at initial recognition

291   classication of nancial instruments
         management determine the classication of its nancial instruments at initial recognition

         a financial assets and liabilities at fair value through prot or loss
         financial assets at fair value through prot or loss are nancial assets held for trading a nancial asset is
         classied in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term derivatives are also
         categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges assets in this category are classied as
         current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months otherwise they are classied as noncurrent

         b loans and receivables
         loans and receivables are nonderivative nancial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not
         quoted in an active market they are included in current assets except for maturities greater than 12 months
         after the end of the reporting period these are classied as noncurrent assets the groups loans and
         receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet

         c heldtomaturity investments
         heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative nancial assets with xed or determinable payments and
         xed maturities that the directors have the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity other than
         a those that the group upon initial recognition designates as at fair value through prot or loss

          d financial liabilities at amortized cost
          financial liabilities at amortized cost consists of trade payables
          trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course
          of business from suppliers accounts payables are classied as current liabilities if payment is due within one
          year or less

292  recognition and measurement
        a loans and receivables
        loans and receivables are initially recognized at the amount expected to be received less when material
        a discount to reduce the loans and receivables to fair value subsequently loans and receivables are
        measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less a provision for impairment
        trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
        the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment

          b heldtomaturity investments
          heldtomaturity investments are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental

210     offsetting nancial instruments

          financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of nancial position
          when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle
          on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously

211     impairment of nancial assets

          assets carried at amortised cost
          the group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a nancial
          asset or group of nancial assets is impaired a nancial asset or a group of nancial assets is impaired and
          impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more
          events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event and that loss event or events has
          an impact on the estimated future cash ows of the nancial asset or group of nancial assets that can be
          reliably estimated

          the criteria that the group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include
           signicant nancial difculty of the debtor or obligor
           a breach of contract such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments
           the company for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers nancial difculty granting to the
            borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider
           it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other nancial reorganisation
           the disappearance of an active market for that nancial asset because of nancial difculties or
           observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash ows from
          a portfolio of nancial assets since the initial recognition of those assets although the decrease cannot yet

        be identied with the individual nancial assets in the portfolio including
            i adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio and
            ii national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio

        the group rst assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists

        for loans and receivables category the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
        assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows excluding future credit losses
        that have not been incurred discounted at the nancial assets original effective interest rate the carrying
        amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of
        prot or loss if a loan or heldtomaturity investment has a variable interest rate the discount rate for
        measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract as a
        practical expedient the group may measure impairment on the basis of an instruments fair value using an
        observable market price

        a provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the
        group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables if
        collection is expected in one year or less they are classied as current assets if not they are presented as
        noncurrent assets

        if in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
        objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised such as an improvement in the
        debtors credit rating the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the
        consolidated statement of comprehensive income

212    inventories

        inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value cost is determined using the
        weighted average method this includes the cost of direct materials to the companys premises and other
        direct costs net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less selling
        expenses

213    cash cash equivalents and bank overdrafts

        cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand deposits held at call with banks and other shortterm highly
        liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts

214   borrowings

        borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred borrowings are
        subsequently carried at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs
        and the redemption value is recognised in prot or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective
        interest method

        fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent
        that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down in this case the fee is deferred until the
        draw down occurs to the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be
        drawn down the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
        the facility to which it relates

        borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specied in the contract is
        discharged cancelled or expired the difference between the carrying amount of a nancial liability that
        has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid including any noncash
        assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in prot or loss as other income or nance costs

        borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement
        of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period

        the fair values of borrowings are based on cash ows discounted using a rate based on the borrowing rate of
        16 2015 16 the rate used is the average interest rate obtainable from commercial banks and has been
        determined as a level 2 measure within the fair value hierarchy

215   borrowing costs

        general and specic borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of
        qualifying assets which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their
        intended use or sale are added to the cost of those assets ie capitalised until such time as the assets are
        substantially ready for their intended use or sale

        investment income earned on the temporary investment of specic borrowings pending their expenditure
        on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation all other borrowing costs
        are recognised in prot or loss in the period in which they are incurred

216   provisions

        provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past
        event and it is probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation and the amount has been
        reliably estimated provisions are not recognised for future operating losses

        provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
        obligation using a pretax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
        risks specic to the obligation the increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest
        expense

217    current and deferred tax

        the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax tax is recognised in the statement of
        prot or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or
        directly in equity in this case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity
        respectively

        the tax currently payable is based on taxable prot for the year taxable prot differs from net prot as
        reported in the statement of prot or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
        deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible the groups
        liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
        reporting date

        deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying
        amounts of assets and liabilities in the nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
        computation of taxable prot and is accounted for using the liability method deferred tax liabilities are
        generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the

notes to the financial statements contnd


        extent that it is probable that taxable prots will be available against which deductible temporary
        differences can be utilised such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises
        from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and
        liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax prot nor the accounting prot

        deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries
        except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
        temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future

        the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent
        that it is no longer probable that sufcient taxable prots will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be
        recovered deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the
        liability is settled or the asset is realised deferred tax is charged or credited to the statement of prot or loss
        except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with
        in equity

        deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
        assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
        authority and the group intends to settle its current tax liabilities on a net basis

        deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as noncurrent in the statement of nancial position

        board bonus payments are at the discretion of the board and the expense is recognised as in the year it is
        incurred there is no contractual obligation neither has there been a past practice to create a constructive
        obligation

219   revenue recognition

        revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable stated net of discounts
        returns and value added taxes the group earns revenue from the sale of goods and services

        revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from the sale of goods and
        services in the ordinary course of the companys activities revenue is recognised when it is probable that
        the economic benets associated with a transaction will ow to the company and the amount of revenue
        and associated costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably

        revenue includes hotel entertainment and restaurant revenues other service fees rental income and the
        invoiced value of goods and services sold less returns and allowances value added tax vat and other
        taxes are excluded from revenue and treated as overhead expenses as these are borne by the company

        each lease payment is allocated between the liability and nance charges the corresponding rental
        obligations net of nance charges are included in other longterm payables the interest element of the
        nance cost is charged to the statement of prot or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant
        periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period the property plant and
        equipment acquired under nance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and

       ii cash ow and fair value interest rate risk               
       the groups main interest rate risk arises from longterm borrowings with xed interest rates the groups
       borrowings at xed rate were mainly denominated in nigerian currency naira

       the groups xed rate borrowings and receivables are carried at amortised cost they are therefore not
       subject to interest rate risk as dened in ifrs 7 since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash ows will
       uctuate because of a change in market interest rates                               

32   credit risk
                              
       credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and nancial institutions as well as
       credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables
       
       i risk management                            
       credit risk is managed on a group basis for banks and nancial institutions only independently rated parties
       with a minimum national rating of a are accepted

       there is no independent rating for customers risk control assesses the credit quality of the customer taking
       into account its nancial position past experience and other factors the compliance with credit limits by
       customers is regularly monitored by line management

       sales to customers are required to be settled in cash or using major credit cards mitigating credit risk there
       are no signicant concentrations of credit risk whether through exposure to individual customers specic
       industry sectors andor regions

       the credit ratings of the investments are monitored for credit deterioration
                                                     
       ii security
       no security is obtained for trade receivables either in the form of guarantees deeds of undertaking or letters
       of credit which can be called upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement

       however some guests are required to provide security deposits for credit transactions while others are
       granted credit on the strength of their credibility and past performances in the case of default unpaid
       balances are set off against security deposit while others are referred to debt collection agents
                                        
       the credit quality of nancial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to
       external credit ratings if available or to historical information about counterparty default rates

       there are no credit ratings for transcorp hotel plcs current assets however the companys cash and
       cash equivalents listed below are purely bank and shortterm deposits

      none of the amounts receivable from related parties are past due or impaired and repayments have been
      received regularly and on time historically management has established a related entity risk management
      framework including predetermined limits for extending credit to key management personnel
                                                   
      iiiimpaired trade receivables                         
      individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount
      directly the other receivables are assessed collectively to determine whether there is objective evidence
      that an impairment has been incurred but not yet been identied other receivables are not impaired for
      these receivables the estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for impairment

      the group considers that there is evidence of impairment if any of the following indicators are present
       signicant nancial difculties of the debtor
       probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or nancial reorganisation and
       default or delinquency in payments more than 90 days overdue
      receivables for which an impairment provision was recognised are written off against the provision when
      there is no expectation of recovering additional cash

      impairment losses are recognised in prot or loss within other expenses subsequent recoveries of amounts
      previously written off are credited against other expenses

      individually impaired trade receivables relate to customers who had defaulted for more than 90 days
      where there is no evidence for recoverability of amounts owed the group expects that a portion of the
      receivables will be recovered and has recognised impairment losses of n149 million and n120 million for
      group and company respectively the ageing of these receivables is as follows

       not impaired these relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of

       the other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and are not past

       prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufcient cash and marketable securities and the
       availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when
       due and to close out market positions at the end of the reporting period the group held deposits at call of
       n100 million 2015 n12917 million that are expected to readily generate cash inows for managing liquidity
       risk

       management monitors rolling forecasts of the groups liquidity reserve and cash and cash equivalents note
       21 on the basis of expected cash ows

       this is generally carried out at each of the respective companies of the group in accordance with practice
       and limits set by the group these limits vary to take into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity
       operates

       in addition the groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash ows in major currencies and
       considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios
       against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining debt nancing plans

       the tables below analyse the groups nancial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their
       contractual maturities

       the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows for trade payables
       balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not
       signicant

       a risk management                             
       the groups objectives when managing capital are to
        safeguard their ability to continue as a going concern so that they can continue to provide               returns for
         shareholders and benets for other stakeholders and
        maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital

       in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
       shareholders return capital to shareholders issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt                           
       the group monitors capital on the basis of the following gearing ratio
        net debt as per note 30 divided by total equity as shown in the balance sheet including noncontrolling
         interests
                                              
       during 2016 the groups strategy was to maintain a gearing ratio within 20 to 70 and a minimum b
       credit rating the credit rating was unchanged and the gearing ratios at 31 december 2016 and 31
       december 2015 were as follows

5    recognised fair value measurements
                                   
      this note explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the nonnancial
      assets that are recognised and measured at fair value in the nancial statements to provide an indication
      about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value the group has classied its nancial assets
      and liabilities into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standards

      the groups policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of
      the reporting period

      there were no transfers between levels 1 2 and 3 for recurring fair value measurements during the year
      the investment property was carried at cost in the prior period being the year of acquisition

      ii valuation techniques used to determine level 2 fair values                                   
      the group obtains independent valuations for its investment properties at least annually

      at the end of each reporting period the directors update their assessment of the fair value of its property
      taking into account the most recent independent valuations the directors determine a propertys value
      within a range of reasonable fair value estimates

      the best evidence of fair value is current prices in an active market for similar properties where such
      information is not available the directors consider information from a variety of sources including



                                                                       transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016      69

       current prices in an active market for properties of different nature or recent prices of similar properties in
        less active markets adjusted to reect those differences
       discounted cash ow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash ows
       capitalised income projections based upon a propertys estimated net market income and a
        capitalisation rate derived from an analysis of market evidence

      all resulting fair value estimates for properties are included in level 2 the key inputs under this approach are
      the price per square metre from current year sales of comparable lots of land in the area location and size
                                       
      iii valuation processes                            
      the group engages external independent and qualied valuers to determine the fair value of the groups
      investment properties at the end of every nancial year and for other land and buildings at least every three
      years

      as at 31 december 2016 the fair values of the investment properties have been determined by ubosi eleh 
      company estate surveyors and valuers
      in valuing the property the valuers assumed 
      i   that the title of the property is good and marketable
      ii that the property is not adversely affected by or subject to compulsory acquisition road widening new
           proposal or planning scheme
      iii that the property is free from all onerous charges and restrictions

      the basis of valuation is the market value that is the price which an interest in a property might reasonably be
      expected to realize in a sale by private treaty assuming
      i   a willing buyer
      ii   a reasonable period within which to negotiate the sale taking into account the nature of the property
           and the state of the market
      iii values will remain static throughout the period
      iv the property will be freely exposed to the market
      v no account is to be taken of an additional bid by a special purchaser
      vi no account is to be taken of expenses of realization which may arise in the event of a disposal

      the investment property was carried at cost in prior period being the year of acquisition
      the main level 2 inputs used by the group are derived and evaluated as follows
       leased land  discount rates terminal yields expected vacancy rates and rental growth rates are
        estimated by ubosi eleh  company estate surveyors and valuers
      the estimates are consistent with the valuers experience and knowledge of market conditions
                                     
6    critical accounting estimates and judgements                               
                                            
      critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty                
      the preparation of nancial statements requires management to use judgment in applying its accounting
      policies and estimates and assumptions about the future estimates and other judgments are continuously
      evaluated and are based on managements experience and other factors including expectations about
      future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the following discusses the most
      signicant accounting judgments and estimates that the company has made in the preparation of the
      nancial statements

      impairment of goodwill
      the group reviews goodwill at least annually and other nonnancial assets when there is any indication that
      the assets might be impaired the group has estimated the value in use and fair value of operating segments
      to which goodwill is allocated using discounted cash ow models that required assumptions about future

      sensitivity                           
      if the average budgeted gross margin used in the valueinuse calculation for transcorp hotels calabar
      limited cgu had been 1 lower than managements estimates at 31 december 2016 69 instead of 70
      the group would have had to recognise an impairment against the carrying amount of goodwill of n2919
      million
                              
      the reasonably possible change of 1 reduction in average budgeted gross margin represents a reasonably
      possible reduction in sales of 2
                              
      if the pretax discount rate applied to the cash ow projections of this cgu had been 1 higher than
      managements estimates 20 instead of 19 the group would have had to recognise an impairment
      against investment in transcorp hotels calabar limited thcl of n200 million

      have resulted in an impairment writedown in investment in thcl

           the group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that intangible

           goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually

           the group periodically evaluates its non current assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
           circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable the groups
           judgements regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and

           in assessing goodwill for impairment at 31 december 2016 and 2015  the company compared the

      periods beyond the budget period cash ows were extrapolated using growth rates that do not exceed the
      longterm average growth rate for the business

      based on the results of the impairment evaluation described above the recorded goodwill was not impaired
      as the recoverable amount of the subsidiary exceeded the carrying value

      the key assumptions used for the value inuse calculations are as follows

      management has determined the values assigned to each of the above key assumptions as follows

       other operating costs        fixed costs of the cgu which do not vary signicantly with sales volumes or prices
                                    management forecasts these costs based on the current structure of the business
                                    adjusting for inationary increases but not reecting any future restructurings or cost
                                    saving measures the amounts disclosed above are the average operating costs for
                                    the veyear forecast period

       annual capital expenditure   expected cash costs in the cgu this is based on the historical experience of
                                    management and the planned refurbishment expenditure no incremental revenue
                                    or cost savings are assumed in the valueinuse model as a result of this expenditure

       longterm growth rate        this is the weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the
                                    budget period the rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports

       pretax discount rates       reect specic risks relating to the cgu and the countries in which they operate




       reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of goodwill
       to fall below the carrying value
