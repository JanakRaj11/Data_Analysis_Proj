                      seminar attended seminar on environmental laws and regulations
                           my knowledge about environmental laws and regulations had been fragmentary
                      this seminar enabled me to acquire the knowledge i needed in a systematic manner
                      i had thought that environmental considerations and design were independent of
                      each other but i have realized that when we verify our design we must be aware
                      that the environment is one of the functional requirements for the product we
                      design the seminar drove home the realization that even a small mistake can lead
                      to a major complaint or compensation for damage as a design draughtsman i will
                      coach the people in my section on environmental laws and regulations

osamu miyamoto        engineering divisions are essential to sound environmental management however

                      verification during the development stage must be led by the engineering division so
department
                      that when new products are in the process of being developed the preservation of
                      the global environmental is taken into consideration

                      seminar attended seminar on environmental laws and regulations
                           before i attended this seminar i had assumed that effective measures to prevent
                      failures were to include the ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions
                      among the design fmea items and to use parts that comply with the green
                      procurement standard
                           however as was pointed out during this seminar our process fmea meetings
                      did not examine possible inclusion or attachment of foreign materials during
                      production

                      problems and pollution and thought of how i can contribute to environmental
                      activities
                          the environmental management section to which i belong examines chemicals
                      contained in our products in light of the rohs directive the european union        s

                      seminar attended new recruit training
                          by attending the environmental seminar i was able to learn what specific

                          in addition i learned about biodiversity and renewed my understanding that

    environmental patrol

        as part of its ems activities the tohoku hirose electric group conducts patrols in the presence
    of those concerned to ensure that industrial waste is separated into the specified categories
    thanks to the meticulous separation of plastic materials used in packaging which are considered
    to be recyclable valuables there are no complaints from buyers regarding our handling of waste
    and only valuable resources are brought to the depository
         thorough separation of waste products to
    reduce industrial waste is one of the topics in
    our annual environmental education plan and all
    employees receive training regarding this issue
    patrols are carried out on garbage collection days in
    the company of those responsible for separating the
    waste correctly
         while the amount of industrial waste was the
    same in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 it was reduced
    by 18 in fiscal year 2013 due the comprehensive
    separation initiatives implemented this year we will
    try to further reduce the amount of waste in fiscal
    year 2014

activities to reduce environmental impacts
 reduction of hazardous substances in our products
     the hirose electric group responds rapidly to revisions of laws governing chemicals contained in products as
 these laws are becoming increasingly stringent year by year
     during product design we select ecofriendly parts and materials in accordance with our green procurement
 guidelines and during design verification we examine whether the environment is being taken into consideration we
 improve the level of knowledge of new designers by holding an annual seminar on chemicals
     we started to bring our activities into line with the rohs directive1 in 2005 accordingly we had updated all our
 major products by 2006 which was earlier than the enforcement of the relevant law we installed xray fluorescence
 spectrometers at all our production sites and put an organizational structure in place to analyze specified toxic
 substances by 2007 we had ceased to manufacture any products2 that did not conform to rohs
     ever since a list of substances of high concern svhc associated with the reach regulation3 was first released
 in november 2008 we have been meeting the compliance requirements for substances on the list which is updated
 frequently and making public information about the chemicals used in our products
     by 2013 we had ceased to use dibutyltin compounds the use of which is prohibited by the reach regulation

 1 rohs directive this was promulgated on february 13 2003 and enforced on july 1 2006 by the european union eu this directive restricts the use
    of six specified hazardous substances in electric and electronic products lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyl pbb
    and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde
 2 except for some customized products
 3 reach regulation regulation concerning registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals promulgated on december 30 2006 and
    enforced on june 12 2007
    this regulation prohibits selling products that contain unregistered chemicals within the european union it also includes regulations governing the
    conduct of producers and importers and the suppliers obligation to make relevant information public

  visiting industrial waste disposal contractors to carry out inspections
                           as there has been a string of reports on illegal
                    dumping the responsibility of industrial waste generating
                    companies is gaining in importance such companies have
                    an obligation to directly inspect contractors that collect or
                    dispose of waste
                         each year the hirose electric group dispatches staff to
                    visit contractors that dispose of the waste produced by its

reduction of paper usage
    as part of its commitment to saving resources the hirose electric group is working to reduce paper usage
    we are reducing paper use by printing on both sides of a sheet condensing two or more pages into a single page
printing on the back of previously used paper and using electronic documents we also preferentially purchase paper
that has an environmental label
    in fiscal year 2013 we endeavored to cut down on paper use by replacing paper documents with files on laptop
pcs in meetings and substituting electronic files for internally circulated paper documents however since the
volume of production increased our paper usage was 5 higher than that in fiscal year 2012
    we will continue our efforts to reduce paper consumption

biodiversity conservation
      the hirose electric group is preserving
biodiversity by developing producing and selling
environmentally friendly products
      one of the measures we take to raise staff
awareness about biodiversity is to provide them with
elearning opportunities on the subject and afterwards
ask them if they will make pledge about specific
actions they will take to preserve biodiversity in
everyday life
     as the first step toward biodiversity preservation
we incorporated ecotour programs into staff social
gatherings in fiscal year 2013 these programs
enabled employees to have contact with marine
life one program involved a lesson on how dolphins
live and gave participants the chance to swim with
and have direct contact with real dolphins another
program enabled the participants to go snorkeling in
the sea and observe fish this provided an enjoyable
environment for the participants to share experiences
and deepen their understanding of marine life

                      planning ecotours
                          rather than worrying about how to approach different aspects of biodiversity i
                      decided that the participants should enjoy having contact with nature so i planned
                      ecotours there were four field tours that enabled participants to come into direct
                      contact with marine creatures the tours involved learning about the life of dolphins
                      and observing fish
