    facilitating the establishment of new villages

    we have established more than 40 food processing enterprises in 15 provinces and 2
    municipalities in china engaging in the processing of numerous agricultural products
    such as wheat rice corn oils and barley our business characteristics integration of
    primaryadvanced processing of agricultural products on the one hand and domestic
    international trading on the other and our leading position in the agricultural industry
    have given us unique advantages in crossovers between the urban and rural areas
    between the industrial and agricultural sectors and among the regional domestic and
    international markets therefore we are well positioned to make our contributions
    towards the establishment of new villages which can be translated into the promotion
    of an internationalised agricultural industry for china the coordination of urban rural
    and regional developments and the further opening up of the nation

    to facilitate regional distribution of raw materials specialised agricultural production
    and a reasonable level of economy of scale the issue of an excessive number of
    small farmers mismatching with a rapidly changing vast market has been effectively
    resolved with stable supply and quality control of raw materials at the source and
    better coordination between the upstream and the downstream segments unplanned
    agriculture production has been reduced and yield for farmers has been increased
    providing the necessary physical condition for the establishment of new villages

    ample employment opportunities for the local population especially rural residents in
    so doing we have in effect facilitated the establishment of small towns in rural area
    and contributed to the coordination of urban and rural developments by promoting the
