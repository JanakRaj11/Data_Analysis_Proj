    our journey
              this past year has been a highly
              productive one in cvs healths
              csr journey since we stopped the
              sale of tobacco products in our retail
              drugstores we accelerated our work
              by clearly defining the strategy and
              goals of our prescription for a better
              world in order to better align with
              cvs healths purpose of helping
              people on their path to better health

              working through our new prescription
              for a better world framework we
              have built a powerful crossfunctional
              team of senior leaders and subject
              matter experts to identify both the
              opportunities we have to advance
              our social and environmental
              commitments as well as potential
              constraints and challenges one
              thing we all agreed on is that the
              role of csr is more than just
              doing the right thing csr must
              deliver value to the business and to
              society while meeting the expectations
              stakeholders have of us

              to better understand the expectations
              of our stakeholders we engaged
              with our colleagues as well as with
              external parties customers clients

prescription drug abuse is a national issue that damages or destroys countless lives and
requires millions of dollars of unnecessary health care costs every year cvs health believes
that prescription drug abuse threatens the health and wellbeing of the communities where we

with allies and partners to bring about lasting systemic changes we also believe this is the
right thing to do for our customers and patients our 24000 pharmacists have a professional
duty to make sure medications are not being inappropriately prescribed or used improperly
we do this by partnering with organizations like the partnership for drugfree kids and

building capacity of diverse suppliers

in rhode island to train diverse suppliers in the skills needed to secure contracts
with large businesses

this included codeveloping a customized ceo master series focused on critical
management skills and industry knowledge cvs health and national grid each
sponsored three diverse businesses to participate in the program cvs health
sponsored participants included capital city construction a commercial general
contractor peachtree supplies an office and business product dealer and
heroicas painting a professional painting company

over two semesters beginning in april 2014 the ceos from those businesses focused
on learning skills to maximize employee performance develop successful business
proposals and critical areas for competitive advantage including sustainability training

celebrated in november cvs health plans to launch the program more broadly to
its diverse supplier community in 2015
