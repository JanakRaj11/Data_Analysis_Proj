reduction of oa paper
techno associe strives to reduce office paper consumption
by using both sides of paper when making copies and
printouts and by using projectors at meetings instead of
making copies for meeting attendees
    we used 66 tons of paper in fiscal 2013 down 07 tons
over the previous year and paper consumption per unit of
sales remained at the previous years level
    we plan to digitalize more of our administrative
documentation in order to eliminate unnecessary printing
