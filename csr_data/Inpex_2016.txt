          board of directors performance evaluation
          inpex has evaluated by means of a selfevaluation survey the overall effectiveness of the board of

case      directors in order to regularly verify that the board of directors is functioning appropriately as a whole and
          strives to identify issues and continue measures for improvement based on the results of such verification

study 2   the latest survey was conducted from march to early april 2016 as an evaluation of the fiscal 2015
              through the survey form responses were obtained from all directors and audit  supervisory board
          members regarding matters including the operations constitution roles and responsibilities of the board
          of directors
              the secretariat of the board of directors aggregated the responses and the board of directors
          sufficiently discussed and analyzed such responses after exchanging opinions between outside directors
          audit  supervisory board members and representative directors
              as a result of this evaluation process the board of directors has ensured a certain level of board
          effectiveness and confirmed the following matters

            in the operations of the board of directors with respect to the deliberations and the provision of
             information there are active discussions and information is readily provided and thus a certain level of
             effectiveness is ensured with a view to further improve effectiveness going forward more opportunities
             for advance explanations to outside directors are needed and efforts are required with regard to
             establishing appropriate proposals and efficient reporting etc
            with regard to the constitution of incumbent directors greater diversity needs to be ensured in terms
             of gender variety of experience in other industries academic expertise etc and we should
             accelerate the consideration of this matter
            the board of directors should ensure more time for discussion related to broad corporate strategies
             including medium to longterm vision and management policies in addition the board should
             further enhance the involvement of outside directors in those discussions with a view to increase
             corporate value over the medium to longterm

              we will make necessary improvements with the aim of ensuring greater effectiveness and enhancing
          the functions of the board of directors

                            at a time of substantial tightening of laws and regulations pertaining to bribery and corruption worldwide

                            instituted the antibribery and anticorruption abc guidelines applicable to the entire group to further


   study
                            reinforce the prohibition the guidelines were implemented in october 2014
                                  in implementing systems to prevent bribery and corruption within the group in accordance with the
                            abc guidelines we have positioned the institution of internal regulations that support risk assessment
                            and the guidelines as a highpriority task and have engaged the services of an external law firm with
                            expertise in the implementation of such systems
                                  risk assessment is said to be an effective and fundamental approach to building a strong compliance
                            program and in fiscal 2015 we conducted advanced risk assessment at each divisions in headquarters
                            and three overseas offices in countries and regions where we operate
                                  the assessment process involves collecting information on the frequency of negotiations with
                            government workers types of administrative acts approval processes and other matters through
                            responses to preliminary questions and interviews with our executives and employees at the headquarters
                            and overseas offices conducted by an antibribery and anticorruption secretariat set up under the
                            compliance committee the external law firm prepared a risk assessment report that summarized
                            degrees of risk and matters requiring improvement on the basis of the responses to these questions and
                            interview results we plan to make use of the report in instituting internal regulations and implementing

                                  future plans call for continued risk assessment at overseas offices efforts to minimize risks

               local communities are playing an important role in the construction of onshore facilities approximately
          3000 of the 7000 workers at the onshore construction site in darwin are locals
               krystal noakes a darwin local who has been working on the project for 18 months is one of more
          than 800 aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples engaged in the project krystal earned her
          certificate required to work in the resource industry during a preemployment training program she is
          now working through her electrical apprenticeship and is saving for her first home

               as the project reaches its peak level of onshore construction in 2016 construction activities progress
          from a predominantly civil focused works to mechanical and electrical works while it is not always feasible
          to source local staff with specialized skills that the project will require we are continuing to proactively
          provide locals with employment opportunities during the construction of the project
               we will also need workforces to support the longterm operational phase of the project for at least
          40 years for instance we expect to employ about 300 permanent staffs during the lng plant operations
          in darwin
               in 2012 the project contributed a3 million to the construction of the north australian centre for oil
          and gas at charles darwin university we are running the plant operation traineeship at this facility and
          continue to support building the capacity of the local workforce

     our overall ghg emissions in fiscal 2015 was 791              thousand tonsco2 from the fiscal 2005 level and                        within an upper chim

from the previous fiscal year the increase is attributed          the fiscal 1990 level by 2020 although the fiscal 2014                 resulting in less nighttime

     in our operations in japan we engage in improvement          and undertake further ghg emissions reduction to

 in the recently circulated inpex values questionnaire you received the highest number
 of nominations as someone who best represents a values person how do you feel
 about this nomination


 very honored of course but i must admit i think there are many others in our organization who
 could and should be recognized more than me for the way they live and breathe the inpex
 values both in and outside of work its certainly easier to be recognized when you are part
 of a group of people who share similar attitudes and passion for the way we work not just the
 things we work on

on a healthy balance between work and home life we
provide working environments that accommodate the
circumstances and lifestyles of individual employees
and enable people to demonstrate their full potential
we also pay close attention to external factors such as
japans declining birth rate and aging population when
promoting worklife balance
      as part of these activities we instituted a morning
oriented work style in july and august of 2015 to enable
employees to begin work early in the morning and
spend the evening with their families or in other pursuits
during the summer when daylight hours are longer
