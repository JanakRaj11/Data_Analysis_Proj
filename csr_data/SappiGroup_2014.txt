group safety performance

in 2014 there was a noticeable improvement
in workrelated incidents and near misses
reported investigated and analysed to prevent
recurrence



our investigations continue to focus on root
causes as opposed to finding blame

practical support is supplied in the form of
workshops training sessions a safety bulletin
and monthly sharing of good practices and of
learning from mistakes

energy selfsufficiency

our integrated mills have the capability to
generate their own power and steam using
biofuels mostly black liquor this reduces
these mills dependency on purchased energy
fuel power steam and makes them more
energy selfsufficient

about the kyoto protocol
in response to global concerns about the effect
