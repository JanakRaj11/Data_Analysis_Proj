                              dear readers

                              the phoenix group is publishing its fourth sustainability report under the motto reliable process
                              management it presents phoenix as an important link within the pharmaceutical supply chain and
                              demonstrates the quality with which the relevant processes are being implemented and improved
                              furthermore the report clearly reveals the progress being made within the company on the subject of
                              sustainability

                              in the fiscal year 201516 we worked intensively on our csr goals across the group we carried out the
                              first groupwide employee survey now its time to identify specific measures for the individual areas of
                              activity and introduce them in all countries our second objective was to reduce the illness rate for
                              which a slight decline was already recorded in the reporting year the new occupational health manage
                              ment system is helping us to put even greater focus on the health of our employees we are doing
                              everything we can to achieve our ambitious target of reducing the illness rate by one percentage point
                              by 201819 our third objective was to cut the costs associated with pharmaceutical waste which we
                              did by 3 per cent compared with the previous year the specific actions we have taken to optimise our
                              csr processes are described in the environment section using the best practice example of our danish
                              subsidiary

                              for the first time this report contains our performance indicators across all regions in a twoyear
                              comparison to this end we have further developed our csr processes and optimised data quality this
                              was an important topic at our first international meeting of csr managers in february 2016

                              our stakeholder questionnaire enabled us to define fundamental csr issues from the perspective of
                              our stakeholders and to add three further csr goals to our target programme for the fiscal year 201617
                              we are going to give the relevant employees throughout europe online and inperson training on the
                              compliance guidelines in germany we are expanding our online training programme to include data
                              protection until 201718 and employees at all our sites will be invited to participate furthermore we
                              will draw up groupwide data protection guidelines by mid2018

                                                                                                  letter from the executive board   3

a challenging market environment the good distribution practice gdp guidelines and counterfeit
pharmaceuticals have had an influence on our daytoday activities this year we have been a strong
supporter of the securpharm initiative in its efforts to reduce counterfeit drugs by preventing them from
entering the pharmaceuticals supply chain in future sustainable principles will be incorporated into our
business processes wherever possible  including the phoenix groups general procurement division
sustainability criteria will be taken into account when selecting our suppliers and products in an effort
to take more responsibility for the supply chain this allows us to strengthen our longstanding partner
ships and to reliably manage our procurement processes

the next step will be to roll out sustainability activities to other areas of the phoenix group such as our
retail business as a result we will be able to provide a comprehensive picture of the phoenix group in
the future

with this csr programme we are successfully facing up to the challenges in the market and within the
industry we feel confident about being wellprepared for the future  from an environmental social and
economic perspective  while also looking after the interests of our stakeholders

delivery of drugs and medical products on the other hand we also have a responsibility towards our            further information

ments for nontrading goods such as capital goods and services on behalf of the phoenix group and its
subsidiaries

the highest procurement volumes in this area include indirect material groups like transport mainte
nance and facility management services materials handling it infrastructure energy and vehicles

we have cultivated longstanding partnerships based on trust with many of our suppliers our supply
contracts ensure the necessary standards are met in terms of price quality and availability they also
increasingly incorporate business ethics clauses it is noteworthy that the standards of the phoenix
group are even more farreaching than those of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa in some                 see glossary page 70
instances once a year we hold annual talks with our suppliers of framework agreements with a focus on
quality assurance as well as on the implementation of innovations thus far we have carried out audits
when necessary or as required by law but not consistently for all suppliers in future we want to inte
grate sustainability criteria to a greater degree in our strategic procurement processes through the
selection of our suppliers or the products that we purchase on that account we set up a working group
at our last groupwide procurement meeting to develop appropriate proposals

we also observe strict ethical standards in sales it is a basic principle of the phoenix group not to offer
any products or services that are proscribed or even banned altogether

sustainability integrated in all corporate processes
for the phoenix group growth and corporate success are inseparably linked to social responsibility we
want to be measured against this claim issues relating to employees and the environment are therefore          g416
discussed in the context of the european girp and the german phagro associations we have also set
ourselves the goal of integrating sustainabilityoriented principles in all quality management processes
and our cooperation with customers business partners and employees we plan to gradually extend
this process to all of our companys subsidiaries it is the internationalisation of our markets and varying
conditions in the countries in particular that represent a significant challenge in this regard  a challenge
we are meeting with a management structure established across the group a csr programme and
binding targets

                             of heavily regulated markets counterfeit pharmaceuticals and the
                             sustainability programme of the phoenix group

the new corporate mission statement represents a further milestone in the development
of the phoenix group what role does sustainability play in this context


oliver windholz sustainable and responsible conduct are part of our daily work and an
aspect of our values enshrined in our corporate mission cooperation between employees
and business partners is based on a respectful trustworthy and proactive relationship
through the efficient use of our resources we ensure quality with respect to the environ
ment employees and society we are conscious of our responsibility in these areas of activity
in the past fiscal year we set ourselves the goal of conducting the first groupwide employee
survey which we carried out successfully we have also set ourselves two additional objec
tives to reduce our pharmaceutical waste and the illness rate by the end of 201819


sustainable conduct requires economic strength and competitiveness
what is your corporate strategy for commercial success


oliver windholz as a family business we want to grow profitably and organically through
targeted acquisitions in wholesale and retail our business model is focused on the customer
and quality but also conscious of costs we incorporate newly acquired businesses in all social
and environmental aspects of sustainability when investing in logistics we consider energy
efficient measures with the building of the largest northern european logistics centre in
denmark we are not only taking an environmentally friendly approach to construction but
are also expanding our services in prewholesale and pharma services


how does the phoenix group consistently manage to satisfy the strict legal
requirements in heavily regulated markets


oliver windholz laws and standards must be observed there is no question about that the
guidelines of good distribution practice gdp in particular are our top priority we base the
handling of up to 100000 medical products and pharmaceuticals on these guidelines our
compliance structures apply to the whole phoenix group and serve to make all employees
aware of specific issues and to train our focus group we are also playing a role in the fight
against counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals several years ago we joined the securpharm
partnership programme in germany this system will help to verify the authenticity of drugs
and identify individual packages

                           what is the phoenix group doing to be an attractive employer


                           oliver windholz in the past year we restructured our hr organisation the new structure
                           will assist the phoenix group in improving our position as an attractive employer the first
                           employee survey marked an important step for phoenix in this process we asked all employees
                           of the group about their job satisfaction the feedback was mostly positive but there are also
                           areas in which we must improve to this effect we decided on specific measures at a local
                           level in consultation with our employees across the group these will now have to be imple
                           mented i am pleased that so many of our employees offered their constructive feedback


                           is that enough to satisfy your demand for skilled personnel


                           oliver windholz no we have also initiated further important projects such as extending our
                           talent management programme across the entire phoenix group to the extent possible we
                           want to fill our management positions from within our own ranks in germany a company
                           wide framework agreement on occupational health management was concluded for the first
                           time with the central works council on the one hand we made a commitment to promoting
                           the health of our employees as well as a positive working atmosphere on the other hand we
                           also aim to make the workplace even safer and conducive to health our objective to lower
                           the illness rate by one percentage point will provide us with extra impetus


                           how are you managing to strengthen the companys unity across 26 european countries
                           and apply this groupwide


                           oliver windholz our focus is on further strengthening the cooperation between the sub
                           sidiaries so that we can learn from each other for this reason we launched the warehouse
                           excellence initiative two years ago for example through this initiative we have made it
                           possible for our employees to make continuous improvements to processes and exchange
                           information across the different sites these efforts have been received very positively by the
                           employees our new global intranet coin improves communication and cooperation between
                           departments and beyond borders in addition international meetings for all specialist depart
                           ments contribute to the personal exchange of knowhow which makes it easier to transfer
                           best practices between countries as a result the phoenix group is becoming more efficient
                           and a culture of close cooperation is developing

                                                           acting responsibly as a building block of corporate strategy   21




what role will responsible environmental and social conduct play in our
daytoday activities in the future


oliver windholz in 2015 we conducted our first groupwide sustainability survey more than
70 per cent of our stakeholders and management agreed that responsible conduct is an
essential component of our corporate strategy as we grow we try to make energyefficient
investments wherever possible the introduction of led technology at our distribution
centres for instance demonstrates that while we are significantly reducing our consumption
of energy our employees are working under more pleasant lighting conditions at the same
time the new group data protection division is overseeing phoenixs compliance with
all data protection requirements to protect both our customers and our employees our
compliance guidelines provide us with a framework for action and thus security in a heavily
regulated market


what are the companys specific objectives in the next few years


oliver windholz we have added two new areas of activity to our sustainability programme
by the end of the current fiscal year we will have trained all employees who need to be aware
of certain compliance guidelines in their daily work we are also expanding our data protec
tion training programme by the end of 201718 all employees in germany will be given
appropriate training we have set ourselves the goal of adopting groupwide data protection
guidelines by may 2018 the successful integration of our acquisitions will be another feature
of the coming fiscal year as you can see we have a lot planned in 2016 to keep the phoenix
group on the road to success during this fiscal year and to make further steps towards
becoming the best integrated healthcare provider together with our management our
employees and the advisory board we are working as one experienced motivated dedi
cated and committed to achieving results

             see also our    with regard to its economic responsibilities the phoenix group is continually faced with new challenges
          supply chain in    the political pressure on many healthcare systems requires additional savings and it is expected that
           the front flap   wholesale and retail margins will be further squeezed we are therefore concentrating on expanding our
                             own ranges and on intensifying cooperation across borders having local expertise at hand within the
                             group means that we can address the regional differences prevailing in the european pharmaceutical
                             markets

                             in the course of our materiality analysis we identified the topics that are of particular significance to our
                             value creation these issues include adherence to quality standards comprehensive availability of drugs
                             secure processing of customer data as well as the collaboration to combat counterfeit pharmaceuticals
                             consequently we are giving these areas more attention

                                                                                                                           added value       25




adding value  targeted acquisitions in wholesale and retail are part of the phoenix groups strategy for growth




we are continuously increasing the high level of quality and safety of our products and services through            g412 g413 g414
strict quality management in doing so our focus is on customer satisfaction in particular which we
assess on a regular basis and on compliance with statutory requirements observing the guidelines for
good distribution practice gdp in all companies is central to these efforts in the field of drug safety we      see glossary page 70
are involved with various organisations and initiatives across europe and are working to develop the
necessary structures to comply with stricter directives in the future we are also continuing to develop
the field of data protection and striving to apply europewide regulations across the entire phoenix
group the appropriate structures are currently being implemented

corporate strategy targets longterm growth
we want to create value in the long term through a customeroriented corporate culture rigorous cost
awareness and profitoriented growth in addition to the successful integration of our acquisitions and
the realisation of major investment projects the expansion of the business segments wholesale retail
and pharma services plays a key role

throughout all business units the phoenix group continuously implements best practices across
europe in addition to groupwide initiatives the group particularly benefits from process optimisation
measures carried out successfully on a local basis which then serve as a starting point for improvement
measures in other countries

acquisitions strengthen the core business
the phoenix groups growth strategy comprises not only organic growth but also targeted acquisitions
in wholesale and retail in taking over sunpharma pharmacies in slovakia we entered a new retail market
in 2015 in line with the rebranding as benu pharmacies we will also continue our selective expansion
of benus market presence in central and eastern europe our dutch company brocacef groep has
received approval by the relevant competition authorities to acquire the mediq apotheken nederland bv
in addition to pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesale this acquisition also includes prewholesale                see glossary page 71

                            the phoenix group is fully committed to its responsibility for environmental protection reducing
                            pharmaceutical waste is one of the most important fields of action since it not only comes at a high
                            cost to the company but also poses an ecological threat

                            our employees receive regular training in the application of the gdp guidelines for handling pharma
                            ceuticals both at our distribution centres and during transportation these efforts also help to avoid
                            damage to packaging and will get us closer to achieving our goal of cutting the cost of pharmaceutical
                            waste by 10 per cent by 201819

                                                                                                                   environment         33




we are increasing our investment in effective energy monitoring at the end of 2015 we successfully
carried out the energy audit as required by the european energy efficiency directive and the german law      see glossary page 69
on energy services and other energy efficiency measures the results of this audit have revealed detailed
information about appropriate optimisation measures some of which we are already implementing
such as the use of led lighting technology

the phoenix group is also engaged in various efforts to protect the climate for example through the
increased use of renewable energy sources to supply power as well as an economical and efficient trans
port logistics system

significantly reducing pharmaceutical waste
the phoenix group transports and stores around ten million pharmaceutical packages every day due            g4en23 g4en27
to technical problems and human error in our processes it is not always possible to avoid damage to
preclude risks to health and the environment pharmaceuticals with damaged packaging are categorised
 as hazardous waste by law they must be withdrawn from the supply chain and disposed of in accord
 ance with regulations

within the phoenix group we registered 120355 tonnes of pharmaceutical waste in the reporting
period an increase of almost 9 per cent in comparison with the previous year this is due on the one
hand to the 3 per cent increase in revenue on the other hand patients in most countries especially in
northern europe return damaged and expired products to the pharmacies these products are then
disposed of by wholesalers which means that the amount of pharmaceutical waste cannot be fully
controlled by our company

nevertheless the phoenix group wants to avoid pharmaceutical waste from the outset we have set             the phoenix group
ourselves the target to reduce the cost of pharmaceutical waste by 10 per cent by 201819 in comparison     wants to reduce the
with the 201415 figures in the reporting year the costs incurred amounted to eur 335 million            cost related to pharma

which is the equivalent of 014 per cent of our total revenue in the previous year the costs amounted to

                             in particular employees in all our subsidiaries must observe and implement the rules in accordance with
                             the gdp guidelines the most important requirements in the distribution centres include

                                andling packages with care

                             in some countries employees are regularly informed in meetings about the cost of products that were
                             damaged or expired in the previous weeks employees are thus more aware and sensitised furthermore
                             it is possible to compare the distribution centres on the basis of the cost analysis

                             transmed drivers must also take care that packages are not damaged during transportation packages
                             therefore have to be carried with both hands and should never be loaded onto vehicles on end or tilted
                             likewise containers must be stored upright to prevent liquids from leaking out strapping around trans
                             port crates should not be removed packages also need to be secured with tensioning straps for example
                             to avoid shifting during transportation

proper handling of nonhazardous waste
besides hazardous waste company processes also generate other waste materials that are not classified
as hazardous these include plastics paper and cardboard waste from power generation and mixed
waste that is consigned to special waste facilities for proper handling biodegradable waste is allowed
to decompose naturally wherever possible in total over 20000 tonnes of nonhazardous waste is
generated annually which is mostly recycled at all of the subsidiaries of the phoenix group

continuous improvements in energy efficiency
the phoenix group has further expanded the energy monitoring of its buildings which also contributes
to meeting stricter statutory requirements in 2015 the emphasis was on implementing the energy

mental management system of the eu the subsidiaries of the phoenix group have taken on this
challenge and have completed energy audits germany france the netherlands or are awaiting the
introduction of a certified energy management system eg croatia

in germany a multisite process was used for the energy audit due to the size of the company for which
15 representative sites were selected the subsidiaries that were audited included phoenix group it
gmbh and transmed transport gmbh an energy monitoring system was utilised to provide the relevant
data for the audit on the sites energy consumption

in the meantime our company has invested in its own human resources for energy management in
2015 one of our employees successfully passed the exam to become a certified energy auditor according

      see glossary page 69    lighting is one of the key areas in which we are optimising energy efficiency at phoenix in germany for
                                example lighting accounts for 15 to 20 per cent of our total electricity demand the gradual transition
                                from fluorescent to led lighting is therefore one of our preferred ways of realising energy savings
                                led lighting not only requires less electricity offers longer life and higher light output but is also less
                                harmful to the environment when it comes to disposal

                                thanks to the complete transition to led technology in the distribution centres in 2015 the phoenix

of their power from renewable sources and their annual co2 emissions have dropped by 14000 tonnes

new structure and agenda for hr management
like many other companies the phoenix group is faced with major personnel challenges these include
providing employees with the best support the appeal of the employer brand dealing with demographic
change changed recruitment markets and worklife balance

an efficient hr organisation is essential to giving these issues specific attention to this end we made     aligning the hr strategy
some important decisions during the reporting period as a result an hr strategy has been developed          to the corporate mission
that is aligned to the corporate mission statement this strategy includes the efficient realisation of all   statement will harmonise
                                                                                                              tasks across the group
administrative tasks related to personnel as well as strengthening the role of hr as a business partner in
the company that actively handles and guides strategic issues of future importance we are aiming to          see glossary page 70
implement and promote these topics across the group as well as intensifying standardising and
improving the quality of support at german sites and subsidiaries

as part of the reorganisation of hr the phoenix group is therefore establishing a model based on
three pillars




    1 hr business partner the future central contact for employees and departments
       concerning all personnel issues

    2 hr competence centre bringing together central and groupwide hr topics with the
       support of centrally directed expert teams

    3 hr systems  shared services optimising and standardising hr systems and
       hr reporting in conjunction with performance measurement using key figures




focus on competency model and talent management
we have developed an accompanying competency model based on our corporate mission that takes
into account not only the point of view of the company and technical aspects but also management and
customerspecific perspectives groupwide standardised assessment criteria establish transparency in
terms of the requirements performance and potential of our senior management

we aim to fill our management positions largely and wherever appropriate from within the ranks of our
own company the very high continuity in our management makes up an important component of our
success we strive for transnational succession planning for top positions which open up even more
groupwide career opportunities at the same time we are reducing the cost of external recruitment and
the risk of losing corporate expertise we offer our managers interesting career prospects and strengthen
their commitment to our company in doing so

finland construction of the new childrens hospital is making progress
our finnish company tamro has been making a significant contribution to the construction of a new
childrens hospital in helsinki since 2013 the existing childrens hospital built in 1946 no longer meets
modern standards  even though it is the only facility in the whole of finland to offer a full range of
medical services hence a foundation was set up in 2012 to pave the way for the building of a new
childrens hospital by the end of 2015 tamro had provided eur 100000 in funding to this project on
the one hand the company made direct donations to the foundation and on the other hand it appealed
to all of its employees and business partners to participate the hospital will be fitted with furniture
