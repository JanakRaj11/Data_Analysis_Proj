to better serve our communities through volunteer and pro bono work

where are we now

we are growing our sustainability and resiliency services we are working toward the
goal of carbonneutral business operations we are advocating for smart decisions by
governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and we are working to reduce the
lifecycle impact of structural materials in our projects

we are evaluating our employees satisfaction and comfort in the office so that we
can create a better workplace and we are providing new benefits and opportunities
for employees to grow we are engaging in important conversations on topics such as
women in engineering




    how do smart companies achieve enduring success
    the triple bottom line approach to sustainability  the planet people and
    profits  resonates with me because it touches every dimension of how a
    business should operate it shows how great companies can achieve enduring
    success and leave lasting legacies for future generations most of us spend a lot of
    time thinking about realizing success in the short term but how often do we take
    a longterm view i hope we will make many lasting contributions to building a
    better future but to do so we must adapt to current business realities while being
    mindful of the world in which we operate i want our firm to be the global driver of
    change and innovation in our industry  and i know we can get there i envision a
    future where young highpotential employees aspire to work at thornton tomasetti
    a great firm known for our projects and also for our values

                      looking ahead to our next sustainability report which will be published in 2016 we expect to make
                      progress toward our strategic sustainability goals in these areas

                      a lower carbon footprint and early achievement of our fiveyear goal

                      were moving closer to our goal of achieving carbonneutral business operations by 2030 by next year
                      we expect to achieve a lower overall carbon footprint for the firm and a lower average carbon emissions
                      per employee in 2013 we set a fiveyear target of 40 tons of carbon emissions average per person
                      not counting carbon offsets for air travel we are moving quickly towards this goal and may accomplish it
                      sooner than planned

                      integrating sustainability practices into our structural projects

                      as a member of the aia 2030 commitment we are dedicated to achieving carbonneutral buildings by
                      2030 we cant accomplish this goal without collaborating with our clients and partners but we hope to
                      contribute as structural engineers by reducing the embodied carbon in structural systems by 2016 we
                      expect to see sustainability practices integrated into our structural designs with a resulting decrease in the
                      embodied carbon of our projects

                      measurable gains in employee engagement

                      many of our corporate sustainability initiatives have focused on reducing our carbon footprint and improving
                      office environments a new employee engagement survey will help thornton tomasetti to achieve better
                      employee wellness and satisfaction results from the annual survey will help us set specific targets to
                      increase performance in lowerperforming areas and advance our goal of achieving measurable success in
                      raising performance in at least three areas critical to good employee engagement
