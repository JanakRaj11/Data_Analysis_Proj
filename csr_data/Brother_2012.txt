face to face talk sowing the seeds for a sustainable
future while expanding ties and cooperation




the great east japan earthquake has taught people the value of uniting the heart to assist the
reconstruction and caused people to reconsider conventional ways of thinking against this
backdrop brother industries president toshikazu koike invited tokiko kato who is involved in
assisting the reconstruction and conveying her own message to the public based on her experience
to discuss a sustainable society and brothers csr management



looking back over the past year since the earthquake

koike  on march 14 2012 we delivered about 2300 handmade bags brothers 500 selfgenerating
ﬂashlights and ﬁve home sewing machines to shichigahamamachi a town just south of shiogama city
in miyagi prefecture which was struck by the huge tsunami we were lucky to have a connection with
the town through a nonproﬁt organization based in nagoya city which has focused on reconstruction
eﬀorts in shichigahamamachi and have been working with this npo

kato  what made you decide to start the activities

koike  since the earthquake in 2011 the brother group has been helping the reconstruction in various
ways with the assistance of group companies around the world some employees in a department
responsible for the home sewing machine business volunteered to start a project for delivering
handmade goods created using sewing machines which are what brother ﬁrst started producing they
invited other employees to join the project by distributing guidebooks on how to create handmade
goods eventually the project involved sales and manufacturing subsidiaries sales partners such as
dealers and customers who use brother sewing machines both in and outside japan

face to face talk sowing the seeds for a sustainable
future while expanding ties and cooperation
koike more than 2300 handmade items were collected
far beyond the initial target of 1000 and were delivered
to elementary and junior highschool children and people
living in evacuation shelters in shichigahamamachi
the selfgenerating ﬂashlights which are ecofriendly and
suitable for longterm storage incorporate our
proprietary shakecharging technology which harnesses
vibration energy power is generated simply by shaking
the ﬂashlight these selfgenerating ﬂashlights dont
require batteries and so are useful in an emergency the
town mayor was very pleased

kato  selfgenerating ﬂashlights amazing talking about sewing machines my mother used to work as
a dressmaker but sewing machines have become much more convenient over the years

koike yes in the aﬀected areas many people have become reclusive in their temporary homes due to
the psychological shock of the earthquake and fears about the future this is not good for their mental
health we thought that sewing machines could help them communicate with each other create something
and refresh their soul so we delivered our sewing machines in the hope that craftwork would help
motivate them as you mentioned sewing machines today are very convenient its easy to thread the
machines users can scan images and enjoy easily making decorative embroideries some people who
learned from us how to use the machines were surprised by the functionality and ease of operation
by the way i heard you have visited the aﬀected areas many times to talk with the local people

kato  yes the tv reports on the aﬀected areas immediately after the earthquake reminded me of the
situation after world war ii when i was young i was held in a concentration camp in manchuria
eventually i was put on a freight train and returned to japan on a repatriation ship and thats when i
started i was overwhelmed with a sense of nostalgia and felt very close to the people who appeared on
tv they were on the edge of survival pictures of babies in the arms of their mothers in evacuation
shelters reminded me of my childhood that sense of closeness prompted me to write a song ima
dokoni imasuka in one week the song reﬂected the simplest form of myself eliminating all
unnecessary things in my life when i was small although there were hardships i found my mission to
sing songs in that sense 311 marked a major milestone in my life by taking me back to where i began
last year i visited the aﬀected areas several times in february 2012 i went to miyagi prefecture and
found lively temporary markets throughout the prefecture with unique names such as yume ichiba
dream market or kaze ichiba wind market which sound encouraging and amusing at a market in
ofunato city i found that a community with a nice atmosphere had been created with a boardwalk a
wooden walkway which i was told had been donated when i served as unep goodwill ambassador i
visited sri lanka and thailand after they had been hit by the tsunami caused by the earthquake oﬀ the
coast of sumatra large markets were created around temporary home communities and were packed
with people printing designs on tshirts and making clothes with sewing machines

koike when i visited shichigahamamachi i was impressed by the character of the town mayor he has
been staying with his relatives because his house was destroyed by the tsunami when i asked when he
was going to rebuild his house he replied ill think about it when the issue of relocating the town to
high ground is solved and all the temporary shelters are gone i was greatly impressed to see such
integrity in todays world in the town mayor election held this year he was reelected uncontested but
he will have to work hard for another four years in a diﬃcult situation he really amazed me

kato  i too have met many upstanding people in the tohoku region doing great work like the mayor

thinking about energy and the environment in asia
                                                     koike in 2010 a donation presentation ceremony of the ink cartridge
                                                     return project was held in conjunction with the tenth meeting of the
                                                     conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity
                                                     cop10 thank you very much for visiting brother communication
                                                     space as unep goodwill ambassador

                                                     kato  thank you for inviting me how is the project going

                                                     koike six printer manufacturers have been collecting and recycling
used ink cartridges through post oﬃces and some public oﬃces about 16 million ink cartridges have
been recycled annually in europe north and south america and asia the brother group is collecting
and recycling cartridges via unique systems in the respective regions
incidentally energy issues have attracted much public attention since 311 in the 1970s you built
kamogawa shizen ohkoku kamogawa natural kingdom with your husband in chiba prefecture showing
your stance on such issues based on your own experience which types of energy are you most
interested in now

kato  i am seriously considering introducing a low head hydropower system near kamogawa and have
been doing some research last year i visited the kingdom of bhutan with my friends and was surprised
to learn that the country produces four times more electricity than it uses so it exports some to india
the electricity is generated by low head hydropower systems utilizing the steep mountains and abundant
snowmelt in the himalayas unlike japan bhutan does not have big cities or large industries that need a
lot of electricity so they do not need to build large dams when i learned about these things i thought
we can learn from bhutans approach japan may be diﬀerent from bhutan in terms of economic scale
and socioeconomic system but it is similar in being mountainous with many mountain streams and high
annual precipitation

koike regarding the himalayas i understand that the glacial lakes have been melting due to global
warming and that villages in lowlying areas are at risk of ﬂooding prevention of global warming is a top
priority of the brother group and we have been working hard to enhance the energy eﬃciency of our
products and meet co2 emissions reduction targets at manufacturing facilities and oﬃces in and
outside japan under the global slogan of brother earth

kato  we really need products to help communities become selfsuﬃcient in electricity although battery
capacity is an issue selfgenerating ﬂashlights surely have huge potential i hope you will create a big
market for this product

face to face talk sowing the seeds for a sustainable
future while expanding ties and cooperation
koike yes in fact our engineers have been working to solve the
challenges to broaden the range of applications in future for
example our technology could mean that mobile phone users dont
have to struggle to ﬁnd a power outlet when the battery runs out 
they could generate electricity and recharge their phones simply by
shaking them recently we have launched a new highquality video
conferencing system using cloud computing these systems help
reduce energy consumption for longdistance business trips for
example thus reducing global warming and improving the worklife
balance by eﬃcient time management

kato  in japan technologies tend to be developed to assist people who need help this is a wonderful
approach
in many asian countries today the rich natural environment is being destroyed in the rush to
modernize making the same mistake japan did several decades ago however japan learned a lot from
environmental mistakes and has developed worldclass green technologies japans technologies should
be transferred to asian countries to help protect the beautiful nature and create business
opportunities and the local people would be grateful to japan the concept of brother earth should
be reﬂected in this context

expanding ties and cooperation toward a sustainable future

koike you debuted 47 years ago and yet you still perform often hosting tours such as horoyoi
concert appearing on tv and radio programs writing books doing interviews and taking care of the
kamogawa natural kingdom where do you get the energy

kato  i think i am destined to do all of these things i do not have intentions things happen in the
natural course of events i have liked rivers since my childhood and i used to spend a lot of time by
rivers the water rushes down a river and from the same riverhead ﬂows to diverse destinations if you
drop a leaf on the surface of a river you can watch it bump into rocks and circle around and around
going nowhere but eventually it will move on and ﬂow down i feel like that ﬂow if there is someone who
needs me when i am asked to come i think i can go i decide to do things based on that simple principle
so when i come across an event i try to face it honestly if i meet someone by chance i try to
communicate with sincerity visit them as much as possible and do whatever i can this is my style
memories of events and people i have met properly and courteously can last for 10 or 20 years at a
concert in an aﬀected area i met someone who had been to one of my concerts 20 years ago the
person vividly remembered the concert and so did i and we both commented on the fun we had had in
2011 i discovered on many occasions that i am still connected to people whom i met 20 years ago
even though we have never exchanged letters over the years
this experience totally changed my attitude toward people i meet by chance i try to do my best for the
people i meet over the years of my life there have been undercurrents of water and i have felt the joy
of discovering the water ﬂowing to the surface and forming a spring in that sense i am very grateful
for my decades as a singer

future while expanding ties and cooperation
koike our history resembles yours one hundred and four years ago brother started out as a repairer
of imported sewing machines with the ambition of turning the import industry into an export industry
brother succeeded in manufacturing sewing machines in japan later while forecasting changing needs
we switched our main products one after another from knitting machines and typewriters to machine
tools printers and multifunction devices today our sales outside japan account for about 80 percent
and we sell products in more than 40 countries and regions over the years we have made numerous
mistakes but our predecessors always embraced the challenges without hesitation
so our philosophy is not neither too much nor too little we do a lot even if it is too much it is
important to correct any mistakes and change course to survive otherwise we cannot keep up with the
changing times

kato  you mentioned sewing machines and printers as examples how are they related to each other
technologically are they linked say on a family tree

koike yes for example when a product is developed other technologies are generated in the process
these technologies may grow into a big branch blossom and bear fruit through such processes some
                                                                   businesses grow into large mature trees while other
                                                                   businesses are like young skinny trees growing rapidly these
                                                                   businesses are related to each other and form the big forest

face to face talk sowing the seeds for a sustainable
future while expanding ties and cooperation
kato  i too am committed to expanding ties and cooperation last year i released a cd titled
nuchiyui and decided to focus on nuchiyui in my activities nuchi is an okinawan dialect that means
life while yui is an archaic japanese word that means ties for sustaining communities i coined
nuchiyui to communicate the message of keeping ties among people and connecting the past with
the future to pass on the baton of life i will keep singing to deliver this message
japan has been quick to abandon its past but i believe that constancy in constancy and change as
described in zeamis kadensho should be handed over properly to the next generation in that sense
there is a lot to learn from bhutans approach while actively introducing cuttingedge technologies the
country is committed to preserving its traditions and customs people of our generation have a duty to
connect the past with the future so i will continue to sing until i become 100

koike i agree i do not intend to retire when i turn 60 i will continue to work as a senior volunteer or
something similar this type of personal commitment will revitalize our nation thank you very much for
today

significantly increasing the printing speed and enhancing the multifunctionality of compact inkjet allinone



packaging diverse functions into a compact body to
meet everchanging needs

in the printer market customers needs are diversifying and
becoming increasingly demanding such as for small reasonably
priced faster printers with various useful functions to meet
these expectations brother released the new compact inkjet
allinone for the japanese market in september 2011

the development team ﬁrst focused on improving the basic
                                                                                new compact inkjet allinone with much faster
performance the new engine1 technology that had been
                                                                                printing and multifunctionality
developed for business equipment was built into the compact
inkjet allinone features also include a new print head with
double the nozzle density and a continuous feeding mechanism
in which the second page starts being fed while the ﬁrst page is
still being output as a result printing of a4 normal paper is
more than three times faster than conventional models of
brothers compact inkjet allinone
                                                                                  a conventional head         a new head
the higher grades of models feature automatic doublesided                        printing speed remarkably increased by the
                                                                                  highspeed engine
printing ideal for printing new years cards and saving paper
and label direct printing for cds dvds and bds bluray discs
in particular the label printing function which market surveys
showed customers ranked highly used to be found only on the
highend models the development team created a unique
mechanism by using every last millimeter of height and clearance
to build the label printing function into the compact inkjet
allinone without sacriﬁcing the compactness of the main unit
which is equivalent to the conventional models

1 engine installed in brother products means a processing unit
    such as a program or hardware for fulﬁlling speciﬁc functions




                                                                              label printing top and doublesided printing bottom

the development team also took on the ambitious challenge of enabling the compact inkjet allinone to
connect to the cloud2 to enable photos to be linked with mobile terminals and web services3 whose
number of users is rapidly increasing for example photos taken with a smartphone can be transferred and
stored in the cloud then shared with friends and printed with a compact inkjet all in one without a pc

to achieve this however brother had to sign contracts with various web service companies interfaces
standards for intermediate forms of exchanging data were also needed nevertheless inhouse
divisions worked as a team to overcome the challenge within a shortterm since its release the new
compact inkjet allinone has been highly evaluated by many including customers as a nextgeneration
printer that anticipates modern needs and enhances brothers brand presence as a third choice when
selecting printersprinter that anticipates modern needs and enhances brothers brand presence as a
third choice when selecting printers



2 cloud is short for cloud computing services by which software and data conventionally managed and used on respective computers
     are stored in large data centers and made available to users as needed via the internet
3 web services refer to various services oﬀered by community websites and social networks

minimizing product returns and servicing

based on brothers unique concept from the viewpoint of customers


eﬀorts to minimize the number of returns after shipment
at the brother group the percentage of products returned from customers for repair or return is
deﬁned as product returns and servicing rate we believe that the time and eﬀort suﬀered by
customers due to trouble with the products no matter how small is an inconvenience for them the
brother group believes that reducing the number of returned products close to zero should be placed
above all others to achieve greater customer satisfaction and together with all departments from
development design manufacture logistics sales to services we promote the acrosstheboard activity
to pursue improvement of products quality



efforts to reduce the product returns and servicing rate of industrial sewing machines

the principles of contributing to society by supplying products that
meet customer needs ensuring product safety as the basis of
quality assurance and putting top priority on product safety

during product development we assess safety risks to ensure the
product will perform safely until the end of its service life we             staﬀ at a manufacturing facility disassembling

not cause a safety risk and that troubles will not lead to accidents

we have built a database by collecting information such as past
cases feedback from customers about overheating and internal
troubles including burnt parts found during repairs from facilities
around the world we have extensively analyzed the causes and
possibility of problems turning into serious accidents such as a
ﬁre and ways of improving the design and instruction manuals
                                                                              a product safety training program in which

preventing troubles before they occur rather than preventing                 at brother industries shenzhen ltd
recurrence in addition the divisions own product safety training
was rolled out to manufacturing and sales facilities to share knowledge

as a result there were no serious accidents caused by brothers products worldwide in fy 2011 the
number of cases of burnt parts etc increased because more products were shipped and a wider range
of information was collected but the number was still half the peak in fy 2008

the brother group will continue to review its product safety standards and improve training to deliver

minimizing risks to parts procurement in case of disaster

building a disasterresistant supply chain based on lessons learned from
the great east japan earthquake

the great east japan earthquake in march 2011 disrupted
supply chains in many industries and highlighted the diﬃculty of
handling risks in the event of a disaster having experienced
partial disruption of parts procurement after the earthquake the
brother group has been building a disasterresistant supply
chain

speciﬁcally an earthquake response concurrent team was set up
in march immediately after the earthquake as an initial response                                   earthquake response members reviewing models
                                                                                                    of a disasterresistant supply chain
consisting of members from relevant departments in particular
the purchasing dept gathered information from suppliers and adjusted delivery schedules for parts
that were diﬃcult to procure meanwhile the development dept and production dept cooperated in
evaluating substitute parts this quick response successfully minimized the impact of the earthquake on
production

subsequently earthquake response members from the purchasing dept analyzed the causes of
procurement problems and developed a minimal operation model that should be sustained in the event
of a major earthquake this model was shared with relevant inhouse departments meanwhile parts
suppliers and the brother group reviewed response measures from their respective viewpoints and
then launched eﬀorts such as developing generalpurpose parts procuring parts from two or more
suppliers and manufacturing parts at two or more facilities

with cooperation from suppliers the brother group will quickly prepare a procurement manual
reﬂecting diverse risks including major natural disasters and invest resources in building a more reliable
supply chain for customers and business partners

 supply chain the process from production of raw materials for products to delivery to end consumers
