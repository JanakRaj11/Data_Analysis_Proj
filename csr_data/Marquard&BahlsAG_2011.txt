topics of concern
                     we went through several phases to identify the most relevant topics from the areas of                                although the topics in the ﬁeld of corporate citizenship are presumably of lesser importance
                     corporate responsibility first we made a list of various topics we considered to be                                for most of our stakeholders we added them to our cr strategy because we see this
                     relevant to both us and our stakeholders these were then prioritized by assessing our                               commitment as an important pillar of our corporate responsibility to identify new and

                     conducted an internal materiality analysis for each of our stakeholders and prioritized the
                     topics accordingly the topics of high importance as circled in fig 3 were translated into
