from blake moret
president and ceo
its a privilege to share my perspective on corporate responsibility for the first time
i joined rockwell automation 31 years ago and became president and ceo in july 2016
im very proud of the legacy of caring and environmental stewardship that ive inherited
and im committed to building on this legacy as we move forward never has it been more
important that we fulfill our obligation as an iconic global company to set an example for
our employees customers partners shareholders and communities

we start with our mission to improve the quality of life by making the world more
productive and sustainable our accomplishments in 2016 were significant once again
the ethisphere institute named us one of the worlds most ethical companies and the
dow jones sustainability north american index listed us as a member newsweek ranked
us among the top green companies in the us 7 im especially proud to see that our
employees worked more safely than the year before with safety performance that was
among the best in our industry

as ceo inclusion and engagement are priorities for me every three years we conduct our
global voices employee engagement survey in 2016 we continued to have a strong stable
employee engagement index score that was significantly higher than comparable global
companies i believe there is a strong correlation between highly engaged employees and
customer loyalty

we are a global technology leader that focuses all of our passion and knowledge
on making our customers more productive today industrial automation is less
about adding capacity and more about efficiently using what you have to achieve the
next level of productivity with our innovation and extensive understanding of industrial
processes we help customers do more with less through smarter safer and more
sustainable manufacturing

as important as it is to invest in the next breakthrough innovation its equally important
to us to invest in developing our current and future workforce technology has driven our
industry forward but a global skills gap that leaves millions of jobs unfilled threatens to
hold us back we strongly support the concept of lifelong learning for recent graduates
and experienced employees including our own and those of our customers for the future
workforce we contribute thousands of volunteer hours and millions of dollars to the success
of first for inspiration and recognition of science and technology and other stem
science technology engineering and math programs employees want to know that their
work is important they will have the tools and training to succeed and they will have the
opportunity to advance their careers

these are the issues we care about deeply and where we feel we need to lead were
grateful for the mutual interest you have in these topics and in our efforts and progress
as always we welcome your thoughts and ideas

                                                  sincerely
