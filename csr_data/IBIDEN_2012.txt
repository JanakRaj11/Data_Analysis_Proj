    consolidated mediumterm management plan and implementation of csr management
    the aim of the global ibitechno 100 plan our mediumterm management plan is to establish a struc
    ture that achievessustainable growthandstable profitabilityduring the next 100 years starting from
    the 100th anniversaryimplementing csr managementis clearly specified as one of the key pillars
    of activities underpinning the activities of this plan to continue to move forward consistently after
    100 years we are striving for increased trust and management transparency
       in fiscal year 2011 we made changes in theibiden group charter of behaviorwhich is shared
    within the group to implement csr management and thoroughly discussed our role in each field
    sharing our values concerning goals in fiscal year 2012 we will make efforts in a way that enables
    each department to manage activities separately to achieve goals

    risk response promotion from a global perspective
    in fiscal year 2011 we were struck by the largescale natural disasters of the great east japan
    earthquake and heavy flooding in thailand at a global level these events caused serious damage to
    the business world including the disruption of supply chains though the ibiden group suffered little
    direct damage from both disasters there was significant impact on the electronics and automobile
    markets in terms of the procurement of raw materials and parts moreover our customers suffered
    serious damage the company managed to minimize the impact on production by quickly
    implementing procedures for authorizing substitute products furthermore since we responded to
    requests for emergency assistance from customers to the utmost extent we received words of
    appreciation from many customers
       learning from the disasters we had experienced we launched efforts to secure multiple supply
    chains and establish global production bases in response to the request from our main customers for
    the establishment of a bcp business continuity plan to handle any natural disaster in the future

    building trust through communication
    to be a trusted partner in the international community we need to initiate and maintain dialogues
    with our stakeholders and undertake actions by working closely with them beyond the confines of our
    group the ibiden group continues its proactive disclosure of information regarding its financial
    condition products and csr and promotes transparent management practices in an attempt to help
    stakeholders gain a greater understanding of how the group is run and decisions are made
       we hope you will get to know the group   s range of undertakings discussed in this report and we
    welcome your feedback and opinions

    undergoing sustainable management assessment
    in order to realize and maintain csr management it is essential not only to conduct internal evaluations and
    audits but also to assess our activities from an objective viewpoint to this end the company undergoes an
    external assessment every two years and strives to improve on the credibility of the csr activities it promotes
         in march 2012 we thus underwent thesustainable management assessmentsma which was conduct
    ed by a nonprofit organization npo the sustainable management forum of japan smf to evaluate the
    level of our activities pertaining to areas such as management environment and social development while
    working jointly with the organization to verify the evidence proof andor rationale of these activities as the
    smf takes into account the requirements of iso 26000 we believe that the assessment conducted on the
           s activities provides an evaluation based on international guidelines
    company
         we were given an average evaluation of 7 75 as a result of this assessment which indicated that we
    have yet to satisfy all sustainable management standards by category we were givenmeets the sustainable
    levelin the area of management such as compliance and riskmanagementapproaching the sustainable lev
    elin the area of environment andalmost meets the sustainable levelin the area of social development
    including human resource management the evaluation also provided suggestions for improvements
         the smf gave an excellent evaluation on environmental topics such as chemical control use of natural en
    ergy and waste reduction it was pointed out however that to continue to decrease our environmental load
    it is necessary to expand the range of control beyond the group to gain a complete understanding of the cur
    rent status promotion of biodiversity protection activities also will benefit from further development in the
    area of social development the smf indicated that the company needed to continue to thoroughly inform its
    employees throughout the group of the policies and visions it is pursuing in matters such as human resources
    it was also suggested that the company should present more effectively its intended course of action in local
    communities to its employees
         having considered the abovementioned suggestions we have already included them in our policies for fis
    cal year 2012 in the area of environment this report also outlines more clearly various action policies in areas
    such as social contribution


    corporate evaluation by external organizations and thirdparty audit
    the company conducts gap analyses betweenwhat it should beand the results of external corporate eval
    uations our csr promotion division analyzes the data obtained from important survey questions and
    discusses the course of action with departments involved to identify elements that are lacking at the compa
    ny furthermore if it is possible to improve upon these elements during the next fiscal year each department
    develops strategies within its action policy
         the results of csrrelated audits conducted by thirdparty organizations similarly undergo the process of
                                                                                                           s
    gap analysis to establish the difference between the global industryrequired standards and the company
    current efforts and to identify issues that need to be addressed we take to heart the suggested issues put
    forward during these audits and strive to improve upon them by analyzing the causes and implementing cor
    rective actions as well as preventative measures furthermore we are working toward creating a system that
    meets the global standards by improving upon these issues for fiscal year 2011 our focus was on developing fur
    ther our human rights activities in asia by establishing rules and guidelines that clearly state items that require
    attention concerning human rights

    up a department responsible for each risk category strengthening the ac
    countability structure and offering seminars and workshops geared toward

    should the internal audit or other mechanisms discover business actions that may create risk of loss the offi
    cer responsible for the strategic corporate planning operation is immediately tasked to understand the
    details of the said risk as well as the scope of its potential loss he then gives instructions on swift and sys
    tematic measures and attempts to prevent the loss from occurring furthermore in case of a largescale
    accident or a disaster he immediately sets up the headquarters to thoroughly understand the situation imple
    ment first responses and prevent further loss to minimize the loss

    addressing risks
    the ibiden group undertakes risk management activities so that we may continue to reliably conduct our
    business operations we regularly detect and assess risks to reduce risks in important areas operational divi
    sions are working on the risks related to strengthening our business competitive edge while functional
    divisions are addressing the risks bringing serious repercussions to the company    s business in fiscal year
    2011 focusing on the risk of legal violation as a companywide risk we built a legal compliance system and
    implemented measures for boosting legal compliance management to next level at each functional division
    as for measures to be taken when disasters such as earthquakes occur we believe that lifesaving comes first
    followed by the early supply of products to customers
        to prepare for earthquakes we not only check each building  s resistance to earthquakes but also deter
    mine the items matters and divisions for actions to be taken in regard to damage prevention secondary
    damage and anticipation furthermore to prepare for supply risks that may occur during earthquakes and
    other disasters we have verified the current situation at the company as well as our suppliers and begun im
    plementing measures to reduce risk in the order of risk priority

    compliance companywide promotional committee
    in august 2003 the compliance companywide promotional committee headed by the president was formed
    in an effort to bolster compliancerelated awareness across the group the committee carries out groupwide
    procompliance activities and reviews such undertakings compliancerelated policies and plans decided by
    the committee are communicated to each plant which in turn rolls out individual actions in accordance with
    them all group companies both in japan and abroad have set up their own compliance organizations man
    dated to formulate and conduct individual actions

    standards for employee behavior
    the group has long since stepped up its commitment to compliance fol
    lowing the introduction of the ibiden standards for employee behavior 
    employeescode of conduct as our overseas operations rapidly expand
    with the construction of plants in the philippines china france and hun
    gary we must now ensure compliance with international rules as well as
    with laws and regulations prevailing in the countries where we do busi
    ness recognizing this the group undertook a full review of its compliance
    program to improve the framework and revised the ibiden standards for
    employee behavior in fiscal year 2003                                              we have established the ibiden
                                                                                        standards for employee behavior
       at the group all officers and employees are determined to respect the           which serve as compliance guide
    standards for employee behavior and create a group of companies that                lines for officers and employees
    are good corporate citizens in the eyes of the international community

    revision to the standards for employee behavior
    the ibiden standards for employee behavior are continually evolving in light of the globalization of our ex
    panding business operations taking into consideration the expectations of our stakeholders we add and
    revise provisions on worker rights with which we must comply as internal standards we have also established
    the standards for employee behavior based on such international standards at our main production plants
    overseas and we are making efforts to provide thorough education on human rights and ethics according to
    these standards
        upon the revision of the ibiden group charter of behavior in fiscal year 2011 ibiden reorganize the code
    of conduct so that employees who must comply with it can understand it more easily and we continue our
    efforts to promote their compliance

    compliance education
    the company runs a broad array of education programs including levelspecific and workplacespecific train
    ing designed to enhance employee awareness of the importance of compliance these programs include
    group discussions on causes of violations of the employeescode of conduct and actions taken in response
    to the violations they educate every single trainee in consciously deciding on the right action in a given situa
    tion
        we continually provide our own csr portal site on the intranet and ex
    amples of compliance practices in our internal magazine and on the
    intranet as another way to improve staff awareness
        in addition we have invited outside instructors to educate manage
    ment persons responsible for promotion including officers concerning
    compliance risk management and human right including harassment to
    be undertaken as an administrator we also arranged elearning educa
    tion of the revision of the employeescode of conduct and approximately

    compliance by directors
    when establishing a compliance system it is crucial that all executives and managers be at the forefront of
    the efforts as september is csr month executives and the management persons responsible for csr attend
    workshops by external instructors to gain a clear understanding of their role as managers
        furthermore executives must conduct themselves in accordance with the standards for employee behav
    ior in both their personal and professional lives as the standards include items relevant to individual executive
    such as regulations regarding competition as well as conflict of interest

    whistleblowing system
    after learning of any suspected compliance violation in the group employees are generally required to report
    it to consult and to take action using the chain of command between the superior and the subordinate we
    have however established a compliance consultation service for quickly solving any problem that cannot be
    reported through the usual channels the service is available not only to employees of ibiden group compa
    nies but to all those working for the group we provide three access channels to facilitate consultation one
    inside the company another at a lawyer    s office and the other at an outside organization
         in fiscal year 2011 we provided consultations in 70 cases for the entire group in japan although most of
    the consultations were related to the issues that could lead to issues related to potential harassment case
    and labor management none of them significantly affected our business activities moreover at workplaces
    where problems were observed seminars and other events are held individually to prevent recurrence to
    discover and deal with problems as early as possible we will continue our educational activities to enhance
    our reliability by offering a consultation service that can be safely used by those who seek consultation
         in addition we have set up a consultation service for our supplier in fiscal year 2011 we create an envi
    ronment where we not only offer consultations internally but also gather valuable feedback on ibiden         s
    compliance from our regular supplier
         ibiden has no record of legal violations such as corruption and information leakage which have a major
    impact on business activities

    selfcheck
    to clarify compliance issues at plants a selfcheck on morality security and respect for human rights is con
    ducted once a year on a plantbyplant basis any problem identified in this process will be addressed through
    remedial activities specific to the plant
       employees holding managerial posts are required to submit themselves to annual selftesting to measure
    their understanding of the ibiden standards for employee behavior and their state of compliance with the
    standards for identification of topics that are not fully understood starting from the fiscal year 2011 the self
    check for not only employees holding managerial posts but also regular employees have been carried out to
    recognize challenges at the individual level and little understood topics case studies illustrating compliance
    related issues that many testtakers failed to answer correctly are published to increase their understanding

      csr management in the supply chain

    to earn the trust of international community while operating business globally both the group and the entire
    supply chain must responsibly take actions that respond to social demands we believe that a sustainable
    growth of the entire supply chain as well as a higher corporate value will be realized through promotion of
    csr activities based on the basic policy of the ibiden group


    basic purchasing policy
    1we comply with laws regulations and societal norms and strive to build relationships of trust and mutual
          cooperation with suppliers
    2we provide suppliers opportunity at a fair deal
    3we continue to fulfill our social responsibilities including human rights and environmental protection
          through purchasing activities




    ibiden group supplier csr guidelines
    ibiden began disclosing requests to suppliers based on its basic purchasing policies
    in fiscal year 2008 and held a briefing session for 100 suppliers in fiscal year 2009
    confirming the status of their measures this enabled us to confirm the gap in mea
    sures among the suppliers and recognize the necessity of management which has led
    to more specific improvements in the supply chain
         in fiscal year 2 0 1 1 ibiden published ibiden group supplier csr guidelines fol
    lowing the changes in the ibiden group charter of behavior these guidelines
    provide our suppliers with items desired for the entire supply chain by our customers
    the industry and the international community as well as the group the items are di
    vided into subcategories according to themes such as labor health and safety environment protection ethics
    and fair business practices these guidelines also allow us to thoroughly understand the risks from several
    viewpoints such as worksite safety respect for and dignified treatment of employees and the consideration
                                           given to the environment which in turn allows us to make improvements
                                              we also invited our major suppliers after the publication of the guide
                                           lines to our briefing session to share with them in addition to the group
                                           itself specific challenges ahead as they play an important supporting role
                                           in matters such as material supply subcontracting and procuring of tem
                                           porary staff moreover we conducted supplier surveys as well as site
                                           visits in keeping with the content of the guidelines to provide support to
                                           identify issues and make improvements eleven individuals are now cur

      respect for human rights

    respect for worker rights
    the ibiden group clearly defines its basic policy to support and respect the protection of human rights as
    well as to avoid involvement in any violation of human rights the ibiden standards for employee behavior
    spells out such policy stipulating that officers and employees respect the basic principles and rights of labor
    and take actions that follow the common sense and rules of society while complying with the employmentre
    lated laws of each country such as the labor standards law and labor regulations

    human rights education
    to ensure respect for human rights the group offers education on fair employment and human rights particu
    larly to labor relations managers as well as managers and staff members in charge of recruitment interviews
    calling their attention to the prevention of humanrights violations ibiden also distributes the ibiden stan
    dards for employee behavior and example booklets a collection of violation examples to all employees at
    the time of hiring in our new employee training or education programs offered at the time of hiring we edu
    cate our employees to promote the understanding of the ibiden standards for employee behavior including
    dealing with human rights issues as well as to ensure that the standards are reflected in their actions

    assessment
    for the group to make advances in human rights initiatives the cooperation of the entities comprising the en
    tire supply chain beyond the group is indispensable in our letter addressed to business partners we
    specifically request that laborrelated human rights be observed including bans on child labor and forced labor
    in addition we confirm the state of compliance by business partners by sending out periodic questionnaires
        in fiscal year 2011 we conducted a survey based on the csr guidelines targeting the plants and group
    companies in japan and provided them with guidance aiming to enhance their understanding furthermore
    we held a survey among business partners regarding specific items to be tackled in terms of labor and human
    rights in the csr guidelines and their management we audited some suppliers in japan and provided guid
    ance to contractors and temporary help agencies as a result of the audit in fiscal year 2011 we found no
    cases of major violations that could lead to the violation of worker rights



      employment and development of human resources

    employment of global human resources
    the ibiden group celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2012 is an international corporation with 34 overseas
    locations in 17 countries in north america asia and europe with the next 100 years in mind and armed with
   ibiden  s unique business modelwhich rivals any other on the international stage we will continue to strive
    to further strengthen our competitiveness to this end obtaining highly diverse human resource is crucial as
    more than 75 of our sales were made outside of japan in fiscal year 2011 it is essential that we hire and
    nurture employees who can see things from a global perspective and manage people at overseas locations
    while absorbing different cultures in terms of our hiring practices we have defined the desired candidate pro
    file and are actively pursuing foreign students who are studying in japan we are also hiring more staff at
    overseas locations who demonstrate the skills and experience to become executive candidates in the future
    as a result we hired a recordhigh 14 foreign students in april 2012

    development of global human resources
    first we have adopted the concept of creating a global human resource pool
    which will allow us to form from a medium to longterm perspective a group
    of employees that can succeed on the global stage motivated young employ
    ees who fit the global human resource profile will be selected to participate in

      measures for safety
    in fiscal year 2011 withreduction of occupational accidents and potential incidents and improvement to the
    working environment    legal complianceandreduction in mental illnesses and lifestyle related diseases
    as the three pillars of our activities we implemented occupational health and safety programs for the entire
    ibiden group to be specific we shifted our activities from accident prevention to hazard prevention by im
    proving the level of risk management our activities centered on the following guidelines focused
    implementation of activities to prevent major disastersrecurrent accidents strict legal compliance through
    the regular education of legally qualified people in laws and regulations as well as through the audits of oper
    ations and management of laws and regulations and participation of all members based on thehealth100
    planan initiative for improving health vigorously
        while the group   s and domestic group companiesoccupational accident occurrence rates are below the
    national manufacturer average unfortunately one fatal accident occurred in may 2011 in response to this in
    cident the entire ibiden group overhauled and corrected risks that could cause accidents on site we
    confirmed the effectiveness of safety management measures to deal with what had been identified as highly
    critical in a risk assessment for areas that had been recognized as hazards at plants we implemented correc
    tive actions promptly and completely
        in addition based on the results of the occupational health and safety risk assessment and the occurrence
    of workrelated accidents in the previous fiscal years we specified that fallingflying objects getting caught
    betweenunder objects and collisions with objects were companywide risks and managed the progress of
    reduction in applicable risks we fully implemented the planned risk reduction measures before implementing
    risk assessment we conducted educational training offering risk assessment study meetings and practice
    training sessions to help participants acquire accurate risk assessment knowledge and methods for extracting
    risks furthermore we have revitalized workplace safety circle activities and established activities to point
    out and correct risks through safety patrols led by the head of each workplace aiming to reduce risks on a
    routine basis in fiscal year 2012 we will expand the scope of our safety activities targeting subcontractors
    working on premises while further improving the level of our activities

    particular we will promote the following activities
    1	we will introduce innovative technology to conserve energy when constructing a new plant or introducing
        a new line while reducing energy loss by adopting the technology to the existing lines
    2	we will establish a technologysystem that allows energy consumption to fluctuate according to fluctua
        tions in production volume while lowering the energy unit load by promoting bic activities
    3	we will promote activities to improve yield rates of materials increase productivity through loss reduction
        and conserve energyresources by means of the 3r activity
    4	we will enhance chemical control pollution prevention management and disaster prevention management
        in order to reduce environmental risks

      coping with climate change issues

    through private power generation activities to supply clean energy as well as energy conservation efforts in
    manufacturing activities we are working to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions to upgrade our private
    power generation systems we are boosting our hydroelectric power generation capacity improving thermal
    power generation efficiency and promoting fuel conversion with regard to energy conservation efforts in
    manufacturing activities we are accelerating the improvement of energy conservation practices throughout
    the company by strengthening companywide co2 reduction activities while all manufacturing divisions man
    age the basic unit of energy consumption and set specific targets for each division

    measures to supply clean energy
    the ibiden group can trace its history back to a scheme aimed at building a hydroelectric power plant up
    stream on the ibigawa river to supply power and attract industry and thereby help revitalize the nearby city
    of ogaki the group was established under the name ibigawa electric company in 1912 but over time began
    to utilize electricity to evolve into an electrochemical company we have continued to expand our business
    since then including areas such as carbides carbon building materials ceramic products and electronic prod
    ucts as we have grown and developed hand in hand with local communities

    we are consistently trying to increase our use of natural energy such as hydroelectric power and solar power
    and improve the efficiency of a cogeneration system with a high level of environmental performance as a
    consequence power we generated inhouse supplied nearly 55 of the power we consumed in fiscal year
    2010 we have successfully reduced co2 emissions by approx 91000 t co2 for fiscal year 2011 from the
    quantity emitted to generate purchased electric power

      understanding the influence on biodiversity

    initiated from the power of water the group  s business activities are blessed with the benefit of biodiversity
    such as maintaining a stable water supply and our activities also have some impact in the area of biodiver
    sity just as we need to cope with the issues of global warming due to climate change biodiversity conserva
    tion is one of the most important tasks to tackle
        aiming to contribute to constant social advancement in line with the values stressingharmony with na
    tureibiden will act responsibly as a global enterprise by working together with society


    activities to create a society in harmony with nature for biodiversity protection and sustainable resource use
    focusing on the upstream areas along the ibigawa river which are the roots of the ibiden group we will
    contribute to protecting biodiversity and sustainable use of resources in the local community we will achieve
    this by carrying out forest preservation activities to support the water sources and promoting social contribu
    tion activities in collaboration with the local community


    forest preservation activity areas
    in august 2008 ibiden signed an agreement on lively forest creation with the gifu prefectural government
    the ibigawa town government and the ibi shizen kankyo rangers a nonprofit organization according to this
    agreement we will plant trees thin the forests and conduct improvement cutting in ibiden         s forest higashi
    yokoyama forest in the higashi yokoyama district and ibiden     s forest fujihashi forest in the tsurumi district
    over the next 10 years in an effort to support sustainable reforestation activities in the future

                                  lished by the ministry of the environment

    note 1 calculations have been based on the consolidated financial results of major domestic manufacturing
            group companies since fiscal year 2009


    3main environmental protection costs
    in fiscal year 2011 investment increased 21 compared to fiscal year 2010 the increase in investment was
    primarily due to the investment made for6 research  development costsenvironmentrelated products
    such as automotive exhaust system components and2 global environmental protection costshydroelec
    tric power plant updating etc
        in fiscal year 2011 costs increased 4 compared to fiscal year 2010 this is primarily because2 global
    environmental protection costsincreased due to the maintenance work of water channels penstocks and
    tunnels associated with the repair work of the hirose power plant facilities electricity supply started in 1925
    which we started in september 2011 in order to improve performance and repair deterioration

    note	with regard to the investment associated with the repair work mentioned above approximately 3 bil
           lion yen will be recorded in investment in fiscal year 2012

                                                                                                                  unit million yenyear

    5economic results and real effects of environmental protection measures note 3
    the economic effects of energy conservation for fiscal year 2011 decreased 59 compared to fiscal year 2010
    the main causes of the decrease were the decline in power generation and increase in costs due to the re
    pair work of the hirose power plant the economic effects of improved power generation efficiency achieved
    by the repair work will be recorded in fiscal year 2012 and thereafter
        the economic effects of resource recycling for fiscal year 2011 increased by 15 compared to fiscal year
    2010 the main causes of the increase were the reduced waste treatment costs achieved by reducing losses
    at the water treatment plant specializing in liquid waste and drainage treatments in addition to the economic
    results brought by effectively using resources through raw material loss improvement efforts
                                                                                                                                  unit million yenyear
