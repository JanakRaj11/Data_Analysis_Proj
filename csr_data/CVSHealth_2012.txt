     i knew health care was my calling when
     i first volunteered as a candy striper at the
     local hospital it was there that i learned the
     importance of patient education and the
     power of compassionate care as a nurse
     practitioner at minuteclinic those early
     lessons have served me well patients put
     their trust in me to make the right decisions
     for their wellbeing and my commitment to
     helping them on their path to better health
     never wavers

     my work at minuteclinic is the most
     rewarding yet in my career it is great to
     work for a company that shares my passion
     for helping others and offers an affordable
     welcoming place for patients to get the

as a pharmacist who used to work in our
retail stores i know that patients worry
about getting their prescriptions on time

in leading the development of our virtual
pharmacy initiative i was part of a team that
sped up delivery of mail prescriptions by
dispensing and shipping from the location
closest to the member

in fact this particular solution shaved two
days off of the dispensing and shipping pro
cess making a real difference in the lives of
these patients

im proud to work for a company that puts
our customers first encourages new ideas
and rewards innovation
