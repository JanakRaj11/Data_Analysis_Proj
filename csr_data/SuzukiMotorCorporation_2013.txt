introduction




                                                                introduction
       since inauguration of business we have been making best efforts to develop customeroriented valuable
      products under the first paragraph of our mission statement develop products of superior value by focusing on
      the customer also in line with our growth strategy we have continuously reevaluated every field and improved
      our management practices under our basic policy think hard and make an extra effort to get over the status
      quo
       the management environment of the group is in a worrying situation with slowdown of economy in asia in
      addition to economic stagnation in europe on the other hand there is a growing expectation for economic
      recovery against a background of sign of economic recovery in the united states easing of extreme yen
      appreciation and effect of economic stimulus measures in japan

       however we still face a lot of challenges such as european financial instability environmental issues and
      disaster risks in order to overcome those challenges we are working altogether throughout the entire group
      under the suzuki vision create a wow beyond customer expectations which is based on the philosophy of our
      mission statement

       especially for the environmental issue the group has been providing minivehicles in japan and many fuel
      efficient compact cars mainly in india and asia we believe that the spread of compact cars is what can contribute
      to the environmental issue in addition to the promotion of nextgeneration environmental technology with the
      suzuki green technology we will work on the global environmental issue based on suzuki 2015 environmental
      plan and suzuki biodiversity protection guideline which were established last fiscal year

       at the same time under the slogan small cars for a big future we will work toward manufacture of small
      cars and environmentallyfriendly products which are wanted by our customers we will also work on lean
      efficient and sound management by emphasizing the smaller fewer lighter shorter and neater concept in
      terms of production organization facility parts and environment

       we believe that it is important for every one of us to observe laws and regulations social norms inhouse
      rules etc and behave fairly and faithfully as well as it is indispensable to build and maintain reliable and good
      relationships with our stakeholders such as customers business partners shareholdersinvestors local societies
      and employees

       in this report our csr corporate social responsibility activities carried out in fiscal 2012 are divided into three
      categories efforts for environment efforts for society and efforts by plants and companies we hope this
      report can provide an opportunity to understand our csr activities

strengthening corporate governance

investors local communities and employees and to be a continuously growing company while making a further contribution to the
international community
 in order to realize that intention we consider that the enhancement of the corporate governance is one of the most important issues
for proper corporate management and are aggressively taking various kinds of measures some of the ongoing activities are as follows

①directors and meeting of the board of directors
 for the purpose of enabling the agile corporate management and operations and clarifying the individual responsibilities
we have reduced the number of directors and introduced a senior managing officer and managing officer system in
that system all directors excluding chairman  ceo and outside directors also work as leaders for accomplishment of
tasks such as executive general manager of each division or other functional units to allow for discussion based on site
information at board meetings for making proper decisions in line with actual situations of each department
 at the management planning committee which is a councilsystem organization involving four executive vice presidents
as members important missions for management at each department are crossfunctionally and comprehensively
reviewed and basic concepts are adjusted and established in order to embody the said basic concepts we have the
department in charge in the management planning division furthermore in order to enhance the management supervisory
function we selected two outside directors and reported them as independent directors based on the rules of tokyo
stock exchange
 in order to clarify managerial accountability for individual directors and flexibly respond to the changing business
environment the term of each director is set to one year

②company auditors and auditors meeting
 we have adopted a company auditor system and there are five members including three outside company auditors to enhance
our auditing function all three outside company auditors are reported as independent directors based on the rules of tokyo stock
exchange
 in addition we have a department that audits the company as well as a department for auditing subsidiaries and affiliates thus
audits are conducted concerning compliance with laws internal control and management efficiency from three different angles
including independent auditor they always exchange information to strengthen their mutual collaboration

③compliance corporate ethics system
 suzuki established suzuki rules of corporate ethics which specify standards of behavior in order to make all
directors and employees at suzuki strictly follow the laws regulations social rules and inhouse rules as well as to act
in good faith and fairness in addition we have established a corporate ethics committee and hold corporate ethics
seminars to check compliance with the rules of corporate ethics in addition we determined a basic policy for the
establishment of an internal control system on may 15 2006 in accordance with companies act and we are now making
necessary arrangements for the system

disaster measures
 our group had taken various preventive measures supposing a tokaitonankai earthquake however after the great east
japan earthquake we acquired a site in miyakoda district in the northern part of hamamatsu city in order to move the
facility in ryuyo district in iwata city shizuoka prefecture where we expect to have tsunami damage also production
of minivehicle engines which used to be concentrated in the sagara plant was partially shifted to the kosai plant and
expansion of research facility in india was promoted not only for researches but also as means to decentralize potential
risks of the sagara test course which is the development base of automobiles in this wise we decentralized production
and research bases both in japan and overseas we will continue to improve our ability to cope with disasters

 a part of suzukis facilities is registered as an emergency shelter for local residents when a disaster occurs we have a
system for an earthquake to deploy watchmen on the roof of the headquarters let them check occurrence of tsunami
and sound a siren to notify residents when tsunami is found manual and electric sirens are installed on the roof of the
headquarters the electric siren is designed to be operated even with the dedicated electricity generator in case of a
power failure


measures against earthquakes and tsunami taken by suzuki for employees
 refuge areas and evacuation routes were reviewed at each office giving top priority to protecting employees lives from
earthquakes and tsunami damages we introduced the earthquake early warning system to offices expecting damage by
tsunami and established the system to assure that all employees can evacuate safely to the place which water will not
reach we have a system to confirm safety of employees immediately when a disaster occurs via satellite telephones set
at each plant and sales distributors all over in japan as an emergency communication tool we conduct a drill for satellite
telephones every month to be ready for an emergency
 in addition we introduced the relief method training by retired fire fighters so that we ourselves can arrest bleeding or
treat injuries upon largescale disasters
 furthermore in order to confirm safety of offduty employees we introduce the safety information system in case an
earthquake or tsunami occurs in order to confirm safety of employees and their family this system automatically sends
safety inquiry mail to mail addresses that each employee has registered and those who receive the mail send a reply
about their own safety situation

measures for disasters at plant
 in preparation for disasters an earthquake drill with all employees participated in is conducted at the headquarters and
each plant
 a fire drill using fire extinguishers and fire hydrant is conducted at plants so that everyone in a worksite can perform first
aid fire fighting
 also water discharge drills by fire engine or small transportable pump are performed for promoting individual disaster
prevention activities by the private fire brigade
 above all the premises of headquarters kosai plant iwata plant osuka plan and toyotkawa plant are certified as
cooperative business entities for local fire brigades by hamamatsu city kosai city iwata city kakegawa city and
toyokawa city respectively because of their contribution to reinforcement of local firefighting and disasterprevention
system etc

    ber 2004 to improve manners and awareness
    of environmental beautiﬁcation of our employ
    ees and started volunteer activities for clean
    ing underground passages and public roads
    around the headquarters we name this activity
    suzuki manner improvement activity and
    conduct it continuously on a monthly basis it
    reached its 100th activity in january 2013 and
    burnable and nonburnable wastes we had
    collected in total reached 45 minitruckloads

     bodies wishing to be foster parents determine the area
      and details of activities proﬀer them to the mayor

manufacturing automobiles considering safety and environment
installing advanced safety technologies
 because minivehicles are used by many people in order to reduce
accidents due to careless mistakes such as looking aside just for a
moment or unintentionally lacking concentration while in traﬃc or driving
for a long time as much as possible we pursue safety applicable to wider
varieties of scenes
 we introduced advanced safety technologies such as the radar brake
support collision mitigation brake and unintended start control system
to the wagon r launched in july 2013 and the spacia launched in septem
ber 2013 as charged maker option we support safety of drivers

                  the automatic braking system reduces damage by rearend
                  collision due to inattention to the ahead of the driver
     when driving slowly due to traﬃc congestion the laser radar detects
   the vehicle running ahead and activates the automatic braking system
   if it recognizes that collision cannot be avoided this avoids hazards                            laser radar
   such as rearend collision or reduces damage if collision occurs                                the laser radar works even on rainy days because it is in the

     operating when the laser radar is detecting the vehicle running ahead while driving at approximately 5 kmh  30 kmh
     conditions the radar does not normally detect pedestrians or motorcycles but may activate the automatic braking system under some circumstances


                                                                                                 the laser radar installed in the cabin measures

    when   the radar brake support is activated the vehicle suddenly brakes check that all passengers wear seat belts properly to ensure safety
    after the automatic brake is activated the vehicle moves forward due to the creep phenomena be sure to step on the brake pedal

                 unintended start control system
                  contributes to avoidance of collision caused by misoperation of pedals or shifts
    the laser radar detects the frontal obstacle when the vehicle is parked or driving slowing at approximately 10 kmh or less
   when the accelerator is strongly stepped on with the shift set in forward position output from the engine is automatically
   controlled to suppress sudden start or acceleration this contributes to avoidance of collision in a parking lot etc
                when the laser radar is detecting an obstacle within approximately 4 m ahead with the vehicle parked or driven slowly at
     operating approximately 10 kmh or less
     conditions the shift position is forward d l including s mode

installation of low fuel consumption technologies
 a new variation equipped with technologies for
reducing fuel consumption such as the newly
developed dual jet engine and the deceleration
energy regeneration mechanism enecharge are
introduced to the swift released in july 2013 in
order to improve the environmental performance




 the combustion chamber in the dual jet engine is designed to be smaller than the conventional ones to satisfy both the
engine performance and the environmental performance at high dimensions thorough knocking suppression technologies
cooling technologies are gathered while raising the compression ratio by installing dual injection system that improves
heat eﬃciency cooled egr system that increases the eﬀects of knocking suppression etc we realized the optimum
compression ratio 120 that converts fuel energy to power at maximum without lowering the output or torque we also
reduced various energy losses and pursued heat eﬃciency to the utmost limit this contributed in realizing the lowest fuel

external auditing
 auditing of documents and onsite auditing are carried out by third party organization in regard to the validity and
adequacy of our environmental management system to determine whether or not measures are being properly
implemented
 in fiscal 2012 renewal audit was conducted at five plants and surveillance at one plant and no nonconformity1 to
iso14001 requirements was found also there were 24 items to be monitored2 in total on which we will implement
continuous improvement
12 nonconformity indicates a defect that needs immediate correction but is not critical to the system operation
 items to be monitored indicate matters that need not be immediately corrected but continuous improvement is preferable

improvement of transmission
improvement of fuel eﬃciency through adoption of cvt continuously variable transmission with an auxiliary gearbox and its expanded adoption
 cvt with an auxiliary gearbox which covers a wide range of transmission gear ratio was first adopted on the palette
launched in september 2009 is now installed on all of suzukis mini passenger vehicles and compact passenger vehicles
of 12l and 16l classes
 employing low viscosity cvt fluid and ball bearing for the cvt differential side bearing the alto eco greatly reduces cvt
friction resulting in further improvement of fuel efficiency then we expanded adoption of this improvement to all of mini
passenger vehicles

further improvement in idling stop system engine auto stop start system
 we have upgraded the idling stop system engine auto stop start system
which is one of the important technologies for improvement in fuel efficiency by
stopping the engine when the vehicle speed becomes 13 kmh or lower during its
deceleration right before its complete stop the idling stop system engine auto
stop start system has become a system that suppresses unnecessary fuel consumption as much as possible to further
contribute to improvement of fuel efficiency and reduction of gas emission and noise thanks to this improvement the
wagon r achieved low fuel consumption of 300 kml1 the spacia achieved 290 kml1 and the alto eco achieved
330 kml1

adoption of deceleration energy regeneration system enecharge
 the wagon r launched in september 2012 and the spacia and the alto eco
launched in march 2013 adopted the newlydeveloped highefficiency high
output generator and highefficiency lithiumion battery and have been equipped
with advanced generation system enecharge which effectively generates
electric power with energy during deceleration without depending on power of the engine adding to the effect of engine
shutdown during deceleration these technologies have contributed to further improvement in fuel efficiency
 because enecharge generates and charges regeneration power intensively during deceleration loads to the engine
during driving is reduced and easy and smooth acceleration is also realized

development of ecocool an airconditioning system with freezable substance
 we developed ecocool an airconditioning system with freezable substance
that realizes both comfort and improvement in practical fuel efficiency by freezing
the substance with the cold air emitted from the airconditioner and blowing the
fan air through the frozen substance during engine shutdown and adopted on the
wagon r launched in september 2012 we are planning to expand adoption of ecocool to more models equipped with
the idling stop system engine auto stop start system to be launched

use of tailored blanks
 tailored blank is a manufacturing method by which steel parts having different thicknesses or materials high tensile steel
plate plated steel sheet etc are welded in advance with laser welding etc and then pressed by applying this method to
various panel components it is possible to partially reinforce specific portions of the same component without adding any
part thus avoiding weight increase

extensive use of hightensile steel plate to all suzuki vehicles
 by adopting hightensile steel plate with excellent strength the number of reinforcement parts and the entire weight are
reduced and the body strength is enhanced by further increasing the tensile such as by adopting super hightensile steel
plate of ts980 mpa to the wagon r from its third generation model launched in september 2003 and ts1180 mpa to
the floor side member of the spacia as well as expanding the use of hightensile steel plate weight reduction has been

efforts for weight reduction of the spacia
weight reduction of white body
 light and strong hightensile steel plate is used for approximately 42 weight ratio of the body and additional welding
effective in spot welding on the body is conducted in addition the thickness of the outer panel is reduced by contriving
its shape etc while assuring the strength as a result the weight of the white body was reduced by approximately 23 kg

reduction of air resistance
 aerodynamic performance largely influence driving and fuel
efficiency of a tall height wagon as for the spacia we conducted
a windfunnel test and aerodynamic cae from the initial phase of
development we optimized the shape of the front bumper and
windshield molding to create smooth air flow around the body this
accomplished one of the lowest air resistance in the mini height
wagon class


reduction of rolling resistance
 during development of the spacia we focused our attention on reduction of rolling resistance by using various kinds of
testing equipment
 for the tires we adopted newly developed tread rubber with the inner pressure increased resulting in drastic reduction
of the rolling resistance while ride comfort and quiet interior environment are maintained
 also in order to reduce rolling resistance we adopted a low compressive distortional pad for brake unit type hub bearing
and low torque sealing low viscosity oil for transmission and ball bearings on the differential side

 suzuki is contributing for reduction of co2 emission which is regarded as the cause for global warming by working on
development and improvement of products that focus on fuel efficiency improvement 

improving fuel efficiency
activity for all models
 we are promoting switchover from the conventional carburetor to an electronically controlled fuel injection system that
enables more optimum fuel injection control
 in addition we are also making efforts to improve heat efficiency by reducing product weight improving combustion
mechanism reducing friction loss etc these efforts improved the global average
fuel efficiency of suzuki motorcycles in fiscal 2012 by 14 compared to fiscal 2005

example of applied product
 650cm3 scooter skywave 650lx burgman 650executive in oversesas market
launched in january 2013 in japan is designed to improve transmission efficiency
by optimizing cvt control  and also to improve heat efficiency by optimizing fuel
atomization fuel injection and ignition timing also friction at moving parts is
reduced to prevent mechanical loss
 thanks to these thorough improvements in efficiency fuel efficiency of the model
was improved by approximately 151 compared to the conventional model and it
realized one of the lowest fuel consumption in the class                                     skywave 650lx
                                                                                    burgman 650executive in overseas market
 as for the vstrom 650 launched in january 2013 in japan the weight was
reduced by 6 kg compared to the previous model by downsizing the abs unit and changing the rear carrier from
aluminum to resin and air resistance was improved by 26 by changing the shape of the cowl and windscreen as a
result fuel efficiency was improved by 10

 outboard motors
improving fuel efficiency
 suzuki made efforts to develop and improve products that focus on improvement
in fuel efficiency in order to reduce co2 emission which is regarded as the cause for
global warming
 we launched a total of seven types of outboard motors in 2012 df99b15a20a df100a115a140a and df250ap
which adopted lean burn lean fuel control df99b15a20a are the first outboard motors in the class to adopt fuel
injection system and df15a realized improvement in fuel efficiency by as much as 12 compared to the previous model
df100a115a140a and df250ap adopted feedback control using o2 sensor in addition to lean burn control which
realized improvement in fuel efficiency by as much as 14 for df140a and 22 for df250ap 
                                                                  improvement rate of fuel eﬃciency

fuel efficiency improvement technology
technology for improving fuel eﬃciency
 because small outboard motors are mostly used without connecting the battery fuel
injection system could not be used therefore we developed fuel injection system of
low power consumption that can start the engine without connecting to the battery and
installed it on df99b15a20a

friendly solar energy or man power and compete in races the purpose of this event is to raise skills for races by solar
boats and manpowered boats and to pursue improvement in performance of boats
 in order to sail the boat faster with less water resistance as well as less electricity the miyakoda challenge team
adopted a hydrofoil boat equipped with the same wing as an aircraft at the bottom which enables the boat to sail with
its body completely separated from water due to lifting power during sailing as a result they captured 6th victory in the
1hour slalom race and 1cycle slalom race

experimental study for commercialization of battery replacement station for popularizing electric motorcycles on january
24 2013 regarding kamakura city as an experiment area
 electric motorcycles are very environmentfriendly have a small turning radius and are expected to be popularized as
useful transportation at the time of disaster however there are some problems such as that cruising range is small and
battery charge is difficult outside because a quick charger or normal charger for electric vehicle cannot be used lately
we will conduct an experiment study to integrally operate electric motorcycles and battery chargereplacement system in
kamakura city
 in this study we install a lockertype battery replacementcharge equipment within the
expected scope of activities in order to improve convenience for users in addition we
will develop informational system that allows users to recognize the replacement timing
of battery charging status and availability and to make                                                 1 replacement

reduction of co2 emission from domestic offices
 we conducted energysaving activities to reduce amount of co2 emissions such as controlling temperature setting of air
conditioning equipment at each office throughly turning off unnecessary lights reducing energy loss by changing equipment
to energysaving type and frequently checkingrepairing each plant equipment improving operation method of equipment
upgrading to higherefficient equipment thanks to these activities the amount of co2 emissions from our domestic offices
in fiscal 2012 was cut by 278700 tco2 which means reduction by 126 compared to fiscal 2005


co2 reduction at domestic plants die plants and group manufacturing companies

energy saving activities at plants
 energy saving efforts at individual plants range from largescale efforts such as increase of efficiency of pressure control
for air compressors and use of inverters for fans and pumps which require capital investment to steady efforts including
reduction of air leakage and lightout during recess time such activities have been conducted throughout the entire plant
and have brought successful results every year
 reduced amount of co2 and individual items of efforts are as follows

promotion of co2 emission reduction at offices
 we determined the standard of employee behavior in fiscal 2008 and all of our employees are getting together to
promote energy saving at offices and reduction of co2 emissions in addition we put the progress of each activity in
relation to the standard of employee behavior on the inhouse homepage so that individual employee can check the
result of their activities although we are promoting efforts for energy saving and co2 reduction as we need additional
information processing equipment for reinforcing development energy consumption per employee in fiscal 2012
increased by 10 compared to the previous year

standard of employee behavior
 we have established a standard of employee behavior for inhouse cost cutting activities which covers a wide range of
activities for the purpose of promoting energy saving and co2 reduction by individual employees

reduction of transportation distance for imported parts to plants
 in the process of importing parts they are once stored at warehouses and then delivered to plants by requesting plants
to store parts we are now reducing the use of warehouses to avoid temporary storage of parts also for delivery of tires
some of our plants directly receive tires from tire manufacturers to eliminate the need for temporary storage

efforts for transportation of completed automobiles in japan
 for domestic transportation of automobiles suzuki uses
two types of transportation methods by land and by sea
 for land transportation we are working on improving
average fuel consumption by promoting ecodrive at
consigned transportation companies and switching
to new trailer also currently more than 13 of
transportation of completed automobiles are conducted
by sea and we are continuously performing promotion
of modal shift that considers reduction of co2 emission
and economic efficiency




improvement in packing materials
 for transporting repair bumpers we changed the packaging style from cardboard boxes to air cushion materials resulting
in reduction of the packaging material weight by 50 and the average cubic volume by approximately 75
 moreover lowering the height of transfer pallets has enabled twotier loading on a truck box greatly improving the
transportation efficiency of trucks between plants  the packaging style for bumper transportation was changed at the
kosai plant in fiscal 2008 and then at the sagara plant in fiscal 2009

     soap box car is a name derived from the us in the 1930s where children attached tires to a box used for shipping soap from a soap factory and
          with it today a soap box car refers to a vehicle that does not have a motor engine and runs by using only gravity such as slope soap box
  cars are still popular in the us and relevant events such as races are frequently held

management of substances of concern
 in 2003 we introduced imds international material data system which is a material data collection system focused on
automobile industries and based on it we established an inhouse management system for substances of concern see
the chart below this system allows us to control not only the four heavymetal substances lead mercury hexavalent
chromium and cadmium targeted by european elv directive but also substances of very high concern svhc specified in
the reach regulation registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals in fiscal 2012 we identified 34
types of automobiles motorcycles and outboard motors in total to be in compliance with laws and regulations related to
substances of concern
 so far using this system we have identified compliance with laws and regulations related to substances of concern on
products produced by domestic plants and magyar suzuki hungary and some products produced by maruti suzuki india
in fiscal 2012 we have made this system available also for products produced by suzuki motor thailand which is our new
automobile production base we will try to apply this system for some motorcycles produced by pt suzuki indomobile
motor in indonesia




reduction of substances of concern
 suzuki not only strictly follows the goals set by japan automobile manufacturers association and european elv
directives but also aggressively promotes reduction of the four kinds of heavymetal substances of concern for all
models of automobiles motorcycles and outboard motors even in business areas where specific regulations do not apply
following the nonchrome treatment technique white on galvanization which was put into practical use in fiscal 2009
aimed for further reduction of substances of concern we have developed the black nonchrome treatment technique on
galvanization in fiscal 2010 this new technique is currently
evaluated for practical use in many countries various           reduction target set by japan automobile manufacturers
regulations related to substances of concern have been                         association inc new vehicles
tightened such as reach regulation which became effective
in june 2007 to control chemical substances in europe         materials to                   reduction target
                                                               be reduced
under such circumstance suzuki is working on reducing
                                                                            automobiles 110 or less in and after jan 2006
substances of concern and carrying out activities to reduce                 compared with 1996
hexavalent chrome globally including asia such as india for      lead     motorcycles  60 g or less in and after jan 2006 in
outboard motors which is said that reduction of hexavalent                 210kg vehicles
chrome is difficult we achieved complete abolishment of                    prohibition of use in and after jan 2005 excluding
such substance from all outboard motors manufactured in the      mercury lc display for navigation system etc
                                                                            combination meter discharge head lamp room lamp

abolish hexavalent chrome in outboard motors manufactured       chromium
in thailand by the end of 2013                                 cadmium prohibition of use in and after jan 2007


compliance with european chemical control regulation reach  clp
 in june 2007 reach regulation concerning the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals a
regulation which is aimed to protect human health and environments from chemical substance hazards became effective
in europe concerning chemical substances to be manufactured  imported reach requires companies to register evaluate
certify and disclose them to customers for compliance with reach cooperation throughout the supply chain is crucial in
order to prevent turmoil in the worlds automobile industry appropriate countermeasures are taken by organizing a task force
in cooperation with european us korean and japanese automobile and parts manufacturers while keeping in step with the
task force suzuki has promoted compliance with reach by cooperating with our european plants distributors and partners and
completed the necessary preliminary registry before december 2008 in addition we have completed the necessary report on
substances of very high concern svhc by june 1 2011 in december 2008 clp a new regulation for classification labeling
and packing of chemical substances and compounding became effective in europe similarly to the action for reach suzuki
has promoted compliance with clp while cooperating with our local european plants distributors and partners and completed
the necessary report on hazardous substances listed in the clp contained in substances and compounds to echa european
chemicals agency by december 2010 also we are submitting the report which will be required after 2011 on hazardous
substances contained in new chemical products and compounds
 we will keep close relations with our partners to have communication of information between the supply chain which is
necessary for registration of reach as well as to comply with certificate on substances of very high concern svhc and
restricted substances and to additionally submit for clp
                                                                                      43

reducing noise
vehicle exterior noise
 we are reducing various kinds of noises from the engine transmission airintake and exhaust systems and tires at the
same time we are optimizing the design of the sound insulation cover that is used to prevent the inside noises from being
released to the outside of vehicle
 as a result we made all automobiles manufactured by suzuki and sold in japan conform to the vehicle exterior noise
regulations in japan
 in addition for the acceleration noise regulations for muﬄers which became newly effective in december 2008 we made
all optional muﬄers sold by suzuki conform to the said regulations

reducing air conditioner refrigerant
 for the purpose of reducing the usage of air conditioner refrigerant hfc134a that is one of the factors causing
global warming we have optimized the design of air conditioning systems and at the same time are making efforts for
downsizing the heat exchanger and introducing a subcooling system the air conditioner system of the refrigerant saving
type is adopted in all models by domestic production car and adopts it to an oversea production car sequentially

use of alternative refrigerant
 we are now conducting research and development of a nextgeneration airconditioning system using an environmentally

reducing vocs volatile organic compounds 1 in car interior
 in order to further improve interior environment we will continue to make efforts to reduce the amount of voc by
reviewing the materials bonding agents painting methods for interior parts etc for all new domestic automobile models
sold since january 2006 we have successfully achieved lower cabin voc levels than the target set by the ministry of
health labor and welfare which is deemed as the automobile industrys voluntary goal2 we intend to further reduce the
voc value for all models to be sold in japan in addition we are making efforts for reduction of cabin voc for vehicles to
be sold in global markets including china and europe
 also we have added the target for tvoc total volatile organic compounds in the inhouse regulation and are promoting
further improvement in interior environment by reducing other voc not specified by the ministry of health labor and
welfare

voc volatile organic compounds
 voc is a chemical contained in solvents mainly used in the painting process
 suzuki worked to reduce the amount of voc emission in the painting process in fiscal 2012 the average amount of voc
emissions from the automobile body bumper and motorcycle paints was 439 gm2 which indicates a reduction of 10 g
m2 from the previous year
 the target defined in the suzuki environmental
plan 2015 is to keep 40 reduction against fiscal
2000 reduction from fiscal 2000 is 419 and we
accomplished the target
 in fiscal 2012 we improved the painting method so
that paint adheres to products more efficiently and
the equipment to reduce paint to be disposed of when
changing colors
  we will continue to improve the painting method etc to
reduce voc emissions

1 thermoset   resin
   this type of resin material will not soften or melt after being hardened by heat or pressure it is like a biscuit or ceramic
 even after beingresin
 2 thermoplastic
                     formed this type of resin material can be softened or melted by reheating and will be solidified by cooling it is reusable through
    repetitive melting and solidifying it is like a chocolate or candy

recyclable design
use of colored pp resin materials and recyclable pp materials
 materials that can be recycled easily or recycled materials are used for motorcycle parts in order to improve recyclability
we used more colored pp parts with high recyclability for exterior components of skywave 650lx than older models to
improve recyclability for nex and shooter we try recycling by using recycled pp materials for the bottom plate of the
seat

 pppolypropylene

easy disassembly of parts
 we are pursuing ease of disassembly of parts for promoting recyclable design for address v125 series the claw structure
has been optimized to enable easy disassembly of the exterior parts without using any special tool for bandit 1250f on
the other hand the number of resin parts is reduced approximately by 30 compared to the conventional full cowl model
by integrating parts of the body cowl under cowl meter panel etc so that these components can be disassembled more
easily

promotion of recycling abroad
 in europe endoflife vehicle directive elv directive 200053ec came into effect in 2000 requiring automobile
manufacturers and importers to establish a proper system for collecting and disposing of disused automobiles suzuki
is creating elv collection network systems suitable for respective conditions of individual countries in addition we
are obliged to provide disposal companies with the dismantling information of new model automobiles and give such
information through the international information system idis international dismantling information system organized by
automobile manufacturers
 also under the rrr reusability recyclability recoverability directive 200564ec which came into force in 2005 we
were audited by an authorized auditing agency on our systems for collecting material data and verifying environmental
impact substances and acquired the certificate of conformance cocom in august 2008 we obtained the rrr directive
approval for all of our vehicles sold in europe then we had an audit by an authorized organization and obtained a new
cocom based on the revised european rrr directive 20091ec in october 2011 and our new models since january 2012
are certified by the revised european rrr directive
 in china an automobile recycling law is now under consideration so we are conducting the regulatory trend survey by
keeping close contacts with our local subsidiary to prepare for conformance to the new regulation

promotion of voluntary recycling efforts
efforts for recycling of bumpers
 in an effort to use resources more effectively we have been collecting and recycling used bumpers that have been
removed from automobiles by distributors at the time of repair or replacement
 initially used bumpers were collected from distributors in the original form since 2000 however they have been
collected after being shredded by a shredding machine which has been installed in almost all of our distributors with
some exception additional bumper shredding machine were introduced or added in fiscal 2012 as a result the cubic
volume of the shredded bumpers for transportation was reduced to 16 of the previous volume allowing for reduction of
co2 emission during transportation due to efficient transfer and handling of the downsized materials
 the collected bumpers are recycled and reused to produce such automotive parts as battery holder engine undercover
foot rest etc

                packing materials

efforts through reducing and reusing
using returnable containers
 we are actively pursuing the use of returnable containers in our domestic transportation and delivery activities cardboard
had been previously used domestically but we started using returnable containers from fiscal 2003 to reduce paper and
improve operating efficiency
 in fiscal 2012 returnable containers accounted for 23 of the total number of containers used in shipments out of our
plants reducing the use of cardboard by approximately 97 tons also returnable containers used for receiving shipments
accounted for 64 of all receiving containers used during the fiscal year resulting in reduction of approximately 168 tons
of cardboard


promotion of using returnable containers for packaging materials
 suzuki encourages employees to use returnable racks instead of steel cases which used to be discarded at local plants
in order to reduce the amount of packing and packaging materials used
 in fiscal 2012 we began to use returnable racks for egypt in addition we have already used returnable racks in hungary
india indonesia taiwan pakistan usa china ecuador malaysia and thailand as a result approximately 77 of the total
parts and materials were transported with the use of returnable racks




efforts through recycling
reusing cardboard
 we reuse cardboard materials already used in factories as cushioning materials since a machine that produces
cushioning materials was introduced in 2003 we have promoted reuse of waste cardboards in fiscal 2012 we reused
approximately 41 tons of them

waste reduction
reduction of waste and landfill
 at our six domestic plants and die plants the zerolevel landfill waste landfill waste is less than 1 of the amount
recorded in 1990 24675 tons was achieved in fiscal 2001 through reduction of waste and promotion of recycling
 our group companies in japan also accomplished the zerolevel landfill waste landfill waste is less than 1 of the
amount recorded in 2002 1370 tons in fiscal 2008
 we will promote further reduction of waste while maintaining the zerolevel of landfill waste
 at overseas group manufacturing companies the total waste discharge amount and landfill waste amount data are now
being collected

activities for the law for the promotion of effective utilization of resources
 based on the law for the promotion of effective utilization of resources which went into effect in april 2001 we created
a plan for controlling the occurrence of byproducts and reported the plans results the purpose of this plan is to control
the occurrence of byproducts such as scrap metal and waste casting sand in fiscal 2012 we reduced those byproducts to
70 tons per 100 million yen of sales we will continue to make efforts to reduce them

 under the policy of making parts smaller fewer lighter shorter and neater suzuki is making efforts for paper reduction
and material recycling

paper reduction
 for the purpose of reducing the amount of paper used suzuki has been aggressively conducting companywide paperless
and paper reduction activities by promoting computerization of various documentary forms use of backing paper and
reduction of documents used at meetings

promoting green procurement
 we have established suzuki green procurement guideline as our policy to purchase ecofriendly parts and materials
from suppliers that are aggressively conducting environmental conservation activities suppliers who agree to this
guideline submit suzuki green procurement promotion agreement to us
 in may 2011 we partially revised this guideline by changing the expression parts raw materials etc to parts
accessories raw materials and sub materials to clarify applicable items and adding the words packing materials
machines and equipment to expand the scope of application according to the revised guideline we will implement the
green procurement activities with consideration for both environment and people concerning not only suzukis products
but also packaging materials used for transportation of purchased parts etc as well as machines and equipment used for
production and development
 moreover to the suzuki list of controlled chemical substances we have added some substances that are not listed
in the gadsl but covered by japans act on the evaluation of chemical substances and regulation of their manufacture
etc and labor safety and sanitation law as prohibited materials so that overseas suppliers can understand prohibited
substances regulated by the japanese laws
 also we are going hand in hand with suppliers to conform to conventional regulations such as european elv directive
and european regulation concerning the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach
and other various environmentrelated laws and regulations to be established in future

                 management assistance for the mundo de alegria school for japanesesouth americans
 the mundo de alegria school located in yutocho nishi
ku hamamatsu city is a school for japanesesouth american
children the school was established to accept children who
cannot attend japanese schools due to the language barrier or
international schools due to the economic hardship so that they
can experience the joys of learning and adjust to the japanese
society
 the school was established in february 2003 with private
donations however it was difficult to manage the school
privately thus local companies including suzuki cooperate to
encourage collaboration from the local industries in hamamatsu
and approximately 60 local companies joined the supportive
action in august 2005 the school became the first domestically
incorporated school for the japanesesouth american students
receiving subsidies from the prefectural and municipal
governments with the consistent efforts gradually recognized
the number of supporters and collaborators is increasing and
people from the local industrial community take part as board
members founder trustee whip and councilor of the school
now the number of students has exceeded 200 persons
 we hope to nurture admirable second and third generation
japanesesouth american youths living in hamamatsu city

      a group that works in good faith and look to the future rather than rely past methods in this we place emphasis
      on the following points

                 safety health and traffic safety related activities

safety and health
 safety and health management are promoted through our basic safety concept

     basic safety concept                 make safety a priority all accidents are preventable safety is our responsibility



 if any accident occurs it is specified without exception regardless of                                           heinrichs law 129300
seriousness in a relevant report that is circulated in the company for
horizontal deployment to prevent recurrence of the same accident
or occurrence of similar ones we will continue to raise employees
safety awareness to sense potential risks review or revise our safety
operation manual and improve any risk factor in our workplaces
 as the saying goes for every accident that causes a major injury
there are 29 accidents that cause minor injuries 300 accidents that
cause no injuries in order to prevent accidents from occurring we
need to implement activities that eliminate noinjury accidents
 since 2001 we have relied on risk assessment which looks at case
examples of noinjury accidents in order to counter and improve them

 heinrichs law

                 activities for career advancement
 it is our belief that career advancement through selfdevelopment is a source of job satisfaction for this reason we offer
activities that allow employees to advance depending upon their qualifications or abilities we pursue the development of
human resources by supporting those who wish to challenge and achieve higher goals

goal challenge system
 rather than setting easy goals that are soon achieved we feel that setting high goals is an excellent way to improve
ones self our goal challenge system allows employees to set and achieve high standards every half period employees
confer with their supervisors and set specific goals to be achieved over the course of six months and everyone in the
company works to achieve their goal the implementation of this system has produced the following results

    specifying goals has improved motivation
    supervisors can appropriately appraise the individuals achievements and offer specific guidance and development

 suzukis personnel system places greater emphasis on occupational ability than seniority intended to develop
professional human resources it is based on an objective and fair personnel evaluation system according to abilities
roles and responsibilities of individual employees the performancebased personnel system and the goal setting system
motivate employees intentions to step up each rung of the corporate ladder


selfactualization systems
 we are pursuing a standard that can be used to accurately evaluate employee performance and a corporate culture that
enables employees to maximize their abilities a selfactualization system has been implemented as a support system that
lets employees fully exercise their abilities in jobs that they choose to do and that allows employees to request transfers

 we are pursuing a working environment where employees who bear business activities can maximize their motivations
and abilities in a mentally and physically fulfilling condition various assistant systems are employed to help employees
work actively through positive adaptation as a company to diversify the working environment also a comfortable working
environment will improve employees motivation to increase productivity


childcare shortening hours system
 we have adopted a system to shorten daily working hours based on self application by employees who need childcare
for children in the third grade or younger
 the employees applying for this system may be exempted from overtime work in principle also they can use the
dedicated companys parking area allowing them to use cars for easy pickup of their children
 this system enabling employees with small children to choose from various working styles creates a working environment
where employees with motivation and ability can keep working this shorttime working system enhances awareness of
childcare support in the entire workplace and promotes employeefriendly working atmosphere which can support
those shorttime workers


childcare caring of an aged family member system
 we provide baby breaks and breaks for caring for an aged family member to employees regardless of gender who due to
personal reasons such as childcare nursing care etc have difficulty in working even though they have the will and ability
to work this system is used by many employees


reemployment system
 since july 1991 far earlier than the revision of the law concerning stabilization of employment of the older persons in
april 2006 we have adopted a reemployment system for hiring people after the mandatory retirement age of 60 years old
this system offers employment to the people who are willing and able to work after retirement age of 60 years old now
they are using their abundant experience and acquired skills in each working place


employee consultation service
 since 2002 we have rolled out the employees consultation service throughout the company as part of csr
management system in april 2007 the coverage of this service was expanded to include not only suzukis regular
employees but also all persons working in the business locations including regular apprentice probationary dispatched
temporary part time seasonal and seconded workers and suzukis employees working in other companies locations
in addition the consultation service is also available to employees of other suzuki group companies it provides a broad
range of consultation from trouble in the workplace such as sexual harassment or power abuse to questions problems
and improvements related to their individual jobs casually via email or phone service in addition consultation with an
outside lawyer is possible to maintain fairness quick and fair solutions to individual problems can maintain a comfortable
working environment also it is ensured that any report or consultation request will not cause any disadvantage to the
reporting person
 in addition to the consultation service an improvement proposal box is located at worksite cafeterias and offices
allowing every employee to easily make a proposal on work improvement or request for consultation

employees
 among the labor unions goals are stable employment and maintaining and improvement of work conditions in order to
meet these conditions stable development of the company is required when negotiating salaries bonuses labor hours
etc our opinions sometimes differ however we do share the same basic vector which aims to stable development of the
company


employee communication
 we arrange frequent labormanagement consultations to ensure that employee ideas are reflected in all of our
departments such as research and development design manufacturing sales etc
 in addition to discussing requirements salaries bonuses labor hours etc we hold monthly discussions that regularly
cover a wide range of issues such as business policies production planning business hours welfare safety and health
etc and seriously exchange ideas on what suzuki and the labor union can do to deliver quality products to the customer

the importance of cooperative relationship and smooth communication between labor and management as well as the
need for a fair equal and clear personnel management system etc we also work with the labor union to promote global
personnel exchanges both domestically and abroad and we strive to establish a work climate which allows our 56000

                improving corporate value
 the suzuki group has been holding up the phrase develop products of superior value by focusing on the customer as
the first statement in the mission statement and has placed valuable products on the base of manufacturing since our
inauguration
 under this philosophy suzuki has made the best efforts to improve the corporate value to live up to expectations
from shareholders and investors and in line with our growth strategy we have continuously reevaluated every field and
improved our management practices under our basic policy think hard and make an extra effort to challenge the status
quo
 for the mediumterm sales target we have constantly recovered the consolidated sales which had been dropped to
24691 billion yen in march of fiscal 2010 after the lehman shock and are now working to reach 3 trillion yen by march
of fiscal 2015 for the consolidated profits we accomplished the target ordinary income rate of 6 in this term and the
operating profit ratio and current net income ratio are the best ever
 however on the other hand we also have nonprofitable businesses and unsuccessful markets we will make efforts to
improve profits also of such business and regions to this purpose we will put our efforts toward realizing the philosophy
of the mission statement by holding up create a wow  beyond customer expectations  as suzukis vision also we
will select and centralize management resources to continue investment to important fields including environmental
technologies small cars and growing markets and establish the revenue base and develop human resources that support
such fields

                for our shareholders and investors
 suzukis basic profit sharing policy is focused on maintaining a continuous and stable dividend at the same time
however from a medium and longterm perspective we always consider how to improve business performance dividend
payout ratio and internal reserves as a basis for enhancement of our corporate structure to prepare to expand our
business operations in the future
 the suzuki groups business performance largely depends on overseas production plants mainly in developing countries
and is subject to exchange rate fluctuations therefore for further stable growth of suzuki group it is important to
enhance corporate strength and prepare for any contingency
 in this accounting period of consolidation fiscal year 2012 we could compensate profit declines due to impact of
foreign exchange rates or cutdown in sales in europe with profit increase realized by increase in sales of automobiles in
japan and other asian countries and cost reduction as a result the current consolidated net profit became the best ever
 the business environment still shows a grim outlook but we have set the yearend dividend of this business year to 10
yen per share the ordinary dividend including an interim dividend was 18 yen increased by three yen per share from the
previous fiscal year
 in line with our basic policy the surplus is distributed twice a year in the forms of the interim dividend and the yearend
dividend according to the resolution of our board of directors the interim dividend is available for the shareholders as of
september 30 every year as the record date which is stipulated in our company contract the decisionmaking meetings
for the dividends are the board of directors for the interim dividend and the shareholder meeting for the yearend
dividend

introduction of suzukis monozukuri production to local students
 for the purposes of cultivation of human resources and activation of researches we give suzuki endowment lectures
at a local university by sending lecturers from suzuki also we create an endowed chair to inform students on what are
happening in the industrial world

endowment lectures
 suzuki reformed the lectures which had been presented to shizuoka university engineering dept for nine years since
2003 and has started the new threeyear lecture course from 2012 to 2014
 this course is on research of element technologies to use energy of fuel gasoline etc more effectively the current
internalcombustion engine disposes approximately 50 of fuel energy as thermal energy thus we are trying to study
and develop new technologies to use regeneration energy and to realize an advanced vehicle with high environmental
performance
 the study is conducted at the laboratory by integrating production experiment and analysis at the lecture of
automotive engineering we provide unique education which only a company can present for example teaching
functions materials manufacturing methods etc of parts while looking at actual parts

activities at yokohama labo
 some engineers were sent from the suzuki yokohama labo for a lecture aimed at elementary and junior high school students
in line with a program called dr tsuzuki club school sponsored by the tsuzuki ward administration promotion section
yokohama city in fiscal 2012 a lecture under the theme of robots was provided to 43 students of two junior high schools
generally science is a popular subject for elementary school students in lower grades and it is said that they are highly
interested in experiments and observations however scientific subjects in junior high school tend
to be less popular and be avoided in selective classes in high school after we understand such
circumstances we effectively used a personal computer projector comprehensible charts graphs
pictures animations real robots etc in the presentation so that students could understand easily
and enjoy the lecture robots demonstrated there include microcomputerequipped master 
slave type robots a line tracing robot that follows a line with its infrared sensor led display unit
and radiocontrolled electric wheelchair soccer robots we used them to show the actual robot
motions and functions and also let students experience actual operation while touching those
actually moving stateofthe
art robots in front of their eyes
the students were listening to
the instructors explanation with
keen interest we are promoting
these lectures hoping that this
helps prevent local children from
drifting away from science

explanation of suzukis business activities and efforts for environmental
preservation as well as promotion of mutual communication




voluntary cleanup around the plant
 plant employees voluntarily conducted cleanup around the plant
manner improvement activities at takatsuka motorcycle plant twice
a year
 this activity was conducted under a slogan of pick up trashes and
leave greetings and was a good opportunity to deepen exchanges and
increase communication with local residents




noise monitoring activity on the west of the plant
 we conducted monitoring activities patrol early in the morning and at
night on the west side of the plant to check noises from the plant four
times throughout the fiscal year we checked noises at 600 and 2200
which was quiet time to make sure that there was no problem
 through that activity we ensure protection of local residents living
environment against noise
