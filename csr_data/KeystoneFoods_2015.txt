innovating new products globally
keystone foods rd teams partner with customers and work independently to create customized imaginative
food solutions we introduced and commercialized 170 new products across the world in 2014 alone along with

    keystar energized to meet
    the evolving world of csr
    since 2008 the keystar csr program has evolved and grown responding to changing needs and conditions
    related to the global economy food safety consumer preferences emerging socioeconomic concerns and other key
    factors in late 2013 we comprehensively reviewed and updated keystar to better manage and produce sustainable
    outcomes for society and our stakeholders and communities

    during that process we made some refinements to our four strategic keystar pillars and the program continues
    to expand globally and be tracked extensively whatever we attempt and however we approach each csr initiative
    we never lose sight of our keystar principle of being guided by our values

    sustaining the planet
    reducing energy use and our carbon footprint conserving water
    and eliminatinglimiting waste are key ways we help safeguard our
    planet while achieving truly sustainable growth using a targeted
    methodical approach we establish global targets and measures
    with both keystar teams and local management responsible
    for reaching objectives goals are established for each facility and
    division annually and the company has a set of stretch goals we
    are striving to achieve by 2020

    each division is able to identify opportunities with the highest
    potential returns and positive outcomes for their operations
    and customers through this decentralized approach 
    consistent with our business model  we share responsibility for
    sustainability leadership and innovative thinking its acting locally

    thing to plan another to execute and its a tribute to our people and programs that we are able to create
    measurable positive results through a variety of impactful initiatives


    measuring our carbon footprint
    improving our ghg footprint has always played a large role in keystone foods daytoday operations
    we have measured and continue to reduce our carbon footprint scope 1 emissions are those from
    sources owned by the company scope 2 emissions are those generated to produce electricity the result
    of these efforts is quantified in the chart below

minimize the environmental impact of our operations assure compliance with applicable laws regulations
and other environmentally oriented requirements and continually improve in these areas

our us proteins facilities follow an environmental management system ems based on iso principles

     water and wastewater
     with water being a natural resource of evergrowing
     importance keystone foods has studied and analyzed
     water risks across our global operations over the past
     two years so we can better prioritize water reduction and
     reuse projects as always the balance between using water
     wisely and ensuring uncompromising standards of hygiene
     must be met through ongoing audits conservation teams
     discovering new ways to optimize use innovative reduction
     initiatives and other efforts we continue to advance our
     smarter resource use and conservation

     sometimes asking what if delivers impressive results at

     reduction in heat exchanger valve size could be implemented
     and what the rewards might be through thorough testing
     it was determined that water consumption in the product
     forming process could be reduced from ten gallons per
     minute to four by using a smaller valve adding a shutoff valve
     operating when the forming process was not taking place
     created additional water and financial savings

reduction adds value
we work closely with customers and suppliers to address waste throughout our supply chain cutting waste
hauled to landfills lowers costs and adds value for our customers building rapport in the communities where
they and we live and operate



thinking differently to recycle
the unrecyclable
at keystone australia employees made a
concerted effort to change habits and recycle
more effecting a substantial reduction in
the units solid waste but one troublesome
problem remained it was found that plastic
packaging from raw materials was a large
portion of waste being sent to landfill as the
plastic was contaminated with organic matter if
could not be recycled traditionally

by finding a different destination for this
material via a commercial partner specializing
in hospital waste this previously unrecyclable
plastic now goes to an incinerator where
recovered energy helps run the operations of
the commercial partner




reducing waste and diverting dust
during production at the keystone georgia facility breading dust particles were created that landed on the floor
and clogged drains while not a health hazard these particles made cleaning more difficult and costly and sent
additional matter to the wastewater treatment facility a new collection system was installed that now gathers
about 5770 pounds of this breading dust over each day of production the key outcomes of reduction and
recycling also added a bonus benefit by contracting with a company to purchase this material and divert it from
landfill generating revenue




                                                                                                                    12

     contributing
     to communities
     along with our sharpened philanthropic focus as outlined in
     our new keystone cares program we act as a good corporate
     citizen within every area in which we do business through wide
     ranging community involvement from employee volunteerism
     to championing health and wellbeing in the community from
     career opportunities to economic development we know that
     we do well by doing good



     introducing keystone cares
     reﬁning and targeting the ways we give back
     in 2014 keystone foods began an initiative to refresh and refocus
     our philanthropic efforts and the way we contribute to our
     communities the big idea make even more of a difference acting
     globally and impacting locally this was the genesis for keystone
     cares that will become a primary component of our keystar
     contributing to communities pillar in mid2015

     today our charitable giving is making a real difference in our local
     communities however we have found that the breadth of our
     giving can often dilute the impact of our efforts we have revisited
     our philanthropic approach to ensure that our giving is precisely
     aligned with our mission vision and values


     keystone cares will target three key areas of giving
                        nourishing people
                        approximately 842 million people  12 of the world population  do not eat enough to be
                        healthy and one in eight people go to bed hungry each night as a leading global supplier of protein
                        products we seek to leverage our expertise to minimize hunger and food security concerns

                        local community support
                        contributing to our communities is at the heart of our organization due to the geographic
                        diversity of our company we focus our community support at the local level to address local
                        priorities and consider cultural differences

                        disaster relief
                        when significant disasters strike in areas where our facilities are located both our people and the
