        2009 corporate social responsibility report 3

dear stakeholders


as we began 2009 the economic forecast was discouraging and we were concerned about the impact that the economic downturn could have on our local
communities and on access to health care and the medications people need

we were pleased then by opportunities in 2009 to contribute to the national conversations that took place about economic recovery and about making the us
health care system more accessible and more effective we also were gratified by opportunities to have an immediate impact across all of the communities we
serve as a large health care company and employer with the capacity to drive positive social change through our business practices

healthy solutions our 2009 corporate social responsibility report describes our continuing efforts across the country to partner with local governments
nonprofits schools and faithbased organizations to support important community priorities like access to health care and job creation this report also captures
some of the advisory work we did in 2009 in one case we were invited to testify before the us senate on our perspective on the governments welfare
to work program an initiative with which cvs caremark has a long history we also are contributing to the work of president obamas economic recovery
advisory board as a member of the education and training subcommittee

at the same time this report tells the story of how our more than 200000 cvs caremark employees responded to other opportunities to serve in 2009 by
providing patients with access to high quality and affordable solutions that meet their health care needs by rolling up their sleeves and volunteering in their
communities by organizing food drives and fund raisers by helping other health care practitioners better understand how medicine works in the united states
and by sharpening our companys overall approach to our vision of improving the quality of human life

this was the vision we had when cvs merged with caremark in 2007 an integrated health care company with the collective expertise scale and network to
improve the delivery accessibility and affordability of pharmacy services and acute family medical care every day we strive to fulfill our mission by creating
solutions that enable people to sustain their health and their wellbeing

along the way we are maintaining a company culture that truly values and encourages contributions to the communities we serve in 2009 we built on
our practice of hosting free health fairs in urban communities for example by also offering more than 3 million in free flu shots to the unemployed this
initiative saw us partner with the naacp and with career centers sponsored by the us department of labor to ensure better access to flu shots in addition
our minuteclinic network of walkin retail health clinics and cvspharmacy stores dramatically increased the publics access to the h1n1 flu vaccine as that
pressing public health issue became a national concern in 2009

while health care remains the primary focus of our company our mission calls on us to be responsive to the broader needs of our communities so as this
report indicates we are contributing to a healthy environment we are ensuring that our employees are valued for their contributions we are providing relief to
communities during times of emergency and we are operating in an ethical transparent manner these are our social and environmental responsibilities and
we take these responsibilities very seriously

cvs caremark has a long history of giving back to our communities dating back to our
roots as a regional new england retailer in 2009 we donated more than 79 million in
cash inkind contributions and volunteer hours to worthy organizations all across the
country this included a special 46 million inkind donation to feeding america that
helped sustain thousands of food banks and shelters serving the millions of americans
struggling with the daily challenge of feeding their families




our commitment to corporate social responsibility took us to some interesting places in 2009 one example is our cvspharmacy greenbagtag program this
program launched in 2009 provides rewards to customers who forego plastic bags for reusable shopping bags or who choose to use no bag at all it was
borne from our realization that our extracare program the nations largest customer loyalty program was capable not only of providing savings to customers
but also of creating powerful incentives for socially responsible behavior already our customers have had their greenbagtags scanned more than 6 million
times having seen the proof of this concept we now are designing extracare programs that encourage healthy behaviors like better disease management by
customers with chronic conditions

as our company has grown we have maintained a steadfast commitment to responsible business practices our approach to patient privacy for example
is now driven by a privacy governance council a group that we created in 2009 to enhance our privacy and data protection strategy provide leadership
on privacy issues and align the privacy strategy with the core business operations of cvs caremark we also made significant investments in diversity
management and in technologies that make it easier for our colleagues to communicate and to collaborate no matter their location

cvs caremark has a long history of giving back to our communities dating back to our roots as a regional new england retailer in 2009 we donated more
than 79 million in cash inkind contributions and volunteer hours to worthy organizations all across the country this included a special 46 million inkind
donation to feeding america that helped sustain thousands of food banks and shelters serving the millions of americans struggling with the daily challenge of
feeding their families

we view these commitments as integral to the way we conduct business they define who we are as a company and make cvs caremark a place where our
colleagues are proud to work an essential part of our commitment is communicating our progress which we do annually through this report summarizing our
contributions and our business practices i hope you will take a few minutes to read this 2009 corporate social responsibility report learn more about what
