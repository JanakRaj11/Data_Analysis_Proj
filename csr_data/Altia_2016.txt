a year of dialogue and development
we want to be a leading alcohol beverage company in the nordic and
baltic regions also when it comes to corporate responsibility for us
responsibility is both a strategic priority and a success factor in business
we are increasingly engaging in dialogue on responsibility with our
partners suppliers and customers our efforts in the area of
responsibility build sustainable longterm business for altia




at altia responsibility is part of everything we do  from the executive management teams
agenda to brainstorming by the product development team and the planning of our marketing
in 2015 we took significant steps forward in our work on responsibility

the koskenkorva bioenergy power plant celebrated its first anniversary in november it has
reduced the carbon dioxide emissions of the koskenkorva production plant by as much as 35
percent finnish barley finds a wide variety of uses at our plant it is a valuable raw material
that we utilize almost completely in our production operations

at the grand opening of the bioenergy power plant i emphasized how proud i am of the high
level of fuel selfsufficiency of the plants steam generation which is expected to be as high as

altias responsibility report 2015



65 percent that sense of pride is still strong as the bioenergy power plant represents a
profitable investment that is a significant part of altias future it is a major step for us but we
have also taken many smaller steps forward in other areas of our operations

responsible alcohol consumption
altia is a significant operator in society we pay a substantial amount of taxes in our operating
countries we make investments we create stability and jobs and we work together with other
operators to promote a responsible drinking culture

we are committed to responsible alcohol consumption and its development in all of our
operating countries through our actions we want to set an example for other operators in our
industry we participate in campaigns to promote a responsible drinking culture in our various
market areas

we respect the right of adults to consume alcoholic beverages or to choose not to consume
them most adults consume alcoholic beverages in moderation in various social settings we
take the negative impacts of alcohol abuse seriously and we believe society must prevent them
through sensible regulation we are strongly against alcohol consumption by minors

transparency through communication and stakeholders
this responsibility report marks the first time that we discuss our corporate responsibility
objectives and our progress with respect to them

our stakeholders views regarding our responsibility are of essential importance to us in the
development of our operations in may we conducted our second stakeholder survey on
responsibility the materiality analysis carried out based on the survey highlighted nine key
themes that we will focus on in this report

employee wellbeing and good leadership are among our three most important responsibility
themes i am pleased to say that the results of altias annual personnel survey showed a
significant improvement during the year we have focused on leadership development and
increased communication by our management

responsibility goes hand in hand with transparency in 2015 we increased our stakeholder




10

altias responsibility report 2015



dialogue in various ways including the launch of our twitter account altiafi which
provides us with a platform for dialogue with our audience and open communications about
our operations

another change that promotes greater transparency is the whistleblower channel we
introduced during the year it offers our personnel a secure channel for reporting conduct that
is in breach of our business principles

responsible product development and local production
altia buys barley mainly from 1500 contract farmers for use at the koskenkorva distillery we
have signed the baltic sea action group bsag commitment in accordance with the
commitment we encourage farmers to use environmentally friendly practices in agriculture
we also made a concurrent commitment to reducing our water consumption we favor local
production whenever possible

responsibility is an important consideration in our product development we launched non
alcoholic wines during the year and we are also developing our selection of organic and
fairtrade wines the rajamäki plant also received certification in 2015 for bottling fairtrade
wines we launched our first product manufactured from organic grain spirit produced at
koskenkorva and finnish organic blueberries the rooftop garden organic blueberry ginger
liqueur

product quality and safety is the most important theme for our stakeholders as well as everyone
at altia responsibility is a key aspect of our product development and the development of our
portfolio of partner brands we believe it will also provide a competitive advantage for altia
going forward

i hope you enjoy reading our report

altias responsibility report 2015




business environment and altias strategy
altia is the leading producer and importer of alcoholic beverages in the
nordic and baltic countries our competitors include major
international beverage industry players nordic companies local
importers and small local producers we value diversity as it enriches
the industry and helps shift drinking culture from a focus on quantity
to a focus on quality

strategy development in progress
altias longterm focus is on profitable growth profitable growth is sought by implementing
the companys current strategy which extends to 2016 its focus areas are brands innovation
customer insight and leadership development altia has also begun to develop its strategy 2020
in a broadbased effort within the organization the new strategy 2020 will be a seamless
extension of the strategy being implemented at present

altias responsibility report 2015



economic climate remains weak
the economic climate in the food retail travel and restaurant industries remains weaker than
average this is also reflected on the beverage industry the markets for alcoholic beverages are
stagnant or declining in all of our operating countries and competition is intense

nevertheless altia has been successful in capturing market share in several product categories
in spite of the difficult market situation in marketing altia has focused on insight into the
nordic consumer as well as brand building in product development attention has been
shifted even further towards responsibility and new innovations that create added value
examples of this include fair trade and organic products launched during the year as well as
nonalcoholic and loweralcohol beverages which are increasingly sought by consumers

altia also took significant strides forward in improving the efficiency of its operations with
regard to production as well as the supply chain the koskenkorva distillery for example
operates at full capacity every day of the year and the high efficiency creates a cost advantage

continued digitalization
digitalization is a strong trend also in the alcoholic beverage industry consumers in the eu
buy alcoholic beverages remotely from online stores online sales remain relatively minor and
focused on enthusiasts nevertheless ecommerce represents a significant trend in consumer
behavior that domestic operators should be able to respond to

international competitors are currently able to fully utilize social media channels and e
commerce even towards finnish consumers at the same time domestic operators are partly
prohibited by law from participating in this competition in finland

the problem of gray imports
the nordic countries are characterized by strict legislation and taxation of the alcohol industry
while in our other operating countries latvia and estonia the markets are more liberal the
border trade and gray imports are nevertheless a common feature of all of our operating
countries they are a significant problem in finland sweden and estonia for example in
finland the value of gray imports exceeds the total sales of the entire restaurant industry
denmark represents the opposite example it has achieved a decrease in gray imports by




17

altias responsibility report 2015



reducing taxes on alcohol

a comprehensive reform of finnish alcohol legislation began in 2015 the process will
continue in 2016 and new legislation is expected to enter into force at the beginning of 2017
we hope that the legislative changes will make it easier for finnish companies in the alcohol
industry to operate and pursue success in export markets

stakeholder interaction and materiality
analysis
our stakeholders perceptions regarding our responsibility are of
essential importance to us they help us develop and prioritize our
operations we want to be a leading alcohol company also when it
comes to responsibility
we aim to communicate our operations to our stakeholders in an open and transparent
manner we developed our stakeholder communications by launching altias twitter account
altiafi in september 2015

in addition to daytoday stakeholder interaction we evaluated our stakeholders perceptions
regarding our responsibility by conducting our second comprehensive stakeholder survey
according to the results of the survey the themes related to altias responsibility cornerstones
perceived as the most important by stakeholders are product quality and safety employee well
being and good leadership

we conducted a materiality analysis based on the results of the stakeholder survey and our
internal assessments and we also produced our firstever materiality matrix of the
responsibility cornerstone themes nine were highlighted as the most material aspects of our
responsibility

altias responsibility report 2015




stakeholder interaction
stakeholder survey product quality and safety is the most important
aspect
in may 2015 we conducted our second stakeholder survey on responsibility to assess our
stakeholders views on the responsibility cornerstones that guide our responsibility efforts and
to support the development of our work in the area of responsibility

the most important themes among our responsibility cornerstones as highlighted by our
stakeholders were product safety and quality employee wellbeing good leadership
responsible marketing and the use of responsibly produced raw materials product quality and
safety was also highlighted as the most important theme in our first stakeholder survey
conducted in 2013

the least important themes according to the respondents were our measures to reduce water
consumption and protect groundwater and to minimize environmental impacts by reducing
waste volume and developing packaging

domestic ownership production and raw materials was highlighted as the most important
theme in the responses to an openended question at the beginning of the survey to gauge
respondents opinions on what altia should focus on in its responsibility efforts

overall the responses of the various stakeholder groups regarding the order of priority of the
responsibility cornerstone themes were very similar

our contract farmers highlighted the price we pay for barley which was characterized as being
too low and unfair altias barley pricing is influenced by the prices of grain in the world
market and particularly by the development of the market prices of wheat and barley in the
eus internal market altias public market price for barley is competitive compared to other
public barley prices

some of the survey results support the conclusion that the level of awareness among our
stakeholders regarding our responsibility efforts is not yet high enough which presents us with
a good opportunity to develop our communications on responsibility via various channels




25

altias responsibility report 2015



invitations to participate in the survey were sent by email to 2238 stakeholder representatives
in our operating countries and a link to the survey was also posted on the company website
we received a total of 238 responses

the largest respondent group was suppliers at 27 percent followed by personnel as expected
the majority of the responses came from finland 61 percent

we have not received any other direct feedback in our operating countries with regard to the
development of our responsibility efforts aside from the results of the stakeholder survey

issues highlighted in the media and by stakeholders during the reporting period included
finnish alcohol law reform the gray import of alcohol consumption that is not reflected in
statistics the organic production of alcoholic beverages and bioenergy

materiality analysis
we conducted our second stakeholder survey on responsibility in may
2015 we sent a link to the survey to 2238 representatives of different
stakeholder groups and the link was also posted on our website we
received a total of 238 responses
we reviewed the results of the stakeholder survey in our corporate responsibility working
group which is comprised of 10 members representing different business areas the working
group is led by the senior vice president for commercial operations who is also a member of
altias executive management team

in addition to the results of the stakeholder survey the core group of the working group
discussed the impacts of global megatrends and trends related to the development of
responsibility in the alcohol industry on the cornerstones of our responsibility and also
reviewed the categories and aspects of the international gri reporting framework to ensure that
our responsibility cornerstones are sufficiently comprehensive

the core group of the corporate responsibility working group is led by the senior vice
president for commercial operations who is also a member of altias executive management
team with the other core team members being the product development and sourcing
director who is responsible for the altia and customers cornerstone the category director
for spirits who is responsible for the altia and society cornerstone the hseq manager who
is responsible for altia and the environment and the director of leadership and culture who
is responsible for the altia and employees cornerstone

based on the analysis we revised our responsibility cornerstones slightly with regard to the titles
and content of their themes as well as the themes grouping and location under the
cornerstones

we produced also our first responsibility materiality matrix the material aspects included nine
themes which are the focus of our report

our executive management team approved the updated responsibility cornerstones and the
materiality matrix

altia  customers




product quality and safety are crucial priorities for altia for example in wine production
operations in rajamäki the quality of wine is monitored by sensory evaluation as well as
chemical laboratory analyses at different stages of production

although recalls are relatively rare altia practices actively for these situations with phantom
testing among other things last year there were a total of 15 product recalls in all of altias
markets combined the recalls were mostly related to taste defects microbiological
fermentation and foreign objects

focusing on traceability is an important aspect of ensuring the quality and safety of altias
products the products altia manufactures can be traced down to individual batches of
packaging materials and raw materials

when selecting raw material suppliers we also evaluate their responsibility by means of our
corporate social responsibility survey we require that our suppliers are certified or externally
audited with regard to product safety product quality and social responsibility

altias largest customers the nordic alcohol monopolies are members of the european
business social compliance initiative bsci the bscis ethical principles emphasise working
conditions human rights and environmental protection altia is committed to complying with
the bscis ethical principles in its own operations and throughout the supply chain bsci

altias responsibility report 2015



audits commissioned by the monopolies and focused on risk countries continued in 2015

altia is developing its portfolio of organic and ethically certified products to respond to the
growing demand for them in may 2015 the rajamäki bottling plant received permission to
start bottling fair trade products altias first own fair trade wine patchwork was launched
in sweden in finland altia launched the rooftop garden liqueur the first product
manufactured from organic grain spirit produced at the koskenkorva plant

responsible sourcing
selecting our wines responsibly
at altia we work with wellknown wine producers who are able to supply the volumes we need
for our products the biggest wine sourcing countries for altias proprietary brands are
australia usa chile spain south africa and hungary

selecting producers to supply us with wines is done with care all of our suppliers whether
from a risk country or not fill in our csr corporate social responsibility questionnaire and
sign a contract which includes a bsci business social compliance initiative clause when
visiting our suppliers we carry out ocular audits and in countries like south africa for
example we visit the vineyards and talk to the farmers and workers supplying the grapes to
check that our standards are met so far our suppliers have done great work audits have never
brought up any crucial issue that would have ended the cooperation

each member of the wine sourcing team is responsible for a group of specific countries and
apart from having an indepth knowledge of these countries have also built up networks of
producers and brokers to cover all needs

this means that even if we cant visit a potential supplier on day one one of our contacts will
be able to make sure that everything is as it should be in time we visit all of our suppliers and
producers

in particular suppliers to the monopoly countries are very aware of what is expected of them
regarding corporate responsibility even so in some countries the situation has been
complicated huge steps have been made in recent years in the right direction however that
said we must also respect the intricate underlying challenges that many risk countries are faced
with with our suppliers we work together

raw materials  demanding safety and quality
at altia we expect certificates from our partners regarding the safety and quality of the
products as well as certificates concerning social responsibility by communicating openly we
make sure that our suppliers know all the requirements set for the products in 2015 we




45

altias responsibility report 2015



mapped out the certification situation of our suppliers and discussed development plans to
implement missing audits

with new potential suppliers we use a specific evaluation tool to make sure that they meet all
the required aspects to minimize our carbon footprint we prefer locally produced products
and materials wherever possible

through altias supply chain the awareness of csr issues has been rising during the last years
for example all actors work towards the efficient use of raw materials and avoid over
packaging

bsci tests partners responsibility in practice
altias largest customers the nordic alcoholic beverage monopolies are members of the
european bsci as a supplier to the monopolies altia and its sales companies are committed
to complying with the bscis ethical principles in altias own operations and throughout the
supply chain

the ethical principles are included in the code of conduct which emphasize working
conditions human rights and environmental issues in the supply chain these ethical principles
are also based on the most recognized international labor standards such as ilo conventions
and the un global compact

in 2015 one audit was conducted in trinidad  tobago and two reaudits in south africa
one supplier with nonconforming results in the first audit in 2014 filled in a selfassessment
report on the progress of correcting the shortcomings

for 2016 audits have already been agreed to be conducted at our suppliers in guyana and
chile

at altia we have continued implementing the bsci by updating contracts to reflect the new
code of conduct and asking our suppliers to sign the bsci terms of implementation

the bsci audits focus on risk countries as listed by bsci in 2015 these countries accounted
for only 5 percent of altias total purchases the majority of altias purchases are made in the
eu area with finland representing the single largest sourcing country

sensory perception and chemistry come
together in quality assurance
in altias wine production operations at the rajamäki plant the quality
of wine is monitored by sensory evaluation as well as chemical
laboratory analyses
in recent times we have particularly focused on developing the sensory evaluation of wines at
least five people participate in each evaluation session to ensure a reliable result the evaluators
are trained and their sense of taste is tested says hanna jatila wine quality master at altia

quality monitoring applies to beverages produced at the rajamäki plant as well as wines
produced elsewhere and bottled at the rajamäki plant each wine is tested at multiple stages of
the process upon delivery during processing and several times during bottling

two evaluation sessions are held at the rajamäki plant each day lasting from ten minutes to
half an hour depending on the number of products being evaluated approximately 3100 wine
samples are evaluated each year

limit values are specified by legislation
in addition to sensory analysis wines are also subject to chemical analyses in a laboratory in
the analyses special attention is paid to sulphur dioxide content sulphur dioxide is a
preservative that is subject to legal maximum limits

like sensory analysis chemical analysis also takes place at several different stages of the wine
production process sensory and chemical evaluation complement each other

the most important stage in the quality assurance of wine is accepting delivery when a batch
of wine is delivered samples are taken for the purpose of sensory analysis if the wine is found
to be defective in taste for example the delivery will not be accepted however this is quite
rare as only a few batches of wine are returned per year

wine quality is also monitored by agreements the agreements between wine producers and




48

altias responsibility report 2015



altias wine purchasers include an aqs document that serves as a guideline for the chemical
composition of the wine cooperation between the parties concerned is essential in quality
assurance

in the event of changes such as the introduction of faster and more accurate chemical or
microbiological methods altia must develop its methods accordingly it is very rewarding to
work with major wine and beverage companies as they give us new perspectives that help us
improve our quality assurance further hanna jatila explains

altias responsibility report 2015



our biggest customers alko in finland and systembolaget in sweden are continuously
increasing their sales of fairtrade and other ethically certified wines bechjansen explains

widoff also views responsibility as an increasingly important issue in the wine business with
companies adjusting their portfolios to meet the demands for responsible production

naturally we try to increase our share of these kind of wines because of the rising demand
we are always part of the blending process where style and quality are decided for us
uniqueness and great value are key widoff says

altia is constantly on the lookout for new sustainable partners as the demand for fairtrade
wines increases so does the demand for altias fair trade portfolio

responsibility in the alcohol trade
each year altia organizes a partner seminar for its partners in
conjunction with the mikä viini what wine event in helsinki the
theme of the seminar in 2015 was responsibility
on september 15 2015 some 35 of altias international partners met at a partner seminar in
helsinki this marked the fourth time altia has organized the seminar for the producers whose
products it imports and represents in past years the seminars themes have included current
topics related to finnish alcohol law and the alcohol trade this was again the case in 2015 when
the seminar focused on responsibility in the alcohol industry

responsibility is crucial for altia our most significant customer alko requires that producers
the supply chain and importers operate responsibly says nina jansson partner director
finland at altia

the speakers at the seminar included minna alitalo purchasing director at alko leea
rankinen vice president of corporate responsibility at sok tuuli kaskinen director at
demos helsinki and maria nymander corporate responsibility  product regulation
manager at altia

alkos message to its partners typically carries the most weight at these seminars as alko is our
largest customer in finland

altia is committed to the ethical principles of the european business social compliance initiative
bsci they are based on key international agreements such as ilo principles and the un
global compact the principles emphasize human rights working conditions and environmental
responsibility

the monopolies in finland alko sweden systembolaget and norway vinmonopolet are
members of the association they require that their entire supply chains commit to the principles

the majority of altias partners are major international companies that have good processes
related to responsibility partners in socalled risk countries in particular generally have a high
level of awareness of the regulations that concern them jansson explains

altias responsibility report 2015



responsible business provides the framework for the trade the most notable advantage of the
partner seminar is that it gives our partners the opportunity to present questions directly to alko
representatives and other key players in the industry while the theme was familiar to everyone
the partners considered the seminar useful

plants in rajamäki and tabasalu consist of energy consumption water consumption waste
water and waste generation environmental impacts are mitigated by annually determined
measures the effectiveness of which is monitored by means of environmental indicators

koskenkorva distillerys bioenergy power plant which began fullscale operations in january
2015 uses barley husk as its primary fuel the use of renewable fuel helped the koskenkorva
plant reduce its fossil carbon dioxide emissions by 35 percent and increase its selfsufficiency in
terms of fuel in steam generation to 46 percent in 2015

altia increases the efficiency of its logistics by combining the volumes of altias own products
and its partners products as well as by operating close to customers

altia is a significant buyer of domestic barley in finland in 2015 altia purchased nearly 191
million kilograms of barley for its koskenkorva distillery mainly from the 1500 contract
farmers this volume represents approximately 15 percent of finlands total barley harvest
altia encourages its contract farmers to optimize the efficiency of their operations and use
production inputs sensibly for example as part of altias bsag commitment made in 2015
aimed at protecting the baltic sea

the clean groundwater at the rajamäki plant is a key raw material for altias alcoholic

environmental impacts
altias environmental impacts and proactive measures related
to environmental incidents
altias key environmental impacts are defined in assessments of environmental aspects
conducted at threeyear intervals in the assessment conducted in 2015 the most significant
environmental impacts were identified as energy consumption water consumption waste
water waste generation and product wastage leading to quality costs

environmental indicators were defined to support the reduction of the most significant
environmental impacts with plantspecific reduction targets set for the threeyear period
20162018 the achievement of environmental targets is monitored on a monthly basis by
means of environmental indicators actions to reach the environmental targets are defined for
each production plant in the environmental programs prepared on an annual basis

the cognac production facility in france is excluded from the environmental targets and
indicators as its production volume and environmental impacts are significantly smaller
compared to the other plants

an environmental risk assessment was conducted in late 2015 for the rajamäki plant based on
the assessment a proactive plan was produced to support the prevention of potential
environmental incidents and emissions

environmental indicators 20132015
in the environmental indicators for 2013 the figures for the koskenkorva plant are presented
separately and the other plants are combined due to the fact that the environmental indicators
for koskenkorva are calculated per tonne of barley while those of other plants are calculated
per cubic meter of product

altias responsibility report 2015



energy consumption and energy efficiency
the energy consumption indicator decreased from 2014 to 2015 at the koskenkorva plant as
well as at the rajamäki and tabasalu alcoholic beverage plants energy saving measures are a
major development area for altia both in terms of profitability and environmental
responsibility altia began energy reviews at the koskenkorva plant and the rajamäki alcoholic
beverage plant in late 2014 the reviews were carried out according to motivas instructions
they provided information on the plants energy consumption profiles and helped identify
opportunities for the costefficient reduction of energy consumption the reviews were
completed in late 2015

in 2008 altia joined the voluntary energy efficiency agreement of the confederation of
finnish industries ek and the state of finland in accordance with the energy efficiency
program altia is committed to reducing its energy consumption in finland by 9 percent by the
end of 2016 using 2005 as the baseline in 2015 altias energy savings amounted to 237
mwh or 01 percent compared to 2014 and 40203 mwh or 170 percent compared to
2005

water consumption and groundwater protection
water consumption relative to production volume has decreased at the koskenkorva plant as
well as altias other plants compared to the previous year water consumption has been
reduced by optimizing washing during production processes and the filtering of products
protecting groundwater and soil is important to altia as clean groundwater is a key raw
material in the production of alcoholic beverages altia protects the quality of water at water
intake plants in finland mainly through the precise monitoring of groundwater quality and
surface levels ownership of land in the groundwater areas of pumping stations and also with
building restrictions protected areas and monitoring the use of the land altia owns two
protected mires in rajamäki the companys operations do not have any negative impacts on
the mires

altias responsibility report 2015



wastewater emissions and exceeding environmental permit
limits
wastewater quality is monitored at koskenkorva and rajamäki on a daily basis by measuring
chemical oxygen demand cod in wastewater samples the environmental target for
improving wastewater quality was not achieved as the indicators at both plants increased
compared to the previous years altia will continue its efforts to reduce wastewater emissions

the rajamäki plants monthly average for the biochemical oxygen demand of wastewater
exceeded the limits specified in the environmental permit twice during the year while the limit
for the amount of solids in wastewater was exceeded three times following these instances of
environmental permit limits being exceeded the rajamäki plant has reduced its wastewater
load by improving the biological treatment of wastewater the environmental permit limits for
biochemical oxygen demand and solids in wastewater were also exceeded once at the
koskenkorva plant due to problems associated with the restarting of the wastewater treatment
plant following a shutdown

no penalties were imposed for exceeding permit provisions or neglecting environmental laws or
regulations during the reporting period

waste recycling
altia seeks to decrease waste volume by reducing the amount of disposed packaging material
the environmental indicator for reducing the waste volume was higher in 2015 than in 2014
due to a change in the reporting method for waste alcohol at the rajamäki plant due to the
change the indicator is not comparable with the figures for the previous years the waste
generated at altias plants is almost fully utilized as material or energy the average waste
reutilization rate for rajamäki koskenkorva and tabasalu was 984 percent

intermediate energy needs

3 the change between figures for 2013 and 2014 is due to a change in the calculation method for the power plant at koskenkorva the operations of which have been

transferred to step oy altia will in the future report the information from these operations as indirect energy use and emissions

4 district heating not reported in 2013

5 at the end of 2014 an oil leakage incident occurred at the koskenkorva plant where a diesel oilwater mixture leaked into the protective pool due to a hole in the tank

due to the failure of the protective pool the mixture also leaked into the surrounding soil the defective tank and the protective pool were removed and the soil was replaced

with new soil

first year of fullscale operations at the
koskenkorva bioenergy power plant
in its first year of operations the bioenergy power plant at altias
koskenkorva plant reduced the production plants carbon dioxide
emissions and increased its selfsufficiency in terms of fuel in steam
generation
the 10megawatt bioenergy power plant which began fullscale operations in january 2015 uses
barley husk as its primary fuel the bioenergy power plant makes it possible for altia to utilize
practically 100 percent of the barley grain in its yearround production of grain spirit and starch
in 2015 altia purchased 191 million kilos of domestic barley or approximately 15 percent of the
finnish barley harvest

lower carbon dioxide emissions and higher selfsufficiency in
terms of fuel
the use of renewable fuel helped the koskenkorva plant reduce its fossil carbon dioxide emissions
by 35 percent in 2015 the ethanol distillation process requires a significant amount of steam
and more than 95 percent of the climate impacts of alcohol production are generated during the
distillation of ethanol

the plants selfsufficiency in terms of fuel in steam generation increased to 46 percent for the full
year and reached 61 percent in december prior to the new bioenergy power plant the plants
fuel selfsufficiency in steam generation stood at approximately 20 percent

at the current rate we will reach our fuel selfsufficiency target of more than 60 percent by
summer 2016 im very pleased with the level of commitment and determination our team at
koskenkorva has demonstrated in working to ensure that we reach our shared target says plant
manager antti snellman

in terms of the technology and fuels it uses the power plant is the first of its kind in finland

we want to participate in the development of renewable field biomasses in finnish energy
production and diversify our core competencies as an industrial user of barley snellman explains

promising results in the use of ash
altia has also investigated the use of ash from the new biomass boiler in cooperation with pro
agria

the first test field was established in spring 2015 by spreading approximately 30 tonnes of ash
from the boiler over an area of 15 hectares no significant differences were observed during the
growing season between the ashfertilized field and the control field that used chemical fertilizer
the crop yields measured at harvest were also very similar

these tests provide us with a genuine opportunity to develop the circular economy based on
returning nutrients to the soil to support the growing of barley says toni ylinenluopa
development manager at the koskenkorva plant

the promising results mean that the fertilizer tests will continue a new test field was already
established in fall 2015 and testing will continue in 2016 the tests conducted in the coming
years will provide further information on the effects of the ash fertilizer on the soil crop yield and
quality

aiming to optimize the product life cycle
altias material efficiency extends from the raw materials used in
manufacturing and production processes to the packaging transport and
storage of products
the aim of altias development efforts in the area of material efficiency is to achieve an optimized
manufacturing process packaging is necessary for protecting the product and reducing wastage
but the excessive use of packaging materials should be avoided the design of packaging takes
into account the environmental attributes and recyclability of the materials used

most of the time costefficiency and environmental friendliness go hand in hand says piia
soininentengvall packaging development manager at altia

the development of material efficiency is part of the value improvement project launched at the
beginning of 2015 the first phase of which will continue until the end of 2016 the project
covers all of altias business operations

the aim is to achieve significant savings in the use of materials while improving production
efficiency and inventory turnover by creating more modular packaging solutions centralizing
purchasing and harmonizing the use of packaging materials this involves cooperation both
within the organization and with external partners such as the suppliers of packaging materials
says mila kuvaja sourcing and packaging development manager at altia

one concrete example of these optimization efforts is the harmonization of product structures
the company has cut back on features such as engraved and embossed logos and texts on bottle
molds as harmonizing packaging leads to a significant reduction in wasted materials

for baginbox wine packaging altia has introduced laser printing at the rajamäki plant the
packaging markings are left blank for example where the vintage is indicated and the
information is only printed on the package when it is used this avoids having to discard the
cardboard packaging of baginbox wines when a new vintage is introduced or when the alcohol
content changes which reduces the amount of cardboard wasted




78

altias responsibility report 2015



comprehensive development efforts
altia has taken a longterm approach to the development of material efficiency the shift from
glass bottles to pet bottles which are approximately 90 percent lighter than glass began
gradually in 2012 and is still ongoing

the rajamäki plant has also switched from aluminum closures to plastic closures for plastic
bottles following this change plastic closures are used for 955 percent of our pet bottles
using a plastic closures for a plastic bottle means better recyclability soininentengvall explains

the manner in which the product is packed and transported is also significant

we have optimized the amount and structure of plastic glass and corrugated board in our
products to minimize empty space this means we can transport larger shipments and minimize
traffic emissions soininentengvall adds

protecting the baltic sea and other
waterways by making a bsag
commitment
in may 2015 altia signed the baltic sea action group commitment to
mark its dedication to even broader protection of the baltic sea and
other waterways the focus of the commitment is on environmentally
friendly and highquality agriculture
altias operations have a very substantial impact on the baltic sea and other waterways altia
purchases grain from contract farmers who cultivate some 50000 hectares of land the lower the
amount of nutrient emissions from farms to waterways the better says riku venhola senior
advisor at bsag

according to venhola the 1500 finnish farmers with whom altia cooperates in the area of grain
purchasing are the key to realizing the commitment made by the company

if the farmers experiences of environmentally friendly agriculture are positive the information
will spread quickly its also important to keep in mind that altias operations affect the food
supply chain as a whole from farmers to producers retailers and ultimately consumers
venhola adds

bsag is an independent foundation focused on the protection of the baltic sea it works with
businesses public officials policymakers and farmers

productive and efficient agriculture
according to kari kiltilä the man responsible for altias grain purchasing the bsag
commitment represents a sensible step forwardfrom the perspectives of all parties
concernedin promoting sustainable agriculture

in practice this means that altia encourages farmers to maximize the efficiency of their farming
operations use production inputs sensibly as well as monitor plant populations during the




80

altias responsibility report 2015



growth season and ensure their viability

the commitment does not restrict agricultural activity instead it promotes efficient and more
environmentally friendly production we help farmers in areas such as performing plotspecific
nutrient balance calculations to determine the amount of nutrients introduced to fields through
the use of fertilizers and the amount of nutrients removed during the harvest kiltilä explains

altia also informs the farmers of the nitrogen and phosphorus content of barley delivered to the
koskenkorva plant farmers can then utilize this information in their nutrient calculations the
larger the crop yield of a field the more efficiently the plants tie up nutrients in the harvested
crops if the nutrients are left in the soil they will be washed off into waterways causing
eutrophication

a high yield of goodquality crops and environmentally friendly farming go hand in hand this
is good for business it also means that the farming operations are environmentally friendly
kiltilä concludes

leadership employee communications and competence development

dismissals were not avoided in 2015 due to the discontinuation of contract production at
svendborg statutory negotiations were conducted in denmark in 2015 a total of 26
employees were dismissed and outplacement services were offered to them

one of the key objectives related to personnel in 2015 was improving communications related
to strategy communication was developed both at the company level and locally all of our
personnel also participated in discussing ideas on what altias new purpose means in practice
for our business

sickness absence and accident frequency targets 67 percent were implemented in 2015 the
indicators for sickness absences and accident frequency remained largely unchanged from 2014

altia revised its performancebased bonus scheme in 2015 the starting point for the
development effort was to create a more incentivizing model that would allow employees to
more directly influence the size of the bonus through their performance in addition to
financial rewards altia also strives to develop other forms of incentives

responsible leadership
setting a common direction
one of the key objectives related to personnel in 2015 was improving communications related
to strategy this was clearly highlighted in the personnel survey conducted early in the year

communications were improved in many ways including regular reviews by the ceo that all
members of personnel are invited to participate in either in person or virtually the events are
also recorded to allow employees to watch them at a convenient time

local communications were also an important focus area the rajamäki plant for example
held quarterly reviews by the plant manager that employees were invited to attend and the
plant management has also organized monthly events in the various departments of the plant
altia also introduced yammer as a new communications platform to encourage employees to
share their views and best practices

the implementation of strategy was communicated to employees on a monthly basis by
updating the results of key indicators on the company intranet one of the indicators is the
employee pulse which measures employee perceptions regarding internal communications
the personnel pulse showed strong positive development during the year

late in the year altia employees worked to come up with new ideas to develop operations
towards making the companys business operations even more meaningful this was achieved
by a virtual tool that gave employees the opportunity to post their own ideas as well as
comment and evaluate ideas posted by their colleagues

the measures led to positive changes as the results of the altia tasting employee survey
conducted late in the year improved by six percentage points with higher scores for all 58
questions

managerial work requires continuous learning
the leadership principles defined in late 2014 were implemented in the company in several
ways including discussing them in management teams to determine how to put them into




85

altias responsibility report 2015



practice in each organization

the leadership principles were also incorporated into development discussion practices each
line manager addresses the management principles when holding discussions with their
respective managers regarding managerial work and its development

a line manager training program was implemented in spring 2015 with managers from various
operating countries participating in the program the program was largely based on altias
leadership principles

every member of altias personnel regularly participates in development discussions the
development discussions for whitecollar employees include two meetings during the year and
for bluecollar employees there is one meeting annually at the development discussions a
personal development plan is created for each employee that defines the most significant
development measures with regard to competence development and motivation

leadership principles
show direction
     explore future possibilities and opportunities in the business

responsibility for employee wellbeing
actions to prevent sickness absences and accidents
altias occupational health and safety system has been certified in accordance with the ohsas
180012007 standard the certificate covers the koskenkorva plant the rajamäki alcoholic
beverage plant and the technical ethanol business operations as well as the operations of the
head office in helsinki

the objectives of the system include the reduction of sickness absence rates and the number of
absences caused by accidents in order to achieve these objectives a total of 42 actions have
been determined for the various locations and 28 of these 67 percent were implemented in
2015

action plans have also been created for operating locations that are not within the scope of
certification namely the tabasalu plant and logistic centers with the exception of cognac the
programs include for example improving ergonomics and communication regarding safety
and hygiene issues improving work efficiency with the new shift model increasing the safety of
forklift traffic emphasizing the use of personal protective equipment and speeding up the
return from sick leave through the active use of the early support model

the accident frequency and sickness absence rates are monitored in all of altias operating
countries with the exception of france in 2015 the sickness absence rate was 30 percent
2014 30 percent the logistics center in sweden had the highest rate 49 percent while the
office in denmark had the lowest 03 percent the accident frequency for accidents
requiring at least one day of absence was 12 2014 12

as in the previous year the rajamäki plant had the highest number of accidents the rajamäki
plant continued to develop the identification of hazards and risks as well as implement
immediate corrective measures a few isolated accidents occurred in other production locations
koskenkorva svendborg tabasalu and the swedish logistics center in brunna there were
no fatal workrelated accidents in 2015

remuneration and incentives support the strategy
altia revised its performancebased bonus program in 2015 the starting point for the
development effort was to create a more incentivizing model that would allow employees to
more directly influence the size of the bonus through their performance

performancebased bonuses are paid once a year or more often in the form of annual result
bonuses or sales bonuses bluecollar employees are part of a production bonus scheme all
personnel except those in short fixedterm employment relationships are included in the
performancebased bonus scheme the objectives of the performancebased bonuses are to
support the implementation of strategy reward personnel for good results and share altias
financial success

in addition to financial rewards altia also strives to develop other forms of incentives these
include praise and positive feedback celebrating accomplishments sharing best practices
including key talents in strategy and development work as well as offering small tokens of
appreciation in recognition of jobs well done

a good line manager is genuinely
concerned about employees
the altia plant in rajamäki has implemented altias leadership
principles show direction support success and ensure
implementation  in daytoday operations according to plant manager
janne peltoniemi the most important thing for a line manager is to be
genuine and to ensure that the personnel are committed to shared goals
the altia plant in rajamäki nurmijärvi in finland is the workplace of some 250 employees
most of whom work on the factorys various production lines and in the logistics center the
current organization at the rajamäki plant has only been in place for about a year and the plants
operating methods have been revised to a significant extent in recent times

altias new leadership principles have served as a guideline in this process of renewal

the leadership principles are the cornerstones of our line management and leadership we have
set challenging and clear targets the achievement of which is regularly monitored this also
means that we want to strengthen our employer image and take more pride in our work says
janne peltoniemi plant manager at the rajamäki plant

patronage and lowering thresholds
the new leadership principles have been translated to the plants own language and they are
also included in development discussions with personnel peltoniemi points out that the
leadership principles must be reflected in all employees

the aim of all development efforts at the rajamäki plant is to engage people from different areas
of the organization

we want to create a more open and interactive work community we also want to give everyone
the chance to participate in the development of our management and development in general
peltoniemi explains




95

altias responsibility report 2015



the rajamäki plant has also seen strong cooperation in the implementation of new operating
methods the development of line management for example has been geared towards
eliminating psychological barriers between different levels of the organization

we have also introduced a patronage initiative which involves members of the management
team acting as patrons for specific bottling lines this means that they have regular weekly
meetings with the employees working on the bottling line assigned to them it also gives them the
opportunity to receive firsthand feedback from the employees peltoniemi says

communication at the rajamäki plant has also been improved by using the yammer platform
the factory has the most active yammer group in the entire altia organization peltoniemi says
good communication is key to having a transparent and open organization

a good line manager is genuinely concerned about employees no matter how many decisions
we make at the management level success always comes down to the commitment of the
personnel in my world the key is to focus on individual employees peltoniemi concludes


     the management culture here at the rajamäki plant is somewhat burdened by
     history but the situation has improved significantly over the years in the logistics
     organization i work in good line management depends on highly competent
     leadership i appreciate the current approach to management which involves a strong
     focus on people skills

     as an employee i feel that i have the opportunity to generate discussion and influence
     my work i would like to see even more openness and justified decisionmaking as
     transparency makes it easier to understand and accept changes with regard to
     internal communication i would like to see summaries of information at present
     important messages sometimes end up being fragmented across multiple channels

     markus hälikkä production controller logistics

     i have worked at the rajamäki plant for ten years i am pleased with the current
     management culture here changes are not made without listening to the employees
     opinions new decisions are always discussed with those at the factory floor level
     corrective adjustments are also made where necessary




96

altias responsibility report 2015



     i am one of four team leaders in the supplies department team which consists of
     about twenty employees right now i am feeling a little uncertainty with regard to the
     division of responsibilities as the organizational changes implemented a year ago left
     our team with less direct managerial supervision this creates a certain sense of
     detachment and team leaders now have to look into matters that should be handled
     by a line manager we have talked about this at length with the management in recent
     times for example with regard to occupational safety i am confident that this issue
     will be discussed at the management level and sorted out soon

     piritta mononen team leader

     in my opinion the supervision of work at the rajamäki plant needs to be easygoing
     firm and realistic i work on the production line for baginbox wines i deal with my
     line managers almost every day and sometimes i also work with the managers
     responsible for bottling and maintenance my experience is that our supervisors and
     managers are very open to ideas and suggestions i can talk to them in an honest and
     straightforward manner so i am very pleased with things overall

     i will take up the position of team leader myself in january 2016 one improvement i
     would like to see is some type of orientation training for new employees with regard
     to the operating methods and framework of supervisory and managerial work at the
     rajamäki plant

koskenkorva switches to 12hour shifts
altias koskenkorva plant implemented a 12hour shift work model in
may 2015 the new system has been met with 100 percent positive
feedback we have a lot of young fathers working at the plant and the
longer stretches of time off make a big difference in arranging family life
says plant manager antti snellman
the first request to revamp the shift work model came from koskenkorva employees back in
2011 the previous model was the traditional threeshift model consisting of eighthour shifts

our employees wanted to have more time for their hobbies and achieve a better balance between
work and family life explains plant manager antti snellman

the initiative led to a comprehensive change process that took four years it began with
establishing a working group that visited other companies for example in the process industry
or those working in food and energy to learn more about alternative approaches to shift work

the employees in the working group became interested in the 12hour model it involves
employees working two morning shifts from 6 am to 6 pm followed by one day off the
employees then work two night shifts from 6 pm to 6 am followed by six days off

after receiving the green light from occupational health services the employers federation and
the employee union we started a oneyear pilot in may 2014 all of the feedback we received
during and after the oneyear pilot was positive not a single employee wanted to go back to the
old model also worth noting is that sicknessrelated absences declined by 50 percent after the
change snellman adds

altia has about 50 employees at the koskenkorva plant with approximately half of them working
as operators under the shift work model the majority of them work in the control room
monitoring plant processes on computer terminals

there is plenty to do throughout the day but it is not physically strenuous work says process
controller antti latvahirvelä

altias responsibility report 2015



i get to spend more time at home with the kids we dont need to worry about daycare
arrangements and we know my work schedule until the end of the year if i want some variation
i can trade shifts with my colleagues he adds

fellow process controller sami kokko echoes his colleagues views

i wouldnt change this new model for anything this is the best shift model i can imagine i have
much more free time than i did under the old model and the 12hour workdays dont feel
different than the old 8hour workdays did kokko says

finland needs neutral and factbased
discussion on alcohol
kristiina hannula the director of ehyt  finnish association for
substance abuse prevention  would like to see the public discussion
on alcohol become less emotional and more factbased this could
make alcohol a neutral topic of discussion in finland

how would you describe the current discussion on alcohol in our society
the public discussion on alcohol in finland is highly emotional and sometimes aggravated
the participants tend to put words in each others mouths public health organizations for
instance are assumed to promote total abstinence while we in the ngo sector talk about the
alcohol industry from our perspective the discussion should be based on genuinely listening to
the other parties words rather than on making assumptions this would support more effective
interaction between the various parties involved

how would you like the discussion on alcohol to develop
i would like to see a balanced discussion on alcohol along with a balanced alcohol policy and a
balanced drinking culture alcohol should be discussed in a neutral manner even though
everyone has emotional experiences related to it alcohol should be discussed dispassionately to
highlight its advantages and disadvantages in a balanced way

in your opinion can cooperation between alcohol industry operators and
ngos influence the prevailing discussion on alcohol and drinking
culture
it certainly can but cooperation must be based on genuine and honest interaction at ehyt
we have very positive experiences from our cooperation with microbreweries and wine
enthusiasts




101

altias responsibility report 2015



in your view what is the most important aspect with regard to altias
responsibility
altias operations are in good shape with regard to responsibility as long as communications are
based on facts altias responsibility as an industry operator also includes accepting that certain
decisions may be positive for the alcohol industry but not beneficial to the finnish economy as
a whole and vice versa i think it would be responsible to put that into words somehow altia
naturally uses its marketing activities to sell its products and thats fine but the messages it
communicates must not be misleading

what kind of cooperation would you like to have with altia regarding
responsibility
above all i would like the cooperation to be balanced which is something i have highlighted
in all discussions on alcohol in future cooperation between altia and ehyt could involve
joint events for example this type of cooperation would require that we are an equal partner
with altia and both sides would have to make an equal contribution to the financing of any
joint events

the finnish association for substance abuse prevention ehyt operates throughout finland and
with the entire finnish population to promote a healthy lifestyle in addition to the prevention of
alcohol tobacco and drug abuse ehyt promotes the prevention of the negative impacts of gaming
and gambling ehyt also coordinates the national network of ngos operating in the area of
substance abuse prevention which is comprised of 40 of finlands most significant substance abuse
prevention associations wwwehytfi

a consumers wish for altia promote a
drinking culture based on moderation
as a consumer i want to believe that companies do everything they
can to operate in a responsible manner even though aspects such as
monitoring the subcontracting chain can be difficult at times says
tommi koivisto author of the isyyspakkaus paternity package blog

what does corporate responsibility mean to you as a consumer
i think corporate responsibility is an important issue but i also think that individual consumers
dont always understand what responsibility means in practice when im buying a product or
service thinking about the responsibility of the company behind it is not always the first thing
on my mind however if it later becomes apparent that the company in question has been
found to have conducted its business in an unethical manner i will no longer buy their
products or services conversely it pleases me to find out that a company ive supported has
received praise or awards for its ethical conduct

do corporate responsibility issues affect your consumption behavior
most of my purchase decisions are based on needs as a consumer i want to believe that
companies do everything they can to operate in a responsible manner even though aspects such
as monitoring the subcontracting chain can be difficult at times when it comes to clothing i
value items that are produced from certified organic cotton as well as clothing manufacturers
that look after the rights of their employees in the countries their clothes are produced in
when im choosing a wine i usually check whether it has been produced organically for
example if theres a new range of wines out i tend to go for the one thats organic

what do you believe consumers will expect from companies in the future
with regard to responsibility
it seems to me that interest in responsibility issues has increased substantially in recent times
for instance ive read news about the clothing industry indicating that workers in developing
countries suffer from poor working conditions nevertheless i dont believe that consumers




103

altias responsibility report 2015



will read through corporate responsibility reports before each purchase decision they make in
the future

in your view what is the most important aspect with regard to altias
responsibility
altia could take a stronger role in promoting a drinking culture based on moderation finnish
society suffers from many alcoholrelated problems and altia could respond to this in the
companys operations in my opinion finnish society should move towards enjoying high
quality alcoholic beverages in moderation rather than drinking excessive quantities

message to altia
please continue to provide a diverse selection of products i hope you will continue to update
your product range and keep it interesting

the important thing to me as a farmer is
that altia wants to be a reliable and
competitive grain buyer
the contract farmers that supply altia with grain are essential for the
companys business according to mäntsäläbased farmer silja vuori
altias role as a nationally significant user of grain means that ensuring
the success of farmers the agricultural sector and the rural areas of
finland is an important aspect of the companys responsibility

what role does responsibility play in the work of a farmer
responsibility means that the products sold by farms to industry are appropriate in terms of
quality and that they meet the buyers needs are delivered as promised and that their
production satisfies both general requirements and the customers specifications

for a farmer responsibility means managing the farm in such a way that it functions well and is
successful in the long term a responsible farmer looks after the farm on the principle that the
farm is inherited from the previous generation and borrowed from the next generation
responsibility in farming operations means that the condition of the soil improves working
methods are enhanced and the farms operations and finances develop favorably

responsibility also means that substances such as fertilizers and pesticides are used
appropriately and with care altia helps farmers in this regard by providing reports on the
amounts of nutrients removed from the fields during harvest this is one example of how altia
helps farmers make more efficient use of their resources and minimize the negative
environmental impacts of their operations this kind of environmental responsibility is
something that todays society is expecting from farmers to a greater extent than before

what are your expectations regarding altias responsibility efforts going
forward
i hope that altia will continue to develop its business and production operations to remain the




109

altias responsibility report 2015



first choice for its customers by operating efficiently and finding good markets for its products
altia can continue to be a good and reliable contractual partner for farmers and the grain trade
in the future

as a company altia determines what areas of responsibility it emphasizes i hope that as a
responsible company it will continue to give due consideration to farmers as contractual
partners

in your view what is the most important aspect with regard to altias
responsibility
the important thing to me as a farmer is that altia wants to be a reliable and competitive grain
buyer i hope that altia will define cooperation with farmers as part of its responsibility altias
role as a nationally significant user of grain means that ensuring the success of farmers the
agricultural sector and the rural areas of finland is an important aspect of the companys
responsibility

what kind of cooperation would you like to have with altia regarding
responsibility
i would like altia to communicate information to farmers on hopes and needs the company
and its customers have with regard to responsibility they can also communicate information
to farmers based on laboratory analyses which is something they have already done i believe
that this will also help altia source better raw materials at the same time altia can help
farmers select the right varietals and methods to achieve the best possible results

message to altia
as a major grain purchaser altia has the opportunity to influence trading practices and pricing
in the finnish grain market developing new operating models and utilizing the storage
capacity of farms for example can benefit both farmers and altia they should also promote
the broad use of increasingly diverse price fixing mechanisms and grain varietals that suit their
purposes to the greatest possible extent
