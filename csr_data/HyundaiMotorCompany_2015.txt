           hyundai continually innovates to provide people with more convenient
               and safer mobility selfdriving cars with perfect safety are
                        the future of automobiles and a target for

                 i devote myself to research in developing cars with the aim of caring for the
                  family the framework of our research is based on selfdriving cars that
                  are capable of selfparking we also emphasize the family  what if a couple
                  who both have jobs cannot pick their kid up after school because of busy
                  work schedules it would be so nice to have a helper car in that situation
                  i think the truly selfdriving car will reflect the drivers love for his or her
                  family and desire to protect them and get them to their destination safely
                  this is the future for mobility that im working on

question 1                                          answer

when will autonomous driving                        autonomous driving technology is rooted in adas technologies such as
                                                    autonomous emergency braking lane keeping assist and parking assist
technology be commercialized
                                                    system have been applied to hyundais vehicles this shows that some
                                                    autonomous driving technology has already been commercialized
                                                    the commercialization of a completely autonomous driving system that
                                                    does not require a driver may rely more on laws and changes in the
                                                    social system than any technical difficulties

question 2
                                                    an authoritative interpretation of relevant laws is needed before autonomous
is it legal to drive a selfdriving vehicle
                                                    driving technology can be fully commercialized it is possible from a technical
on the road can i sit in the back                  standpoint to sit in the back seat but legal and social expectations need to
seat what happens if there is an                   be managed first for example autonomous driving can only really be fully
                                                    commercialized if there is a system in place to enable the driver to drive the
obstacle while driving autonomously                vehicle in an emergency

                                                    selfdriving cars handle obstacles in the same way a driver does they detect
                                                    the location and movement of obstacles using a camera or sensor equivalent
                                                    to the human eye based on what they see the car could then either
                                                    decelerate or change directions by controlling its brakes accelerator and

question 3                                          answer

how advanced is hyundais autonomous                carmakers including hyundai are working on creating selfdriving technology
                                                    not unmanned vehicles our direction of development is different from
driving technology compared to that of
                                                    that of it companies  for instance it companies develop systems using
other companies                                    sensors or it technology whereas we aim to apply our new technology in
                                                    mass production we therefore focus on developing technology to be used in
                                                    sensors and vehicle systems that can be fully commercialized and must also
                                                    ensure their reliability and durability it is thus quite hard to make a straight

add performance to efficiency  sonata hybrid
hybrid cars are often perceived as being ecofriendly and economical but
relatively low in performance hyundai has developed ecofriendly cars with both
superior fuel efficiency and performance opening a new chapter for hybrids
the new sonata hybrid is fitted with both a direct fuel injection 20 gdi hybrid
engine with 156 horsepower and an electric motor with 51 horsepower this model
has excellent driving performance and will pave the way for the development of
better and more exciting ecofriendly vehicles

      company plans to develop safe recycling technology for             therefore in order to reduce the amount of water consumed
      the hybrid and electric vehicles of the future                    during painting and the overall amount of wastewater created
                                                                         in the factory a water recycling system reduces the quantity
