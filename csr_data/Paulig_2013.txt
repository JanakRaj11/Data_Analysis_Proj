procurement
demand for coffee outstripping production the predominance of small coffee plantations climate change and growing
consumer interest in the conditions in which coffee is produced are challenges to players in the coffee chain in 2012
paulig took part in a number of projects to improve coffee production in the countries of origin developments in coffee
traceability are monitored by paulig with countryspecific spot checks which cover the bulk of green coffee purchases


kerstin linne knows the challenges
faced by coffeegrowers
german coffeesector expert kerstin linne knows the
challenges climate change presents to coffeegrowers from
start to finish linne shuttles between coffee countries of
origin like brazil guatemala indonesia or kenya training
coffeegrowers to adapt to accelerating climate change in her
work she encounters both prejudice and enthusiasm

kerstin linne says that coffeegrowers are aware of the effects
that climate change is already having on their plantations
they are aware of what is happening on their fields how               in october 2010 kerstin visited kenya where the first training
much its rained whether theres enough water whether its            sessions for coffeegrowers had been held earlier the courses had led
usable and for example how the coffee bushes flowering has           to a lot of positive developments in cultivation practices
gone on the other hand the growers lack the latest scientific
                                                                        level the uncertainty doesnt attract them one project
research data and forecasts of climate change its my job to

put together daily observations with existing facts and to help
                                                                        is a climate project started in 2011 by paulig and five other
them to understand how and why what they do has to change
                                                                        european companies in the coffee sector together with the
kerstin says its great to see time after time how motivated
                                                                        german development cooperation organisation giz entitled

them giving up in the face of challenges is not an alternative
she comments
                                                                        kerstin hasnt picked an easy job as nothing is certain with

almost half the year on the road for coffee
                                                                        in trouble as their capacity for adapting to it is slight however
                                                                        you measure it its very hard for growers to get training and
kerstin linne took her mba in economics of developing                   financial backing for their work kerstin reports
countries in bremen and mexico she has written numerous
articles and publications about sustainable development
today she travels around the world on behalf of her own
company to work for the cause of climate change for nearly
half the year kerstin gives talks consults and meets people
in the coffee business and growers trying to find common
ground between them experiences of the growers everyday
lives should be used on international projects more one of my
most important missions is to act as a voice for growers with
the producers and industry the growers know best what they
need and the kind of problems they have to cope with points
out linne who also visited finland in october to attend the
paulig coffee seminar

kerstin reckons there are plenty of challenges and not all
needs can be met its hard to get financial backers along             kerstin addressed brazilian
onto projects because scientific information about the impact           coffeegrowers on the effects
                                                                                of climate change in
of climate change on coffee cultivation is on the forecast
                                                                                      autumn 2011

                                                                    5

cultural differences and friendship

working in the coffee countries of origin like kenya is
according to kerstin a challenge because of cultural
differences and the language barrier although the official
national languages are english and swahili a total of 42 local
languages are spoken there

its understandable that growers want to use their own mother
tongue for communication so you need an interpreter to help
at meetings once youve made contact through discussion
suspicions about this young foreign womans ability to be
helpful usually fade away many people feel they genuinely
benefit from information and guidance and they even want to
make friends with me for instance it isnt unknown for me to
be invited to the family home for a meal it feels really great to
get so much trust and this is one of the jobs more rewarding
sides kerstin tells us

almost twothirds of the worlds coffee comes from small
plantations of less than two hectares in area since
smallholders success in their work cannot be taken for granted
in regions afflicted by climate change kerstin hopes that               making a difference to climate change starts with practical action a more energy
consumers will also not take their morning cup of coffee for             efficient stove installed in a mexican coffeegrowers kitchen needs less firewood thus
granted for most producers coffee is their only source of             reducing the felling of forest trees in the cultivation area
income and they do an enormous amount of work every day so
that we get coffee to enjoy kerstin points out

coffee and climate helps growers to adapt to climate change
global warming may have longterm impacts on the
future of the coffee sector as with other industries rising
temperatures drought and torrential rainfall in some
regions have already locally impacted cultivation and
reduced harvests

coffee bushes become more susceptible to diseases in
a damper and warmer climate than they are used to a
considerable proportion of coffee is produced by smallholders
with little opportunity to modernise their operations or move
their plantations to more favourable areas climate change is
already affecting the price and availability of green coffee to
some extent

to help small coffee growers to adjust six european coffee
enterprises and the german development cooperation
organisation giz started a joint climate project in the beginning
of 2011 entitled coffee  climate from finland paulig is a
participant

in the coffee  climate project practical tools are developed            the work has been started by charting the initial situation in
for growers by combining research data on climate change                  brazil progress was made to the field work stage at the end of
with proven good cultivation practices economic support                  2011 and in tanzania practical work got under way in february
systems are also developed the pilot countries in the climate            2012 the experience gained from them will be used when the

pauligs purchases of certified coffee grades tonnes

responsibilitylabelled green coffee accounts for some 10 of global output and demand is growing the manufacturing of
products with responsibilitylabelled ingredients is sometimes challenging because of the quality and scarcity of the supply of
raw materials of the coffee purchased by paulig in 2012 roughly 65 was certified for responsibility




trend in traceability

paulig systematically develops the traceability of all the coffee it purchases in cooperation with its trading partners  of the
coffee purchased by paulig in 2011 100 could be traced back to the exporters in the countries of origin 88 to the coops
and processing plants and 46 to the coffee plantations or plantations cooperatives

personnel
pauligs coffee division provides jobs for nearly 500 people in seven different countries in spring 2012 paulig launched
new values simultaneously throughout the group the attainment of personnel responsibility is measured in all group
units by means of the broadbased biennial tellus survey the latest poll was carried out in autumn 2012 and its results
showed particular improvement in supervisory work with continuing training and leadership development


promises make the values visible
marketing manager risto kalsta considers the shared
values to be an immense resource and a springboard
for doing everything
its important for the values to be clear and practical and that
they embody doing things i am very pleased with the way the
values have rolled out and entered everyday life they are plain
to see people mention them everyone remembers them and
their importance deepens all the time

the fivestrong team that risto heads made promises together
for the new values last spring we opened the values as
handson deeds meaning what each value signifies in our
teams way of working in the course of the year weve
returned to the promises and weve looked at how theyve been
implemented in practice risto reports




so what are the value propositions of ristos team
stay curious
we decided to break the mould this means that we expose                 make things better as a supervisor i feel that getting feedback
our thoughts and ideas boldly both within the team and with             is the most important way to upgrade my own actions since
others complete outsiders we actively seek new perspectives            the beginning of 2013 ive kept a feedback journal in which i
and were open to criticism we ask for opinions and we spar             record all the feedback ive received and given it also makes
over ideas at an early stage we make things as concrete as              it easy to see where progress has been made
possible we order experimental layouts we visualise ideas
model packages and advertisements we make collages and                  grow together
draw ideas on paper  and then of course we talk about                 we admit that we need help you definitely dont need to
them everyone sees ideas in their own way and thats why               get through on your own when you cant make headway
its important to illustrate them this way we can bring out their       its important to say it out loud to a friend the other person
best sides and combine them                                             doesnt need to have a readymade solution because often
                                                                         just thinking things over aloud and a few good questions will
strive for excellence                                                    help to solve a problem also the final result is usually better
we invite feedback we want there to be a low threshold to               when two people think through an issue over again all that
giving and getting feedback in our team feedback is part of             this takes is for us to have a spare moment when someone
the working day and daily discussion the aim of which is to             asks for it




                                                                     8

mentoring boosts all stages of a career
the mentoring program got started in spring 2012 five pairs took part in the pilot
after good experiences mentoring became a permanent addition to pauligs training
and wellbeing package veterans of the pilot mia katko and riitta helaniemi see
many advantages in mentoring
mia who has worked as assistant           a long time as group treasurer and
controller for the coffee division         latterly as the group director of risk
since autumn 2010 says that the           management mentoring was familiar
period helped her particularly to map      to riitta for example from her time at
out her personal career path the         the aalto university where she has
mentoring shook me into thinking in a      supported students in plotting their own
new way and to see my career over          careers
a longer time span at the same time
my understanding deepened of the           its interesting to meet new people and
company and of the opportunities           their work it opens up your own view of
afforded by the corporate group doing     things and as a plus you get a pleasant
a swot analysis of myself was also a       sense of helping others also i think
very useful experience                   its important to pass on the knowledge     riitta and mia believe mentoring is rewarding for
                                           and expertise youve accumulated          both parties in all stages of working life
mias mentor riitta has worked for         riitta notes
paulig for around twenty years for



good for all
with mentoring you can transfer tacit     both mia and riitta warmly recommend
information for example between          mentoring to all irrespective of job
coworkers and you can help younger       description or length of service the
people in career planning says paulig    main this is to be committed to working
group hrd manager marika holstein         together mentoring helps you to see
here the mentoring period involves a     your own situation here and now as
whole raft of gatherings and thematic      well as in several years from today i
discussions with your partner the kick   was always full of enthusiasm after the
off covers things like what mentoring is   meetings the discussion really gave
and what it isnt                        me a lot of new energy mia says

this is really important so that          often a mentor is found for a young
everyone comes to the program with         person within the same company for
the right expectations mentoring is       people who have been on the job for
confidential and equal a mentor is not    a longer time talking with someone
a psychologist or a representative of      from outside the company can provide
the employer he or she should not         refreshing new perspectives mentoring      the mentoring program and ready themes structure
direct a partner but help them to grasp    partners dont necessarily need to have     the discussion and make the work targetoriented
their personal strengths by listening     known each other before the situation
asking questions and bringing out their    is best when they begin to get to know      particular in times of choosing in ones
own experiences and observations          each other riitta adds commenting        working life its useful to be able to talk
although the focus is on work issues      that collaboration sometimes continues      confidentially with someone who knows
the best combination comes when you        after the actual mentoring period          the history of your career path
really get to know each other and can
chat to a moderate extent about private
things as well  these also affect your
work riitta points out

business
a good financial result permits longterm business development and investments a crucial factor if paulig is to thrive is
success in green coffee procurement both financially and in terms of quality after prices spiked in 2011 the price of coffee
encountered heavy downward pressure in 2012 there have been rapid fluctuations in the price of coffee in a short period
which has brought uncertainty to the market however pauligs financial result remained on a steady basis and its market
position held strong


2012 steady trend continued
the net sales of pauligs coffee division fell by 105
per cent on the previous year to roughly 2979 million
euros the change in net sales was mostly due to a fall
in the price of green coffee the target for earnings was
overachieved however

success in purchasing green coffee is crucial to pauligs
achievements both financially and in terms of quality green
coffee accounts for 90 of all procurement the price of green
coffee and the currency markets demand constant vigilance
other expense items are more easily predictable in 2012 the
trend in the price of green coffee was downwards until the late
summer after which it went into a new upswing

pauligs market position remained strong in all the business
areas in finland paulig is still the clear market leader and the
recognised brands kept their huge popularity among finns in
the course of last year we improved profitability in russia and
the other cis states as well as in the baltic countries where
paulig is also the market leader in terms of value in russia
the trend in market share progressed according to plan and
we rose to second place for roasted coffee in two large cities
most of the brands sold in russia can now be made at the
new roastery in tver the uptime rate of which has taken a
positive track after initial challenges

investments during 2012 were mostly in replacements
the number of personnel increased in russia but in other
countries there was no change in the workforce




last year was filled with factors of uncertainty from the price of coffee and usdeur exchange rate to the
macroeconomic fundamentals however our company was able to respond to these challenges and operational
result remained at a satisfactory level our operations are also on a steady basis with an eye to the future

the price of coffee is due
to many factors
after peaking in 2011 there was strong downward
pressure on the price of coffee in 2012 this was
influenced by improved harvest prospects and expansion
in coffee production the two biggest producer countries
brazil and vietnam yielded large harvests
there have been rapid fluctuations in the coffee price in the
short term which has brought uncertainty to the market last
year the price of coffee varied on the commodity exchange
from 143 to 237 cents usd a pound roughly 454 grams
the price sensitivity was boosted in addition to variations in
harvests by global economic conditions rising demand in
developing and coffeeproducing countries and investors
interest in coffee the downward price trend has been forecast
to continue in the first half of 2013 although in the long term
the price of coffee is expected to rally

the price of coffee is set on the coffee exchanges of new                  weather conditions and climate change have increased
york and london for paulig the new york exchange is                      uncertainty over harvests unexpected changes in the weather
more important as roughly 98 per cent of pauligs purchases               have put most pressure on the topquality raw materials that
are arabica coffee which is quoted in new york a bonus is                paulig buys for which the balance of demand and supply

developing countries such as china and india growing                      coffee has a direct effect on growers income and their ability
demand is causing big changes in the coffee market it can be              to support their families with living standards rising in the
expected that demand for green coffee will grow faster than                countries of origin labourintensive coffee cultivation will only
production for production to meet the rising consumption                 be an attractive livelihood if the price for coffee is reasonable
the cultivation of coffee must be increased or a better yield will         the remuneration paid for the product affects the growers

if the price of green coffee on the exchange falls too low coffee cultivation will no longer
be an attractive livelihood in the countries of origin afflicted by climate change

environment
in the management of environmental matters our cornerstone is the international iso 14001 environmental standard
our roasteries represent stateoftheart technology and ecological thinking an example of which is that no mixed waste at
all is any longer generated by the production process in normal situations most waste is reused for energy and the amount
of this was reduced from the 2011 figure by no less than 251 tonnes through intensified sorting as a result of using
thinner packaging laminate on the biggest product juhla mokka blend coffee the consumption of material was reduced by
30000 kilos on the previous year thanks to this the carbon dioxide emissions of the packaging production process were
reduced by roughly 110 tonnes


all of pauligs waste gets a new lease of life
in 2012 paulig generated a total of 585 tonnes of waste as recently as the beginning of the 21st century most of the roasterys
waste ended up in a landfill but today no mixed waste at all emerges from the production process in normal conditions
most of the waste is used for producing energy and since 2011 the amount of this has been reduced by no less than 251
tonnes through streamlined sorting currently most of the waste is biomass formed in different stages of manufacturing
a considerable part of the waste generated consists of various types of plastic and board which are also sent for recycling




in 2012 paulig generated 308 tonnes of energy waste this          in 2012 the various stages of pauligs production process
was comprised of for example wood pallets laminate chaff        produced 184 tonnes of organic waste the dust from green
plastic packagings and wet or dirty paper and board the           coffee is collected for composting and the coffee chaff resulting
energy waste compressor shown in the picture compacts               from roasting is compressed into briquettes a small quantity of
waste for onward transport by a waste disposal company to be        organic waste also results from the coffee packaging process
recycled in energy production                                      when the coffee product for packaging is changed for another on
                                                                    a production line the coffee remaining in the pipeline has to be
                                                                    removed to prevent mixing of coffee products with different roast
                                                                    levels for example organic waste is returned to the soil

                                                               15

                           the quantity of waste is declining
                           rapidly as new uses are found for
                           individual materials paulig takes in
                           nearly 3000 container loads of coffee
                           each year each incoming container
                           has the coffee beans packaged in thick
                           plastic these giant sacks are collected
                           and fed into a plastic compressor in the
                           roasterys yard in 2012 236 tonnes of
                           this waste was generated and recycled
                           into new plastic




                           paulig also recycles its office waste
                           the offices have separate collection
                           bins for energy waste wastepaper
                           office paper papers for destruction
                           and board organic waste is taken
                           by employees straight to the organic
                           waste bin in the personnel restaurant
                           on the ground floor in office work
                           green office principles are applied
                           for example by printing out hardcopy
                           on both sides and by avoiding
                           unnecessary printouts




     at the end of 2012 a baler came on stream for recycling
     the board used to line the interior of coffee containers this
     is used to compress the board into the bales shown in the
     picture this material is usable feedstock for the board
