      for patients around the world
terumo has held up its corporate mission of contributing to society through healthcare as its highest value over the full 90
years of its history in keeping with this mission we consider it our duty to develop excellent products and ensure their stable
supply and to work proactively to address various issues surrounding healthcare
      the environment surrounding the healthcare industry has been undergoing a dramatic transformation in developed
countries reducing medical costs and improving quality of life have become major issues shaped by changes in the social
landscape like aging populations and slowing economies in developing countries undergoing economic development there
are growing demand for healthcare
      in response to these social needs we utilize our unique technologies and expertise to pursue healthcare with added value
      the evolution of medical devices and equipment will lead to reduced physical strain on patients as well as cutting
treatment times and costs thus making healthcare more efficient and economical a left ventricular assist system for
example drastically changes the environment for treatment as it allows patients to conduct therapy at home instead of being
subject to lengthy hospitalization
      medical devices and equipment can only be beneficial however when operated by professionals who know how to
use them properly with ongoing advancement in healthcare we must recognize that it is necessary for the development and
popularization of healthcare to provide support for the technical training of healthcare professionals to help them acquire the
sophisticated skills needed to perform safely
      our goal is to provide better healthcare and become a company needed by people around the world this is our strong
determination

   compliance system

terumos corporate philosophy contributing to society through healthcare is the goal not only of the company but of all
associates who work for terumo we will continue to conduct honest and fair business practices based on strict legal
compliance and corporate ethics and thereby maintain our position as an ethical healthcare company
       to promote these honest and fair business practices we established the internal control committee which
deliberates and executes important groupwide issues from compliance perspectives in addition based on directions of the
internal control committee each entity placed a compliance officer whose role is to facilitate compliance activities and
carries out such activities at each entity through these activities the internal control committee receives and deliberates
important information to enhance group wide compliance activities


   compliance with code of conduct of the terumo group sakura rules

to go further toward meeting social expectations in april 2008 we established the code of conduct of the terumo group
sakura rules which sets the standard for the conduct of daily business activities for all associates within the terumo
group including overseas entities a booklet of the sakura rules is distributed to all associates of the terumo group
       the sakura rules which is based on terumos corporate philosophy and heart of terumo states that each
associate must conduct business activities honestly take responsible actions for environmental conservation and make
consistent efforts to enable the company to become a role model reliable corporate citizen we carry out study sessions on
the sakura rules that respond to each site and encourage associates to recognize the importance of corporate ethics we
also clearly state and thereby promote the need to respect human rights and eliminate discrimination in our code of conduct


   implementing the whistleblowing system roba no mimi

at terumo we are in the process of implementing a whistleblowing system to detect and reduce the risk of noncompliance
this system allows associates to report or consult any matters related to the violation of laws regulations and internal rules
       in japan the hotline roba no mimi was established in 2003 to support corporate ethics enabling all associates to
report or consult matters or situations deemed as inappropriate in light of the code of conduct of the terumo group
sakura rules associates can contact this hotline on an anonymous basis and we strictly maintain their privacy and
prohibit retaliation against them as we address the reported improprieties
       we are also working to further extend the whistleblowing system through the establishment of similar hotlines at
locations outside of japan


   respect for bioethics

respect for life is our top priority in our evaluation and development of medical devices and equipment and pharmaceuticals
we are committed to practicing both good ethics and good science not only by observing all relevant laws and public
guidelines but also establishing our own internal regulations
       we have created an internal committee on animal testing for research and development and product evaluation the
committee educates associates reviews testing plans ensures the appropriateness of experiments and confirms their
completion and oversees feeding care management and inhouse health checks of animals to achieve the three rs
stipulated in the 2005 revision to the pertinent law as well as the fourth r responsibility

 the principle of the three rs the three rs stand for replacement with research that does not use animals reduction of numbers of
animals and refinement reduction of suffering felt by animals russell and burch first advocated this principle in 1959 stating that it is
vital for researchers to consider and examine the three rs fully when conducting research the 2005 revision to japans act on welfare
and management of animals states this principle explicitly

       proprietary coils that expand by absorbing moisture can be more
       effective for embolization
when treating a cerebral aneurysm it is important for the platinum coils to be                before
distributed evenly throughout the aneurysm to help prevent blood flow and reduce
the risk of rupture a terumo subsidiary microvention inc has developed a
unique coating for their platinum coils using a proprietary technology called
hydrogel when these hydrogelcoated coils absorb the moisture in blood during
the procedure they expand to assist with filling the space within the aneurysm
clinical trials have been completed which show that hydrogelcoated coils provide
evidence for increased efficacy these findings were recently published in an

       diseased blood vessels including devices to treat cerebral infarction
in order to provide a whole range of products for cerebrovascular treatment terumo is working on devices that are useful not
only in treating rupturing blood vessels but also dealing with cerebral infarction caused by blocked blood vessels
       additionally current technologies used to treat cerebrovascular diseases are also being utilized for treatment of
aneurysms within other parts of the body hemostasis of a massive hemorrhage and treatment of cancer terumo expects to
continue to increase its efforts in developing minimally invasive medical devices and equipment that will improve the quality

      promoting widespread use of tri by offering training and support
      to physicians
heart diseases including angina pectoris and myocardial infarction account for a
large proportion of deaths around the world ischemic heart diseases one of these
conditions that narrow the coronary arteries through arteriosclerosis or thrombus
have been commonly treated by endovascular intervention via a catheter inserted
through the femoral artery
       as a new treatment that can reduce the strain on patients and the
healthcare system transradial coronary intervention tri therapy in which a
catheter is inserted into the patients wrist artery to treat coronary arteries is
increasingly popular
       however tri procedure is not easy to perform because the artery from the                  tri inserting a catheter into the wrist artery

wrist to the heart is narrow and winding to further increase the use of tri it is
imperative to provide technical training for physicians to this end terumo started
providing support for physicians to acquire tri techniques in 2005 since then we
have proactively developed tri simulation training programs and provided
practical training workshops
       we have also been working to encourage the adoption of tri around the
world by providing training programs in europe north america and asia we
support japanese physicians when they give technical training on tri to local
physicians in those foreign countries as well as to foreign physicians visiting
japanese tri experts                                                                              tri simulator

  efforts to reduce the environmental impact of distribution

the need to reduce the amount of energy used in the transportation of products has become a major theme in the fight to
prevent global warming
      as a cargo owner in japan terumo has been making efforts to improve distribution efficiency and construct an
efficient distribution infrastructure by among other things reducing the amount of energy used to transport our products via
a modal shift to shipping contractors with high transportation efficiency increasing sea shipping and integrating and
eliminating distribution centers we have also been monitoring data on the environmental impact of distribution since fiscal
2006 switching from truck to marine transportation to reduce environmental impact and improving the carry efficiency of our
own distribution vehicles


  improving efficiency in the transport and storage of prefilled syringes

packaging box of pharmaceutical products requires a tamperproof structure so that the products are not easily taken out of
their box by removing the sealing tape we developed a new tamperproof structure to replace the previous boxes which
had flaps that covered the entire bottom section in order to downsize the packaging boxes the new structure not only uses
paper resources more effectively but also increases the efficiency of transportation thus reducing co2 emission during
transportation and takes up less storage space

      making efforts to reduce the amount of landﬁlled waste
manufacturing processes and business activities at our factories rd center and offices generate a variety of waste we
have therefore set a target of zero waste emissionsdefined as an amount of landfilled waste equal to less than 1 of the
total amount of waste generatedfor all of our sites in japan excepting our sales offices to ensure we achieve this
reduction target we urge rigid adherence to the proper sorting of waste and continue to refine our waste treatment methods
and rules in fiscal 2010 only 03 of our total waste by volume was disposed as landfill meaning that we achieved our zero
emission target for the seventh consecutive year

      reducing packaging
for effective use of resources and improved usability terumo is making efforts to reduce packaging materials without
impairing functionality including by developing smaller lighter and slimmer packages and reviewing package design


  eliminating transportation box for caloriedense liquid meal

we reviewed the transportation box used for our caloriedense liquid meal product
with a particular focus on redundant distribution practices conventionally we
packed multiple product boxes inside a transportation carton which eventually
became waste in the distribution process we reexamined the necessity of the
double packaging and eliminated the transportation box consequently reducing
paper consumption by 50 on the customer side the change resulted in the
reduction of waste packaging material and eliminating the need for additional
unpacking
                                                                                                eliminating transportation box eliminating
                                                                                                the packaging inside the red circle


  eliminating inner boxes of digital thermometers

in order to protect female digital
thermometers we used to ship them in
double packaging consisting of inner boxes
and an outer box we redesigned a new lean
and simple package that allowed us to
eliminate the inner boxes without impairing
the protective function with this new
package design we reduced paper
consumption by 5 eliminating the inner            before reexamination                       after reexamination

cartons also helps our customers to unpack
products faster and reduce waste




     we established a crossdepartmental project involving development

     distribution and sales sections plus factories to consider how to reduce
     packaging while maintaining its functionality in order to improve customer

     convenience and use resources effectively

             we are committed to reducing packaging for people and                       a member of terumos packaging

      promoting recycling
while our industrial waste group one of our specialized environmental groups plays a big role in sharing important
information among sites all our associates make efforts to recycle due to their unique properties and product safety
concerns it is not usually possible to recycle our products for use in other medical products we do however recycle
various types of waste generated in our production processes and officebased business activities for use in other plastic
products including floor tiles and recycled plastic fuel rpf also organic sludge generated from wastewater treatment is
recycled into organic fertilizer our recycling rate reached 94 in fiscal 2010

   aiming at appropriate pcb management

in accordance with the law concerning special measures for promotion of proper treatment of pcb wastes and the waste
management and public cleansing law we have removed all transformers fluorescent light ballasts and other equipment
containing pcbs to ensure the prompt and appropriate disposal of these materials we completed early registration with the
toyota office of the japan environmental safety corporation jesco
      this fiscal year we identified heavy electrical machinery high pressure transformers containing trace amounts of
pcbs when we demolished the head office building we submitted a notification and are keeping the transformers in
compliance with applicable laws until they can be treated

             promotion of green purchasing
                                as clearly declared in our basic environmental policy
                   terumo sets voluntary targets and works to conserve the environment
          we promote green purchasing through our established guidelines for selecting office and
          stationery supplies and other equipment used in production processes and workplaces



      green procurement
  compliance with chemical regulations world wide reach etc

in response to increasingly stricter chemical regulations world wide terumo has established a regulatory compliance system
through cooperation among the concerned departments


1 collection of regulatory information
    in europe which has the most advanced chemical regulations our local subsidiaries regularly provide related
    departments in japan with information on environmental regulations these departments then extract the environmental
    information and report it to the environmental management department which aggregates external information and
    serves as a contact point for environmentrelated industry associations this system is intended to prevent issues from
    falling through the cracks at the survey stage as described below
2 checks in the design phasesupplier survey
    at the stage of product design designers are informed of regulated substances so that they can refrain from using
    environmental pollutants wherever possible we use our human x eco development guidelines as a tool to raise the
    awareness of our designers
          meanwhile the quality assurance department and sections in charge of material procurement cooperate to
    investigate the amount of regulated substances contained in materials procured this material investigation is conducted
    in the form of comprehensive survey that serves a wide variety of purposes and covers items that are necessary in
    assuring product quality as survey results become available the quality assurance department enters them into a
    database so that we can use the data immediately when needed
3 feedback to local sites
    to ensure that our local sites comply with the regulations the environmental management department provides
    feedback to local subsidiaries and related departments
