explanatory notes to the annual accounts

1   principles for valuation and determination of results

general
the annual accounts have been drawn up in accordance with the statutory provisions of title 9 book 2 of the
dutch civil code bw unless otherwise stated assets and liabilities are recognised at nominal value the
principles applied as the general basis for the valuation for assets and liabilities and the determination of
results are the historical costs

comparative figures have been adjusted where required to improve comparison inter alia this is the case for
the costs of software where in the balance sheet for 2013 the costs of software were classified as tangible
assets instead of intangible assets

an asset is included in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the
company and its value can be reliably determined a liability is included in the balance sheet when it is
probable that settlement thereof will entail an outflow of resources that embody economic benefits and the
magnitude of the amount thereof can be reliably determined

income is included in the profit and loss account when an increase of the economic potential related to an
increase in an asset or a decrease of a liability has taken place the magnitude of which can be reliably
determined expenses are accounted for when a decrease of the economic potential related to a decrease in
an asset or an increase of a liability has taken place the magnitude of which can be reliably determined

if a transaction results in almost all or all of the future economic benefits and all or almost all of the risks
related to an asset or liability being transferred to a third party the asset or liability is no longer included in
the balance sheet furthermore assets and liabilities are not included in the balance sheet from the time at
which the requirements of probability of future economic benefits andor reliability of the determination of the
value are no longer met

the income and costs are allocated to the period to which they relate income is accounted for when all
significant risks relating to the delivery have been transferred to the counterparty

continuity
these financial accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis

estimates and uncertainties
in preparing these financial accounts assessments estimates and assumptions have been made that affect
the amounts accounted for in particular this concerns the net sales and cost of sales including transport
costs the assessments estimates and assumptions made are based on market data knowledge and
experience and other factors that are considered reasonable under the given circumstances the actual
results may differ from these estimates the estimates and underlying assumptions are continually assessed
revisions of estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods
on which the revision has an impact potential special features regarding estimates and assessments if
significant are included in the notes to the balance sheet and the profit and loss account as a consequence
of the agreement between the shareholders of gasterra as explained under the offbalance sheet assets and
liabilities the deviations from these estimates do not affect the result

transaction in foreign currencies
transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate applying on the transaction
date

cash and bank balances trade receivables and current liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the
exchange rate applying on the date of the balance sheet

the exchange rate results on gas exports and gas imports arising through translation are allocated under gas
purchases the other exchange rate results are accounted for under financial income and expenses

fixed assets
intangible fixed assets
intangible fixed assets are valued at the historical purchase price or production cost less straightline
depreciation over the economic life of the assets

intangible fixed assets that have not been completed as at the balance sheet date are accounted for under
the category intangible fixed assets under construction after being put into use the relevant asset will be
classified under the category intangible fixed assets

the depreciation period used for intangible fixed assets is 5 years intangible fixed assets under construction
are not depreciated

tangible fixed assets
tangible fixed assets are valued at the historical purchase price or production cost less straightline
depreciation over the economic life of the assets

tangible fixed assets that have not been completed as at the balance sheet date are accounted for under the
category tangible fixed assets under construction after being put into use the relevant asset will be classified
under the category tangible fixed assets

the depreciation periods applied to tangible fixed assets are between 5 and 10 years tangible fixed assets
under construction are not depreciated

impairment
for intangible and tangible fixed assets an assessment is made at every balance sheet date as to whether
there are any indications that these assets are subject to impairment if any such indications exist the
recoverable value of the asset is estimated the recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the
realisable value if it is not possible to estimate the realisable value of an individual asset the realisable value
is determined from the cashflow generating unit to which the asset belongs
when the book value of an asset or a cashflow generating unit exceeds its recoverable value the difference
between the book value and the realisable value is accounted for as an impairment loss if there is an
impairment loss of a cashflow generating unit the loss is first allocated to goodwill which is allocated to the
cashflow generating unit any residual loss is allocated to the other assets of the unit in proportion to their
book values
furthermore at each balance sheet date an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that an
impairment loss accounted for in previous years has decreased if any such indications exist the recoverable
value of the relevant asset or cashflow generating unit is estimated
reversal of an impairment loss previously accounted for takes place only if there is a change in the estimates
used to determine the realisable value since accounting for the last impairment loss in that case the book
value of the asset or cashflow generating unit is raised to the estimated realisable value but not in excess
of the book value that would have been determined after depreciation if in previous years no impairment
loss for the asset or cashflow generating unit would be accounted for

current assets
receivables
the receivables are valued at the amortised cost taking collectability risks into account trade receivables also
include sales that have not yet been invoiced

pensions
gasterra is affiliated with the stichting pensioenfonds gasunie gasunie pension fund foundation together
with nv nederlandse gasunie dutch natural gas infrastructure and transmission company gasterras
employees have a pension scheme administered here




                                                        6

gasterra bv annual report 2014




as of 1 january 2014 the scheme has been changed from a final salary scheme to a conditionally indexed
career average scheme the financial obligations of gasterra in respect of the fund as from 1 january 2014
consist of a fixed premium in combination with the onetime payment to the accrual and supplementary
benefits deposit of the pension fund when the resources that the fund has available are insufficient the risk
hereof then lies with the former participants

the pension scheme is characterised by the pensions act as a distribution agreement the 2014
implementation agreement with the pension fund has a term of 4 years the main agreements included in this
implementation agreement are the following

   on 1 january 2014 gasterra shall make a onetime deposit of  06 million into an accrual deposit which
    is intended to prevent accrual discount in case the premium is insufficient in any year

   on 1 january 2014 gasterra shall make a onetime deposit of 23 million into a supplementary benefits
    deposit which is intended for the grant of a bonus on the pension rights of participants in active service

   gasterra does not have any additional contribution deposit obligation and is not bound to complete any
    gaps in the fund

   the premium amounts to 226 of pensionable earnings gasterra can neither be compelled to pay a
    higher contribution nor to fix the contribution at a lower level

   if in any year the premium is insufficient to fund the pension buildup in that year additional funding will
    be made available by the stichting pensioenfonds gasunie gasunie pension fund foundation from the
    accrual deposit if the accrual deposit is not sufficient for the additional financing of the pension fund the
    pension accrual of participants is set at a reduced amount

the coverage ratio for the pension fund shows the ratio between the funds capital and the value of the
pensions the obligations that the fund shall have to pay out now and in the future
the minimum required coverage ratio according to the supervisory authority the dutch central bank dnb
is 1042 the coverage ratio for the pensioenfonds gasunie was 1101 at yearend december 2014
1114 at yearend 2013 in addition the dnb demands the stichting pensioenfonds gasunie to attain a
required equity in the long term which level depends on the composition of the investments the longterm
coverage ratio required by dnb for stichting pensioenfonds gasunie is 1145 at yearend 2014 1151 at
yearend 2013

a provision is also included as at the balance sheet date for existing additional obligations with respect to the
fund and the employees if it is likely that an outflow of resources will be required in order to settle these
obligations and the amount of the obligations may be reliably estimated the provision is valued at the best
estimate of the cash value of the amounts that will be required to settle the obligations on the balance sheet
date to the extent this obligation relates to the upcoming financial year this is recorded in the current
liabilities account

the starting point is that pension charges to be processed in the reporting period are equal to the pension
contributions owed to the pension fund during the same period to the extent that the contributions payable
on the balance sheet date have not yet been met a liability is included for this if the contributions already
paid at the balance sheet date exceed the contributions owed an accrued asset item is recognised to the
extent that there will be repayment by the fund or a setoff against contributions owed in the future

current liabilities
the current liabilities are valued at the amortised cost with which the income and
expenditure arising from amortisation are recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest
method the initial measurement shall be effected at fair value whereby the transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition are included in the measurement this relates to liabilities with a term of no
more than one year

amounts payable also include purchases that have not yet been invoiced amounts received from customers
due to a decreased purchase of gas under takeorpay agreements are recorded under current liabilities as
an obligation to deliver the obligation to deliver arising from the receipt of gas in the storage service is also
recorded under current liabilities

gasterra bv annual report 2014




financial instruments
financial instruments comprise receivables cash and bank and current liabilities

within the course of its normal business activities the company occasionally uses derivative financial
instruments this relates to forward exchange contracts and gas price swaps in order to hedge the price risk
of certain gas contracts

financial instruments also include derivative financial instruments derivatives embedded in contracts the
company shall separate embedded derivates from the host contract and account for these separately if

   the host contracts economic characteristics and risks and the embedded derivative are not closely
    related and

   a separate instrument with the same terms and conditions as the derivative embedded in the contract
    would meet the definition of a derivative and

   the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss


financial instruments derivatives embedded in contracts that are not separated from the host contract
because the abovementioned conditions are not satisfied are recognized in accordance with the host contract

the company applies cost price hedge accounting techniques in order to recognize the results from hedge
instruments including the forward exchange contracts and the gas price swaps and the changes in value of
the hedged positions simultaneously in the profit and loss account forward exchange contracts and gas price
swaps are initially valued at cost the effectiveness of the hedge relationship is determined by comparing the
critical characteristics of the hedging instrument and the hedged position in the hedge relationship if the
critical characteristics of the forward exchange contract or the gas price swap correspond with the expected
future transaction the forward exchange contract or the gas price swap will not be revalued if the critical
characteristics assessed in the context of the hedge relationship are equal no ineffectiveness exists as soon
as the hedged position of the expected future transaction leads to the processing of a financial asset or a
financial obligation the profits or losses tied to the forward exchange contract or the gas price swap will be
recorded in the profit and loss account during the same period as that wherein the asset obtained or
obligation entered into has an effect on the result

the company documents the hedge relationships and periodically reviews the effectiveness of the hedge
relationships by establishing that no overhedge exists a loss due to an overhedge is recorded at cost or
lower market value directly in the profit and loss account there are no significant cash flow risks related to
the hedge relationships


gasterra concludes gas purchase contracts and gas sale contracts as part of its business operations these
contracts are concluded for the actual physical delivery and receipt of gas in accordance with the companys
expected purchases or sales levels or usage requirements for this reason these fall outside of the scope of
rj 290 reporting standard

gas sales and gas purchases
the pricing of natural gas for both the sales and purchasing sides is influenced to a significant degree by
developments in the gas market prices of natural gas as well as the prices of other energy carriers

gasterras shareholders have concluded an agreement relating to the aftertax profits to be made by
gasterra this agreement stipulates that the price of the natural gas from groningen sold by the nederlandse
aardolie maatschappij bv nam to gasterra during the year has been set such that gasterra will retain the
aftertax profits determined for that year by the shareholders

net turnover
net turnover is divided into gas sales and other net turnover

gas sales represent the income from the supply of gas and the income from the corresponding services
provided after deducting the tax assessed on the turnover



                                                       8

gasterra bv annual report 2014




other net turnover is represented primarily by the income from the delivery of services to third parties this
income results primarily from flexibility services

the income is recorded during the reporting period in that the gas was delivered and the services were
provided

a distinction is made between services related to making transport capacity and flexibility available and actual
usage the services are considered to have been provided if the service was made available to the client
during the period agreed

cost of sales
in the main the cost of sales represents the cost of the purchase of gas and the associated services the
transport costs and the costs related to underground gas storage

operating expenses
the expenses are determined on a historical basis taking into account the principles for valuation mentioned
previously and are allocated to the reporting period to which they relate losses are recorded during the
reporting period in that provisions for them may be made

net financial income and expenses
this item includes the income and expenses related to financing

corporation tax
the amount of corporation tax to be included in the profit and loss account is calculated based on the results
determined according to this account in due observance of the valid taxrelated provisions and rates

statement of cash flows
this report provides a statement of the cash flows generated the statement of cash flow is drawn up on the
basis of the indirect method based on the operating results in the profit and loss account

prices of natural gas as well as the future market prices of other energy carriers in addition to this gasterra
has entered into longterm commitments for office rental and ict service the financial consequences thereof
are of minor significance for assessing the financial position at the end of the financial year
