                                    we aim to become a partner that supports stakeholders and contributes to their sustainable growth


                                    turning changes in the business environment into opportunities for new contribution
                                    in march 2013 the dentsu group completed the acquisition of aegis group plc of the uk
                                    and newly established dentsu aegis network dan expanding the dentsu groups current

                                    surrounding the dentsu group extending into every field of business our clients and

                                    establishing strong trust with society through the growth of each and every employee
                                    dentsu is expected to accurately grasp changes in society and focus on maintaining and
                                    enhancing the business foundation and competitive power the group has established to

                                    in 2014 the japanese economy entered into a gradual recovery and 2015 is the year that
                                    we should work to cement that recovery the corporate governance code which went
                                    into effect in june this year encourages innovation that aims to achieve mid to longterm
                                    corporate growth through constructive dialogue with stakeholders corporations are
                                    public institutions of society and without fruitful collaboration with various stakeholders
                                    sustainable growth is impossible the dentsu group also believes that we must realize our

                                    and digital changes in the business environment

                                    the ability to take action while maintaining a good worklife balance it is based on such
                                    concepts that dentsu engages in various efforts to improve its corporate value
                                    in march 2013 dentsu completed the acquisition of aegis group plc of the uk and currently
                                    with dentsu aegis network dan as part of our group we are expanding our business in

                              environment a management control structure that covers our globally expanding
                             scope of operations and control and management functions that can employ those

                                           what was your impression of the human rights art project

                                            i aimed for a visual that had a message that both children and adults would understand
                                            and would make them happy the two months i spent producing this piece while
                                            receiving advice from dentsu employees were enriching and very enjoyable
                                            one piece of advice i received was that even if i created a visual that i thought fit the
                                            slogan depending on who saw it it might be taken in completely different ways i truly
                                            felt the difficulty of creating a design that would convey the proper meaning to the
                                            people who see the poster the breadth of vision of dentsu employees and the clarity

                                    what do you think of the dmi program

                                    i participated in the dentsu management institute dmi as a member of the fifth generation of students
                                    before starting i underestimated the program thinking it was only one weekend a month and that it would
                                    not be a big deal in reality every month was a struggle with many assignments and i became painfully aware
                                    of my shortsightedness however each of the lectures given by guest lecturers from in and outside the group
                                    were full of pearls of wisdom and i fully relished the importance and joy of learning
                                    the highlight of my experience was the dmi global session held over five days in october welcoming 30
                                    dan group employees from all over the world it was an extremely precious experience which i spent in
                                    concentrated study while struggling with the linguistic barrier day and night and gained friends from across
            ryutaro nagasawa        borders i firmly believe that this experience will be a major driving force in accelerating the dentsu groups

c      onfirmation of employee safety in
       emergency situations
from the standpoint of our obligation to ensure safety and based on
our business continuity plan bcp dentsu has a rapidly deployable
system in place for emergency situations the system allows group
wide confirmation of employee survival degree of injury and ability to
establish contact
emergency situations in this context are those that affect dentsu group
locations worldwide they include disasters such as earthquakes storm
damage and fires as well as various other conceivable situations such
as air and rail accidents outbreak of infectious disease and terrorist
incidents
our system to confirm employee safety utilizes a departmentally
organized contact list together with a dedicated system for the
instantaneous companywide broadcast of confirmed information
contact points email addresses and telephone numbers in japan are
registered in this dedicated system in advance allowing rapid response
and it also collects information from responses about safety status
confirmed results are immediately reported to management through
the department in charge response desks are established for the
continuation of operations and appropriate activities are commenced
with respect to the emergency situation at hand

   why is it important that we give back and engage around corporate social responsibility csr
   as a leading global agency
   any of us who have a degree of affluence and who enjoy good health are fortunate it is perhaps easy
   working in the advertising industry constantly trying to sell things to consumers with disposable income
   to forget that an awful lot of people are much less fortunate than ourselves
   of course everyone must make their own decisions on an individual basis whether they wish to give
   anything back but all our businesses operate in a local community and a national and global market
   place just as the communities support us  with staff customers resources to do our jobs  we must
   support our communities working together as a team with focused and coordinated efforts on selected                      nick waters
   programmes we can have a positive impact on the communities around us                                                     winner
                                                                                                                               move the dial

   for a small  of time at helping address some of the challenges in society then we can have a positive impact
   we value responsibility in our group and this is just one way in which we can live up to our values by doing so will enhance our companys
   reputation and help build a virtuous circle by attracting new customers and staff that value the same things we do

   what do you want people to know about your involvement with future proof csr
   there is nothing specific but if my involvement helps our teams around the world recognize the importance of this to our company
   and encourages everyone to get more involved and give a little bit more time and effort then that would be very positive

   what are you proud of in 2015
   everyone in the asia pacific business made such a great effort in 2014 and showed such a desire and commitment to support
   csr initiatives that we have something to really build on in 2015 our ambition is to turn our efforts into more continuous and
   sustainable activities rather than a series of oneoffs we will only be able to judge at the end of the year whether we have been
   able to achieve our aims and whether our efforts have contributed a bit more

 30 days of green case study 2   bird houses  dentsu aegis network russia
dentsu aegis network russia came up with a brilliant gift idea around sharing the 30
days of green campaign with their clients the team focused on the native starling birds
habitat and how they could help increase the low bird population starlings like to live in
gardens and forests in and around moscow and are known for bringing the first signs of
spring to address this issue the team decided to give 600 starling birdhouses to clients
as gifts each client will then be helping to sustain the starling bird population locally
and thereby contribute to the cause this initiative also enhances dentsu aegis networks
corporate reputation and brand by engaging outside companies and clients to join the

why is it important that we give back and engage around corporate social responsibility
as a leading global agency
the main word here that explains everything is responsibility the bigger our business is the bigger is our
responsibility to all our stakeholders  employees clients suppliers etc companies especially networks such as
ours working on so many business fields with prime focus on media to deliver value to our clients must take the
lead in bringing business and society back together and open up our clients for the opportunities to serve new
needs gain efficiency create differentiation and even expand markets throughout their social engagement we
can reset the boundaries of social responsibility by transforming it into creating a shared value strategies for our
clients benefitting both their core business and their customers all at once the most efficient tool to give a voice
to any sustainable business and deliver on its brand promise is in our hands  the media                                   maria grachnova

one thing for sure  corporate responsibility should not be an end in itself but a thoroughly developed future
