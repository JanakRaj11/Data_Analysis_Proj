     group together with various partners such as local governments and
     nutritionists has been holding health and nutrition seminars since october

  joint tagging survey of skipjack off the pacific coast of japan
  helping to conserve skipjack stocks

  skipjack is an integral part of the japanese diet this fish is used to make dried bonito and dashi soup stock and is
  also a favorite for sushi and sashimi hondashi made from dried bonito is one of the main products of ajinomoto co
  inc in japan it has been a household name since it first came out in 1970 beloved for imparting the natural flavor of
  dashi soup stock meanwhile worldwide demand for skipjack continues to grow still many aspects of the ecology of
  skipjack are not well understood ajinomoto co inc is involved in the joint tagging survey of skipjack off the pacific
  coast of japan helping to shed light on the ecology of skipjack and assisting the management and conservation of
  skipjack stocks thanks to efforts like these consumers will always be able to enjoy hondashi

dents in the fiscal 20112013 ajinomoto group occupational
accident prevention plan
    in fiscal 2012 there were no serious accidents involving
getting caughttrapped in filling and packing equipment this
was attributed to thorough handson safety training and packing
equipment safety measures mainly at group companies outside
japan in fiscal 2013 the focus will be ending the ongoing
occurrence of similar accidents involving rotary valves3 on                                                  wire grille installed                             installation of alternative equipment

     in japan falling accidents involving workers 50 or older tend
to result in serious fracture injuries requiring hospitalization or                                            examples of activities to prevent falling
surgery therefore in fiscal 2013 employees in this age group
were asked to selfcheck their physical ability based on the
results they were instructed in exercises to maintain their
physical fitness and help prevent falls while addressing these
individual factors the group also sought to reduce environmen
tal factors such as wet or icy walking surfaces to prevent
these accidents

      the ajinomoto group environmental philosophy
      and basic environmental policies
      the ajinomoto group environmental philosophy and basic environmental policies were revised in 2006 in light of
      trends in compliance and efforts to minimize the environmental impact of business activities they express the
      groups commitment to contributing to a sustainable society as a responsible global company
         since the revision issues concerning the sustainability of the global environment and human societies have
      become even more serious it is clear that the expectations of the ajinomoto group are higher amid significant
      changes in the circumstances and structures surrounding corporate activities
         on its centenary in 2009 the ajinomoto group pledged to work for life in order to further articulate this
      pledge and state even more explicitly its determination to ensure that its business activities help to build a
      sustainable global society the ajinomoto group environmental philosophy and basic environmental policies were
      revised again in april 2011 in addition the group established the ajinomoto group biodiversity policy and action
      agenda in february 2012

   since fiscal 2009 ajinomoto co inc has been involved in the
   joint tagging survey of skipjack off the pacific coast of japan
   partnering with the national research institute of far seas
   fisheries nrifsf the project engages research experts in the
   field of marine resources seeing to elucidate the migratory
   habits of skipjack along the kuroshio current from the southwest

   better understanding of the mysterious life of skipjack
        skipjack are tagged released and later recaught with the
   help of fishing operators survey personnel actually board
   fishing vessels to release skipjack so they must work closely
   with fisheries cooperatives to determine the best boats and
   times for weather and fishing conditions when the tagged fish
   are caught the fishing operators report the date location tag                           meeting with a fisheries cooperative
   number and size of the fish survey personnel meet with people
   in the fishing industry across japan to hand out leaflets and
   enlist fisheries to post educational posters
        many people are involved in acquiring the data which is
   published by nrifsf the data is also used by international
   fishery management organizations and presented at academic
   conferences all contributing to the sustainable management of                                                                           poster and promotional goods

   government white paper cites biodiversity initiatives of ajinomoto group

   japans ministry of the environment recently published the annual report on the environment the
   sound materialcycle society and the biodiversity in japan 2013 which was submitted to the
   national diet in june 2013 this environmental white paper included a column devoted
   specifically to the biodiversity initiatives of the ajinomoto group1
        under the vision of living in harmony with nature many nations are presently working
   toward achieving the aichi biodiversity targets a new strategic plan that was decided at the 10th
   meeting of the conference of the parties cop 10 held in nagoya japan in 2010 japan outlined
   the national biodiversity strategy of japan 20122020 in september 2012 as a roadmap for
   achieving the aichi biodiversity targets the call to action encompasses all segments of society
   and asks businesses to play a major role in achieving the targets the white paper by the ministry
   of the environment cites the biodiversity initiatives of the ajinomoto group as a leading example
   validating the groups efforts in this area
        the ajinomoto group is working to address biodiversity issues directly related to its business
   activities it seeks to influence industry and society as a whole by sharing best practices and
   providing biodiversity education the group presented at side events at the cop 11 held in
   hyderabad india and also publishes information on biodiversity initiatives on its own website

 joint development of environment vitalizing
 concrete to help promote marine ecosystems
  environmental vitalizing concrete promotes microalgae growth on its surface by
  incorporating amino acids into inorganic concrete the result is an organic con
  crete that helps to revitalize marine environments since 2009 ajinomoto co inc
  has been developing environment vitalizing concrete jointly with the university
  of tokushimas department of ecosystem design headed by professor yasunori                                    organic concrete left attracts more fish than

 organic concrete improves the compatibility of natural and manmade
 objects restoring vitality to an area
 in the past few years in addition to the problems with water pollution and eutrophication in
 japans rivers and seas rockyshore denudation caused by multiple factors including
 oligotrophication in which nutrients are depleted rising sea water temperatures and feeding                     onsite monitoring of organic
 damage caused by organisms that feed on seaweed has become a serious environmental problem in japan concrete
      with this understanding ajinomoto co inc has been conducting joint research in laboratories and in the field with partners
 from different fields the research has confirmed that the amino acids which are slowly released by environment vitalizing concrete
 promote microalgae growth which in turn fosters feeding grounds for fish and shellfish this suggests that promoting healthy growth
 of microalgae at the base of the food chain helps to improve and vitalize overall aquatic environments
      furthermore the society of materials science japan jsms verified that incorporating arginine a type of amino acid into
 concrete has virtually zero impact on strength and durability

 experiments are underway at over 40 water areas
 testing and monitoring of the product is underway at over 40 locations in oceans and rivers across japan the company is also
 promoting further research into the speed mechanism and the consistency of the release of amino acids
      environment vitalizing concrete has also begun to appear in a number of public infrastructure projects ajinomoto co inc is
 pursuing further rd and practical applications into such products as wave dissipation blocks in order to create safe and secure
 living environments for people enhance and vitalize the aquatic environment and energize the fisheries industry in local communities

conserving water resources
to reduce the high nitrogen concentration and biochemical oxygen demand bod in process effluent from the
production of amino acid fermentationrelated products the ajinomoto group controls pollutant sources and uses
original treatment technologies suited to the quality of effluent water at each site it takes a lot of water to make
fermentationrelated productsabout 50 times the product weight although the groups production plants are located in
areas rich in water resources the group is committed to minimizing water usage by developing watersaving processes

           fiscal 2012 performance overview
     in the 20112013 ajinomoto group zero emissions plan new                                                   37 as a result waste per tonne of product was 0093 tonnes
     target values have been established for waste per unit of produc                                           representing an increase of roughly 5 compared to the
     tion for the entire ajinomoto group the aim is to reduce waste                                             base year
