    management performance plan 201516 as part of the improvements relating to measuring the solid waste strategy 2024
    in 201516 domestic waste and recycling have both increased two domestic programs were expanded during the year namely
    the wholeofcity kerbside cleanup waste to landfill and the green waste collection service green waste diverted and recycled
    these programs collected a similar tonnage of materials contributing to an unchanged diversion rate the solid waste
    strategy 2024 sets an intermediate target of 35 per cent diversion by 2019

    to be consistent with the new performance indicators adopted in the gold coast waste management performance plan
    201516 the kilograms of waste per household per week measure has been replaced with kilograms of domestic waste
    disposed to landfill per household per year this measure will directly relate to solid waste strategy 2024 programs that will
    be implemented in the next eight years
    in 201516 the initial year of the strategy the data shows very little change in householders waste disposal behaviours for
    either collection services or selfhauled waste

note    
             refers to roll on roll off bins this is a waste container that loads directly onto the waste collection vehicle

there has been modest growth in commercial bin services both wheelie and bulk bins probably due to businesses
increasing their weekly services to manage increased waste generation use of large compactor bins has decreased as
some large waste disposers have added recycling bulk bins and subsequently reduced their waste servicing frequency

overview of the 201516 community financial report

the community financial report is a plain english explanation of our financial statements and covers the
following five components

1	statement of comprehensive income shows information on our financial performance including our
    revenue expenses and net profit or loss

2	statement of financial position balance sheet shows the monetary value of our assets liabilities
    and equity

3 statement of changes in equity shows the changes in our net wealth

4	statement of cash flows shows movements of cash and cash equivalents highly liquid investments
    that can be readily converted into cash

5	financial ratios shows common comparisons between financial statement amounts to allow readers
    to compare our results with other organisations




                                                                                                           chapter four  finance   12 0

    statement of comprehensive income
    the statement of comprehensive income refer page 140 shows whether our operations were in surplus or deficit during the
    201516 financial year calculated using the formula

    total revenue  total expenses  net result

    the net result shows a surplus of 3292 million this surplus is largely a result of the cash 1426 million and physical
    assets 2049 million contributed by developers throughout the year associated with new development in the city
    developers construct local roads parks water pipes and many other assets that are handed over to council at the completion
    of the development they also provide cash contributions towards shared infrastructure that services new development such
    as sewerage treatment plants major roads sporting grounds and more these contributions are restricted in use and are
    therefore not available to fund day to day operations of the city
    the net result also shows some expenditure that does not contribute toward the daily running of the city when assets are
    decommissioned or disposed of the remaining net value of those assets shows as an expense but does not need to be funded by
    revenue raised through rates and levies a net loss on disposal of 573 million was recorded in 201516 04 of total assets

managing our debt
when appropriate we use debt funding to provide for capital works when used to fund assets that provide a benefit to the
community over many years debt funding enables us to spread the cost of those assets over the life of the asset
debt must be managed prudently to ensure repayments can be met our debt policy restricts the use of debt funding to capital
expenditure only and we also ensure that debt service payments do not exceed 20 per cent of total recurrent revenue in any
one year
to keep rate increases to a minimum we seek to minimise borrowings where repayments must come from general rates
funding instead we borrow against other established revenue streams such as specific levies and utility charges to ensure a
sustainable financial future
a more detailed explanation of debt management is provided in the document debt management public statement this
document is available on councils website at the following link

financial ratios
financial ratios use figures from financial statements to demonstrate relationships between key numbers ratios which focus
on financial sustainability are particularly relevant for government organisations
the regulation requires all queensland councils to report on three specific financial sustainability ratios the operating
surplus ratio osr the net financial liabilities ratio nflr and the asset sustainability ratio asr the results of these
ratios calculated in accordance with the financial management sustainability guidelines 2013 are shown in the current year
and long term financial sustainability statements that follow this community financial report they are not reproduced here
in that same format
we prepare detailed asset management plans amps which specify how much we should spend on renewing our assets we
believe that it is more relevant to use these figures in calculating the osr and asr rather than using accounting depreciation


operating surplus ratio amps
this ratio measures the extent to which revenue raised covers operational expenses based on renewal requirements identified in the
amps rather than using accounting depreciation a positive ratio indicates that a surplus may be available to use for future expenditure
or debt repayments surplus funds are being placed into reserves to fund major works in the future

our operating surplus ratio is forecast to remain strongly positive

adjusted operating surplus ratio
this ratio is required by qtc for loan approval purposes and is calculated as the operating result excluding capital items and
depreciation divided by operating revenue this ratio is a more accurate representation of our ability to cover operating costs

    asset renewal funding ratio
    this ratio measures the extent to which our 10 year financial forecast includes required asset renewal expenditure as
    identified in our amps
    a ratio of greater than 90 per cent indicates that we have capacity to fund our projected infrastructure asset renewals without
    needing to increase operating income reduce operating expenditure or increase debt
    our asset renewal funding ratio is forecast to remain above the 90 per cent target

 notes    1	basis of preparation  the current year financial sustainability statement is a special purpose statement prepared in
                accordance with the requirements of the local government regulation 2012 and the financial management sustainability
                guideline 2013 the amounts used to calculate the three reported measures are prepared on an accrual basis and are
                consistent with the councils audited general purpose financial statements for the year ended 30 june 2016

           2	the operating surplus ratio and asset sustainability ratio use accounting depreciation as the measure for the decline in value of
               assets and therefore the required renewal expenditure the council of the city of gold coast has embraced asset management
               as a key component of longterm financial sustainability the council places heavy reliance on its asset management plans for
               the maintenance renewal and replacement of infrastructure assets to meet the service delivery needs of the community now
               and in the future the asset management plans set the optimal schedule of proposed maintenance renewal and replacement
               to achieve specified service levels while minimising asset life cycle costs the council uses its asset management plans to
               determine appropriate funding for the replacement and renewal of its long term infrastructure assets rather than rely on
               funding depreciation as such council does not believe the operating surplus ratio and asset sustainability ratio should be
               viewed in isolation

    description the graph shows the average annual grading of gold coast waterways based on
    south east queensland healthy waterways report card
    commentary the environmental condition of waterways are rated from ad
    the average grading for gold coast waterways in 2015 was b this represents a minor downward
    trend potentially attributable to a significant dry period impacting freshwater environments followed
    by intense rainfall events following this dry spell this leads to significant run off from the land and
    roads being washed into the waterways worsening water quality similarly in drier periods this also
    means that regular flushing of waterways out to sea is reduced and nutrients can build up in the
    waterways leading to poorer water quality and sometimes algal blooms to form
