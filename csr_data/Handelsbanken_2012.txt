corporate social responsibility
 part of our corporate culture


sustainability and corporate social responsibility csr are deeply rooted in handelsbankens
culture and method of working indeed for several years we have reported on these issues in
our annual report and on our website

actions we are also a member of the voluntary initiatives global compact and principles of
responsible investment pri which are both un initiatives aimed at companies these principles
are totally in keeping with the values and principles that already apply at handelsbanken
