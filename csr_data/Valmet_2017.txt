                valmet steps forward with the global challenge

                the year 2016 was the first year that valmet participated in the global challenge a workplace health and
                engagement program for the 100 days between may 25 and september 1 around 1500 valmet employees counted
                their steps as they competed in teams of seven in a virtual race around the world physical activity was rewarded
                with steps which counted towards daily totals with minichallenges and team competitions adding to the fun
                the program also gave tips and practical advice for nutrition sleep activity and overall wellbeing




                       214 teams equals a lot of team spirit

                       the global challenge not only brought out the
                       competitive side in us but also brought us closer
                       together as colleagues the challenge became a
                       conversation starter which led to small talk and
                       eventually to building new connections on a deeper
                       level it gave the teams reasons to interact in new
                       ways  bringing managers and teams closer and
                       breaking crossorganizational boundaries

             ensuring responsible business operations
             wherever we operate
             in 2016 we defined a new global sustainability assessment process to ensure that we are able to operate according
             to our code of conduct whenever we expand our current operations or establish a new legal entity in a new country
             the sustainability assessment process is based on a checklist covering five main topics based on human rights
             labor rights health and safety environmental management and business ethics the piloting of the new assessment
             process took place in jakarta in 2016




                   local conditions are identified

                   the target of the new sustainability assessment is to
                   create a comprehensive understanding of the current
                   practices and the stakeholders expectations on
                   valmet when expanding our business presence we
                   need to understand local market practices to identify
                   our economic social and environmental impacts as
                   well as potential risks the sustainability assessment
                   is part of a smooth entry or expansion to the market

                   understanding stakeholder expectations

                   a comprehensive stakeholder dialogue helps to ensure
                   that valmet is operating in a responsible manner
                   the assessment in jakarta included meetings with
                   selected external stakeholders suppliers the local
                   main contractor of the services center local municipal
