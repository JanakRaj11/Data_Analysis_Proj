our mission is a carbonfree future

the basis of our company is laid in providing carbonfree energy at a stable price
for our owners


according to the united nations sustainable development goals affordable and clean energy is seen
essential for sustainable economic growth and improved human wellbeing energy needs to be produced
and consumed sustainably if the devastating impacts of climate change are to be mitigated

finlands national energy and climate strategy for 2030 sets the framework for energy production in
finland for the coming years with a clear goal of aiming towards a carbonfree society the hanhikivi 1
project is in line with this objective by constructing and later operating finlands sixth nuclear power plant
we are directly contributing to the sustainable development of energy production and halting the progress
of climate change

in addition the hanhikivi 1 nuclear power plant will replace the production capacity that will exit the finnish
market and will help reduce the shortage of electricity supply in the future as a byproduct the project will
stimulate the finnish economy and employment

before we achieve our goal of commissioning the hanhikivi 1 nuclear power plant we have still some years            toni hemminki
of hard work ahead of us the decisions we take now pave the way for our future that is why corporate              fennovoimas ceo
responsibility is an integrated part of our operations and it is paid attention in our project objectives and our
key performance indicators throughout the project


2016  a year of organizational growth and development
the past years our organization has been growing significantly both from organizational development and
headcount perspective in 2016 we recruited 84 talented new colleagues also our operations processes
and practices were strongly developed to be ready for the construction of the actual nuclear power plant

we submitted batches of design documentation of the nuclear power plant to the radiation and nuclear
safety authority stuk we also submitted the environmental impact assessment program concerning the
final disposal of spent nuclear fuel thus fulfilling the requirement of the 2010 decisioninprinciple

during the year the construction work at the plant site progressed and the first buildings were completed
approximately 150 people mostly finnish were carrying out daily work at the plant site over time we will
see an entry of construction workers of many different nationalities at the construction site

all the work that we have done and are doing to set common guidelines and practices will support us
maintaining a functioning and safe construction site where contractors and workers abide by the finnish
legislation and our code of conduct

one of our key responsibility focus areas in 2016 was developing a new compliance and ethics program
which was launched in january 2017 during this year we will review our procedures and develop our
operations in order to ensure that the principles of our compliance and ethics program are taken into
account in all our operations and within our supply chain


looking ahead
our cooperation with the plant supplier progresses constantly our main priority in 2017 is to deliver the
planning documentation of the nuclear power plant to stuk on time to receive the construction license in
2018 also the competence and process development within our own organisation continues to be a high
priority

as part of the compliance and ethics development fennovoima signed the united nations global
compact initiative in the beginning of 2017 with the signature we agreed to align our strategy and
operations with the ten principles of the initiative concerning human rights labour rights environmental
protection and anticorruption the commitment to the principles was a natural albeit significant
continuation of our sustainability efforts

electricity production this is a welcome and challenging task to
achieve the goal all emissionfree energy forms are needed nuclear      however on a levelized basis nuclear power is an economic source of
power capacity worldwide is increasing steadily with over 60 reactors    electricity generation combining the advantages of security reliability
under construction in 15 countries                                       very low greenhouse gas emissions and cost competitiveness

in europe the pursuit of emissionfree power generation has led to
vast utilization of subsidies for renewable energy resources however
in finland nuclear power plays a major role in the implementation of
the finnish climate and energy strategy towards a carbonfree society
and currently more than 33  of electricity production is based on
nuclear energy

dialogue with the project opponents
opposition to the project can be seen most clearly in social media         management of the protests required a substantial amount of police
discussions and as activist protests in pyhäjoki fennovoimas             resources in 2016 as well as in 2015 during 2016 approximately 100
communications operations aim to serve the general public regardless      reports of an offence were made to the police about the actions of the
of their position towards fennovoima we have actively shared              activists after the police dismantled the activist campsite in the end of

key financial figures

fennovoima oy has one major task which is to build a new nuclear power plant in
finland and to produce electricity at a stable price for its shareholders


fennovoimas finnish shareholders consist of industrial companies and municipal energy companies that
utilize energy in their own operations fennovoimas hanhikivi 1 project will benefit the whole of finland
due to the increased carbonfree electricity supply

fennovoima will be operating on the costprice principle the mankala principle whereby the
shareholders are entitled to the electricity generated by the nuclear power plant at cost price in proportion
to their ownership in the company as a result of this principle fennovoima will not make a profit nor pay
dividends in the normal course of its business

fennovoima has offices in helsinki and pyhäjoki the headquarters is in helsinki fennovoima oy has a
100owned subsidiary ooo fennovoima rus in russia the subsidiary was registered in november
2015 to control procurement in russia ooo fennovoima rus has an office in st petersburg russia




financial year 2016
fennovoima had no turnover in 2016 the reason is that the company is still in the project phase and does
not own any revenuegenerating assets yet the construction of the actual plant will begin as soon as the
site is prepared and the construction license is granted by the government of finland the construction
and commissioning of hanhikivi 1 is planned to be completed by 2024 after which the plant will be in
commercial use as a result all the costs of fennovoima basically relate to the design construction and
commissioning of this nuclear power plant the distribution of economic value is described in the following
figure




as there are no revenues expected before the plant begins commercial operations

  the economic value generated a remains at a modest level consisting mainly of financing income
  related to the loan facilities and liquidity management
  the economic value distributed b is naturally considerable prior to commercial operations because
  the whole plant investment is spent during this period fennovoima is not yet able to generate
  revenues nor economic value that it could distribute as a typical enterprise instead the company
  distributes the invested capital to various stakeholders its own personnel external services
  authorities epc contractors etc which contributes to the completion of the power plant
  as a result the economic value retained a  b is currently negative after the plant starts commercial
  operations the economic value generated is going to cover the economic value distributed however
  due to the mankala principle applied by the company the economic value retained is expected to be
  close to zero even during commercial operations

supply chain management

the purpose of fennovoimas supply chain management is to provide a way of
managing monitoring and developing the performance of the entire supply chain of
the hanhikivi 1 project




the scope of supply chain management in fennovoima includes supplier approval supplier followup
supplier steering and supplier data management

fennovoima ensures that the plant supplier and subsuppliers delivering services and products important
to safety are in compliance with the safety requirements and have in place procedures to ensure the
conformity and acceptability of the products and services they provide as compliance with safety
requirements is a basic condition for engagement with fennovoima




process development
our supply chain management procedures and process development follow the project phases during the
year 2016 we focused on intensive process development controlling the supply chain documentation of
raos project and arranging supply chain management training with the main suppliers

during 2017 we will focus on the development of raos projects subsuppliers controlling procedures and
processes and document implementation

fennovoima

supplier approval and followup
initiative for the supplier approval process may arise from fennovoimas own need to place an order from
the plant supplier raos project or from the nuclear fuel supplier tvel in an official approval request
supply chain management is responsible for the coordination of the review process and distribution of the
supplier approval or rejection decision

fennovoima supply chain management assesses the potential supplier companies in a comprehensive
manner all services and activities provided by the suppliers are classified according to their importance to
nuclear safety and treated accordingly in addition to the nuclear safety criteria numerous other factors are
emphasized in the supplier selection the supplier must fulfil technical financial and safety requirements to
act as a supplier in the hanhikivi 1 project

in addition safetyrelated suppliers must have a quality management system that is appropriately certified
or independently evaluated by a third party eg iso 9001 certification and suppliers must have in place
processes to control the operations of their own subsuppliers suppliers must comply with the
occupational safety and environmental requirements of the ohsas 18001 and iso 14001 standards also
matters such as prior experience of similar work are checked

the conditions for the suppliers use of subcontractors and the communication and relaying of
requirements within the supply chain are defined in the supply chain manual procurement plans and
purchasing procedures of fennovoima and in those of the plant supplier to ensure that safety requirements
are fulfilled within the entire supply chain

we require our suppliers and subsuppliers to comply with all applicable finnish and international laws and
regulations and to meet the regulatory requirements and contractual conditions we also expect our
partners to follow ethical business practices respect the environment and human rights and offer a safe
and fair work environment for their employees

auditing the supply chain

our supplier audit procedures are in place to ensure that legal regulatory and
contractual requirements are met and to confirm that the supplier has the required
abilities to produce products or services it is contracted to


auditing is one of the methods that are used to ensure suppliers capability to deliver highquality products
that meet the requirements fennovoimas audits cover all the safety significant suppliers of the hanhikivi
1 project supply chain fennovoima conducted 41 audits of its own and the plant suppliers supply chain in
2016

the plant supplier performs its own audits of its subsuppliers within the whole supply chain of the hanhikivi
1 project in addition to fennovoima and the plant supplier in different phases of the hanhikivi 1 project
audits and inspections can be conducted by subsuppliers third parties or the finnish nuclear and
radiation authority stuk if any audit is regarded necessary within the scope of work stuk always has
the authority to participate in these audits according to its own decision requirements to perform audits
and assessments are referred to in the yvl guides

methods for auditing include

   interviewing auditee personnel
   assessing documentation
   assessing records
   observing activities and processes
   observing physical conditions

sometimes nonconformities which mean ways of action and procedures that do not meet the set
demands and standards are perceived in inspections and audits in such cases fennovoima can refer to
the legal and regulatory requirements and to the contractual terms and conditions to point out the non
conformities in order to demand corrective actions

in nonconformity situations the subcontractors must be able to prove that corrections and corrective
actions have been addressed on the agreed schedule before the operation can acceptably continue if
corrective actions for a critical nonconformity are not performed effectively the supplier related to the
project is to be suspended and it may result in withdrawal of the supplier approval




audits cover the safety significant suppliers                                new focus areas in 2017
fennovoimas audits cover the whole supply chain of the safety               during 2017 we will focus on clarifying the epc agreement
significant suppliers according to graded approach during 2016 the         requirements and yvl nuclear safety guides to the suppliers also our

promoting nuclear and radiation safety

fennovoima and stuk will supervise the construction of the nuclear power plant
and its safety at all stages of the work


fennovoima ensures that the plant will be constructed in accordance with the safety requirements using
accepted plans and procedures fennovoima also ensures that the plant supplier and the subcontractors
that produce services and products important to safety operate in accordance with the safety
requirements and understand the importance of the requirements

only suppliers who possess the prerequisites for operations that meet these requirements and who use
clear quality management and assurance procedures can take part in deliveries that have safety
significance

fennovoima has established procedures for the assessment approval supervision and steering of the
suppliers of products that have safety significance the procedures cover the entire supply chain and all the
phases in the life cycle of the products the nuclear safety of fennovoimas nuclear power plant is built up
by deliverables produced by fennovoima or fennovoimas suppliers the plant supplier or their sub
suppliers as the sole responsible party for the nuclear safety of the plant fennovoima employs the best
available knowledge and resources to ensure that the deliverables support nuclear safety




safety awareness
safety awareness is maintained and emphasized in                            during 2016 our whole organization went through discussions on how
fennovoimas growing organization through continuous open                   safety culture is realized in the daily work this was carried out in
communication and training                                                 team and unitlevel meetings and each team made also a concrete

supplier and main contractors of the construction site

fennovoima

managing risks
an efficient risk management process and reacting proactively to detected risks play a key role in creating
a safe working environment for all workers at the construction site comprehensive regularly assessed risk
management processes and active reporting of safety observations form an important part of preventive
management of occupational health and safety

currently the work at the plant site is regular construction work and civil engineering work and there are
not any operations which have high incident or disease risks however in future the construction work will
include several tasks where the risk of incidents is augmented such as working in confined spaces and
tunnels or working at high altitude or underwater fennovoima constantly monitors the situation at the
plant site and we guide and train our personnel and partners to obey common safety procedures and
guidelines

occupational health and safety development
during 2016 the occupational health and safety management systems of the hanhikivi 1 construction site
including fennovoimas ohs management system and those of plant supplier raos project and main
contractor titan2 have been developed to correspond with the requirements of the ohsas 18001
standard

we were also focused on developing the cooperation practices with the site contractors and creating a
good safety culture at the hanhikivi 1 site as the project owner fennovoima requires site operators
commitment to continuous improvement of occupational safety

the development of the occupational health and safety management system continues in 2017 in
addition new occupational health and safety training for supervisors at the plant site will be launched also
new practices to supervise contractors working at the plant site will be implemented




targets and objectives
fennovoima has defined longterm occupational health and safety objectives and targets that are
expected to be filled every year occupational safety targets are updated each year when operations
change and evolve

precise indicators are specified for each target area and performance in those areas is monitored by the
ohs manager who reports weekly to the construction director and monthly to the management team of
fennovoima

environmental impact assessments
the environmental impact assessment eia procedure is based on the council directive on the
assessment of the impacts of certain public and private projects on the environment 85337eec which
has been enforced in finland through the eia act act on environmental impact assessment procedure
4681994 and the eia decree decree on environmental impact assessment procedure 7132006

the objective of the eia procedure is to improve the environmental impact assessments ensure that
environmental impacts are consistently taken into account in planning and decisionmaking and increase
the availability of information to citizens and the possibility for them to participate in the planning of
projects the eia procedure does not involve any projectrelated decisions or solve any issues pertaining to
permits or licenses

environmental studies

fennovoima has conducted environmental monitoring and environmental and
nature conservation studies on land and at sea since the very early phase of the
project




dust is one of the environmental impacts of construction dust is continuously measured at hanhikivi
headland photo jarmo tyyskä


so far almost 90 studies have been conducted at the hanhikivi             these studies provide information for example for the designing of
headland and its surroundings environmental monitoring and studies        the routes for the cooling water tunnels of the nuclear power plant
ensure good knowledge of the status of the environment of the              also studies of eg vegetation and habitat type studies and different
hanhikivi headland                                                        kinds of fauna studies related to birds bats and moor frogs for
                                                                           instance have been implemented
the studies continue until the commencement of the construction of
the power plant and some will continue during the entire life cycle of    in the sea area fennovoima has commissioned water quality
the power plant the studies provide information that is necessary for     monitoring since 2009 the seabed near the hanhikivi headland has
applying for permits as well as for the design of the buildings and       been studied by carrying out seismic refraction surveys drilling and
structures as we want to ensure the neutrality of the research results   aerial studies also aquatic vegetation and benthic fauna have been
we contract external research and consultants to conduct the               studied by surfacesupplied diving the fish fauna in the area has been
necessary studies                                                         studied eg in several fishery research reproduction studies and
                                                                           impact assessments on fish stock
on the land area drillings and geophysical investigations have been
carried out with which the levels and characteristics of the bedrock     fishery subsidies and compensations to professional fishermen were
the ground water level and the thickness of soil layers have been          eur 007 million in total in 2016
investigated

sea grayling investigation
based on the obligation of the environmental permit of the nuclear power plant we also conducted a separate investigation
regarding sea grayling which is a critically endangered fish species in 2016 the liminkaoja river located about 2 km south of
the hanhikivi headland is a spawning area for sea grayling the purpose of the investigation was to identify if sea grayling also
spawn in the marine area near the hanhikivi headland a similar investigation has been done by fennovoima once before in
                                                                                                                                      sea grayling
2012 the investigation included eg a survey of professional fishermen experimental fishing and observation of sea grayling
fry no sea grayling spawning in the marine area nearby hanhikivi headland has been observed in spite of comprehensive
studies in 2017 fennovoima will continue fishery and fishing industry monitoring as required in the water permits in addition a
survey of freetime fishermen will be carried out

environmental impacts during construction

our objective is that the construction of the nuclear power plant would interfere as
little as possible with the nature around the construction site area


the construction period which is approximately ten years will have a significant impact on the
environment the site area in the hanhikivi headland is a greenfield site  a natural state area which has
become an industrial site




landscape and land use
the power plant will be placed in a visible area at the tip of a headland reaching out into the open sea and
it changes the landscape significantly

the beginning of the groundwork has already changed the land use in the area of the hanhikivi headland
the plant site area has been fenced and the access routes in the area have changed a decree on
restrictions of movement and presence on the hanhikivi 1 plant site entered into force in november 2015         hanhikivi 1 construction site

instead land use on the north and northeast coasts that are significant ecologically remains largely
unchanged access to a protected hanhikivi boundary stone is not possible at the moment

the most significant impacts of the project on the recreation use are connected with fishing and hunting




water system and fishing
the construction of the nuclear power plant has local impacts on the water systems and fishery in the area
the coastline around the hanhikivi headland is open and there are not many species of aquatic vegetation
the fish species typically found in the area are those typically found in the whole of the bay of bothnia

water construction work started with dredging work in november 2015 and continued in september 2016
the construction activities in the sea area cause temporary turbidity of the seawater in a small area but it
doesnt have a significant impact on the water quality the impacts of turbidity are controlled with             fish monitoring
continuous measuring the turbidity of the seawater off the coast of the hanhikivi headland also naturally
increases during storms or periods of heavy rainfall

fishing in the immediate vicinity of the water construction area and in the immediate vicinity is not possible
during the water construction work the construction activities in the sea area can also drive away fish from
a larger area and temporarily influence the migration routes of fish excavation in particular causes
underwater noise that may drive away fish from the area the construction activities in the sea area
destroy some whitefish and herring spawning areas in the dredging areas the sea in front of hanhikivi
headland is significant both in terms of the fish stock and in terms of fishery and there are professional
fishermen whose livelihood the project will affect negatively

in 2016 fishery and fishing industry monitoring were conducted as required in the water permits the
purpose of the monitoring is to assess the impacts that the water construction works cause to fishery the
monitoring included a survey of professional fishermen fry production surveys of whitefish vendace and
herring and experimental net fishing

fennovoima

sea water quality monitoring
fennovoima continued sea water quality monitoring at the sea area the water samples are taken five
times in a year at six monitoring points located around the hanhikivi headland

based on obligations in water permits turbidity monitoring began again on august 10 2016 before the
dredging work was commenced turbidity monitoring continued until november 16 2016 turbidity was
monitored at six monitoring points of which two were located in the marine spoil area approximately 10           dredging work at the sea area
km from the hanhikivi headland and four were near the hanhikivi headland                                         in front of hanhikivi headland in
                                                                                                                  fall 2016
in connection with the dredging work conducted by a subsupplier there were four oil spills at the coast of
the hanhikivi headland in september and october 2016

   september 6  gear oil spilled after a propulsion unit hit an underwater obstacle 300 liters
   september 16  hydraulic oil spilled after a mechanical failure in a barge hoppers hydraulic system
   50 liters
   september 22  gear oil spilled from the propulsion unit after the vessel grounded 30 litres
   october 6  gear oil spilled after propulsion unit hit an underwater obstacle 105 liters

based on the dilution and harmfulness of the substance in question the oil spills did not cause any
permanent damage to the environment no oil was found on the shoreline of the hanhikivi headland
which indicates that no harm was caused to the nearby flora and fauna fennovoima suspended the
dredging work until a detailed report about the accident was received and the required corrective
measures and practices were taken

prior to the commencement of the dredging work in spring 2017 more emphasis is placed on the proactive
prevention measures of all environmental accidents fennovoima the plant supplier raos project oy the
main contractor titan2 and the dredging company have established a steering group for the dredging
work the thorough analysis of the accidents has resulted in improved prevention of environmental
accidents and preparedness to act in similar situations the oil spill response plan for the construction site
was prepared together with the plant supplier and it has been communicated to the authorities all
contractors at the plant site are obliged to follow the oil spill response plan




flora fauna and protected areas
the direct impacts of the project during the construction phase affect the area in which the buildings and
structures of the nuclear power plant and various related functions are built the main part of the
construction efforts will take place in an area of about 1 km2 in the central part of the hanhikivi headland

as a result of the construction the forest and coastal areas will change partially into built environment and
the species and habitat types found in the immediate environment of the built areas may change over the
short or the long term construction work has also resulted in the fragmentation of continuous shore and          yellow iris iris pseudacorus
forest areas during the construction phase the indirect impact of the noise and dust from the construction
site and the related traffic and the vibration from blasts and excavation will affect the surrounding nature

the hanhikivi headlands nature conservation areas and areas defined as habitat types protected under
the nature conservation act remain outside the constructed areas and construction work will not have any
significant adverse impacts on these areas

construction workers are instructed and trained to avoid moving in the areas outside the site fence

more information about protected areas can be found in the nature conservation section

fennovoima

air quality
dust and emissions from traffic affect the air quality the impacts are however local and are estimated to
have no major impacts on the protected areas in the hanhikivi headland
                                                                                                                 no increase in
the earthwork traffic at the site and certain operations such as rock crushing will generate dust during
                                                                                                                 the dust levels
the construction of the nuclear power plant most dust sources will be located at low elevation levels so the
dust cannot spread far and its impact on air quality will mainly be limited to the construction site

the impacts of traffic emissions are very local and their impacts on the air quality will depend in addition
to the emission volumes on the traffic routes used

the residential areas by these roads are mostly located at distances from the road where the increase in
the contaminant concentrations will have no significance the residential building closest to the new road in
the hanhikivi headland is located approximately 300 meters from the road while the rest of the residential
buildings are located at the distance of some 051 kilometers

to decrease emissions from traffic fennovoima has paved the access road that connects the plant site to
highway 8 with asphalt and set a speed limit of 30 kmh for the construction area and 40 kmh for the road
that leads to fennovoimas plant site office generation of road dust at the plant site is also decreased by
irrigation

results
dust monitoring was started in 2015 and continued in 2016 fennovoima has conducted dust monitoring
especially near the nature conservation areas no increase in the dust levels have been detected since the
beginning of the monitoring




noise
according to noise modelling the noise caused by the project will remain below the guideline values set for
residential areas and areas including holiday residences both during construction and the operation of the
                                                                                                                 average noise

average noise levels at different measuring points have been 3065 db during 2016 same level as 2015
the noise level has varied according to the location of the measuring point and the time of day day versus
night time the individual peaks in the noise level are usually explained by the weather conditions such as
strong wind or heavy rain

nature conservation

the nature conservation areas and other valuable natural sites located in the
vicinity of the construction site area are outside the construction site fence and
some of the most valuable areas are isolated with separate fences this is to
ensure protected areas and preservation of the natural values

waste management at the construction
site

during the construction phase management of construction waste will be arranged
in accordance with the environmental guidelines in order to minimize the impacts
of the waste and its treatment on the environment




the primary objective is to reduce the amount of waste that is generated the
secondary option is to utilize waste in new applications and in the production of
materials or energy the last option is to appropriately dispose of the waste in a
landfill site
construction waste management is based on efficient sorting of waste at the site of its generation as well
as on uniform and efficient instruction of the various parties and companies operating at the plant site on
appropriate waste management procedures

waste generated during construction will be appropriately sorted and recycled or utilized in energy
production as far as possible the earthmoving excavation and dredging masses generated during the
construction phase will be utilized as far as possible in various onsite filling and levelling operations the
handling storage and transportation of hazardous waste will be arranged in accordance with the
regulations

fennovoima

85  utilization target in construction waste management
during 2016 waste management was small scale because the construction work at the plant site was still
at an early stage a temporary waste collection point was taken into use to emphasize construction waste
management before that each contractor has been responsible for their own waste management
according to the instructions of sorting the construction waste

the majority of waste from the construction site consists of normal construction waste in different
categories of waste metal wood concrete rock energy mixed construction waste bio waste paper
cardboard glass and weee

our target of 85  of construction waste fractions to be utilized as material or energy was exceeded

drainage water treatment
raos project began excavation works of the reactor pit area in spring 2016 and by the end of the year
reached the level of 20 meters a total of 58447 m3 of drainage water from the reactor pit was treated
with temporary container settling after which it was discharged into the sea water from the reactor pit
caused temporary turbidity of sea water near the discharge point water quality was monitored by taking
monthly samples and turbidity of sea water was visually monitored

drainage water is visually monitored also at fennovoimas excess soil area samples of the drainage water
are taken every three years next time in 2018 the first water samples were taken when the excess soil
area was taken into use in 2015 ditch expansions and small rock dams have been constructed which
delay the water flow and allow particles to settle from the drainage water

during 2016 fennovoima has built a comprehensive ditch system to the construction site to manage and
collect the accumulated storm water the ditches direct the storm water to the sea fennovoima has also
built a storm water ditch outside the plant site to puustellintie to ease the accumulation of melt water
during spring time the ditch has no connection to the sea directly only during high tide
