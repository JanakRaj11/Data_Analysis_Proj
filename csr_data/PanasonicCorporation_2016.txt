fundamental stance
panasonics founder konosuke matsushita coined numerous aphorisms which are still used at the company hardship
now pleasure later the source of our failures is within us there are signs before all things and small things can
create big problems one must be alert to signs of change and act accordingly among many others using these ideas as
a cornerstone in its thinking the company conducts groupwide risk management activities covering its operations around
the world with the aim of taking preemptive actions to eliminate sources of failurethat is any factors that could impede
the accomplishment of business goals

company believes that by combining these two functions it is better positioned to accomplish its business objectives and
to increase its corporate value furthermore by disclosing appropriate information concerning risks to the public improving
the transparency of its management and reducing risks through preemptive measures the company gives its customers
and other stakeholdersas well as local communities and the public as a wholegreater confidence in its organization

basic framework
panasonic has three levels of management cycles for risk management the gg risk management committee four
panasonic companies and business divisions each year an assessment of the impact of risks that could affect the
business management of companies and affiliated business divisions is undertaken using a single global set of standards
incorporating the potential impact on business operations probability of risk occurring and other factors steps are then
taken to identify major company risks and to ensure that appropriate countermeasures are implemented taking into
consideration these major company risks the gg risk management committee considers and identifies those major
risks that require attention from a groupwide perspective the gg risk management committee also monitors progress
made concerning countermeasures as a means to improve and strengthen groupwide risk management

increasing risk sensitivity
the gg risk management committee systematically educates and raises awareness among panasonic group
employees to ensure the thorough dissemination of knowledge of basic policies on risk management and for these to be
put into practice in addition to disseminating information to all employees through internal communications on its activities
selected corporate major risks and the progress of measures for handling those risks the gg risk management
committee provides annual seminars on risk assessment for managers in charge of risk management promotion the
committee aims to increase the level of skills for the effective conducting of risk assessments by explaining panasonics
basic policy on risk management the risk management guidelines

in addition to prevent risks from becoming even more severe when they have manifested and responses have been
insufficient the committee issues guidelines for business unit directors on responding to risk occurence to the
business unit directors and ensures that these guidelines are put in place thoroughly the committee improves the ability
to handle risks on the ground overseas by providing training on the essentials of risk management how to respond when
risks have manifested and related matters for newly appointed presidents of overseas affiliates and for employees who are
about to be posted overseas

the committee has organized hotlines as a mechanism for employees to report latent risks regarding matters such as
compliance violations various forms of workplace harassment and improprieties in procurement processes employees
and suppliers are able to report any perceived problem independently and at any time the company has also established
a mechanism by which all employees can independently report latent compliancerelated risks in the workplace through
annually conducted compliance awareness surveys feedback concerning reported risks is provided to each workplace
and these risks are dealt with


initiatives relating to business continuity management bcm
as a public entity of society panasonic has established as part of its management philosophy that it will contribute to the
advancement of world culture by working to improve the quality of life of society through the products that it produces and
sells since 2005 the company has been keenly aware of the necessity of activities relating to business continuityone of
the companys duties to society the company thus engages in business continuity management bcm whose goal is to
prevent a halt to the supply of products or the provision of services when contingencies such as disasters have occurred
or in the rare event that service has halted to restart operations as quickly as possible

specifically if disasters or other incidents were to occur within our supply chain they would impact the production or sales
of our group companies in the case of btob this impact would also affect the production and sales of companies to which
we deliver this is why panasonic believes it is critical to have bcm that includes our supply chain

for this reason we have conducted a hazard survey of various risks posed by natural disasters in countries around the
worldearthquakes floods tropical depressions tsunamis naturally occurring fires landslides tornadoes and volcanic
eruptions we have also shared these findings with each of the four companies and have put priorityranked measures
in place both within our own group and in our supply chain we also work hard to obtain information on disasters
and incidents and to respond swiftly in real time both in order to confirm the safety of our employees and to provide
uninterrupted supply to customer companies

forecasts indicate a high probability of a major earthquake in japan directly under the tokyo metropolitan area or in the
nankai trough within the next 30 years in response to these predictions panasonic has established a crosscompany
task force which is promoting earthquake resistance and disaster responses based on the latest government damage
predictions the task force conducts annual groupwide disasterpreparedness training drills it has established emergency
response headquarters at every level of the group within the four companies and within business divisions these
headquarters are intended to maintain and improve panasonics initial response capabilitiesincluding confirmation of the
safety of employees and reporting among different emergency response headquarters on the degree of damage

in terms of procurement activities we also manage the securing of replacement sourcing and the building up of inventory
for emergencies based on evaluations of the criticality and interchangeability of procured parts

concerning fires the task force conducts periodic fire risk assessments independent fire prevention checks and fire
prevention audits and strives to prevent similar accidents from occurring again by sharing case studies of dealing with fire
related accidents

                                                                            10

environment policy

environmental policy
contributing to society has been the management philosophy for panasonic ever since its founding and we have been
taking measures against pollution since the 1970s we announced the environmental statement in june 5 1991 clarifying
our approaches to address global environmental issues as a public entity of society since then we have been carrying
out initiatives including matters on global warming prevention and resources recycling corporatewide aiming to attain a
sustainable safe and secure society

in fiscal 2014 the panasonic group introduced a new brand slogan a better life a better world aiming to realize a
better life for all its customers and is promoting environmental initiatives as an important element in achieving that goal
in production activities exhaustive energysaving measures have been implemented in all factories worldwide pushing
for further co2 emissions reduction in our production activities we are also pursuing recyclingoriented manufacturing
for effective utilization of resources one example is the development of a resources recycling and trade scheme together
with our supplier in which scrap iron from used home appliances is recycled into steel plates to be used as material for
products by our group

in addition panasonic has introduced its own indicator called the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions to
strengthen co2 reduction efforts during actual product use until now the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
had been disclosed to represent the volume of our direct contribution to co2 emissions reduction by cutting down power
consumption during product use through energysaving designs for our key consumer products now we are also engaged
in business development in the areas of housing automotive and b2b accordingly more of our products are being
integrated into finished goods and services of other companies contributing to their energysaving performances for this
reason we have defined the co2 emissions reduction effect in these business areas as the size of indirect contribution to
reduction and disclosed the figures from the fiscal 2015 results

furthermore we define our products and services that accelerate the transition to a sustainable society such as energy
saving performances as strategic green products gps of these we call the products that deliver the industrys top
class environmental performance super gps and are actively working for business expansion by promoting wider use
we aim to contribute to further reduction of co2 emissions

environmental action plan green plan 2018
after the completion of the green plan 2010 which was established in 2001 the green plan 2018 was established in 2010
to clarify our targets for fiscal 2019 from april 1 2018 to march 31 2019 as well as an action plan for all employees
in order to achieve the targets the green plan 2018 will continue our initiatives in five areas co2 reduction resources
recycling water chemical substances and biodiversity

the green plan 2018 was revised in 2013 followed by the newlyestablished environmental action guideline
furthermore in response to rising demand by the society for co2 reductions following the 21st session of the conference
of the parties cop21 of the united nations conference on climate change and to the need to make changes to our
business structure including growth in the automotive and b2b businesses the plan was revised again in 2016

in the area of co2 reduction we are focused on maximizing the size of our contribution to reducing co2 emissions which
is an indicator that represents our efforts for co2 reduction as well as on steady and continual reduction in co2 emissions
from our factories to contribute to making net co2 emissions from the entire community peak and decline thereafter at an
earlier timing as our contribution to reducing co2 emissions is expanding not only in our key consumer products but in
housing automotive and b2b businesses the revised green plan 2018 clearly stated the target amount of co2 reduction
to clarify our contribution in these areas the revised green plan 2018 also defines our target for active use of renewable
energy as for resources recycling we promote higher recycled resource utilization ratio and factory waste recycling rate

                                                                            12

as well as create more resources recyclingoriented products to materialize recyclingoriented manufacturing

in addition the revised green plan 2018 has set new targets such as 100 completion of water risk assessments for our
factories it also clearly states zero violation of laws and regulations by factories and products

in the area of ecoconscious products and businesses we have expanded the scope of our activities to products services
and solutions in our b2b business while applying our strengths in home appliances the concrete numerical targets
established in line with the revisions to the green plan 2018 are aimed at creating environmental value for our customers
panasonic will deepen the collaboration with various partners across the supply chain and accelerate environmental
initiatives to extend better impacts on the society

we will steadily execute this environmental action plan towards achieving our fiscal 2019 targets

environment environmental management systems

environmental sustainability management founded on environmental
management systems ems
as the foundation of environmental sustainability management panasonic established ems in all of our manufacturing sites
across the world in fiscal 1999 and has continued to have the sites iso14001 certified since then

in order to further reinforce environmental sustainability management globally we have established ems in all our sites
including nonmanufacturing sites across the world and these sites have certified iso14001 in principle in october
2011 we published the environmental management system establishment guidelines that summarize ems concepts for
different business forms such as manufacturing sales and services and head office administration aiming to build ems in
accordance with the basic rules for environmental affairs on a global scale based on the guidelines groupwide action is
underway to achieve the goals set out in the green plan 2018

the revisions to iso 14001 in september 2015 called for consolidation of
environmental and business activities as well as for actions from a wider
perspective with actions necessary within three years of the revision in
house seminars discussion meetings and lectures on the transition to the
2015 version by outside experts are being held at each company and business
division also with top management required to take on greater responsibility in
their participation in environmental management efforts are being directed to
upgrading management awareness through the development of study materials
customized for top management our activities will be strengthened further

environment environmental risk management

groupwide systems to manage environmental risks
as a tool to continuously reduce environmental risks panasonic has established an environmental risk management
system specific to each company in accordance with the basic risk management policy for all companies see page 8
we promote 1 identification of environmental risks and groupwide risk management each year and 2 ensuring quick
responses to reported environmental risks

to identify environmental risks and implement the management system environmental risks are identified for each
company and for each region in the world each year from these risks environmental risks on a groupwide level are
selected the risks that show a high level of frequency or seriously impact business management are designated as major
risks and prioritized in planning and executing riskreducing measures these measures are implemented for each major
risk and progress is monitored and followed up on a quarterly basis in the pdca cycle

when an environmental risk is found the relevant company related job functions and regional headquarters collaborate
to promptly implement emergency measures and recurrence prevention measures adapted to the risk level also the
management flow in case of risk discovery is standardized to prevent the occurrence of secondary risks as a result of

environmental compliance management at factories
panasonic manages its environmental systems in full compliance with laws and regulations we regularly measure emissions
of gas wastewater noise odor etc and introduce preventative measures for cases that may lead to serious violations

furthermore key human resources are developed for information sharing among the companiesbusiness divisions
environmentrelated job functions and regional headquarters to ensure exhaustive compliance with legislation related to
factory environment management in respective countries where panasonic manufacturing sites are located specifically
activities to share information as well as specialized training is conducted for factory management officers in charge of the
management of chemical substances waste wastewater and exhaust gas either by country or by region in japan europe
china and southeast asia in addition field surveys were conducted on a global scale to confirm thorough implementation
of environmental compliance and we also started verifying the effectiveness of various measures

however in fiscal 2016 there were eight violations of environmentrelated legislation outside japan in response they
were reported promptly to the administrative authorities and measures to address the causes were implemented we will
continue to ensure compliance with legislation as well as prevent recurrence

cases of violations of laws and ordinances such as exceeding the standard legal level etc in fiscal 2016

measures against soil and groundwater contamination
in the latter half of the 1980s soil and groundwater contamination due to chlorinated organic solvents was detected at
some panasonic sites in response we have conducted anticontamination activities across the company specifically
in 1991 we created the manual for preventing contamination of soil and groundwater and began conducting necessary
surveys and measures in 1995 we discontinued the use of chlorinated organic solvents and in 1999 created guidelines
on the prevention of environmental pollution to ensure there would be no recurrence of similar problems at our sites in
fiscal 2003 we began enhancing our surveys and measures to comply with relevant laws and regulations including the
soil contamination countermeasures act which was enforced in japan in 2003 and in fiscal 2004 started implementing
measures to place all our bases across the globe under management supervision with regard to soil and groundwater

specifically we conduct onsite inspections and interviews at the bases in addition to surveying their use of vocs and
heavy metals furthermore we implement surface soil surveys within the premises for the sites where contamination was
detected beyond the regulatory pollution standards we conduct detailed borehole surveys to identify the boundaries of the
contaminated areas and take remedial measures

as a result of these efforts we were able to place all our bases under management supervision in 2008 furthermore in
fiscal 2011 the management supervision scheme was purposespecifically reorganized and reinforced to establish a new
management supervision scheme with the highest priority given to preventing dispersion of pollution beyond our premises
this new scheme is implemented across all operating sites to further improve the level of measures against contamination

in fiscal 2016 two new soil contaminations were detected at panasonic sites as a result of soil surveys in land utilization
reviews we confirmed that there is no possibility of external dispersion and have completed the purification

overview of environmental impact from business operation
in order to mainly manufacture and market electrical and electronic products panasonic consumes petroleum and
electricity as energy sources and resources as raw materials of parts and components as a result we emit co2 and waste
into the environment this diagram maps the environmental impact from our business operation from a procurement stage
to recycling activities also ghg throughout the entire supply chain is classified into scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 and
assessed according to the ghg protocol the international calculation standard

expanding the scope of strategic gps
panasonic has been devoting much of its energies into the creation of no 1 ecoconscious products superior gps until
fiscal 2013 in the course of business reorganizations such as expansion of b2b businesses panasonic has decided not
only to pursue environmental performance of consumer products but also to work on further expansion of products and
services that lead to the mitigation of environmental impact starting in fiscal 2014 the concept of strategic gps has been
introduced for the creation of such products and services in addition to alleviating impact on the global environment with
toplevel environmental performance we aim to accelerate the drive to shift to a sustainable society through a variety of
business operations including those that are expected to reduce impacts through wider dissemination and those directly
cutting impact in specified regions

the ratio of strategic gps rose from approx 19 in fiscal 2015 to 21 in fiscal 2016 we will work to further push up this
ratio in the future


of the strategic gps the following two were named super gps for fiscal 2016namely highreliability pb 0 added zinc
carbon batteries for its environmental performance ranking at the top class in the industry and the led highceiling lighting
and led flood light projector that can cut down environmental impact dramatically

 led flood light projector module type

zinc carbon batteries that are in wide use in
developing and emerging countries commonly require
the addition of lead to assure quality however
because lead is a material with a high environmental
impact recycling is very difficult for this reason
panasonic developed a technology that assures the
quality and reliability of zinc carbon battery that                       highreliability pb 0 added zinc carbon batteries
does not contain lead and has made a head start
in introducing the technology on a global scale it is
an ecoconscious product that responds to increasingly
stricter environmental regulations as well as demands of
ecoconscious consumers in countries around the world


in addition to this the led highceiling lighting and led
flood light projector are an expansion of panasonics
product lineup in this area which had centered on
products integrating the light source and its fixture              led highceiling lighting with      led flood light projector
                                                                    dispersion panel module type      module type
notwithstanding the dramatic improvement in energy
conservation compared to products using an hid light
source the products chosen as super gps for fiscal 2016 are modular in design to create a wider variation in fixture style
light distribution and brightness they can also easily replace existing lighting systems and contribute to wider led use for
high ceiling lighting and projector systems

initiatives for ecoconscious factories green factories
panasonic is working on green factories gf activities in its efforts to cut down environmental impact caused by
manufacturing specifically based on legal compliance each factory develops a variety of plans for reducing environmental
impact in production activities focusing on co2 emissions total waste generation water consumption and chemical
substance releases and transfers progress control is implemented and improved through total emissions reduction and
specific unit management to achieve both environmental impact reduction and business management

the gf assessment system was introduced in fiscal 2011 aiming for further advancement by visualizing the activity levels
at factories under the system the factories evaluate themselves on a onetofive scale across 19 environmental activity
items classified into six basic groups emissions reduction environmental performance enhancement reduction activities risk
reduction human resource development and management comparing the progress with other sites and implementing relative
assessment enables the factory to identify issues and voluntarily reviewpromote measures for improvement in fiscal 2014 the
system was upgraded to enable the addition of further assessment items to the existing 19 based on the companys needs

for regular checks on the progress state of subordinate factories and to lead to greater improvements companies share
the best practices implemented at similar factories as well as management knowhow corporatewide to upgrade the
efforts to higher levels through continuous improvement the case studies on reduction implemented at each factory are
registered in the beforeafter ba chart search system and updated for application at other factories presently more
than 2700 cases are registered

additionally information exchanges among factories within each country human resource development and gf promotion
activities on regional issues such as in asia and europe are underway through the manufacturing environmental information
sharing group information on global activities for environmental impact reduction legislation and social trends are shared
and discussions are held to resolve issues in gf promotion outside japan information exchanges are promoted within
each country and region where panasonic factories are located such as in europe southeast asia and china especially in
southeast asia where there are many panasonic plants and diverse legislative frameworks and issues that vary by country
competitions in best practices for environmental impact reduction presentation of awards for best practices and activities for
horizontal promotion covering all factories in the region are held to boost and accelerate action in this direction

furthermore in order to support these gf activities respective regional headquarters companies and related divisions
in each region are working on various human resource development programs every year in their respective regions
training programs are being organized including those on energy conservation management of chemical substances and
waste management which are in great demand in china and southeast asia where panasonic has many sites special
training programs on environmental laws and regulations are being held especially in china to ensure compliance with the
legislation being strengthened at great speed

environment co2 reduction

size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
at the 21st session of the conference of the parties cop21 of the united nations conference on climate change held
in novemberdecember 2015 the paris agreement was adopted which limits global temperature increases to less than
2c above preindustrial levels and a more ambitious target of keeping global temperature increases to less than 15c
above preindustrial levels as well as setting the goal for co2 and other greenhouse gas emission levels for the second half
of this century to be virtually zero in order to achieve this co2 emissions should peak out to reach a peak and decline
thereafter as soon as possible with this background companies are asked to contribute to reducing co2 more than ever

panasonic has introduced a unique indicator size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions to accelerate emissions
reduction targeting both our products for energy saving and energy creation and production activities the size of
contribution in reducing co2 emissions is defined as the amount achieved by deducting the actual emissions from the
amount that would have been emitted without the improvements by the energysaving performance of our products and
productivity from fiscal 2006 and this amount is combined with the emission reduction resulting from power generation
by energycreating products in other words it reflects the continuous efforts being made to reduce co2 emissions
panasonic will continue to maximize the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions


we will improve the energysaving performance of our products to reduce the energy consumed in using the products
the more energysaving products are introduced and promoted the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions will
further increase

meanwhile since fiscal 2014 panasonic has been reinforcing its housing automotive and b2b businesses and is
disclosing the co2 reduction effect results in these areas from fiscal 2015 specifically the data represents air conditioning
load reduction effects from improved insulation performance in panasonic housing energysaving effects from products
by other companies equipped with panasonic energysaving compressors and motors and improved fuel economy
effects from electric vehicles equipped with panasonic automotive batteries beginning with the results for fiscal 2016
we will calculate and disclose the co2 reduction from the energysaving effect of products by other manufacturers using
panasonic vacuum insulation materials as with the calculation of energysaving effects of our home appliances the
calculation of the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions through these effects is based on comparison with the
performances of fiscal 2006 we regard such contribution in reducing co2 emissions as indirect contribution to reducing
co2 emissions to distinguish them from the direct contribution from products under the panasonic brand such as home
appliances this represents the fact that the energysaving effect does not come from our finished products themselves
but that our products support the co2 reduction effects for products by other manufacturers

8 factories whose nominal energy consumption per basic unit of production had increased from the fiscal 2006 level due to sharp declines in
                 product prices recorded negative figures in the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions for the size of contribution made by factories
                 consolidated or sold in fiscal 2007 onwards co2 emissions in fiscal 2006 were used for the calculation for factories purchased co2 emissions
                 in fiscal 2006 were not deemed as a negative contribution
9 co2 emissions per basic unit for fiscal 2006 were used for factories acquired while for factories newly constructed the co2 emissions per basic
                 unit for the fiscal year in which they were constructed were used
10 the factors related to fuels are based on the guideline for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions version 22 published by the japanese
                          ministry of the environment the co2 emission factor for electricity purchased in japan kgco2kwh is fixed at 0410 the factors above

contribution in reducing co2 emissions through energycreating products
we actively develop our energy creation business to maximize the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions by
delivering photovoltaic power generation systems and household fuel cell cogeneration systems as means to create
necessary electricity with few co2 emissions we reduce co2 emissions in society

the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions through energycreating products in fiscal 2016 fell to 492 million tons
due to a slowdown in the photovoltaic power generation system business within japan however japan accounts for the
vast majority by region

environment global warming mitigation and adaptation

global warming mitigation
while people seek for affluent lifestyles the acceleration of global warming caused by the increase in co2 emissions
from peoples daily lives and corporate activities is becoming a concern panasonic promotes measures to mitigate the
progress of climate change and to minimize the impact by reducing the greenhouse gases emitted from its products and
services as well as production activities

as measures to mitigate the impact of our products and services we offer energymanagement products and solutions
that link and control a range of energysavingcreatingstoring products at the same time panahome corporation has
set a target to build 26 of the detached houses commissioned for fiscal 2017 68 of those for fiscal 2019 and 80 of
those for fiscal 2021 as netzero energy houses zeh1 whose balance of energy consumption and creation remains at
zero or nearly zeh2

in addition to these energy management solutions in the housing area the panasonic group is also promoting smart
town projects in fujisawa city and yokohama city in kanagawa prefecture

more details on reducing co2 emissions at our factories and offices can be found on pages 3741 for details on
reducing co2 emissions in logistics see pages 4244
1 a zeh is a house designed to produce netzero or nearly zero consumption of primary energy per year by improving the energysaving
  performance of the housing structure and equipment and utilizing energy efficient means such as renewable energy the japanese government
  aims to make zeh as the standard for new houses by 2020
2 a house that reduces its primary energy consumption per year by 75 to less than 100 by utilizing energy efficient means such as renewable
  energy

global warming adaptation
panasonic is also making efforts for adaptation to address unavoidable impacts on the
global environment that cannot be addressed by mitigation measures such adaptation
is based on the matters indicated by the intergovernmental panel on climate change
ipcc etc focusing on the impact of climate change on the ecosystem society and the
economy further we understand that it is important for the measures to take account of
regional characteristics as impacts of climate change vary according to the region

environment global warming prevention at factories and offices

contribution in reducing co2 emissions through production activities
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in factories with the aim of contributing to climate change mitigation as well
as improving production efficiency in factories and reducing energy costs

in fiscal 2008 we set a companywide business goal to reduce co2 emissions by 03 million tons in fiscal 2010 compared
to fiscal 2007 as a result of our unified efforts we achieved 084 million tons in co2 emissions reduction surpassing our
target figure since fiscal 2011 we have been using our unique indicator the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
see pages 3032 to further improve our energy management capabilities and reduce the co2 emissions per basic unit
aiming towards maximizing the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions in production activities in addition to
individual efforts implemented in each factory energysaving and co2 emission reduction measures including horizontal
introduction of good examples across the company specialist training and co2 itakona initiatives1 are promoted
the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions in production activities achieved in fiscal 2016 was 326 million tons
compared with the fiscal 2006 level furthermore we are also reducing energy consumption our investment in co2
emissions reduction in fiscal 2016 was 32 billion yen2

panasonic is a member of keidanrens commitment to a low carbon society a voluntary action program for global
warming prevention across the entire electric and electronic industry with the targets set aiming at 2030 specifically
we are steadily implementing energysaving measures in factories and offices in order to achieve the goals set by the
industry in japan aiming improvement in energy consumption rate in factories and large offices at an annual rate of 1 on
average towards 2030 we are also working to expand contributions to energy conservation in other industries through our
products and components
1 itakona is a term unique to panasonic which refers to a process by which we review stages prior to production to study raw materials to
  ensure waste is minimized and quality is maintained we apply a similar review process for our co2 emissions reduction efforts and call these our
  co2 itakona initiatives the activity is aimed at discovering energy conservation measures from a new viewpoint through continuous display of
  energy consumption levels energy consumption per basic unit and analyzing the factors that influence the variables in each basic unit
2 includes all investments concerning co2 emissions reduction differences or appropriate portions are not calculated

3 calculated with the weighted average of the improvement rate for co2 emissions per basic unit of nominal production for each factory the
  amount of co2 emitted from each factory was used for weighting cases that had no improvements basic unit of fiscal 2006 was converted into
  an index as 100
4 increase in co2 emissions per basic unit in fiscal 2013 2014 and 2016 is due to the decline in production volume which was more than the
  amount of co2 emissions reduced through various efforts
5 the factors related to fuels are based on the guidelines for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions version 22 published by the japanese
  ministry of the environment the co2 emission factor kgco2kwh for electricity purchased in japan in each fiscal year is fixed at 0410 to
  accurately reflect efforts for co2 emissions reduction if the factors set for each fiscal year are used instead 0425 for fiscal 2006 0476 for fiscal
  2012 0487 for fiscal 2013 057 for fiscal 2014 and 2015 and 055 for fiscal 2016 total co2 emissions will be 463 million tons for fiscal 2006 381

display of energy consumption per basic unit of production and analyzing the factors that influence the variables in each
basic unit

in order to accelerate action under the co2 itakona initiative we developed the senavi software that displays energy
and production data simultaneously and analyze energy consumption per basic unit the energysaving navigation
function of this software quantitatively extracts energy loss per device as well as loss per factor based on the automatic
energy loss analysis results through co2 itakona analysis with this function energysaving efforts prioritizing processes
with large energy loss have been made easier 

conventionally energy consumption and other data had been analyzed manually by specialists in order to develop energy
conservation measures this function automatically analyzes data and enables users to consider energy conservation
measures based on the energysaving measure database not only did this contribute to a reduction in working time but
also to the identification of energysaving measures without the assistance of specialists
 an example of factory energy conservation support service is introduced in the following website

6 metageji is a term unique to panasonic which refers to visualizing energy consumption and implementing measurable reduction initiatives by
  introducing measurement instruments such as meters and gauges



utilization of renewable energy
panasonic actively and globally promotes renewable energy usage in the
industry by employing renewable energy such as photovoltaic power generation
in our business activities while at the same time reducing co2 emissions we
set a target of 10000 mwh of renewable energy utilization in our company by
fiscal 2019 when we revised green plan 2018 our environmental action plan in
2016 we are now striving to achieve this target across the world as a specific
example we installed a photovoltaic power generation system with a capacity
of 24 mw in a factory of panasonic appliances refrigeration devices singapore
paprdsg in october 2015 along with the existing photovoltaic system the
                                                                                    paprdsg photovoltaic power generation system
total power that can be generated in the factory is now 28 mw and is expected
to power 10 of the factorys entire operations at its peak the system was
installed through a leasing agreement with sunseap the largest clean energy provider in singapore

as a result of such efforts our power generation from renewable energy across the entire company7 reached 711 million

reducing co2 emissions in logistics
to contribute to the prevention of global warming as well as to improve transportation efficiency while reducing costs
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in logistics we have set the targets of reducing co2 emissions per basic
unit1 by at least 1 yearonyear and by 46 from the fiscal 2006 level by fiscal 2019 focusing on modal shift introduction
of lowemission vehicles and biodiesel fuel reduction in transportation distances and improvement in load factor

in fiscal 2016 our global co2 emissions from logistics activities came to 086 million tons across the world of which
international transportation was 033 million tons 38 and domestic transportation within japan was 0132 million tons
15 co2 emissions per basic unit improved by 6 from the previous fiscal year due to the decrease in international air
freight resulting in a reduction of 39 from the fiscal 2006 level
1 co2 emissions per transportation weight the scope covers both international and domestic transportations

modal shift 2 initiative in collaboration with logistics partners
panasonic promotes modal shift in transportation from trucks to railroad in order to reduce co2 emissions

in fiscal 2016 panasonic took the initiative in modal shift collaborating with our logistics partners including mitsuisoko
logistics co ltd japan freight railway company and nippon express co ltd

conventionally we delivered cold chain equipment from gunma prefecture to
fukuoka prefecture by truck based on requests from customers however to
achieve stable product supply we established the kyushu stock point sp in
2015 because it is necessary to send and place products to the kyushu sp
under a planned schedule we changed the mode of transport from trucks to
rail and the products are stably delivered once a day on weekdays the co2
emissions reduction effects from this change are equivalent to 269 tons per year
as a result our railway transportation in japan in fiscal 2016 reached 13353
fiveton containers reducing 6906 tons of co2 emissions                                                              rail freight transportation

entered into a full recycling scheme for used stretch
film with nozoe industry inc nozoe in fiscal 2015

and are continuing the initiative in fiscal 2016 the
stretch film used for our transport was previously
discarded but is now recycled by nozoe as a material
for plastic garbage bags which we then purchase
a total of 155 tons of stretching film was recycled in                               nozoe                                      panasonic

                                                                                                   uses it for transportation


shifting to direct delivery of products
panasonic is currently expanding direct delivery of products to our corporate customers such as home appliance mass
retailers aiming for higher efficiency in transporting products although we conventionally distributed our products from
factories to logistics hubs and then transported the products to corporate customers we are now changing this method to
directly deliver the products from our factories to customers in fiscal 2016 we expanded this scheme in washing machine
logistics previously washing machines produced in the fukuroi factory in shizuoka prefecture were transported to the
west japan global logistics center glc in amagasaki city in hyogo prefecture or to the east japan glc in urayasu
city in chiba prefecture and then delivered to mass retailers and other customers now we have increased the number
of direct delivery from the fukuroi factory to inventory bases of mass retailers a shorter transportation distance not only
reduces co2 emissions but also reduces the number of circuitous routes to these warehouses as well as overall costs for
inbound and outbound deliveries and storage through this scheme we reduced 989 tons of co2 emissions per year we
will expand this scheme for delivering refrigerators tvs and air conditioners which all have high volumes of transportation
to meet a wider range of orders as well as for products with lower traffic volumes

environment resources recycling

recyclingoriented manufacturing
with swift economic growth advancing worldwide and bringing heightened attention to concerns over resources the
sourcing of new resources and materials not only significantly impact the environment but mineral resource depletion and
material pricing runup have also become issues

to address these concerns and as a responsibility of a manufacturer that uses a large volume of resources panasonic
has been propelling recyclingoriented manufacturing under the theme of recycling resources since 2010 placing it as an
important issue along with co2 emissions reduction

recyclingoriented manufacturing has three aspects under this concept which are to minimize the amount of total
resources used and maximize the amount of recycled resources aim towards zero waste emissions by reducing our
landfill of waste from production activities and recycle used products

we have been working on the weight reduction and downsizing of products to minimize the total resources used and are
continuing to increase resource collection through introduction of new recycling technologies and systems to expand the
usage of recycled resources

furthermore by reducing the amount of factory waste and thoroughly recycling resources from waste we are working to
eliminate the amount of waste treated in landfills to as close to zero

in addition to utilizing the resources that were previously wasted across the entire production process we have established
a process where resources are recovered from used products recycled into products and further delivered to customers
to realize sustainable business activities throughout the product life cycle

we use many kinds of resources including iron 27 of total resources used and plastic 10 of total resources used
due to our wide range of products and businesses from home appliances components such as semiconductors and
batteries to housing in recyclingoriented manufacturing it is important to promote the reduction of total resources used
and at the same time develop a recycling process according to the specific characteristics of each resource for expansion
of our usage of recycled resources

furthermore we clarify recycled resource utilization issues by identifying the volume of each type of resource used across
the panasonic group for example in the case of recycled plastic we used approx 18700 tons of recycled plastic in
our products in fiscal 2016 by identifying the characteristics required in the materials to be used securing a stable supply
researching how to recycle it in production and developing new recycling technologies the amounts of total resources
used and recycled resources used in panasonic are both on the decrease however the recycled resource utilization ratio1
in fiscal 2016 marked 169 which is higher than that of the previous fiscal year due to increased usage of recycled resin
and recycled steel plates we will continue to work on further reducing total resources used and maximizing utilization of
recycled resources to maintain and improve our recycled resource utilization ratio

in addition as for the recycling rate of waste at factories we had traditionally set different targets for japan and countries
outside japan according to the relevant local infrastructures however with the awareness of the importance of zero
waste emission activities we have set a globally standardized target since fiscal 2011 and are taking steps to improve the
standard level of waste recycling across the entire group the factory waste recycling rate2 was 992 for fiscal 2016
against the target of 995 or more in fiscal 2019 see page 55

environment reduction in resources used

reducing product mass
to minimize the use of resources for production we continuously look to reduce the weight of our products

through the product environmental assessment see page 26 panasonic has been promoting resource saving from the
product planning and design stage such as using less resources making our products lighter and smaller and using less
components we also implement various measures from the standpoint of resource recycling throughout the product life
cycle such as component reuse longer durability use of recycled resources easier battery removal and labels necessary
for collectionrecycling

examples of weight reduction and recyclable product design are also introduced in the following website

environment product recycling

global initiatives for used product recycling
aiming toward the effective use of natural resources and the prevention of environmental pollution a growing number of
recycling laws have been enacted in various countries throughout the world examples include the law for recycling of
specified kinds of home appliances home appliance recycling law and the act on the promotion of effective utilization
of resources in japan the weee directive in the european union and recycling laws in many states in the united states
in china as well a similar law has been taking effect in addition to complying with the basel convention which controls
the transfer of hazardous waste to nonoecd countries as well as with related laws in respective countries we strive
to establish the most efficient recycling system in each country in view of its local recycling infrastructure including the
utilization of thirdparties


product recycling results in fiscal 2016 are as shown below due to the decrease in the volume of collection and recycling
of crt tvs and the increase of flat screen tvs the collected products are becoming more compact and lighter resulting
in a flat or downward trend in the weight

fy2016 results
    japan           recycled approx 115000 tons of four kinds of home appliances

   europe           collected approx 31000 tons of used electronic products

     usa            collected approx 7200 tons of used electronic products



product recycling initiatives in japan
in response to the home appliance recycling law of 2001 which covers four
specified kinds of home appliances we established ecology net co ltd jointly
with toshiba corporation which manages a geographically dispersed recycling
network through the effective use of existing recycling facilities nationwide the
recycling management company operates all the recyclingrelated services which
includes supervising 350 designated collection sites shared with groups a and b
and 32 recycling facilities on behalf of the group a manufacturers 18 companies
including panasonic our recycling factories panasonic eco technology center

chubu eco technology co ltd cetec1 conduct unique research to improve
our recycling processes for more efficient treatment of the four kinds of home
appliances2 and for the recovery and supply of more resources in fiscal 2016 we
recycled approx 115000 tons of the four specified home appliances

amendment of the home appliance recycling law was considered in 2014 in
order to make recycling charges clearer and lower as well as to improve recycling
rates3 as a result the statutory recycling rate4 was revised in april 2015
panasonic recycling factories are working to further enhance resource recycling by
                                                                                                             dedicated line for crushing  sorting
improving the productivity and recycling rates through efforts of applying different                         cyclopentane at petec
recycling methods according to the characteristics and materials of products

for example the number of discarded used flat screen tvs is expected to increase
significantly around the time of the tokyo olympics in 2020 and treating them
requires manual disassembly which takes much time and labor in fiscal 2016
peteck and cetec installed automatic screw removers in the disassembly
process to improve recycling productivity as for refrigerators fluorocarbons and
cyclopentane that are used as foaming agents for the insulation material cannot be
treated at the same time since the recycling processes for the two substances are
                                                                                                             nearinfrared simultaneous sorting machine for

years and petec newly established a dedicated line in 2015 to crush and sort cyclopentane to improve productivity as
well as the value of the recycled materials peteck and cetec are also adapting to various changes to respond to trends

in addition in 2014 panasonic developed a resin sorter that can simultaneously identify and sort three types of resins using
nearinfrared nir spectroscopy following installation of the sorter in petec in 2014 the same equipment was installed
in peteck and cetec this has increased the recovery volume of recycled resin whose purity is high further enhancing

recycling efforts in the europe  cis region
since its establishment we have been closely involved in the operations of the recycling electrical products industry
consortium repic a compliance scheme for electrical appliance recycling in the uk it was more than 10 years ago that
the uk originally started discussing legislation concerning waste electrical and electronic equipment weee we examined
how to establish a recycling system and other related issues and eventually established a nonprofit compliance scheme
known as repic in collaboration with other corporations repic manages almost a half of the total weight of weee in the
uk which is processed in the uk weee system

over the years we have contributed to the revised weee regulations put into effect in 2014 through working with repic
the uk government and other stakeholders the uk weee regulations previously allowed trading of evidence notes
which is proof of treated weee between schemes however the limited visibility of such trading became an issue and the
revised 2014 regulations resulted in evidence trading being abolished the change enabled schemes to have a full audit
trail of which treatment company was being used so helping to improve treatment quality and reduce unnecessary costs
we will continue to contribute to the sustainable operation of the electrical appliance recycling system in the uk through an
industry association

in 2015 we collected approx 31000 tons5 of used products covered by the weee directive across europe

the russian waste law has been amended several times the most recent amendment came into force in january 2015
comprehensive law implementation rules are still under development and panasonic is working on developing appropriate
regulations through an industry association ratek
the new executive order of december 9 2015 sets the weee collection target to 5 in 2017 the russian government
is planning to collect the recycling fee for applicable products from manufacturers uniformly in a form similar to a tax
therefore as actions against this plan ratek is working towards building efficient recycling schemes under the initiative
of manufacturers

promoting recycling activities in north america
panasonic continues its leadership role in establishing and operating a recycling system for waste batteries and consumer
electronic products in north america following the startup of a state recycling law in minnesota in july 2007 we
established the electronic manufacturers recycling management company llc mrm jointly with toshiba corporation
and sharp corporation in september of the same year and began recycling tvs pcs and other electronic equipment
with collaborative ties to several recycling companies mrm operates collection programs on behalf of 40 companies
across 20 states through more than 1600 collection bases panasonic collected approx 7200 tons of used electronic
products according to each state mandate as well as voluntary efforts in 2015 the collection results fall short of the

previous year due to the decrease in mandatory collection volume affected by the decline of sales volume

as for waste batteries we established call2recycle in 1994 jointly with other battery manufacturers and now provide
recycling programs for rechargeable batteries throughout the us and canada call2recycle provides collection programs
and a robust retail collection network for over 300 companies and collected approx 5730 tons of rechargeable batteries
in the us and canada


recycling endoflife products in canada started in 2004 with the alberta government extended producer responsibility
epr regulation since then a total of 9 provinces and one territory have legislated weee each with their own unique
parameters and requirements in an effort to harmonize these programs panasonic canada takes part in and is a leading
member of the electronic product recycling association a notforprofit management organization which was established
with the mandate to standardize operations and bring about economies of scale on a national basis through 2200
collection sitesthey are now responsible for managing all the provincial programs with the exception of alberta and the
northwest territories as both these programs are under the direct jurisdictions of their governments and not industry the
currently active provincial epr programs have proven to be very effective in diverting ewaste as reflected in last years
totals where 146423 tons were collected and resulted in an average of 432 kg per capita in canada

only the province of new brunswick and the two territories of yukon and nunavut have yet to legislate ewaste however
consultations are continuing with regulators in order to determine the best approach for these very low population density
regions


recycling business in china
the regulation for the management of recycling and disposal of waste electrical
and electronic products was enforced in january 2011 with this background
we established a joint recycling company in hangzhou zhejiang province with a
chinese company and its operation started in february 2014 this new company
aims at becoming an advanced model for home appliance recycling in china in
accordance with the above regulation utilizing the methods of advanced and
practical technology and a contemporary control system that have developed
through our recycling business in japan for over 15 years the company engages
in collecting and disassembling used appliances as well as selling resources from                          tv disassembly line in the new recycling

used appliances the volume of recycled home appliances in fiscal 2016 reached
550000 units

in february 2015 chinese government revised treatment catalogue of waste electrical and electronics equipment and it
came into effect on march 1 2016 in response to the increase of product categories subject to the new policy from 5 to
14 the company plans to expand the recycling business to wider industrial areas through these businesses the company
aims to contribute to environmental conservation and the effective use of resources in the country


international collaboration in southeast asia and oceania
heartland ewaste recycling programme is a voluntary activity in singapore that
serves as an integrated platform for proper recycling of home appliances and
electronic waste the program is designed based on the shared responsibility
concept among manufacturers recyclers retailers local communities and
the government in the 12 months from february 2015 through january 2016
approximately 3000 home appliances and electronic waste weighing over
8700 kg in total were collected at 76 collection points in 7 neighborhoods in
southeast singapore in addition heartland ewaste recycling programme also
contributed to raising recycling awareness among the community with close to                               student volunteers participating in the monthly

recycling efforts in india
in india the recycling law was enforced in may 2012 requiring manufacturers to form their own recycling systems in
response to this enforcement we established the i recycle program that collects and treats waste home appliances
panasonic has also been taking part in the consumer electronics and appliances manufacturers association ceama to
help develop the white paper containing reports on an analysis of current recycling activities in india and a longterm plan
for waste problem solutions the white paper was submitted to the ministry of environment forests and climate change in
january 2015

the market penetration of home appliances is expected to continue to grow at a fast pace in india we will hold further
discussions with the indian government through various industry associations to help establish an even more efficient and
robust recycling system


recycling initiatives in latin america
as the trend of reinforcing environmental laws progresses in latin american countries discussions on establishment of
recycling laws and actual enforcement are being conducted

we are having dialogues with the brazilian government jointly with an industry association and retailers about the
establishment of local recycling systems we are also actively engaged in a resource collection campaign in major cities
our efforts also include participation in the improvement program of reverse logistics systems in brazil through an industry
association to reinforce the system and making it more effective the project is planned to run for three years with technical
support from jica following a request by the brazilian government

in peru mexico and costa rica we submitted a recycling management plan to each government and started our efforts
from 2016 in colombia we also formed a recycling management organization under an alliance of manufacturers liaising
with governmental organizations and industrial groups and started collecting refrigerators from 2014 aiming to resolve
ozone depletion issues

petec is capable of sorting three major types of resins with different purposes and
propertiespolypropylene pp acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs and polystyrene
psfrom shredder residue of waste home appliances with an accuracy of at least
99 this precision separation is realized by our original nearinfrared identification
technology conventionally shredder residues were generally discarded or used as
fuel however this technology has enabled the sorting and recovering of single resins

pp abs and ps were conventionally sorted by each type at a time over three
processes but in fiscal 2015 we developed new technologies to sort these three types
                                                                                                                        nearinfrared sorting machine that can sort
of resin simultaneously the first of the new technologies is airflow control technology                               three types of resin simultaneously
which is used to blow resin pieces of different shapes and sizes after their types have
been identified the technology reduces the impact of aerodynamic drag caused when
blowing the pieces into the air from the conveyer and stabilizes the trajectory of the
resin pieces the second is the air discharge technology to instantaneously optimize
the duration of the air jet and nozzle position to shoot down the flying resin pieces the
third is highspeed signal processing technology to instantaneously detect the type
of resin of the flying piece that is moving at 3 msecond and ensures continuously
shooting the piece down using more than 700 air nozzles

these three technologies have significantly improved the resin sorting efficiency
                                                                                            won the minister of economy trade and
through development and introduction of such technologies we are striving to               industry prize under the 2015 awards for
improve recycling treatment efficiency and to enhance the scope of resource recycling      resourcerecycling technologies and
                                                                                            systems
the technology also detects and removes specific hazardous substances during
sorting which keeps the substance content significantly lower than regulated by stringent european legislation moreover
because no water is necessary for this sorting process and there is no need for effluent treatment it contributes to reducing
environmental impact caused by wastewater after the recycling process our efforts in resin recycling from mixed resins
in waste home appliances won the minister of economy trade and industry prize under the 2015 awards for resource
recycling technologies and systems hosted by the japan environmental management association for industry

the recycled single resins sorted and recovered at petec are then transferred to the adjacent kato plastic recycling
factory to be washed and processed to recover their chemical properties kato plastic recycling factory is a
manufacturing and development site that demonstrates promotion of use of recycled resin at our appliances company
a home appliance manufacturer and seller the factory plays an important role in enhancing recycled resin utilization by
developing recycling technologies such as a more efficient method for cleaning recycled resins recycled resin is generally
weaker in strength and has a shorter life than new resin this is why its chemical properties have to be recovered to the
level of new resin to make them usable as materials and components in new products different properties are required
for different resins we have established techniques that make full use of the properties optimal to each resin such as pp
abs and ps which include adding antioxidants or mixing recycled and new resins

recycled resin processed and qualityassured by petec and kato plastic recycling factory are reborn in our
manufacturing factories as filter frames for air conditioners or internal parts in ih cooking heaters and refrigerators
according to the resin type to serve the right functions in the right places


building a recycling scheme for scrap iron
jointly with tokyo steel co ltd we started a recycling scheme for scrap iron in july 2013 in this scheme we recover the
scrap iron from used home appliances and tokyo steel makes it into steel sheets we then purchase the sheets back as
a material for our products supplying scrap iron for recycling and repurchasing the recycled iron is the first scheme of its
kind in the japanese electrical manufacturing industry

the increase in electric steel plate usage leads to an increase in the usage of scrap iron which is one of the most important
resources in japan in addition producing steel plates from scrap iron emits much less co2 compared with producing
steel plates from scratch this scheme also stabilizes the procurement price because the price of scrap iron supplied from
petec and the price of electric steel plates procured from tokyo steel are determined by the scrap iron fluctuation rate
agreed between the two companies we will further expand this recycling scheme for more efficient resource utilization

environment factory waste management  zero waste emissions

improving factory waste recycling rate
from the viewpoint of effective usage of resources we believe that generation of waste and revenuegenerating waste at
factories must be minimized even if such waste could be sold as valuable commodities based on this belief we identify
the amount of generated waste including both revenuegenerating waste and factory generated waste and classify
it into 1 recyclable waste including those that can be sold and those which can be transferred free of charge or by
paying a fee 2 waste that can be reduced by incineration or dehydration and 3 landfill waste with no option other
than being sent to landfills

we reduce the emission of waste by boosting yield in our production process and increasing the recycling rate of our
waste materials accordingly we strive globally toward achieving our zero waste emissions from factories 1 goal by
reducing the amount of landfill to nearly zero

we have reinforced our efforts in china and other asian regions as well as in europe the recycling scheme in a new
factory that caused the overall recycling rate to fall in fiscal 2014 entered into full operation in fiscal 2016 this resulted in
the fiscal 2016 recycling rate reaching 992 an increase of 04 point over the previous fiscal year we will continue our
initiatives to achieve the factory waste recycling rate target of 995 by fiscal 2019

as a means to reduce the generation of waste we are fostering resourcesaving product design in our production
activities we are engaging in resource loss reduction employing our own unique material flow analysis methods we
consider materials that do not become products and excessive use of consumables as resource losses and make the
material flow and lost values for each process visible in order to resolve the issues with the involvement of the design
manufacturing and other relevant business divisions in the future we will promote further reductions in resource losses
through the resource loss navigation our original system developed to automatically display information to help reduce
resource losses

as measures to reduce the amount of landfill of waste and revenuegenerating waste we constrain the amount of waste
materials that are particularly difficult to recycle such as thermosetting resin we are also strictly adhering to waste
sorting practices in production processes to further expand the reuse of resources

because waste recycling rates in our overseas factories lag behind those in japan we have worked to improve the
average level of recycling activities by sharing information within and between regions outside japan specifically
in addition to accelerating the information sharing on waste recycling issues between our local factories and group
companies in japan we also promote the sharing of excellent examples and knowhow among our factories across
regions by utilizing ba charts2 prepared by each region following our longstanding approach toward co2 reduction

environment water resource conservation

approaches to water resource conservation
it is said that available fresh water is only about 001 of the earths total water resources in addition the world economic
forum host of the davos meetings has stated in its annual report on global risks that the water crisis continues to be one
of the top risks with global impact in view of the increase in water consumption to be caused by future economic growth
and population increases


with water shortages becoming an increasingly grave social problem panasonic is working to conserve water resources
both in its products and production activities in order to fulfill its social responsibility and to reduce management risks our
environmental policy page 12 stipulates that we make efforts to conserve water resources by using water efficiently and
preventing pollution in green plan 2018 our environmental action plan toward fiscal 2019 we aim to expand the range
of products that contribute to saving and recycling water at the same time we will work on conserving water resources
throughout our business activities in order to reduce the volume of water we consume and to use more recycled water
in our production processes in risk management we are aiming to complete our water risk assessments for all our
production sites by fiscal 2019

concrete action that we have taken for this includes an evaluation of the scale of water risks in all regions where our
production sites are located in order to identify and mitigate the impact of our production activities on our use of water
in the evaluation we employ evaluation tools such as the mapping tool aqueduct by the world resources institute wri
and the water risk filter by the world wide fund for nature wwf which can not only assess the physical risks of water
shortages but also examine the risks in waterrelated regulations as well as reputation risks in each region we are also
making use of public databases available from respective national governments going forward we will conduct detailed
analyses of regions with high water risks closely examine production site data such as local information and water use
volume and specifically identify the impacts on our production activities additionally we will work to conserve water
resources and reduce business risks in regions where water risks are determined to be high by focusing on promotions to
reduce water consumption and expand water recycling


to promote such activities we have established an environmental management system for these activities including water
management page 1617 and are aiming to raise the environmental management level by implementing the pdca cycle
in addition we have established an environmental risk management system to continuously reduce risks and 1 identify
environmental risks and promote companywide risk management every fiscal year and 2 promptly respond to occurrence
of environmental risks page 19 we will continue to manage our environmental risks through these activities


we are also a member of the water project a publicprivate collaborative project aimed at boosting awareness organized
under the initiative of japans ministry of the environment in 2014 its objective is to maintain a sound water cycle
and promote its recovery and presents waterrelated activities by business corporations as well as communicates of
information on the importance of water as its activities we will work in cooperation with the japanese government and
other companies to conserve water resources


water resource conservation through products
by thoroughly analyzing the use of water through our products we have developed functionalities that allow a considerable
amount of water conservation by utilizing water at a maximum level through improvement of water flow control and cyclic
use in fiscal 2012 we enhanced one of the criteria water conservation in our green product accreditation criteria see
pages 2527 and are speeding up the development of industryleading products that contribute to water saving

to promote our initiatives clearly we set forth our chemical substances management rank guidelines which prohibit or
specify certain substances for management in terms of our products and factory activities companies in the panasonic
group are requested to follow the guidelines and suppliers are also requested for support as necessary in fiscal 2013
we added level 3 to the chemical substances management rank guidelines for products to review the timing for the
prohibition of further substances that may adversely affect humans and the environment in addition to the current and
forthcoming prohibitions

management of chemical substances in products
to minimize the environmental impact of chemical substances contained in products we endeavor to identify chemical
substances used in the components and materials of our products in addition for substances that are prohibited in
products in major developed countries due to legislation such as the european rohs directive we specify prohibited
substances to globally ensure that they are not used or contained in our products except in certain cases where
substitution of the substances is infeasible we will also conduct environmental impact assessments for managed
substances contained in our products take steps to reduce the use of substances where the impact on human health and
the environment cannot be ignored and plan to eventually prohibit the use


identifying chemical substances in products
to contribute to the achievement of the global goals set at the wssd it is important for us to disclose and communicate
information on the chemical substances used in our products across the supply chain for which we must promote cross
industrial initiatives to establish and disseminate an effective system we are a member of the joint article management
promotion consortium jamp together with about 440 major companies from various industries such as chemical
component and equipment manufacturers we are proactively formulating utilizing and disseminating chemical substance
management standards and systems through this organization since fiscal 2005 we have been using a product chemical
substance management system to gather data concerning the chemical substances contained in the components and
materials for our products from our suppliers in july 2009 we asked our suppliers to submit the data in a common format
by jamp and approx 10000 suppliers are currently using this format


meanwhile in japan alone burden on companies grew as a number of hazardous substance inspections were carried out
throughout the supply chain using formats unique to each company that were not standardized such as the jamp format
for information communication the ministry of economy trade and industry recognized this issue and presented a new
scheme chemsherpa for sharing and exchanging information about chemicals contained in components and products
throughout the supply chain because chemsherpa follows the standardized jamp format to communicate information
panasonic has joined the scheme and adopted the use as the informationgathering format in its system we plan to
replace the current jamp mechanism with chemsherpa by june 2018 when the jamp support and maintenance period
will discontinue excluding communication of information on automotive equipment for the automobile sector for which the
industrys standard information sharing system is already established

in addition with the supply chain expanding to a global scale it is particularly important for overseas suppliers to deepen
their understanding on the handling of hazardous chemical substances towards a full changeover to the chemsherpa
format we will continue to promote the use to our suppliers through collaboration with jamp and jamp counterparts in
respective countries
                                                                                         61

companies that procure electronic components may need to have a full understanding of the substances contained in the
components at the point of selection or usage in order to adhere to the eu rohs directive and reach regulation

particularly as the reach substances of very high concern svhc list is updated every six months those companies
expect their suppliers to provide the latest substance data to demonstrate compliance with the list


also as a company supplying electronic components to other companies we have published a table of rohs and reach
compliance status on our website since november 2012 so that our clients can obtain relevant chemical substance
information from us quickly and efficiently the table covers our rohs directive compliance information and the substances
designated in the rohs  reach confirmation report for all our major generic electronic components

assessing the impact of chemical substances
scientifically identifying the impact on human health and the environment of products containing chemical substances is vital
to the development of products with low environmental impact we are engaging in activities designed to assess the levels
to which customers are exposed to substances of very high concern svhc as well as safety at the time of product use

to date we have undertaken assessments on cases such as impact of childrens oral exposure to phthalate esters
contained in a power cable or the impact of ceramic fibers used in certain models of commercial microwave ovens as part
of our efforts to comply with the eu reach regulation which requires preparing information for the safe use of products
containing a certain amount of svhc we have created and disclosed a safety assessment document for both cases in both
cases the exposure was considered to be nominal with little concern for any impact on human health
furthermore in fiscal 2015 and 2016 we conducted a risk assessment of dermal exposure to phthalates through contact
with power cables etc and have determined that the concentration levels in assumed panasonic products have little risk to
human health

reduction in usage and emissions of chemical substances
fluorocarbons used as a heat insulator and a refrigerant
for freezers and air conditioners can damage the ozone
layer and cause global warming we developed the
technology to utilize co2 which has much smaller
impact than fluorocarbons as a refrigerant and have
been supplying a home boiler using co2 refrigerant
since 2001 although the co2 refrigerant is suitable for
heating purposes it was difficult to apply to refrigerators
and freezers especially in large professional equipment
due to insufficient cooling efficiency and size problems
however with support from the new energy and                ocucr2001vf a fluorocarbonfree fpwev085 a display case
industrial technology development organization               freezer using co2 refrigerant     compatible with a fluorocarbon

nedo we developed a refrigeration system using
co2 refrigerant and now supply these fluorocarbonfree
freezers and refrigerator display cases to supermarkets and convenience stores in japan further new development of
a dedicated co2 refrigeration system has enhanced the product lineup from 272 models to 651 models and we started
accepting orders from may 2015


in addition as measures against ozone depletion caused by hcfcs a refrigerant called r410 that does not deplete the
ozone layer was used in compact air conditioners but this substance has a very high global warming potential gwp
panasonic then developed a model that uses a new refrigerant r32 which has a lower gwp and introduced it to the

market in 2013 furthermore pt panasonic manufacturing indonesia which owns the factory for manufacturing compact
air conditioners in indonesia redesigned its production facility that used an ozonedepleting hcfc refrigerant r22 to
one using r32 in fiscal 2015 and commenced supplying new r32based air conditioners panasonic contributed to the
indonesian governments initiative to eliminate the use of hcfcs

mercury lamps are currently widely used as the light source for projectors because they provide high luminosity easily
however mercury can have a serious impact on human health and the environment if not treated properly and the short
life of the lamps causes high consumption of resources as well as high environmental
impact for these reasons panasonic is developing products that adopt laser light
sources the ptrz12k series are projectors for professional use that provide high
luminosity by employing a highoutput semiconductor laser light source module
and a heatresistant phosphor wheel in addition the casing material does not use
halogenated flame retardant making the projector an ecoconscious product that
                                                                                              ptrz12k series a laser

reducing the use of pvc resin
polyvinyl chloride pvc is a material of concerns to the generation of hazardous substances from inappropriate disposal
as well as the harmful effects of certain additive agents phthalate ester used to render pvc more pliable in light of the
significant potential for inappropriate disposal of the pvc resin used in the internal wiring of products due mainly to
difficulties associated with the sorting of this resin from used products we have switched our new products launched from
april 2011 to nonpvc phthalates are often contained in pvc materials as a preventative measure in view of the phthalate
restriction to be enforced in 2019 under the eu rohs2 we have listed the substances as level 2 and level 3 prohibited
substances to be applied from july 22 2018 onwards in the panasonic group chemical substances management rank
guidelines ver 10 for products published in june 2016 and are working for substitution of substances

management of chemical substances at factories
panasonic is working to minimize environmental impact by identifying the hazardous substances used in our products
assessing the impact of such use and voluntarily discontinuing the use or reducing the release of such substances since
1999 we have been conducting the 3350 reduction activity to materialize reduction by 33 in three years and by 50 in
six years in japan we started promoting cutbacks in the use release and transfer of chemical substances at our factories
in fiscal 2000 against the target in our voluntary action plan a reduction by 50 from the fiscal 1999 level we achieved
a 75 reduction in chemical substance use and a 62 reduction in release and transfer in fiscal 2005 since then we
have been continuing the activity focusing on substances with particularly large amounts of release and transfer setting
a voluntary action target of reduction by 30 compared to the fiscal 2006 level as a result we achieved a 46 reduction
in the amounts of release and transfer of specified key reductiontarget substances across all factories worldwide in fiscal
2011

reflecting international trends in chemical substance management our reduction measures have focused increasingly on
particularly hazardous substances from fiscal 2011 our chemical substances management rank guidelines for factories
was established in 1999 as a guideline to help manage the above chemical substance reduction activities in version 1
the guidelines specified a list of chemical substances to be managed mainly focusing on carcinogenic substances the
guidelines were later updated to version 2 in 2000 to include rules concerning the japan prtr law version 3 introduced
in 2004 additionally covered a list of substances specified by chemical substances management legislation in japan the
chemical substances covered by version 4 and later from 2009 are those specified in legislation on human health and
environmental impact in japan the us and europe as well as those specified under international treaties

under our chemical substances management rank guidelines for factories we have focused our management on
select chemical substances that are hazardous to human health and the environment further we have created a unique
indicator the human environment impact5 which is used globally in all our factories conventionally the chemical
substances were managed by quantity such as usage amount or emissionsrelease however such quantitybased
management has a problem in that some highly hazardous substances do not become subject to reduction or management
if the usage amount was small and therefore would fall out of the scope of impact assessments in addition the toxicity
criteria varied according to substance types and regional legislation which made standardized management across the

group difficult to address this issue panasonic worked together with experts from both within and outside the company
reclassified chemical substances based on an overall assessment of their hazardousness and specified a hazardousness
factor for each classification specifically we set a hazard classification to each substance by utilizing carcinogen risk
assessments issued by international organizations together with publically available hazard information and lists of ozone
depleting substances for substances that have multiple hazard information items the item ranked with the highest hazard
risk is used for classification we utilize this internal indicator as the human environmental impact indicator to promote
efforts to ensure reduction of highly hazardous substances with greater environmental impacts such as carcinogens and
ozone depleting substances according to the risk level the panasonic group chemical substances management rank
guidelines is also available on the website on our green procurement activities to promote collaboration with our suppliers
encouraging them to offer materials that do not contain hazardous substances

in fiscal 2016 we were able to reduce human environmental impact by 46 compared to fiscal 2011 by substituting
highly hazardous substances in paints improving yields promoting recycling introducing substances with lowsolvents
and hazards and improving processes including reviewing the amount of paint or the number of washing cycles as well
as improving the efficiency of removaldeodorization equipment we will continue our initiatives to minimize the amount of
substances with environmental impact released through our production activities

environment biodiversity conservation

approach to biodiversity
business management and human life in our society is founded on the ecosystem servicesa multitude of natures
blessings provided by our natural capital including soil air water and animals and plants it is important to preserve
biodiversity to sustain the benefits derived from this natural capital towards the future however this biodiversity is
experiencing significant damage at an unprecedented speed accordingly corporate enterprises are now expected to
address the issues of conservation and sustainable use of resources

we are committed to properly understanding the impact of our business activities on biodiversity and contributing to
conservation to this end we are promoting initiatives in cooperation with local governments environmental conservation
ngos and specialized agencies specifically in 2009 we launched a biodiversity project focusing on the three key areas
of land use procurement and products in order to promote biodiversity conservation as an initiative incorporated into our
businesses in promoting the key areas we formulate a biodiversity action plan bap which is the basic concept of article
6 of the convention on biological diversity and implement measures check the achievement progress and improve the
initiatives


initiatives in land use
green areas in our business sites can potentially contribute to conserving biodiversity in that area in particular hardly
any natural environments where wild animals can live and breed remain in urban areas therefore even small areas of
green in corporate premises can become a precious environment for a variety of living organisms if they retain indigenous
vegetation and a watery environment since such areas are often closed from the outside world and hard for foreign
species to blend in

in terms of biodiversity these green areas take on the roles of reinforcing the ecological network and protecting threatened
wild fauna and flora


preservation of biotopes in collaboration with governments and experts
an ecological network refers to the organic relationship between ecological spaces such as the greenery and waters
where a variety of creatures lives and breeds the greenery in our sites helps expand the overall space where wild animals
including birds butterflies and dragonflies live as they can fly from one green area to another dotted in the area in
addition protecting wild fauna and flora in local areas is an activity in collaboration with governments and with help and
advice of experts to preserve endangered species designated by the ministry of the environment or local government
that are deemed to be disappearing from that area our business sites that promote such activities include the ecological
network at the kusatsu factory of appliances company in kusatsu city shiga prefecture the biotope at eco solutions
company in kadoma city osaka prefecture and tsunagari no hiroba at the panahome headquarters in toyonaka city
osaka prefecture
 examples of activities are introduced in the following website

acquisition and upgrade of external certification based on quantitative evaluation
in october 2010 the matsumoto factory of the automotive
 industrial systems company became the first factory
green space in japan to obtain the jhep certification future
prospect type which is based on the biodiversity quantitative
evaluation method developed by the ecosystem conservation
society  japan the factory was certified as a business
site with prospective contributions to biodiversity in terms of
creating a suitable environment that encourages habitation
                                                                                                                    the common fivering ypthima argus

since then the formulation of the factory green space
management policy was combined with diligent conservation                         deadwood planted in forests


                                                                            66

efforts such as changing lawn into sawgrass placing of deadwood and replacing trees of foreign origin resulting in an
increase in reproduction levels for birds and butterflies confirmation of these concrete results led to an upgrade in the
evaluation ranking to level a in september 2015 which was the year for certification renewal the upgrade in ranking not
only recognizes our biodiversity conservation effect objectively but also holds great significance for further development of
our efforts

initiatives in products
together with the ngo birdlife international we have established a thirdparty assessment system to provide customers
with information about product contributions to biodiversity through this system we have assessed products which are
closely linked to biodiversity

we have also enhanced our green product accreditation criteria see pages 2527 by adding biodiversity to the existing
items we define products that contribute to biodiversity conservation as those that use biodiversityconscious materials in
their major components and those that include functions to help biodiversity conservation

in fiscal 2014 panasonic environmental systems  engineering co ltd developed atpsbluesys a ballast water
management system bwms to reduce disturbance from maritime transportation of the marine ecology of local sea
areas ballast water is sea water used to retain the balance of a freight vessel at sea when it is not carrying shipment
because the ship travels across the sea taking sea water from one port and then draining the water into another port the
impact of foreign organisms such as plankton and bacteria on the local ecology environment and resources is becoming
an increasingly serious problem atpsbluesys treats microorganisms in the water with inline electrolysis without using
filters which is the first in japan the system can treat the water to a level lower than the standards by the international
maritime organization imo and successfully acquired the imo g9 basic approval g9ba
 ballast water management system atpsbluesys

collaboration with ngos and npos through the keidanren committee on
nature conservation
we collaborate with ngos and npos through the keidanren committee on
nature conservation in an effort to promote biodiversity conservation on a
global scale as well as in coordination with the industrial sector

the keidanren committee on nature conservation is an organization consisting
of more than 110 keidanren member enterprises that are actively involved
in nature protection and biodiversity conservation since its establishment in
1992 it has been engaged in supporting ngo efforts in nature conservation
promoting exchanges between business enterprises and ngos promoting                  weeding at tsunami memorial park nakanohama

awareness of nature protection and biodiversity among businesses and
supporting the efforts in the tohoku region to recover from the earthquake disaster through the restoration of nature
through corporate and private donations to the keidanren nature conservation fund including donations from panasonic
support worth a cumulative total of approx 36 billion yen has been donated as of fiscal 2016 to 1214 ngo projects in
japan and other countries

in addition to donating and participating in projects promoted by the committee we fulfill our responsibility to ensure
solid implementation of these projects through onsite inspections etc in fiscal 2016 we participated in the tohoku
region recovery support project implemented in september at the tsunami memorial park nakanohama opened by the
ministry of the environment in may 2014 we are contributing to preserve biodiversity through planting mainly local flora
and working on plantation area management activities we have also been engaged in the protection of rare species
such as monochoria korsakowii ovalleafed pondweed which is classified by the nature conservation society of japan
as a nearthreatened species by the ministry of the environment in the fallow fields of sanrikucho in iwate prefecture
and conducted investigation on the state of recovery of seagrass meadows and inspection on oyster farms by the npo
organization mori wa umi no koibito of kesennuma city miyagi prefecture

despite the fact that nature conservation activities are an area in biodiversity conservation that is difficult for companies to
be directly involved in solid actions are possible through collaboration with industry associations and through support for
ngos and npos we will continue contributing to conservation of the ecosystem through continuous participation in these
initiatives in the future

environment collaboration across the supply chain
collaboration with suppliers and transportation partners
as a company backed by a number of suppliers we must consider the environmental impacts of our entire supply chain
and not just of our own operations through our coordination efforts with suppliers and transportation partners who
form an integral part of our business operations we strive to minimize our environmental impact across the entire supply
chain focusing on the reduction of co2 emissions resource recycling chemical substance management and biodiversity
conservation


measures for green procurement
since the publication of the green procurement standards in 1999 we have been promoting the manufacture of eco
conscious products in partnership with our suppliers furthermore in the green procurement standards we set out
the establishment of a group of suppliers who support our environmental policy in supplying products and goods in
order to materialize the targets in supplier collaboration in our green plan 2018 in addition to cooperation in reducing
environmental impact in supplier business operations and sharing achievements through collaboration we are asking
our suppliers to seek the cooperation of upstream business partners to expand the scope of activities of reducing
environmental impact throughout the entire supply chain

also based on the green procurement standards we have been conducting the green procurement survey where we
monitor the implementation status of our suppliers regarding our requests to promote environmental impact reduction
activities more effectively with our suppliers in fiscal 2013 we conducted a trial survey targeted at our major global
suppliers we received responses from 415 companies and were able to confirm the level of activity in areas such as
environmental management system development thorough implementation of chemical substance management reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions promotion of resource recycling and biodiversity conservation

from fiscal 2014 we have replaced surveys conducted on a groupwide scale with surveys at a site level as a means of
communication with our suppliers

in china to respond to the first amendment to the environmental protection law in 25 years 42 companies under the
panasonic group conducted a survey targeting some 700 major suppliers in china to mainly review the state of pollutant
emissions and daytoday environmental management in an effort to identify risks in the supply chain and reduce
environmental impact

in response to the enhancement of regulations such as eu rohs directive we have been engaging in continual
environmental quality assurance audits of our suppliers since 2005 to improve the management level throughout the entire
supply chain in fiscal 2016 we assessed the environmental quality assurance systems of some 1600 suppliers and have
supported their efforts to upgrade their management levels
 green procurement standards httpwwwpanasoniccomglobalcorporatemanagementprocurementgreenhtml


estimation of environmental impacts in business activities by suppliers
in order to assess greenhouse gas ghg emissions across the entire supply chain scope 31 we made our original
calculations based on the greenhouse gas protocol the international accounting standard for ghg emissions since fiscal
2012 we have conducted assessment surveys on four occasions with the cooperation of 185 suppliers in the areas of raw
materials electrical and electronic components and processed parts

from fiscal 2012 we started estimating our overall ghg emissions in the upstream range by multiplying the volume of
materials purchased with the resourcespecific ghg emissions per basic unit based on the inputoutput table published
by the japanese government the estimation results based on fiscal 2015 data is 1299 million tons roughly five times the
ghg emissions of our own production activities
1 other indirect emissions excluding scope 1 direct emissions from facilities owned and controlled by panasonic and scope 2 emissions from
  production of energy consumed at facilities owned and controlled by panasonic

sharing achievements through collaboration
since fiscal 2010 we have been implementing the ecovc2 activity with our suppliers this program is a collaboration
between panasonic and our suppliers aimed to both reduce environmental impact as well as reinforce product capability
and achieve further rationalization for our products and our suppliers in fiscal 2010 the target for reducing environmental
impact was limited to energy saving co2 emission reduction however this was extended in fiscal 2011 to recycling
oriented manufacturing aiming at saving resources and using recycled materials the geographical range of our activities
has also extended initially centered in japan actions accelerated to china and other parts of asia in fiscal 2013 and later
extended to a global scale in fiscal 2015 ecovc activities are stored in a database for effective use within the panasonic
group furthermore exemplary activities are recognized through awards at the panasonic excellent partners meeting held
every autumn these activity presentations are also shown at the meeting venue to be shared with participating suppliers
for use and application in future activities

although the number of cases presented by suppliers in fiscal 2016 fell from the previous year to 933 many excellent
proposals were presented one of the outstanding practices recognized and selected was support for optimal design of
lcd tv underframes by nippon steel  sumitomo metal corporation which involves lcd tv underframes that were
conventionally designed specifically for each flagshipgeneric model this proposes identifying potential problems during the
diagram design stage based on analytic support in rigidity strength and metal molding cae3 and reflecting the findings to the
design to achieve the steel material best suited to the shape of the frame part this enabled cutting down the number of molds
used reducing the thickness of the metal plates and the number of design steps and
resulted in dramatic cost cuts and a reduction in co2 emissions by approx 1300 tons

continuing efforts will be made together with as many suppliers as possible in
realizing reduction of environmental impacts product capability reinforcement and
further rationalization through ecovc activities and further strengthen partnerships
with our suppliers

 panasonic code of conduct chapter 2 implementing the code in business operations ii2 product safety
httpwwwpanasoniccomglobalcorporatemanagementcodeofconductchapter2htmlsection22


based on these foundational policies each of the four companies and each business division has established quality
policies which have been thoroughly implemented in all subsidiary organizations


regulations
quality management system
to establish selfregulating quality assurance processes in each group company panasonic published quality management
system development guidelines in 2004 in japanese english and chinese each group company then implemented the
panasonic quality management system pqms

pqms complements the requirements of the iso9001 standard with panasonics own quality assurance methods and
experience to create a quality management system that aims to deliver the level of quality that the company demands

based on its implementation of the pqms panasonic continuously improves the quality of its products and it is bolstering
its efforts to prevent quality problems from happening in the first place and to achieve more consistent quality

in december 2014 panasonic drew up and began applying the automotive quality management system development
guidelines the automotive pqms which compile panasonics fundamental stances on the quality of components
installed on board motor vehicles

the company is also evolving these guidelines in light of the 2015 revisions to iso9001 to make them easier to handle
while encompassing all requirements making it a more effective management tool

                                                                            78

education
 to establish a corporate culture in which product safety is the top priority in manufacturing panasonic conducts product
 safety education such as by providing employees with learning initiatives such as the fundamentals of product safety
 elearning program and by holding product safety forums at which engineers can learn from one another about product
 safety

panasonic has also established a product safety learning square at a human resources development company in
hirakata osaka prefecture with the aims of fostering a safety culture deeply ingrained by the practice of going to see
the actual location and the actual items in question and providing opportunities to learn about safety technologies relating
to products that have reached the end of their life cycles with full consideration to the deterioration of materials and
components over time after longterm use and so forth the product safety
learning square has displays of actual products that were recalled in the
past and illustrates the causes of the problems and the steps that were taken
with the aim of passing down the lessons learned from the fftype kerosene
heater accidents and of eliminating seven major product safety problems the
company has identified

this fiscal year has seen 6445 visitors to this facility ranging from new hires
visiting for their training at the human resources development company to
managementlevel employees
                                                                                                           product safety learning square

committee organization
activities of the meetings to exchange information on environment and quality activities
quality managers meeting
panasonic periodically holds meetings to exchange information on environment and quality activities as a venue for
reviewing the state of groupwide quality improvement efforts the meetings are attended by cqos at each company and
stakeholders in relevant job functions at the meetings the different companies share best practices relating to quality
improvement measures discuss how panasonic should handle quality over the medium and long terms and engage in
other activities in pursuit of a stronger foundation of quality for the whole group

panasonic also periodically holds quality managers meetings attended by the managers responsible for the departments
that oversee qualityrelated operations within each company as a place for more specific discussions these meetings
both enhance cooperation within the group and promote quality improvement efforts

since fiscal 2016 panasonic has held a global quality managers meeting once a year as an occasion for individuals
responsible for quality in regions across the globe and managers responsible for departments that oversee qualityrelated
operations within each company to come together to share issues and best practices facilitating quality improvement
efforts


activities of the general product safety committee
to implement manufacturing with product safety as its top priority in 2012 panasonic reorganized its groupwide general
product safety committee and established a safety technology working group and a safety standards working group
under its umbrella using these working groups the company has firmly entrenched the safety technologies that it
developed in response to the 2005 fftype kerosene heater accidents and the product safety standards that it devised
making the use of these technologies and standards even more consistent

because of the increasing need for safety features in automobiles robots and other products panasonic is promoting the
acquisition of safety standard certifications through intragroup partnerships to assure safety in these product categories


activities of the safety technology working group
the safety technology working group takes into account the possibility that customers may use products longer than
anticipated during a products design phase it develops scientific evaluation methods for testing material durability
including accelerated deterioration testsaccumulates data and stores them in databases

 because air conditioners refrigerators and other home appliances are joining audiovisual devices in becoming internet
connected and because it is predicted that internetofthings iot technologies will continue to advance the importance
of security measures is greater than ever panasonic has compiled guidelines on threat analysis and other security methods
for product security and has refined its education in relevant divisions the company has set up risk data collection sites in
japan europe and china creating a system that can detect vulnerabilities early and implement countermeasures rapidly

panasonic established a product security center in january 2016 concentrating groupwide governance human resource
training technological development and device verification functions related to product security there in an effort to bolster
these systems


activities of the safety standards working group
beyond complying with public safety standards and to realize a higher level of product safety panasonic established the
1999 panasonic corporation safety standards pcss consisting of design rules that must be followed when developing
products

the safety standards working group has reflected in the pcss what it has learned from the activities of the safety
technology working group and it has strengthened standards relating to major safety issues such as longterm use
flameretarding measures and fall prevention the working group is also making efforts to enhance its product safety
standards to actively prevent risks that it anticipates could occur because of the expanded areas in which the company
does business for example to ensure the safety of the storage battery systems that constitute one of panasonics
growing lines of business the working group created the panasonic system safety standards psss which cover among


                                                                            80

as corporate activity expands globally improprieties occur with some frequency due not just to deliberate dishonest and
criminal acts but also to a lack of awareness and understanding employees doing business in countries and regions where
legal systems are incompletely realized must perennially exercise a high degree of awareness of norms

thorough adherence to these rules with the aim of promoting fair operating practices in all countries and regions of the
world and to realize a sustainable society this is the panasonic code of conduct which incorporates the requirements

of the need to observe ethical and legal requirements we conduct a compliance awareness survey to check the degree
of compliance awareness dissemination among our employees around the world once each year we check the status of
observance and practice of the panasonic code of conduct in our business locations around the world

domestic and foreign business locations and for our business partners

level we also bring those issues together centrally and comprehensively at our head office and reflect them in groupwide

can stay in compliance with the law in the course of their daily work activities and answer societal expectations covering
topics such as preventing corruption and preventing cartels

with cartels export controls and copyright laws in sales procurement engineering and other functional divisions at each
company

each year we designate september as compliance awareness month to check up on our efforts to ensure that the
mental attitude of strict adherence to ethics and the law has taken hold globally and to respond to risks in recent years
as our business and the business environment have changed this has presented opportunities to strengthen our efforts to
accurately grasp signs of changing risks legal violations and improprieties in specific fields  units of business countries
and regions

in this interval the president the heads of companies and business divisions regional representatives and other senior
executives have clarified policies and positions on the observance of ethics and the law ensuring the dissemination of the
importance of compliance down to the ground level

globally such as compliance and information security and also other topics that are specific to particular companies
places of business and regions in fiscal 2016 approximately 132000 employees participated in these surveys globally

used in a wide variety of functions such as the formulation of policies and measures regarding compliance and responses
to specific issues

survey were used to formulate a midterm action plan for fiscal 20142016 within the asian region there exists a wide
variety of legal systems in various countries and there are high risks in terms of the need to prevent corruption in this
business environment in order to develop fair and powerful solution business  including btob and btog  we were able
to identify issues through this survey such as 1 the need for ongoing efforts to instill compliance awareness 2 the need
for repetition of compliance education and 3 the national differences in compliance awareness based on these results
various elements were incorporated in the midterm action plan to practice in the daily business activities including 1 the
formulation of action guidelines and education campaigns at the level of the regional headquarter 2 the strengthening of
elearning and training programs in each national language and 3 the fortification of alliances involving legal departments
in each region and the raising of the level of compliance through auditing

tube business in violation of eu competition law we take this fact very seriously and continue to carry out thorough
control to prevent any such involvement from recurring please refer to the next chapter fair trade for our measures to
prevent cartels

preventing cartels
we at panasonic are taking the fact that our company has been implicated in multiple international cartel incidents
seriously and we have positioned the prevention of cartels as a critical groupwide issue if panasonic were to become
involved in the creation of a cartel we would not only lose the trust of our customers but also be required to pay high
penalties and compensation for damages as well as lose our designation in public procurement we take very serious and
detailed care to prevent any such involvement because it would have a variety of negative impacts on our business

human rights support desk
panasonic has established an equal employment opportunity office at its headquarters and appointed fulltime consultants

a place for employees to go to discuss their concerns about sexual harassment harassment based on power differentials
topics related to the rights of members of sexual minorities lgbt and a wide range of other topics relating to human
rights

the equal employment opportunity office also conducts activities aimed at resolving workplace problems and creating
workplaces without barriers to employees performing their jobs for example in fiscal 2016 the office conducted training
for managers concerning among other things creating a stimulating workplace culture 97 of managers who attended
the training responded that they were able to change ways of thinking on more concrete terms respondents provided
positive opinions on the training such that they reaffirmed the importance of initial responses and were able to clearly
understand what efforts they needed to undertake that the training had served as a good opportunity to once again re
evaluate their own actions and words and that they wanted to work toward sharing with all workplace members respect
for individuals communication and mutual support and toward creating a workplace in which such shared ideals could be
put into practice in addition some attendees provided suggestions for further improvements to the activities of the office
including that the range of attendees for the training should be expanded while the training itself should be conducted
periodically

in its overseas subsidiaries as well panasonic is acting with all due attention to the privacy of those who seek consultation
or report misdeeds including by establishing consultation offices and suggestion boxes similar to those in japan

respect for human rights performance evaluation

as a company doing business in countries around the world panasonic strives to respect human rights and considers it a
precondition for all its behavior to abide by international standards the laws and regulations of each country or region and
the panasonic code of conduct

further to these efforts since 2007 the company has been conducting overseas human resources and labor
assessments intended to identify comprehend and resolve issues in personnel management and labor management
overseas the checklist used in the survey contains around 300 items including those concerning proper implementation
of labor management compliance with local labor laws employment systems and business practices and discovery of
bad influences on business and of latent laborrelated risks that could cause problems

after the local affiliate has conducted a selfassessment based on the checklist an assessor who belongs to a company
or business division in japan performs an audit with the support of the regional headquarters efforts to resolve problems
discovered via assessments are undertaken primarily by assessorleaders mainly managers in charge of human
resources who strive to raise the level of labor management panasonic periodically runs assessor seminars to
systematically promote the education of assessors and to raise the levels of their checking skills

in fiscal 2016 assessments were conducted at a total of 9 sites consisting of 3 sites in china and 6 sites elsewhere in
asia panasonic will continue to strive to improve labor management capabilities through close partnerships between its
japanese and overseas locations thereby to improve the companys ability to respect human rights in all its businesses

furthermore since fiscal 2015 panasonic has implemented risk assessment and improvement efforts based on a
selfassessment checklist relating to human rights and labor that was established that year we have expanded
the implementation of these in fiscal 2016 engaging in efforts toward selfassessments as well as corrections and
improvements at 52 sites overseas

because issues with working hours management have been observed at some companies through selfassessments we
have proposed improvement plans that include revisions to the organization of personnel work management methods and
equipment automation and are moving forward in our efforts to correct these issues




                                                                            97

to young workers
when recruiting employees panasonic adopts a perspective of protecting fundamental human rights and engages in
recruitment activities that comply with the laws and regulations of the respective countries it also prohibits forced labor
labor against the will of any employee or child labor in order to prevent child labor we have built items such as age
verification into the selfassessment checklist used when individuals join the company the risk that child labor will be
performed is thought to be especially high in china and elsewhere in asia and panasonic is thoroughly implementing age
checks in these regions the company does not make employees under the age of 18 engage in heavy labor and offers
them consideration and support so that they may have opportunities to receive education

because there tend to be greater human rights and laborrelated risks for migrant and foreign laborers panasonic has
established items to be checked that include ensuring that panasonicaffiliated entities are not allowing temp agencies
to collect any fees and are not retaining workers passports or identification documents as well as ensuring that they
are providing workers with employment contracts including terms of employment in those workers native languages
panasonic recruits employees and accepts temporary workers based on the laws and regulations of the respective country
so that no employees are made to work against their will or are unduly subjected to disadvantageous working conditions


prohibition of discrimination
panasonic strives to create workplaces where diverse and talented individuals can respect one another as vital partners
irrespective of differences such as race sex age nationality beliefs religion social status disability sexual orientation and
gender identity and can work in a lively and active manner in a supportive environment with consideration of the laws and
regulations of each country


the company has established recruitment standards that select employees based on the applicants aptitudes capabilities
and desires to thoroughly implement these standards the company in japan for instance educates interviewers based
on the handbook recruitment and human rights which the hellowork public employment stability office established
by the national government has drafted for the purpose of promoting fair recruitment selection

managing working hours
based on labor standards legislation in the respective countries and on labor agreements panasonic has established in its
work regulations provisions relating to appropriate working hours break times overtime work holidays leave and so forth

to abide by these provisions the company operates a workinghours management system and is also engaged in
comprehensive employee health management

with a work management system panasonic has implemented a variety of measures with an eye to employees health
including a mechanism by which warnings are issued and other steps are taken at the point when a certain length of
overtime has been reached optimal placement of personnel so that overtime is not overly imposed on only certain
employees and additional health checks performed in the rare event that an employee has worked excessively long hours


managing wages
based on labor standards legislation in the respective countries and on labor agreements panasonic has established in its
employee wage regulations provisions for adequate wages allowances for commuting and other expenses bonuses other
compensation paid on occasional bases retirement allowance and so forth

the company has implemented a role  grade system that determines compensation based on the work or role in which
employees are currently engaged there are no genderbased inequalities in this compensation system

in japan to ascertain whether employees wages are being paid correctly labor unions conduct annual surveys of wage
conditions among their members and check whether those members are being properly paid the salaries resulting from
wage negotiations decided between labor and management

overseas panasonic establishes by country company regulations that comply with all wagerelated laws and regulations
pertaining to matters such as the minimum wage statutory benefits and overtime the company conducts its operations
based on these regulations andfor the specified period of payment and at the specified time of paymentnotifies its
employees through pay statements and electronic data and pays them directly

in cases where the laws of the country or region in question do not prohibit monetary disciplinary action panasonic
recognized such disciplinary action as a possibility and does not prohibit it however this is all predicated on the
procedures for such actions as well as the monetary amounts involved being established within legal limits with
consideration given to the impact on the recipients life as well as such measures being codified in internal regulations and
made well known to employees japanese law does not prohibit monetary discipline but panasonics disciplinary rules
within japan do not include monetary disciplinary measures


the freedom of association and respect for the right to collective
bargaining
panasonic believes that the freedom of association combined with the right to collective bargaining is one of the
fundamental human rights that companies should respect

in countries and regions that permit the formation of labor unionsfor instance in japanpanasonic and the panasonic
group workers union association have stipulated in their labor agreement that unions retain the rights to organize to
collectively bargain and to strike

in addition even in countries and regions where the formation of labor unions is not permitted because of legislation
regulations or conventional labor practices the panasonic code of conduct stipulates the de facto promotion of issue
resolution through labormanagement dialogues which are the goals of the principles of the freedom of association and
the right to collective bargaining in addition the company expressly lists these dialogues as one of the conditions for doing
business with suppliers in its standard purchase agreement and demands suppliers comply with this condition




                                                                            99

at business sites where workplace accidents have occurred panasonic investigates the causes behind the incidents
implements measures to prevent reoccurrence and shares accident case studies groupwide so that all business sites
may implement preventive measures so as not to experience the same kinds of accidents themselves

for special tasks such as handling heavy materials or chemical substances the company conducts work inspections
based on safety data sheet sdss and provides employees with appropriate personal protective equipment making every
effort to minimize the required amount of such work panasonic also conducts additional health screenings and monitoring
for employees engaged in such work to prevent negative impacts on health in accordance with laws and regulations
concerning work in front of visual display terminals vdts in indirect departments as well the company provides annual
special health screenings for those employees who perform at least four hours of work in front of such displays and for
whom they themselves their bosses or an occupational physician have determined screening to be necessary

requests to our suppliers for csr selfchecks
since fiscal 2016 we have begun requesting that our suppliers start conducting csr selfchecks concerning the state of
their initiatives related to human rights health and safety the environment and ethics

we also analyze and evaluate supplier risks based on the results of these selfchecks holding hearings and audits as
necessary

in fiscal 2016 we requested csr selfchecks from roughly 700 suppliers mostly in japan and china

no suppliers with serious issues were found in this round of selfchecks but we will continue to expand the number of
suppliers that we request selfchecks of and we will work to take swift corrective action in the event that we find any
issues and build up a solid healthy supply chain


cooperation with suppliers in reducing the burden on the environment
we work to reduce the burden we place on the environment through cooperation with our suppliers and logistics partners

responsible supply chain response regarding conflict minerals

basic stance on conflict minerals
the issues of conflict minerals are considered important by panasonic these minerals are mined in the democratic
republic of congo drc and neighboring countries hereinafter the covered countries and their extraction funds
organizations that violate human rights cause serious harm to the environment perpetrate corruption and are otherwise
involved in illegal activity

to fulfill our social responsibilities in our procurement activities our policy prohibits the usage of illegally obtained conflict
minerals as raw materials

in the rare event that such use is discovered efforts aimed at to terminate any usage must be made without delay

to this end a notice was issued in december 2010 to the entire group requiring a thorough approach to nonuse in
february 2011 efforts began to require checks of our major suppliers sources for procuring minerals

however in the covered countries there are also companies and individuals engaged in legal business activities with
no connection to any illegal activities we also must strive hard to ensure that such companies or individuals business
activities and livelihoods are not harmed by our efforts to avoid using minerals that are illegally obtained

to this end we need to cooperate with a wide range of stakeholders including countries companies and nonprofit
organizations npos that are taking measures to build fair supply chains of minerals in the covered countries based on
these concepts panasonic has been participating in the organisation for economic cooperation and developments oecd
due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas which
began in august 2011

 alongside our involvement in this project we are also engaged in other efforts aimed at the implementation of the oecd
guidance building management processes that conform to global standards with the aim of contributing to international
efforts to resolve the problem of conflict minerals

panasonics systems for dealing with conflict minerals
panasonic is making efforts to build companywide systems with ultimate responsibility residing with the executive officer
in charge of manufacturing and procurement senior managing director yoshiyuki miyabe as of august 2016 with the
start of the fourcompany system in april 2013 we designated a person at each company to be in charge of investigating
and reporting on conflict minerals under the aegis of these individuals each company is making efforts to build systems
and carry out investigations based on the characteristics of its own business


due diligence efforts
in addition to communicating panasonics policies to our suppliers we also ask them to put reasonable efforts toward
being drc conflict free and procure materials from conflictfree smelters cfs to the extent possible

investigations of conflict minerals require the cooperation of all suppliers and all the refiners  smelters they work with to
reduce the burden on suppliers and to enhance the efficiency of such investigations we have found it effective to use common
investigating tools and explanatory materials based on this realization panasonic uses as an investigative tool the conflict
minerals reporting template cmrt issued by the conflictfree sourcing initiative cfsi we are also active participants
at investigative briefings held by jeitas japan electronics and information technology industries association responsible
minerals trade working group where we work as a presenter we make active use of manuals and other handbooks jointly
prepared by japanese automobile makers and the japan auto parts industries association for conducting investigations


status of investigations
in fiscal 2016 the panasonic group as a whole has surveyed 1300 supplier companies on conflict minerals and has had
responses from 86 of those surveyed as of the end of december 2015 based on the cmrts that we have collected
we have already conducted a risk analysis and assessment and have requested further investigations from suppliers
according to risks

                                                                            114

a total of 256 smelters have been identified by the panasonic group for the four specified minerals among those 65 of
tin 100 of tantalum 66 of tungsten and 65 of gold smelters have been certified as cfs as of the end of december
2015

at the present time we have not confirmed any minerals that have served to finance military power either directly or
indirectly for the metals that have been reported in the survey as being sourced from covered countries but we will
continue our work of closely examining and identifying smelter information

furthermore through our industry activities we have urged smelters to acquire cfs certification our suppliers continue to
perform due diligence but in the rare event minerals are discovered to have been supportive of conflict we are asking that
these suppliers strive to change their suppliers or take other steps toward nonuse


participation in forums on implementing due diligence for responsible
mineral supply chains
beginning in 2011 panasonic has been participating in oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of
minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas projects currently the forum on responsible mineral supply chains at
the forum in november 2013 we learned about ongoing efforts toward conflictfree minerals procurement including mines
exchanges and traceability systems for responsible minerals procurement in rwanda and ways to identify mines through
analysis of mineral composition and generation we also participated in the forum in paris in may 2015 where we were able
to exchange views with other interested persons and learn about effective approaches to the problem of conflict minerals


industry cooperation initiatives
investigations of conflict minerals require the cooperation of all suppliers in the supply chain accordingly panasonic has
been working with jeita japan electronics and information technology industries association as cochair and coleader
of the responsible minerals trade working group engaging in educational activities and efforts to make the investigative
process more efficient through industry cooperation

more specifically we have been working with industry groups both inside and outside japan and holding seminars and
briefings about investigations to promote correct efforts regarding conflict minerals we have checked information on
smelters  refiners and helped plan the ipc1755 standards for the sharing of us data on conflict minerals in november
2013 jeitas responsible minerals trade working group teamed up with japanese automakers to create the conflict
free sourcing working group in order to engage in dialog with the smelting industry and to accelerate efforts to verify
information about smelters  refiners panasonic was also a participant in this activity

since january 2016 along with other corporate members of jeitas responsible minerals trade working group we have
begun working toward getting smelters that have not yet received cfs certification to do so

we have also visited smelters in japan and conducted information exchanges on the conditions and issues surrounding
conflict minerals and have considered what sensible ways of dealing with conflict minerals should look like


support for efforts in democratic republic of congo and neighboring countries
panasonic has engaged in due diligence initiatives to fulfill its social responsibilities as a downstream company but we
think the most important development towards resolving the problem of conflict minerals would be the establishment of
mechanisms for responsible procurement of minerals in the covered countries

based on this thinking since march 2013 we have been participating with industry groups the us government and
citizen groups in the publicprivate alliance for responsible minerals trade ppa

the ppa supports efforts to create mechanisms and develop capabilities for certification and traceability of minerals
transactions that are unrelated to any conflict in the africas great lakes region at the same time it creates a platform for
dialog and cooperation between participating organizations in the interest of realizing sustainable responsible minerals
trade in the region

panasonic is a participant in ppa and supports efforts aimed at responsible minerals trading aiming to make a contribution
to healthy economic development in the region

support for sustainable development of the covered countries
as panasonics corporate citizenship activity in this region in 2010 we began the panasonic npo support fund for africa
as a means of supporting and strengthening the public relations foundation for npos  ngos working to resolve issues in
african nations this is our way of supporting organizations working to resolve issues in african nations included among
the organizations that panasonic has supported so far are the npo terra renaissance 2011 to 2013 which works on
issues including landmines small arms and child soldiers in countries including uganda and the democratic republic of
the congo and reborn kyoto 2014 to 2016 an npo that provides opportunities for women in rwanda to take part in
vocational training in order to support their economic independence in march 2016 panasonic donated roughly 500 of its
solar lanterns to the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr which carries out humanitarian assistance
in the democratic republic of the congo


dialog with ngos
we are engaged in dialog with ngos regarding handling of conflict minerals in march 2015 we participated in an ethical
mobile phone campaign seminar promoted by the international environmental ngo a seed japan sharing our views on
our handling of conflict minerals with representatives of corporations and ngos we also exchanged views regarding the
importance of sectorcooperative efforts on the handling of conflict minerals going forward we plan to continue this kind
of dialog and cooperation
