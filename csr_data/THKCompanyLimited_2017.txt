      providing the optimal robotics engineering for our
      customers needs

         the thk intechs homepage states we provide the
      optimal robotics engineering for our customers needs we
      say this because as the birth rate declines and the popula
      tion ages in japan it is expected that labor shortages in
      production facilities will continue to worsen in order to main
      tain our production capacity and improve our productivity
      under these circumstances we believe one answer is to
      have robots perform simple repetitive andor hazardous
      work and have people engage in tasks that have a high
      added value process management kaizen activities crafts
      manship etc

      industry robots are already performing tasks that humans                        takashi teramachi

               in the past robot software was developed sepa
            rately by each university and manufacturer creating
            a major hurdle for newcomers in the field then a
            movement centered around the ministry of econo
            my trade and industry arose to construct a soft
            ware environment with standardized specifications
            and make that software available so that it could be

            we were amazed by how easily they created their design                                    them however the robot with seed solutions has few wires
            they also had highly experienced staff with a deep under                                  and can be easily disassembled so its transportability is a

robot technology development
  one could say the core principle of thks technology is to create products that use little force to move heavy objects
thk is utilizing this technology to develop nextgeneration robot technology for the society of the future which will face low
birth rates an aging population and labor shortages
   a robot hand that our company developed has already been used for the extravehicular robot experiment rexj on the
international space station in addition the development and clinical study of a walking assist robot to support the reha
bilitation of people who have undergone knee surgery has advanced through an industrialacademic collaboration between
the university of yamanashi kofu municipal hospital and private industry there are various seed solutions made by thk
in this robot which allow it to not only control the amount of assistance and measure walking training data but also wire
lessly communicate with an external terminal
   we will continue to pursue technological developments that anticipate societal needs

hand launched to space which was introduced in our                          with the world
csr report 20132014 and learned that thks technol                            as i gain a broad scope of knowledge through this
ogy was useful for developing space robotics                                 work i hope to become a robot engineer well versed in
   my wish was granted i was assigned to the department                      everything from software to hardware to electronics

   because datacenters store customers valuable data
measures to protect the facility and equipment from earth
quakes are a prerequisite because datacenter customers
have a high awareness on the datacenters antiearthquake
measures it was very important for us to have a system that
can make our customers feel secure this means that it
must withstand the scale of largescale earthquakes like the                   hiroshi miyamoto

where the entire server floor is isolated and one where the
individual racks are isolated when we compared the two                      to take advantage of the latest technology we are looking
while the performance was comparable we chose thks                          forward to see constant advancements in thks seismic iso
floor isolation system from an overall point of view including                lation devices as well
its cost advantage
   our datacenter employs a unique
modular construction design devel
oped by fuji electric where individual
server building modules are built one at
a time as they become necessary at
present we have two server modules
each with 80 racks with a total of 160
racks these modules were construct
ed using 2015 technology if we were to
build the third module in 2018 we can
build it with 2018 technology by that
time power cooling as well as seismic
isolation technology will have advanced
from where it is today because our
modular construction design allows us

     earthquake in 2011 the result is a building 15 times more                             devices to move they are designed to return to their original

                                                   i learned a lot in the two months of childcare leave i took beginning in july of 2015
                                                   first of all by looking after a child 24 hours a day and dealing with stress that you cant prepare for the way
                                                you would for something at work i experienced what its like to be entrusted with the life of a child i also came
                                                to understand the physical and mental state of employees who work shortened hours for their kids i under
                                                stood why the heightened awareness of time these individuals develop contributes to high efficiency in the
                                                work they do i also realized how much the experience of caring for a newborn affects a couples trust in one
                                                another as well as a husbands awareness of what it means to care for a child
                                                   second i learned that childcare leave is only possible with the understanding and collaboration of those at
                                                your workplace i was hesitant about requesting leave at first but thanks to everyones understanding and their
           toshinori sato                       efforts to cover for me in my absence my return to work afterwards went smoothly
           assistant manager                       the third fact i became conscious of was the lack of recognition childcare leave receives friends from col
           corporate strategy headquarters      lege told me that their companies dont offer anything like it but childcare leave is actually something open to
