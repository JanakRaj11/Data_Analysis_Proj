                                            global energy situation

                                         it is predicted that the global demand for energy will
                                         continue to increase in the future with emerging
                                         economies such as china and india as the driving
                                         force according to projections by the international
                                         energy agency iea and other organizations it is
                                         thought that the demand for oil and natural gas will
                                         continue to grow in the future as the core energy
                                         sources supporting the economic growth of emerging
                                         countries and developing nations on the other hand
                                         it was agreed at the laquila summit of july 2009 to
                                         reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 for
                                         developed nations and by half worldwide by 2050
                                         based on the copenhagen accord of december 2009
                                         moreover the main emitting countries clearly specified
                                         their reduction targets by 2020 there is thus an
                                         increasing awareness of initiatives aimed at tackling
                                         climate change on a global level in that backdrop the
                                         modern world requires ongoing efforts to holistically
                                         tackle economic growth and energy security and to
                                         respond to climate change
                                            given the view that the demand for oil and natural
                                         gas will continue to increase it will be necessary to

    representative director president   to maintain and develop a stable supply of energy if
    inpex corporation                    we include reserves expected to become recoverable
                                         due to the application of new technologies the
                                         reservetoproduction ratio of oil and natural gas is
                                         considered to be close to 80 years it is thought that
                                         the shift from developing the regions to date where
                                         recovery was comparatively easy to regions where
                                         recovery is difficult such as hadal zones and polar
                                         regions will incur greater costs than in the past and
                                         require consideration for safer operations additionally
                                         emerging consumer economies such as china and
                                         india are actively working on obtaining oil and natural
                                         gas assets overseas and with the rise of nationalism
                                         over resources in countries such as russia and
                                         venezuela as well as increasing national control of
                                         resources competition over resource acquisition is
                                         heating up

                                                                supply structure and contribute toward promoting the use
