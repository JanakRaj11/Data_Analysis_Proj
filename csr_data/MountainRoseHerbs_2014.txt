                                      water usage
        to determine total usage in production and operations we gathered all of our 2013
        water bills for our main facility

                                                                                           drinking

        tracking water use and employing water conservation tactics are both extremely impor
        tant to us
        some examples
        we use low flow toilets and urinals in all bathrooms
        we have bathroom faucet aerators which conserve water and energy
        our staff is trained to report leaky faucets and running toilets
        more on water conservation related to landscape management practices found in the sus
        tainable campus design section

                             facilities design
in 2013 we consolidated our production facility and storage warehouses from 115927 sq ft
to 114611 sq ft as a growing business this is extremely difficult to accomplish but the
results are significant  less travel and transport time lowers carbon emissions and increases
connectivity among departments
we use recycled or reclaimed materials whenever possible for construction and repair projects
inline with our zero waste policy
we use 22 motion sensors for lights and spent light bulbs are recycled
we use lemon essential oil and grapefruit seed extract to make a diy green surface cleaner
oshasaif air and ergo assessment
in 2013 we underwent a thorough air quality and ergonomics assessment to protect our
employees from minimal particulates we installed air filtration systems in the herb produc
tion and bulk herb filling areas decreasing incidental dust by an estimated 75 we insti
tuted a new ergonomics selfassessment form for office staff rick pasley our safety officer
makes routine visits and adjustments to work stations employee health is paramount

                       sustainable campus design
        this year we became the first eugene area business to be awarded
        salmonsafe certification
        salmon and water health are the cornerstones of environmental well
        being here in the pacific northwest any conservation efforts must
         include rigorous changes in how we live and work at every level
        shawn donnille coowner and vicepresident
        salmon species in the northwest are not only significant ecologically
        but culturally and spiritually as well they face many challenges due
        to habitat degradation overharvesting and climate change we feel
        it is our responsibility to protect them salmonsafe is a nonprofit
        that works with other conservation organizations to improve land
        management practices and ensure a future for our scaly friends
        salmonsafe has certified more than 60000 acres of farm and urban
        lands in oregon washington california and british columbia
        since we relocated to our current facility in 2010 we have dreamed
        of applying for salmonsafe certification in july 2013 we took the
        first step a team of expert scientists conducted a site assessment
        and looked at our overall wastewater management practices water
        quality and neighboring riparian corridors the good news is that
        were on the right track we conserve water with a satellite con
        trolled irrigation system maintain a pesticidefree facility and
        utilize a bioswale which naturally filters roof and pavement runoff
        and now we have the tools to do even more
        at the end of the day its about being accountable with the help of
        salmonsafe we are working to achieve this transparency by gather
        ing the facts analyzing them and improving our policies and proce
        dures mountain rose herbs has taken a firm stance on protecting
        aquatic life in urban ecosystems and we hope that other businesses
        farms and campuses will join us

                                                                                         no 11

                sustainable campus design
alternative transportation
in 2013 mountain rose herbs adopted a milelong section of the amazon bike path
many employees use this bike path to commute to and from work we feel its our
responsibility to maintain the path twice a year we pick up trash through the moun
tain rose river project to keep the amazon canal clean and beautiful for all to enjoy

                               waste  recycling
        zero waste
        in 2006 we created a zero waste policy and implemented our extensive recycling program
        in 2007 we continue to have great success diverting material from the landfill because we
        look at waste as a resource and commodity every scrap of discarded plastic office paper or
        cardboard is individually evaluated to be reused recycled composted and often
        reintroduced into the production cycle clearly labeled containers are placed in all work
        areas and a display in the break room educates employees about how to properly sort their
        recyclables compost and waste we also have three staff members who have completed the
        master recyclers training program offered by lane county waste management division

        our diversion rate this year is 928 compared to 892 in 2012
              an estimated 26441 pounds a year are diverted from the landfill and repurposed
