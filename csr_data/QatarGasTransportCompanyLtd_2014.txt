2013 co2 index




carbon dioxide co2 index
as acknowledged by the kyoto protocol co2 emissions
from international shipping cannot be attributed to any
particular national economy due to its global activities and
complex operation therefore imo has been energetically
pursuing the limitation and reduction of greenhouse
gas ghg emissions from international shipping in
recognition of the magnitude of the climate change
challenge and the intense focus on this topic

the index presents the concept of an indicator for the
energy efficiency of a ship in operation as an expression
of efficiency expressed in the form of co2 emitted per
unit of transport work the index is used as an objective
performancebased approach to monitoring the efficiency
of a ships operation and environmental performance

the calculation of co2 index is based on an individual
vessels fuel consumption and data on the achieved
transport work eg cargo mass number of passengers
carried etc

nakilats 2013 figures for the co2 index throughout its
fleet lng and lpg as shown above was satisfactory in
terms of efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions

     case study

     qatar champions lng as cleaner marine fuel
     nakilat and qatari lng producers qatargas and rasgas company
     limited agreed with engine manufacturer man diesel and turbo to
     convert a qmax vessel to use lng as an alternative to heavy fuel oil
     in the main engines

     the proactive initiative reinforces qatars commitment toward
     the environment with plans to convert an existing lowspeed
     diesel lng carrier to use lng as fuel thereby reducing the ships
     exhaust gas emissions

     shipyard operator nakilatkeppel offshore  marine nkom will
     complete the ships conversion at its erhama bin jaber al jalahma
     shipyard facilities in qatars port of ras laffan the modification
     will utilize man diesel and turbos megi mtype electronically
     controlled  gas injection systems as an innovative and flexible
     technology

     the qmax will be the worlds first lowspeed marine diesel engine to
     be converted to use lng as a fuel the modification will meet current
     known and future stated global emissions regulations

     the control of greenhouse gas and exhaust gas emissions have a
     high priority in todays shipping industry instep with the emissions
     regulations the engine manufacturer man diesel and turbo has
     made technical advancements to the low speed diesel engine to
     have flexibility to utilize liquefied natural gas lng a cleaner fuel as
     compared to heavy fuel oil as an alternative fuel source employing
     the megi mtype electronically controlled  gas injection concept
     evaluation of the proposed megi design for the qflex and qmax
     vessels has concluded in a high confidence level with regards to
     safety and reliability of the propulsion system

     this project is yet another milestone in qatars standing as a
     reliable provider of clean energy to its customers in a safe and
     environmentallysensitive manner and further evidence of qatars
     proactive approach to the sustainable development of the countrys
     marine industry so far the use of lng as a bunker fuel source in
     the lng shipping industry has been applied to conventional steam
     driven lng carriers and more recently to dual or trifuel diesel
     electric lng ships with low pressure injected medium speed four
     stroke diesels

     the use of megi as an alternative will allow a cleaner fuel technology
     with a significant reduction in environmental emissions cleaner
     burning engines with potential to increase mean time between
     maintenance provide flexibility of fuel supply to react to market
     changes and reduced bunkering activities which in turn will offer
     operations and marine risk reduction

committed to maintaining a record of zero fatalities  therefore

performance in terms of injuries shows improvements but we
still intend to foster an even stronger safety culture where both
standards and systems are continuously improved and where each
individual takes personal responsibility for creating a safe working
environment by reporting the unsafe acts and near misses
