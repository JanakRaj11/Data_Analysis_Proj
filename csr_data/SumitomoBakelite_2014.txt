hayashi      sales and profits increased over the                  ito    recently i understand that youre also
previous year but we didnt reach our target                      focusing on shale gas and oil
figures w e hav ent y e t reco v ered t o the                    hayashi      shale gas and oil are now big
performance levels before the financial shock of                   businesses in america consequently the group
2008                                                              has been reinforcing its phenolic resins production
ito   what do you think is the reason for this                    capacity for mining materials also in the past
hayashi      in the last few years weve pursued a                mining was carried out from strata 3000 meters
course of business consolidation this structural                  underground but now miners are starting at
reform is not yet complete first of all folding up               around 1000 meters to improve profitability
unprofitable operations and other measures                         naturally the conditions such as the temperature
reduced our overall sales on the other hand by                   and so on differ depending on where you dig and
concentrating on highprofit businesses and                        so various mining materials are required well
building new businesses weve set a strong                        develop products for all applications and supply
course for the future                                             them to american mining companies
                                                                   ito    you have competitors around the world but
           expanding and deepening
                                                                   where does the advantage of sumitomo bakelite
               our businesses
                                                                   lie

hayashi      until now weve produced medium                      specification which makes us a reliable partner in
term plans every three years but since the                        future china and europe will also start mining
lehman shock its been impossible to forecast                     shale gas and oil but america is expected to lead
the direction of the world economy and so weve                   in mining technology and so we need to
been revising our plans every year on a rolling                    strengthen our connections with american mining

with simple packaging and so we held group interviews to     sumitomo bakelite
investigate the question we found that even people with      tanaka it came about when we developed ecoceeel
no interest in environmental issues would buy products if     eco seal a very thin tough film we were looking for ways
they were marked as having simple packaging but many         to expand sales by focusing on the environmental benefits
companies assumed that they wouldnt sell at all gomi       of the product and so we visited an exhibition held by one
japan was inaugurated when we decided to conduct an           of our major customers they were displaying reduced

which products involve less packaging waste i was sure       company considering how few businesses take the path
that getting consumers to select products with an             of reducing packaging
awareness of waste would lead directly to reduced             tanaka    in fact the students from gomijapan asked me

                           contribute to society by reducing packaging waste using                reducedpackaging school at nada
                           our new technologies we wanted to check whether                        junior high school
                           ecoceeel  which uses our new technology and our
                           proposals for forming film packaging for meat without
                           using a tray like the packaging used for ham are
                           compatible with reducedpackaging products thats why
                           we invited professor ishikawa to tour the amagasaki plant
                           ishikawa     yes they are compatible from the viewpoint of
                           reducing excess packaging i think film is very logical what
                           impressed me about the plant is the prototype line where
                           customers can request prototype packaging i thought it
                           was interesting that various shapes can be made
                           tanaka     the packaging is molded with heat so we can
                           make them any shape besides the typical ham and
                           sausage weve recently expanded use of this packaging to             2013 october sumitomo bakelite and gomijapan held a collaborative
                                                                                                 class at nada junior high school on reducing packaging the pupils
                           rolled eggs stewed mackerel and other foodstuffs                    thought up and presented their own ideas for environmentally friendly
                                                                                                 packaging
                                     a new model for food packaging
                                       with thin strong ecoceeel

                            how has sumitomo bakelite packaging film evolved              enables a 20 reduction in the weight of packaging waste
                           over time                                                      compared with our earlier products this also reduces costs
                           tanaka in 1976 sumitomo bakelite was the first company         for food manufacturers since 2012 the film has been used
                           in the world to develop high performance multilayered           to package block ham seasoned pork and similar food
                           composite films and sheets in the past ham for example        products
                           was a preserved food and as such it was sold wrapped in         ishikawa    thats great through technological innovation
                           bamboo leaves but using film prevents oxidation which can     film is made thinner leading to reductions in co2 emissions
                           further extend the shelf life of the product later we          being able to work with a leading company with technical
                           developed japans first easyopen packaging and we have        capabilities like sumitomo bakelite is a major source of
                           gradually reduced the thickness of packaging film for more     strength for gomijapan
                           than 25 years weve supplied packaging film to a company       tanaka      our engagement with gomijapan has also
                           that makes a longselling brand of ham film that was 120       enabled us to take on new challenges something that left
                           microns thick when the ham first went on sale has been          a particular impression was our collaborative lesson at
                           thinned down to 70 microns also weve recently developed      nada junior high school it was a program where
                           ecoceeel using new production technology this achieves        sumitomo bakelite actually gave form to the students
                           an unprecedented level of thinness and strength which          ideas for reduced packaging we gathered lots of specific
                                                                                           ideas that you wouldnt have imagined coming from junior

   at the time of the development in fiscal 2012 the wetland had                we eliminated the invasive alien species water hyacinth which
   a uniform depth and so we created deeper and shallower                       flourished on the surface

order to implement these in parallel simultaneously we are        in japan and overseas in 2014
promoting the following efforts
❶shortening newproduct development periods and
    improving work quality
original plans have a tendency to be delayed when work is
returned because of any number of problems at the
development stage for new products for that reason we
implement efforts to shorten the development period by                                           whywhy analysis training at overseas sites
solving problems that have arisen by having all related
divisions collaborate from the initial stages thereby raising the
completeness of the quality of the design while eliminating
returns wherever possible furthermore we also are proactive
in the following two points to ensure that existing problems
