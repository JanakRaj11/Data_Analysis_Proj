of the work done by the eiffage foundation which has established
a longterm relationship with associations with the aim of furthering
social integration notably by helping people find suitable
accommodation training and jobs we are constantly strengthening

 accounting principles
 property under construction is accounted for by reference
 to the stage of completion upon a sale agreement being
 evidenced before a notary or upon a property develop
 ment contract being signed
 the stage of completion is determined by performing physical
 surveys of work performed and the percentage thus deter
 mined is applied to the estimated profit for the lots sold
