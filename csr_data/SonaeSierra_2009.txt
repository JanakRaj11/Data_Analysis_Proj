      in 2008 the ombudsman received 75 complaints mainly from shopping centre visitors regarding customer service issues and
      some minor issues encountered by our employees all complaints raised through the ombudsman are reported to the audit
      and compliance committee which ensures that appropriate procedures are put in place
     cr report feedback forms we encourage our stakeholders to provide us with feedback on our cr reports by including a
      feedback form at the back of each report this year our stakeholders can also provide feedback electronically by completing
      the form on our website httpsonaesierracomwebengbcorporateresponsibilitycrreportsfeedbackdefaultaspx feedback
      on our 2007 cr report was very positive with 666 69 people completed the feedback form for the 2007 cr report 
      90 of respondents were sierra employees most of whom were located in brazil of respondents stating that our existing cr
      strategy adequately addresses all of the cr issues which are important to them14 of the third of respondents who believed
      that there were further issues which sierra should address human resources and labour practice standards were the most
      common area cited other suggestions included further emphasis on renewable energy generation reducing electricity
      consumption and social responsibility in general these issues have been addressed by sierra in 2008 for example through the
      introduction of new hr policies see page 84 costbenefit studies for the integration of onsite renewable energy systems at
      20 of our shopping centres see page 35 and improvements in performance in terms of community investment and
      engagement see pages 79 and 80 in response to broader feedback received we have provided a feedback form in both our
      reports including additional space for respondents to make further comments and suggestions on our cr strategy and report

    how we engaged with and responded to our stakeholders in 2008
    in our 2007 cr report we committed to undertaking more targeted stakeholder engagement with some of our key
    stakeholders groups to mark the start of this journey this year we launched two new surveys a top tenant management
    level survey for our key tenant companies senior managers and a cr supplier questionnaire aimed at our high risk suppliers
    these surveys are described in more detail in the relevant impact area sections of this report our key methods of
    engagement feedback received and responses made in 2008 are summarised in the following section below in addition to
    those stakeholder groups mentioned in detail we also consider the media as an important stakeholder we engage with
    media representatives through attendance at conferences presentations and interviews and we regularly monitor press
    coverage received with respect to all our operations in 2008 we received 4043 cases of press coverage covering
    environmental social and economic issues of these 92 were positive

    global compact            httpwwwunglobalcompactorg
    sonae is a signatory of the global compact a voluntary contract between
    the united nations and the worldwide business community it is designed to
    encourage companies to embrace support and enact within their sphere of
    influence a set of core values in the areas of human rights labour standards
    the environment and anticorruption as we are partially owned by sonae
    we must provide this shareholder with an outline of how we comply with
    these principles so that sonae can fully report to the united nations
    although we are not obliged to report publicly about what we are doing to
    uphold the global compact principles we think it is relevant to include an
    overview in this report


      human rights

      1 we support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights the ethical principles established in our
         code of conduct include respect for the dignity and rights of each individual involved in our projects in 2007 we created the sierra
         ombudsman to promote compliance with this code and to ensure that individual concerns are addressed for more information on
         the sierra ombudsman see page 10

      2 we ensure that we are not complicit in human rights abuses our responsible procurement policy ensures that where possible
         we source materials and services from companies which adhere to ethical standards for more information on responsible
         procurement see suppliers page 60

      labour standards

      3 we uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining although we do not
         have a collective bargaining agreement in place our employees rights in respect of this principle are upheld by our code of conduct

      4 we aim to eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labour our responsible procurement policy ensures that we are not
         supporting the activities of suppliers who use forced or compulsory labour

      5 we support the effective abolition of child labour we do not use child labour our responsible procurement policy and code
         of conduct support this principle

      6 we aim to eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation we have a formal nondiscrimination and
         diversity policy setting out our commitment to a meritocratic culture and our objective to become a best practice reference in this
         aspect of corporate responsibility for more information on this policy see employees page 84

      environment

      7 we support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges although it is impossible to predict how climate change
         and other environmental risks will impact our business we believe in taking action now to prevent potentially serious and
         irreversible damage occurring in the future this is demonstrated by our iso 14001 certified corporate ems and our environmental
         standards for retail developments esrd described on page 23 we also commissioned a study to assess the financial impact of
         climate change on some of our assets which will foster our climate change strategy see climate change page 32

      8 we undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility we encourage our stakeholders to address their
         environmental impacts in 2008 we implemented a number of initiatives to help our tenants visitors and suppliers to reduce their
         impacts such as green travel plans for visitors page 35 environment training sessions for our staff and tenants pages 24 and 25
         and cr questionnaires for our suppliers pages 61 and 62

      9 we encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies we aim to build our shopping
         centres with high standards through our esrd whilst also ensuring that we implement suitable technologies where feasible such as
         the installation of rainwater harvesting at shopping penha in brazil see page 46

      anticorruption

      10 we work against corruption in all its forms including extortion and bribery sonae sierras ethical principles supported by

    our impact areas

    society and economy in 2006 we commissioned an independent review of the most important impacts of our business this
    study identified 9 cr material impact areas which have since become the cornerstone of our cr strategy and management
    system the materiality study was reviewed in 2007 and performed again in 2008 with the same conclusion that these
    impact areas continued to be the most important for sierra we have now established longterm objectives for each impact
    area as presented on the table in the following page

    environmental management


    for many organizations it is essential that environmental impacts are managed correctly climate change legislative
    requirements and increased public awareness of environmental issues mean that sound environmental management has
    become an essential component of a successful and sustainable business an environmental management system ems
    provides a strategic and comprehensive framework through which environmental impacts can be measured controlled and
    improved an effective ems that is externally certified to standards such as is0 1400120 demonstrates that environmental
    impacts are managed throughout the business and from product conception to completion furthermore third party
    certification is becoming increasingly important in the building design phase which is illustrated by the recently developed
    paneuropean breaam standard for shopping centres this standard will be launched in 200921 and will ensure that
    sustainability is assessed and compared in a uniform way across europe


    our strategy and management approach
    sonae sierra is committed to safeguarding the environment for both current and future generations by progressively using
    ecological efficiency as a reference point for management and competitiveness and by conceiving implementing and
    operating undertakings in an environmentally responsible way we aim to drive continuous improvement in the environmental
    performance of our products processes and activities our ems in force since 2000 covers all business activities and is
    applied to all countries where the company operates it has been certified in accordance with the iso 14001 standard22
    environmental issues are governed by our environmental policy our approach to environmental management focuses mainly
    on the 4 environmental impact areas identified as being those which are most material to our business activities climate
    change water waste and land use and are described in dedicated sections later in this report
    prior to a new investment in land or an asset an environmental site assessment is first made to assess the potential problems
    liabilities effects and impacts inherent to the development before the construction phase commences a preliminary
    environmental evaluation is conducted to identify potential environmental impacts of the construction operation and
    deactivation phases of the proposed development this results in a list of impact mitigation measures which should be
    undertaken at all stages of the developments lifecycle to ensure that negative impacts are prevented reduced or
    compensated for whilst positive impacts are maximised
    during the design stage we have introduced a green centre concept which is achieved through the implementation of our
    ems and the esrd the esrd comprise 190 standards which have been established based on our experience best available
    technologies and international certifications systems such as leed and breeam the esrd span several issues such as energy
    water waste transport health  wellbeing and sustainability land ecology and community and are revised periodically to
    ensure that the tool is kept up to date
    over the past few years we have strengthened the implementation of the esrd and have continued to roll out iso 14001
    certifications across our owned shopping centres and construction projects to date we have obtained iso 14001
    certifications for our corporate ems for 39 shopping centres in operation in portugal spain italy and brazil and for 17 site
    specific ems implemented on construction sites in portugal spain germany italy greece and brazil

         iso 14001 specifies requirements for an environmental management system which enable an organization to develop and implement a policy and objectives which take
         into account legal and other requirements to which the organization subscribes it applies to those environmental aspects that the organization identifies as those which
         it can control and those which it can influence

          waste management as part of our efforts to improve waste management we provide training to tenants and staff and
          continue to invest in new technology for example at maiashopping and guimarãeshopping in portugal we installed new waste
          compactors which have resulted in increases of 23 and 31 in waste recycling at these centres

          water use we believe that we can contribute to safeguarding the worlds valuable water resources by investing in sustainable
          technologies which use water efficiently and enable us to reuse and recycle water during the construction and operation of our
          centres

           efficiency measures in 2008 water efficient taps were installed in some shopping centres for instance at viacatarina in
            portugal and zubiarte in spain this led to savings of 5 and 50 respectively at avenida m40 in spain a combination of
            water efficient taps and irrigation equipment achieved savings of 40 as a result of the refurbishment of centro colombo in
            portugal new waterless urinals and photoelectric sensor taps were installed waterless urinals work without water through the
            incorporation of a sealant which prevents smells and odours this type of solution is becoming standard throughout our new
            projects due to its water saving efficiency and short payback periods

           recycling and reuse we reduced the use of water in cooling towers at max center in spain and at arrábidashopping in
            portugal at arrábidashopping water consumption was reduced by 10 through innovative recycling and reuse technologies
            similarly at freccia rossa in italy a rainwater collection and treatment system enabling rainwater to be used to flush toilets and
            urinals was incorporated into the design of this centre we also seek to minimise water usage on our construction sites for
            example at gli orsi in italy we reused 112m3 of water on site during construction

           monitoring in 2008 we also installed submeters at a number of centres including plaza mayor valle real and la farga all in
            spain which enable us to accurately monitor water use and identify potential savings

          material use our responsible procurement policy encourages us to procure goods and services during project development and
          centre management which meet certain criteria which are aligned with our sustainability goals and objectives in accordance with
          this policy in 2008 our shopping centres purchased and used on average about 82 of recycled paper grancasa in spain and
          shopping campo limpo and pátio brasil shopping both in brazil are examples of centres that purchased 100 of their paper
          from recycled sources

          energy management in addition to the energy saving initiatives listed under en6 and en18 we also installed energy meters at
          a number of centres including arrábidashopping in portugal grancasa in spain valecenter in italy and boavista shopping and
          shopping penha in brazil which enable us to accurately monitor energy use and identify potential savings

          emissions from transport we have developed a climate change strategy to reduce our direct and indirect ghg emissions
          scopes 1 2 and 3 of the ghg protocol this includes the roll out of green travel plans at our centres and developing an action
          plan to reduce the impact of our company car fleet we also conduct transport studies at our centres to understand how visitors
          could reach our shopping centres which lead to recommendations that should be implemented during the construction and
          operational phase to maximize the use of public transport bicycle parking taxi and bus stops special parking places  signage
          are some of the measures that result from these studies at plaza mayor in spain the promotion of public transport and bicycle
          usage proper pedestrian routes and the creation of parking spaces for visitors that share cars are expected to allow an annual
          savings of an estimated 380000 tonnes of co2 scopes 1 and 2

      achieve a 10 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ghg by square metre of gross lettable area by 2020 compared to the 2005
      level ghg protocol scopes 1 and 2 plus business air travel




    the earths climate is changing this process has been instigated by the build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and
    will affect the global community mainly through changing weather patterns and subsequent disruption to ecosystems
    climate change has continued to move up the political economic and social agendas across the globe for example in 2008
    the eu committed to reduce ghg emissions by 20 increase energy efficiency by 20 and achieve a 20 renewable
    energy use all by 2020 the parties to the united nations climate change convention met in poznan poland and agreed to
    fully engage negotiations for an effective climate change strategy to be designed before the end of 2009
    for sierra as a shopping centre developer and manager climate change encompasses several different issues these include
    ghg emissions and their reduction combined with the mitigation of other significant air emissions we also promote energy
    efficiency the use of renewable energy climate change adaptation strategies and sustainable transport

    we are committed to reducing the ghg emissions arising as a result of our operations and to raising awareness among all
    parties with which we are involved we have monitored and targeted energy usage in our shopping centres and main offices
    since 2002 and in 2006 we developed a climate change strategy to reduce our direct and indirect ghg emissions covering

    resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd the following diagram indicates

         direct emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by sierra for example direct emissions related to combustion would arise from burning fuel
         within sierras operational boundaries such as by the company car fleet natural gas used in shopping centre boilers and onsite cogeneration powered by natural gas
         or fuel
    28
         indirect emissions are emissions that result from sierras activities but are owned or controlled by another organisation ghg emissions from the generation of electricity
         that is imported and consumed by sierra fall into this category

    key achievements in 2008
     we reduced the energy consumption of the landlordcontrolled area of our shopping centres kwh per m2 of mall  toilet
      area by 14
     although total greenhouse gas emissions increased in line with the growth of business in 2008 we successfully reduced the
      carbon intensity of our business this contributed to achieving our target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1 per
      square metre of gross lettable area ghg protocol scopes 1 and 2
     we saved 1741385 kwh of electrical energy through a range of efficiency measures enabling us to avert 559858 tonnes
      of carbon emissions
     we undertook co2 audits scope 1 and 2 in 2 countries with the purpose of monitoring ghg emissions generated through
      specific energy uses in shopping centres and identifying opportunities for reductions
     we undertook full energy audits at shopping centres where these had not been recently performed and implemented the
      recommendations of energy audits that had already been performed at 7 centres in portugal
     we performed cost benefit studies for the integration of onsite renewable energy generation at 20 of our shopping
      centres in operation including plaza mayor dos mares and luz del tajo in spain where we will seek to implement
      photovoltaic energy systems
     we continued to install the necessary infrastructure to measure and monitor separately individual energy uses separately at
      centres where this had not already been installed
     we were selected as a partner of the european commissions sustainable energy campaign  see page 16 for further
      details
     following the pilot project at centro colombo in 2007 we launched green travel plans at a further 5 shopping centres in
      operation with the aim of increasing the use of sustainable modes of travel to and from the centres to the benefit of staff
      tenants suppliers visitors local communities and the environment

      actions taken to reduce energy use and associated ghg emissions

      installation of energy efficient lighting achieved estimated savings of 1066025 kwh of electricity and 305614 kg of co2

      in a number of centres we reduced lighting energy requirements by installing more energy efficient lighting solutions such as electronic
      ballasts and energy efficient bulbs this was the case for cascaishopping centro vasco da gama and viacatarina in portugal la farga
      in spain and parque d pedro shopping in brazil

      we also incorporated efficient lighting measures into the design of our centres in conjunction with having optimum natural lighting
      conditions gli orsi in italy has also installed a selection of high frequency ballasts and metal halide compact fluorescent t5 and t8
      fluorescent lamps although more expensive to install these fluorescent lamps convert electrical power into light more efficiently and
      therefore lower energy costs over the long run

      installation of lighting control systems achieved estimated savings of 237953 kwh of electricity and 74171 kg co2

      in a number of centres we reduced lighting energy requirements by installing lighting control systems such as automatic movement and
      daylight sensors and scheduled timers this was the case for estação viana and guimarãeshopping both in portugal

      installation of energy efficient hvac equipment and control systems achieved savings 437407 kwh of electricity and
      180074 kg co2

      in some of our centres we reduced energy requirements of our chillers and hvac systems by replacing old systems with more energy
      efficient ones and by installing operational controls such as scheduled timers for example a more efficient air conditioning system was
      installed at viacatarina in portugal and the timing of hvac systems at centro vasco da gama in portugal and valle real in spain were
      optimised

    case study
    energy conservation measures in portugal and italy
    in 2008 sierra partnered with energy provider sodesa in the context of portugals strategic
    energy efficiency plan to provide financial support to initiatives which promote energy
    efficiency in the industrial retail residential and services sectors one approved initiative was
    the retrofitting of light bulbs ballasts
    4 sierra shopping centres in portugal centro colombo centro vasco da gama
    cascaishopping and viacatarina were able to replace 9600 light fixtures with more
    efficient alternatives enabling a reduction of around 600 tonnes of co2
    serra shopping also in portugal achieved a yearonyear reduction in electricity
    consumption per m2 of mall  toilet area of 3 one of the energy saving measures
    implemented by this shopping centre was the installation of a system which controls the
    shopping centre lighting levels in accordance with daylight levels this system is controlled
    by the building management system bms and allows for several different levels of lighting
    to suit the needs of each area in the shopping centre
    airone shopping centre in italy does not have a bms and the cooling equipment is a stand
    alone system nevertheless by monitoring the start up timing of cooling equipment and
    ensuring it met minimum operational requirements significant savings were achieved
    within the limits of external temperatures in 2008 this adjustment allowed for a minimum
    increase in energy consumption as the temperatures were higher than 2007 we estimate
    that these measures enabled us to reduce the cooling system electricity consumption
    requirements by 126000 kwh per year

    in august 2008 pátio brasil shopping in brazil launched the first
    international environmental humour event with the opening of the
    eco cartoon competition the aim of the project was to raise
    awareness of the problems associated with global warming whilst
    strengthening the image of pátio brasil shopping as a shopping centre                                 2nd
    which promotes environmental responsibility pátio brasil shopping
    invited the free participation of amateur and professional cartoonists
    from brazil and abroad to create comical images with the theme of
    global warming
    a panel of judges selected the best cartoon to feature in an exhibition
    in the central court of the shopping centre and three selected finalists
    received prize money of up to 1130 the first prize winner illustrated
    that by destroying nature mankind also destroys himself the second
    showed the ignorant human being who cuts down trees the third                                        3rd
    portrayed a modern noahs ark in which animals are rounded up in
    pairs and put into a freezer to preserve them from extinction this was
    ecology presented in a different way and with a lighter touch which
    successfully raised public awareness about a serious subject and
    challenged viewers to search for solutions

                                               largely explained by a significant increase in sonae sierras operations and a greater
                                               international presence these factors have resulted in an increase in employee business

        comment
        the number of visits has increased in line with the growth of our portfolio although it is challenging for sierra to
        effectively influence the mode of transport chosen by visitors it is interesting to note that this year there has been an
        increase in other modes of transport used not private car this is partly influenced by the fact that some of our centres
        which were opened or acquired in 2007 and reported for the first time in 2008 have citycentre locations with very good
        public transport links such as alexa in germany we have also sought to promote other modes of transport among visitors
        through the establishment of green travel plans gtps during 2008 5 new gtps were launched at 5 different centres

                                   water




         longterm objective

         strive to keep water consumption at or below 4 litresvisityear until 2012




    water is one of the most valuable natural resources on the planet it is essential for human life economic development and
    the earths ecosystems yet its mismanagement coupled with the growing effects of climate change mean that access to a
    clean and reliable water source is increasingly limited in many countries across the world the wwf living planet report34
    2008 highlights that a number of european countries are regions of moderate water stress as demonstrated by the
    shortages experienced in spain during the summer of 200835 as the growing human population and the effects of climate
    change put increasing pressure on water resources the effective management and regulation of this resource will become
    increasingly important a recent report from the international management consultancy arthur d little describes water as
    the next carbon36 suggesting that regulatory standards and stakeholder expectations concerning water management will
    develop in a similar way to that of carbon seen in recent years
    at sonae sierra we believe that we can contribute to safeguarding the worlds water resources though conserving water by
    increasing the water efficiency of our assets and maximising water reuse at our centres we can also ensure that the quality of
    local watercourses is maintained by ensuring that our wastewater is appropriately managed and pollution incidents are
    avoided at all costs

    our strategy
    in our shopping centres in operation our strategy to date has been to increase water efficiency by investing in more water
    efficient equipment and to undertake initiatives to increase awareness regarding water saving among staff and visitors we
    also have a strategy in place for addressing water aspects during the project design and development phase since our esrd
    include requirements to reduce water consumption ensure wastewater quality and promote water reuse


    key achievements in 2008
     we reduced water consumption in litres per visit by 125 from 40 in 2007 to 35 in 2008
     we reused 33 of the global water consumed by sierra through the water reuse systems installed at arrábidashopping
      and cascaishopping both in portugal and parque d pedro shopping in brazil
     we undertook full water consumption audits at shopping centres where these had not recently been performed and
      implemented the recommendations of water audits that had already been carried out at 4 centres in portugal
     we undertook feasibility studies for rainwater harvesting at 2 shopping centres in portugal and 3 in brazil and will seek to
      install these systems in 2009 in addition to the one already implemented in brazil
     we continued to install the necessary infrastructure to measure and monitor individual water uses separately in centres
      where this had not already been completed

      actions taken to reduce water consumption

      we installed waterless or sensoroperated urinals in 4 centres in operation as well as all completed projects and sensor taps at some of
      our operational centres in portugal and spain

      at luz del tajo in spain we achieved a water saving of 5796m3 in 2008 by introducing a better way of regulating the water required by
      the cooling towers at this site

      at arrábidashopping in portugal water consumption in the cooling towers was reduced by 10 through innovative recycling and reuse
      technologies

      at freccia rossa in italy a rainwater collection and treatment system was incorporated into the design of the shopping centre enabling
      rainwater to be used to flush toilets and urinals

      at centro vasco da gama in portugal we made improvements to the skylight roof which uses water for visual effects and for interior
      decoration by increasing the efficiency of the skylights water use we were able to make a 28 reduction in water consumption this
      improvement was the result of specific work conducted on the skylight pipes that cost 1001 between february and december 2008
      cost savings of 31600 have been achieved




    case study
    rainwater harvesting at shopping penha
    shopping penha in brazil installed a system to collect rainwater for use in cooling towers
    the system has a catchment area of 4000m2 and it enables the capture filtering and
    chlorination of rainwater a reserve tank allows for enough water to be stored to provide for
    3 days without rain this system will enable an estimated annual water saving of around
    5540m3 per year with a payback on investment of just 02 years and ongoing cost savings
    through reduced withdrawal from the municipal water network the system is both
    economical and beneficial to the environment




    targets
    going forwards our objective in terms of water management is to reduce water consumption per centre visit our action plan
    to achieve this reduction includes installing metering systems which accurately measure and monitor water use in different
    areas of our centres we will also continue to seek opportunities to improve water efficiency through the installation of
    efficient devices such as dual flush wcs waterless urinals and sensor taps which reduce water use where feasible to do so
    we will also implement water reuse systems

        comment on trend
        overall 33 of the water used in the portfolio is being reused or recycled this represents a decrease in comparison
        with last years result which is partly due to the fact that overall water consumption of other sources rather than
        reuse has increased by 19 it is also influenced by the fact that the water recycling equipment at parque d pedro
        shopping underwent maintenance and was out of operation for some time during the reporting period however this
        year water reuse systems were installed in two more centres arrábidashopping and cascaishopping in portugal this
        equipment recycles cooling tower water which would previously have been wasted

         longterm objectives

         increase the proportion of total waste by weight that is recycled recovered or reused in order to obtain a minimum 50 recycling rate
         by 2020
         reduce the proportion of total waste by weight that is sent to landfill in order to attain a maximum 30 of waste sent to landfill
         by 2020




    each year approximately one third of all resources used in europe becomes waste37 much of this waste ends up in landfill
    sites squandering natural resources and creating environmental problems for years to come not only are our stakeholders
    increasingly concerned about this issue the cost of disposing waste in landfill sites is also rising
    given that our business activities both directly and indirectly have the potential to create large amounts of waste we place
    great importance on effective waste management our key priority is to increase the amount of waste that we recycle
    recover38 and reuse and ultimately reducing the amount of waste which we send to landfill

         waste recovery refers to a waste management operation that diverts a waste material from the waste stream and which results in a certain product with a potential
         economic or ecological benefit it mainly refers to the following operations
          energy recovery ie reuse a fuel
          biological recovery eg composting

    our strategy
    in our owned shopping centres we handle large quantities of waste most of which are produced by our tenants and visitors
    over the past 8 years we have successfully achieved significant reductions in the amount of waste that we send to landfill
    this is largely due to our efforts to increase recycling rates by maximising waste separation at source seeking new
    opportunities for waste recycling and carrying out awarenessraising and training activities among our staff tenants and
    service suppliers during the construction phase waste management has been focused on reuse of waste generated and
    separation of waste at source in order to maximise recycling rates


    key achievements in 2008
     we increased our global average recycling rate from 35 in 2007 to 42 in 2008 representing a 20 increase and
      reduced the global rate of waste sent to landfill by 13 allowing us to fully achieve both our waste targets
     we identified suitable waste composting facilities for riosul and viacatarina shopping centres in portugal and airone in
      italy and began sending organic waste to these
     we identified options for sending waste to energy recovery facilities at norteshopping in portugal plaza éboli and zubiarte
      shopping centres in spain and freccia rossa in italy thus allowing us to further divert waste sent to landfill at these centres
     with the aim of identifying further possibilities for increasing the rate of waste recovered recycled and reused at our centres
      we commissioned waste characterisation studies at one shopping centre per country in all countries where we operate


      actions to increase waste recycling and reduce waste sent to landfill

      valle real shopping centre in spain piloted a scheme to increase the quality of waste separation by tenants through the use of
      surveillance cameras this initiative contributed to valle real achieving an average recycling rate of 42 in 2008 up 40 since 2006

      at maiashopping and guimarãeshopping in portugal we installed new waste compactors which have resulted in 23 and 31
      increase in recycling of waste at these centres

      at pátio brasil shopping in brazil the personæ quick wins method of using pamphlets to present examples of nonconformances and
      their respective solutions was adopted to improve environmental performance in particular waste management this and other training
      and awareness actions and in particularly the beginning of organic waste separation and accounting contributed to achieve a 34
      recycling rate in 2008 up 113 on 2007

      at dos mares and luz del tajo in spain we collaborated with local councils to raise awareness about waste recycling among our visitors
      we also actively participated in campaigns to collect waste vegetable oil at dos mares in spain and also at shopping penha and
      shopping plaza sul both in brazil at dos mares centre 6000 bottles were distributed for visitors to collect waste vegetable oil from
      their homes and bring to the centre for recycling

      at tivoli shopping and franca shopping both located in brazil we launched a christmas promotion with the slogan comprou trocou
      ganhou purchased exchanged earned which involved shoppers with canvas bags to reduce the need for plastic ones each
      shopping centre distributed a total of around 4000 canvas bags

    case study
    finding ways to further improve waste management
    lessons from arrábidashopping
    following the reports of waste characterization studies carried out in previous years it
    came to the attention of arrábidashopping portugal that a significant amount of
    recyclable material was still being sent to landfill an investigation into the matter
    revealed that the shopping centres cinemas were not adequately served by onsite
    waste segregation infrastructure
    the arrábidashopping management team decided to create a specific area to manage
    all the waste produced by the cinemas with separate waste containers for different
    waste streams moreover a specific room was created to fine tune this segregation
    enabling the recovery of organic waste and some packaging waste that was previously
    sent to landfill
    the waste management area was introduced in july and the waste room in october
    both actions promoted a substantial increase in the waste recycling rate and a decrease
    in waste sent to landfill thus reducing operational costs and increasing revenues
    associated with waste valorisation
    the waste management area was introduced in july and the waste room in october
    both actions contributed to an improvement in our waste management performance
    reduced operational costs and increased revenues associated with waste valorisation for
    example in 2008 the average recycling rate was 8 higher in comparison to 2007 whilst
    on average we reduced the amount of waste sent to landfill by 13 tonnes per month
    furthermore our revenues from recycling increased by 409 per month in 2008 and we
    saved on average 933 per month in landfill costs

        methodological note
        this data is gathered monthly across all owned shopping centres under our management and is collated in
        our online data system where it is recorded in accordance with the eu waste catalogue classification system
        or the brazilian waste classes the eu waste catalogue and the brazilian classification have also been used to
        determine the classification of hazardous and nonhazardous waste at the end of the reporting year waste
        data is checked and consolidated at shopping centre country and global level in order to obtain the kpi in
        accordance with the gri protocols the waste destination categories recorded in the online data system are
        merged with the equivalents set out in the gri protocols
        not all the properties are able to weigh their waste and for this reason conversion factors must be applied to
        covert volume to mass kgm3 waste where this is the case a standard factor has been applied at all
        properties unless there is evidence to suggest that a more accurate value should be used instead this is the
        case for guimarãeshopping in portugal and franca shopping in brazil as a result of a waste audit conducted
        at these centres

        comment
        quantities sent to landfill have decreased despite the fact that the amount of
        total waste produced increased during the period this absolute increase in total
        waste was again largely due to the portfolio growth resulting in the inclusion
        of 5 additional properties in this indicator this year

                                  land use




         longterm objective

         promote the use of previously developed land for new shopping centre projects and to protect and enhance biodiversity wherever
         possible until 2012




    when land is altered from its natural state it can contribute to biodiversity loss and disturb ecological processes when these
    impacts are not carefully managed the environment can be damaged with longterm impacts for the surrounding
    community the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity teeb review39 the first major report into the economic impact of
    biodiversity loss has found that mass extinctions of plants and animals could have a severe impact on the living standards of
    the poorest people on the planet and cost up to 45 billion a year it emphasises that the loss of biodiversity and ecosystems
    is a threat to the functioning of our planet our economy and society and as a result recommends that biodiversity be
    integrated into all our policies
    as a leading property developer and manager biodiversity is impacted by our operations and we consider a number of issues
    to ensure that impacts on biodiversity arising from our activities are minimised in particular we encourage the use of
    previously developed sites and remediation of contaminated land where possible we avoid developing on greenfield land
    and on sites containing rare species or habitats

    our strategy
    an overview of our principal impacts on land use and our strategy to mitigate these is available on our website
    httpwwwenvironmentsonaesierracompublicnormalenusenvironmentissueslanduseaspx
    as a shopping centre developer and manager our most fundamental impact on biodiversity results from the development of
    land and the associated change in land use that this causes this is particularly relevant where projects are located on
    greenfield or previously undeveloped land which are more likely to be rich in biodiversity or perform valuable ecosystem
    services and functions we apply environmental due diligence edd procedures to all potential land acquisitions in order to
    assess the risk of contaminated land and if necessary to request funding for remediation or monitoring
    we believe that the greatest opportunity to minimise our impacts on biodiversity lie in the project development and
    construction phase which is why our strategy focuses on the following procedures and policies
     where an environmental impact assessment eia is not required by law the new business environment procedure
      requires all new projects to conduct a preliminary environmental evaluation pee this aims to identify potential impacts of
      project design construction and operation on the sites biodiversity and recommends mitigation measures we then monitor
      the implementation of these recommendations to ensure that impacts on biodiversity are minimised as far as possible40
     we are also committed to implementing site specific environmental management systems ems for each projects
      construction works which guarantees impact minimization during the construction phase since 2004 17 of our completed
      projects have obtained iso 14001 certification for environmental management on the construction site ems audits are also
      undertaken during development and operation phases to ensure compliance with sierras ems legal requirements and pre
      defined mitigation measures
    we have also established environmental standards for retail developments esrd which are implemented during the
    design phase and aim to minimise the environmental impact of each building during its operational life an internal analysis
    of the extent of compliance with the esrd standards is undertaken one month after the completion of each project
    concerning biodiversity in particular the esrd establishes that
     ecological features with a very high value must be preserved and other relevant ecological features should be preserved as
      far as possible
     native plants species should be specified for use on all of the developments outdoor soft landscaping works and
      preference should be given to the use of green barriers such as hedgerows rather than fences
     flat roofs ie roofs with gradients of no more than 5 degrees which are not used for any specific purpose eg car
      parking pedestrians use housing of plant rooms etc should be considered for design as green roofs
    in 2007 we launched our long term land use management strategy which includes proposed targets and actions relating to
    biodiversity to be implemented during a five year period 2007  2012 this strategy incorporates the targets set for 2008
    published on page 61 below this strategy also includes actions related to our shopping centres in operation we have some
    ongoing projects to protect existing habitats and we also seek to raiseawareness of biodiversity through marketing events
    and other initiatives promoted among shopping centre staff andor visitors

    key achievements in 2008
     we held biodiversity events to raise awareness among staff andor visitors in 98 of our centres
     we developed a native tree database designed to record the location and log the native trees species present on each
      construction site monitor the trees that have been preserved relocated or felled as a result of the construction activities
      we also monitor the number and type of new trees planted at each project
     we commissioned surveys of the trees present at 8 undeveloped sites prior to construction
     we also undertook several measures to restore habitats at specific locations
          at loop5 a project under development in germany we installed a unique water filtration system to treat contaminated
           groundwater extracted during the construction process and reintroduce it into the soil the treatment of a total amount
           of 122330m3 41 of groundwater through an activated carbon filtering process contributed to restoring the local and
           regional groundwater conditions monitored by specialists from cdm42
          at parque d pedro shopping in brazil we continued to preserve and maintain a corridor of fauna and flora the corridor
           extends from private land adjacent to the shopping centre to the interstate rodovia d pedro i covering an area of
           14820m2 the conservation of the corridor of fauna and flora occurs continuously through gardening procedures
           general maintenance pest control and replanting schemes undertaken by specialists at arborea ambiental43
          we rescued 4 iguanas 6 snakes 4 scorpions 1 spider and 1 grasshopper within the context of the animal rescue
           programme on the construction site of manauara shopping in brazil



    case study
    pátio brasil shopping adopts a natural spring
    aware of the importance of water conservation and other concerns relating to
    environmental protection pátio brasil shopping in brazil adopted a spring in the parque
    ecológico riacho fundo assuming responsibility for its revival and conservation the spring
    is located at the head of the riacho fundo tributary which flows into the paranoá lake and
    surrounding waters of the city of brasilia the adopt a spring programme in which pátio
    brasil shopping participated was developed by the environmental institute and brazil
    environmental water resources and is linked to the secretariat for urban development and
    environment of the federal district government in february 2009 a committee made up of
    representatives of the shopping centre marketing and operations teams technicians and
    landscape architects lead by dr vandete maldaner biologist and programme coordinator
    visited the spring the team were able to evaluate the streams condition and have
    developed a strategy to guarantee the survival of the stream and to ensure that it is
    conserved in a state which mimics its natural condition as far as possible



    targets
    our land use targets focus on ensuring compliance with the recommendations of the pees and maximising efficient use of
    developed spaces through the development of green roof areas and sustainable drainage systems

      longterm objective

      foster loyalty amongst frequently used suppliers and seek to help and encourage them to adopt more responsible business practices
      themselves




    all organisations rely on the products and services provided by other businesses in order to function effectively in the property
    sector our supply chain can have significant cr impacts in recent years the role of responsible procurement in achieving
    global environmental and social goals has been increasingly acknowledged and acted upon by the international community
    for this reason we consider our suppliers cr performance with respect to environmental ethical and social issues including
    safety and health a priority this is why we engage with our suppliers about cr issues and we promote the responsible
    procurement of goods and services

    our strategy
    in 2007 sonae sierra developed and formally approved a responsible procurement policy this policy sets out our aims to
     encourage the use of environmentallyfriendly materials
     integrate cr criteria into our service suppliers management procedures thus ensuring that the social and environmental
      performance of our suppliers is considered when tendering managing and evaluating supplier contracts
     engage with our suppliers in order to improve their performance across our cr impact areas
    we also continue to collaborate closely with our suppliers on specific issues such as safety and health and environment
    through procedures such as the spi and spo environment training and the esrd


    key achievements in 2008
     we launched a supplier cr questionnaire with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the corporate responsibility
      practices of our high risk regular suppliers for both development and property management services
     we included cr clauses in all new development suppliers contracts signed with a value of more than 2 million euros and in
      all new contracts signed with main property management service suppliers cleaning services maintenance security and
      waste removal
     we sent copies of our approved responsible procurement policy to all our development and property management
      suppliers
     we increased the proportion of paper purchased from recycled sources at sierra offices in spain germany greece and
      romania to 80

    case study
    how engagement on cr issues can improve relationships with our
    suppliers the case of giglio and shopping plaza sul in brazil
    to be honest we did have some problems in our relationship with shopping plaza sul but
    after our meeting with mr carlos goto the shopping centres operations manager about
    sierras safety and health and environment policies we were able to absolve our differences
    and align our working practices after this meeting my respect for sonae sierra increased a
    lot i began to understand and appreciate the full extent of sierras interest and investment
    in environmental issues something which i hadnt previously imagined a shopping centre
    developer and manager to be committed to we are aware that there is legislation which
    imposes regulations concerning the way in which shopping centres handle the waste they
    produce as we work with shopping centres a lot but we have never seen any others with a
    commitment like sonae sierras it was important for me to hear mr goto speaking about
    the shopping centres environmental concerns and as my respect for sierras commitment
    increased we were able to align our working practices
    monika giglio cypriano
    giglio collects waste vegetable oil from restaurant units in shopping plaza sul which it
    recycles to produce cleaning products giglio has also recently begun collecting waste
    vegetable oil brought in by staff at sierras own office in são paulo




    ensuring continuous improvement
    we have several procedures in place to ensure that we evaluate and promote improvements in terms of our suppliers cr
    practices on an ongoing basis these include
     service suppliers evaluation procedure including criteria relating to cr
     environment training plan for each shopping centre which includes the identification of training requirements for service
      suppliers
     safety and health monitoring procedures including spo and spi reported in the safety and health section on pages 93 and
      94 and environmental procedures including the implementation of the esrd
     suppliers cr questionnaire
    the suppliers cr questionnaire has provided us with useful feedback concerning our most important or high risk suppliers
    cr practices and constitutes a platform for further engagement the suppliers cr questionnaire allocates a score for each
    supplier based on their response to questions concerning environmental social and ethical aspects of their business the
    overall rating is assigned based on the total score achieved by the supplier divided by the total points considered to be
    achievable this takes account of the fact that some questions may not be applicable to every supplier company from this
    score we generate a percentage to which the rating is assigned
    75 or above          a rating
    50 or above          b rating
    25 or above          c rating
    less than 25         d rating

    the results received in 2008 from sierras main suppliers were in general very positive of a total of 61 property management
    suppliers surveyed cleaning services maintenance and waste removal 57 gained an a rating and 26 gained a b
    rating these findings suggest that suppliers are generally proactive on crissues in response to the questionnaire results
    received in 2008 tailored action plans were made for all the property management suppliers with a c rating designed to
    orientate them towards improving their cr performance the propagation of these action plans is supported by a
    presentation that will be given to all these suppliers in order to share with them some of sierras key policies and procedures
    in terms of cr including code of conduct environmental policy responsible procurement policy and community
    volunteering and investment actions and inform them that we expect a similar attitude in the short term we will aim to
    ensure that our high risk suppliers for property management complete the cr questionnaire again in 2009 and meet a
    minimum cr rating this will also enable us to monitor whether improvements have been made and identify any further
    corrective actions that are necessary
    concerning development suppliers 6 out of 8 high risk development suppliers47 identified in europe responded to the cr
    questionnaire in 2008 of these 83 n5 received an a rating all of these suppliers demonstrated a willingness to pursue
    actions to improve their scores in future in brazil however smaller suppliers working on our new projects were honest in
    recognising that they were not accustomed to working with sustainability policies although they were interested to learn
    more about this larger suppliers tended to have more awareness about sustainability but the application of sustainability
    practices in the provision of services was not yet common practice the implementation of the iso 14001 standard on
    construction sites and achievement of accredited certification is one key way in which we can encourage our development
    suppliers to introduce cr practices
    with respect to issues of labour practices and human rights in the supply chain responsibilities for these matters are fulfilled
    by the companies which we contract to coordinate safety and health all persons working on the construction sites of sierra
    projects must be identified and their employment contracts verified it is explicitly forbidden for children or young adults
    under the legal working age to be employed on our sites and the sh coordinates must ensure that the law is abided by
    with respect to this issue checks from the relevant authorities are periodically carried out to ensure that such obligations are
    adhered to


         a lesson to be learned raising safety and health standards across our supply chain

         sonae sierras sh performance on development projects depends largely on the dedication and commitment of our service suppliers
         to ensure a leading position within the shopping centre industry sonae sierra needs to guarantee that the performance of our suppliers
         conforms to our stringent requirements through the establishment of effective management procedures

         regrettably in 2008 a contractor working on the construction site at manauara shopping in brazil was fatally injured to avoid such
         tragic incidents occurring in the future we believe it is of utmost importance to implement rules and guidelines to incorporate into the
         selection bidding and postcontract evaluation procedures for our suppliers we also need to ensure that bids and contracts are
         understood and accepted by all our stakeholders in particular service providers must be fully aware of their responsibilities to accept and
         implement our policies which are intended to prevent potential environmental impacts occupational injuries and illnesses

         one of the challenges we now face is the lack of competitive bids in some of the remote areas where we operate such as manaus this
         means it is particularly challenging to find suppliers who meet our high performance standards but we are committed to working with
         our suppliers and helping them to achieve the best results possible




    47
         according to our definition high risk suppliers are those suppliers which due to the nature of the activities they perform need to be monitored in terms of
         environmental andor social standards in order to protect the image and position of sierras cr policy and of sierra developments typically these include our building
         contractors

         all contracts ones with new suppliers but also the ones that are renewed will be updated to contain these clauses

    our strategy  management approach
    in the past few years we have pursued various initiatives to increase and maintain tenant satisfaction we undertake annual
    tenant satisfaction surveys in all our owned shopping centres which allow us to gain feedback on operational aspects
    marketing events communications our cr programme and satisfaction with our shopping centre management teams and
    with sierra in general these survey results allow us to develop followup action plans at the shopping centre level which aim
    to improve aspects with lower scores and ultimately drive continuous improvement in tenant satisfaction levels in 2008 we
    also launched our top tenant management level survey to receive feedback from key tenant companies at the senior
    management level we plan to roll this survey out across further countries in 2009
    we also seek to strengthen our tenants commitments in terms of cr through direct engagement with our tenants on safety
    and health and environmental matters at meetings training sessions and other awarenessraising events

    key achievements in 2008
     we achieved high levels of tenant satisfaction49 98 of shopping centres achieved the minimum acceptable level of 35 or
      above and 85 achieved level 4 or above our global tenant satisfaction rating also increased by 5 from 40 in 2007 to
      42 in 2008
     we launched and completed a targeted top tenant management level survey in portugal spain and brazil and developed
      an action plan to improve areas of weakness identified
     we developed new shopping centre regulations in all countries of operation in order to incorporate cr issues and
      implemented these at as many centres as possible thus brining benefit to our tenants
     we incorporated cr clauses into the contracts with our main shopping centre service suppliers cleaning services
      maintenance security and waste removal benefiting our tenants by enhancing service quality
     we further improved the safety of our shopping centres including tenant units by carrying out 11659 hours of spos across
      the owned portfolio and reducing the number of nonconformances per hour of spo to 79 for further details see page 98
      this year we introduced a new dimension to this procedure by encouraging tenants to carry out spos themselves alongside
      the sierra teams
     we continued to raise awareness about environmental and safety issues in general assembly meetings with shopkeepers
      and by providing training to some of our tenants staff in 2008 98 of our shopping centres held at least 6 meetings with
      tenants on cr issues 7 centres in fact held over 20 meetings we also engaged with tenants in our shopping centres on
      themes such as marketing with the aim of helping tenants to improve customer attention and sales



         engaging with tenants example actions in brazil

         tivoli shopping gave a training session and seminar to 93 employees of shop units to help tenants to improve their customer attention
         and sales participants were also invited to win gift tokens in a prize draw

         at shopping metrópole we organised a training workshop for tenants on the iso 14001 environmental certification and we held an
         awarenessraising workshop with the theme of serving customers with disabilities andor reduced mobility the aim of this workshop
         was to enable professionals who work directly with the public to understand the needs of specific customers providing a differentiated
         service and ultimately enhancing competitiveness and adding value to their business

         shopping penha launched a best christmas shop window competition to encourage tenants to attract customers and increase sales
         by making their shops look more appealing the winning shop unit was awarded a 150cc moped and 753 gift voucher

         the average tenant satisfaction level is defined as the average rating given for the two components how you classify your degree of satisfaction level with sierra and
         how do you rate your relation with the management team the ratings are allocated on a scale of 1 not satisfied to 6 very satisfied the tenant satisfaction surveys
         are undertaken in all shopping centres which were fully operational for at least 6 months prior to the survey being made

    case study
    challenging tenants to reduce waste production in parque d pedro
    shopping brazil
    the secretariat of the environment of são paulo state which consumes an overwhelming
    66 million plastic bags a month called for a collective effort for environmentally friendly
    behaviour under the slogan say no to plastic bags and various awarenessraising
    measures this led sonae sierra brazil to challenge the tenants of parque d pedro shopping
    to consider ways in which they could reduce their waste production replace throwaway
    plastic bags with reusable ecological ones and seek to raise shoppers awareness of
    environmental issues
    some of our tenants responded positively to the challenge one shop unit analysed the
    possibility of substituting plastic bags with ecological ones but found this was not feasible
    and so instead reduced the thickness of its plastic bags which not only reduced the amount
    of waste it also achieved cost savings on the type of bags purchased damyller a clothing
    and accessories company changed their gift wrapping enabling them to reduce
    environmental impact in their supply chain in their own words
    we thought this was a great idea from parque d pedro shopping at damyller we decided
    to launch a christmas promotion focusing on environmentallyfriendly gift wrapping we
    worked with our supplier on a pioneering project to procure recycled gift wrap and
    packaging which can be recycled again after its use weve calculated that the use of this
    recycled gift wrap enables the equivalent of 38 tonnes of new paper saved per year
    contributing to the preservation of natural resources and reduction of environmental
    impacts associated with its life cycle weve estimated that this initiative enables an energy
    saving equivalent to the monthly consumption of 76 families a water saving equivalent to
    that consumed by over 200 people per month the conservation of 650 trees 17 tonnes less
    packaging being thrown away

    ensuring continuous improvement
    tenant surveys and action plans
    we carry out an annual tenant survey at all our shopping centres in order to evaluate tenant satisfaction and gain feedback in
    relation to aspects including operational factors such as temperature signage etc satisfaction with the shopping centre
    management team satisfaction with sierra marketing events communications and our corporate responsibility programme
    this survey is made available in the tenants portal sierracentresnet for all tenants present in sierra shopping centres which
    have been in operation for at least 6 months50 there is a minimum response rate for the survey and the management team
    have the responsibility of encouraging tenants to participate in order to achieve this once completed the results of the
    surveys are analysed at both shopping centre and country level global reports per country are produced and corresponding
    action plans are developed per shopping centre to ensure that improvements are made in areas which do not receive good
    feedback these action plans are then monitored to ensure that corrective measures are implemented for example if the
    cleanliness of the centre has received a low or medium rating then a follow up action will be implemented by the shopping centre
    management team to monitor the cleaning contractors performance and insist on corrective actions where necessary the

    top tenant management level surveys
    although valuable at an operational level our annual tenant surveys which tend to be completed by shop managers do not
    help us understand how the senior management of our anchor tenants view our performance for this reason in 2008 we
    launched our first tenant engagement survey aimed at this group of stakeholders over the course of this year we surveyed
    tenants in portugal spain and brazil and we plan to survey at least 5 tenants in germany italy and greece in 2009 this
    survey enables us to gain comprehensive feedback on our management services and cr practices including suggestions for
    further improvements and opportunities for collaboration the findings from the 2008 survey suggested that there were some
    important issues for sierra to consider in terms of tenant satisfaction and engagement in particular effective communication
    was highlighted as an area for improvement with respect to cr issues however the results of the top tenant management
    level survey showed that sierra was viewed as being more proactive on environmental and community issues in comparison
    with our competition as a consequence we have defined 3 priority areas for intervention as well as actions to be
    implemented in the short to mediumterm in order to improve sierras relationship with key tenants with a focus on
    communication these are
     tenant meetings firstly we will seek to share the findings of the study and to deliver a document with information about
      sonae sierras organization and key contacts for each relevant business area secondly we will hold annual or biannual
      meetings to share relevant information with our tenants
     communication with tenants we will create a newsletter to improve communication with tenants and will also make
      enhancements to our online portal sierracentresnet
     mall management we will ensure that relevant information about operational issues is delivered to the headquarters
      operations managers


    effort ratio analysis
    the effort ratio refers to the ratio of rents plus common charges paid by the tenant to the sales they achieve we regularly
    monitor the effort ratio of our tenants and we compare the performance of different tenants with similar operations or units
    in other shopping centres if we detect that a tenant has a very high effort ratio we arrange a facetoface meeting with the
    store management to seek to understand the reasons for this and if possible help the tenant to find a solution this
    monitoring procedure basically constitutes a proactive letting approach
    details about the monitoring procedures which relate to tenant safety and health are provided in the safety and health
    section pages 93 and 94

    targets
    our targets for 2009 focus on continuing to improve levels of tenant satisfaction in our owned shopping centres although
    we have targeted the same tenant satisfaction thresholds as last year this by no means makes these softer targets we
    believe that maintaining the same levels of tenant satisfaction achieved in 2008 will indeed be a challenging task due to the
    prevailing economic climate in 2009 the economic downturn is likely to have a negative impact on tenant sales which may
    translate into decreasing satisfaction on the part of our tenants in general we have observed that tenant satisfaction is not
    only influenced by the services provided by our shopping centre management teams but also by shop units own

                                               due to the improvements made in the shopping as a consequence of the refurbishment
                                               works more generally the increases across most shopping centres can be linked to our

                                               this was due to the implementation of internal procedures which were new to the

      longterm objectives

      achieve full implementation of community advisory panels caps in all operational and development portfolio by 2012
      become recognised as a top tier company in employee involvement with local communities by 2011
      devise and implement a long term strategy aimed at involving the largest number of our shopping centres local communities members
      in order to improve our communities wellbeing




    sierra is determined to provide attractive public space that meets the needs of the local population and adds value to the local
    area by generating local economic benefits but also through environmental stewardship and social responsibility in order to
    achieve this we integrate community consultation and engagement into the development and operation of each centre and
    seek to build ongoing relationships with local communities that will facilitate environmental social and economic
    improvements in the areas in which we operate we believe that this also helps to provide a firm foundation for the successful
    performance of our centres we consider community consultation engagement including staff volunteering investment
    including donations and sponsorships visitor satisfaction and environmental social and economic impacts on the local
    community to be important issues within this cr impact area

    structured questionnaires the results of these surveys are used to inform the centres marketing strategy to ensure that it is
    tailored to the catchment area these surveys are currently undertaken annually at all our centres in portugal spain italy

    mall tracking visitor surveys
    we also undertake annual or biannual mall tracking surveys at our operational shopping centres to help us understand our
    visitor profile behaviour and requirements these surveys include satisfaction and loyalty tracking measuring past present
    and future visitor behaviour concepts and the level to which the shopping centre fulfils the visitors expectations the
    shopping centre manager prepares an action plan on the basis of these survey results with attention to critical factors that
    affect the centre in terms of satisfaction loyalty and competition level of response with respect to each factor and shortterm
    actions necessary to correct any negative results
    in 2008 the surveys undertaken in portugal spain italy germany and greece asked visitors specific questions about possible
    environmental and social impacts caused by our centres visitors rated energy efficiency and waste management as being the
    most important issues for sierra shopping centres to focus on in order to improve environmental performance however
    when asked which environmental issues they considered to be most important overall climate change and water saving were
    the most commonly cited employment was generally viewed as the most positive impact that sierra centres have on the
    surrounding community other factors such as generation of traffic noise waste and consumption of water received a mixed
    response with some visitors regarding the centres impact as positive and others considering it to be negative


    visitor suggestions  complaints procedures
    visitor can also submit their suggestions and complaints using three different channels 1 the information desk 2 shopping
    centre management website and 3 shopping centre websites httpwwwsierracentrescom these are then passed on to
    the relevant centre manager who will ensure that appropriate actions is taken there is also an internal coordinator for
    customer care within sierras marketing department who interacts with the shopping centres to enhance the relationship
    with our visitors in addition to these procedures visitors may also present complaints to the sierra ombudsman described on

          concern about the community is initially acted upon in the development stage when we carry out market studies that identify
          consumers needs in retail services and leisure activities in order to conceive a shopping centre which is adequate to both market
          needs and the existing retail offer sonae sierra seeks to deliver by creating emotionally meaningful operations which are
          coherent and sustainable and have a longterm market perspective we also seek to develop in compelling locations creating
          shopping centres with a leisure  entertainment component including broad and innovative tenant offer

          sonae sierra seeks to create convenient and efficient layouts that translate into a streamlined visitor experience engaging the
          customer into an experience that fits with the local setting by generating strong meaningful links with community values in
          terms of environment although the construction of a shopping centre presents a potential short term negative impact on the
          environment sierra undertakes specific measures to mitigate environmental impacts and improve environmental performance for
          further details see page 23 in the environmental management section

          new projects can also generate an impact on the surrounding areas and accesses since the majority of the shopping centre
          projects involve considerable improvements to the urban infrastructures that surround the scheme these improvements are
          always part of the base project and in some cases are also part of protocols with local authorities

          during the operation stage the shopping centre has four fundamental management systems environmental see page 23
          access see page 74 concerning the une 17000122001 standard safety  health see page 90 and operational management
          the operational management system guarantees the shopping centre sustainable performance towards visitors and retailers this
          system operates on general analysis of shopping centres performance indicators surveys and technical operational information
          among others

          some examples of the positive impact with local communities are

    key achievements in 2008
     in 2008 we carried out our second climate survey results in all 16 assessment categories increased with the most positive
      results being in the themes of mission and values and corporate responsibility
     we invested 900 per capita in external staff training and development
     we introduced a formal nondiscrimination and diversity policy setting out our commitment to a meritocracy culture and
      our objective to become a best practice reference in this aspect of corporate responsibility
     we fulfilled another cr goal with the introduction of the new flexible working arrangements policy formal procedures are
      now in place which enable all new and existing staff to apply for parttime working hours
     we incorporated midyear appraisals in to our personal assessment process and trained managers on this process and on
      providing feedback to their staff
     we undertook workplace conditions assessments for all staff in romania greece and at the são paulo offices in brazil
      locations where these assessments had not previously been undertaken




    case study
    inov contact programme supporting international
    work experience at sonae sierra
    the inov contact programme is an initiative supported by the eu and managed by
    aicep portugal global its goal is to support the training of qualified staff in an
    international context sonae sierra joined the programme in 2000 as part of its cr
    policy since then we have welcomed 23 trainees nine of whom had the opportunity
    to join the company once their placement ended the placements last for nine
    months the initial training is held in portugal followed by a placement in one of the
    countries where sierra operates and in different organisational departments such as
    corporate relations environment communication shopping centres backoffice
    marketing and other departments this initiative has been a success with very positive
    feedback received both from the participating departments and from trainees in the
    words of some of the schemes participants
    i was assigned to romania at the beginning of june my main role was to monitor
    the implementation of the environmental management system at river plaza mall and the bucharest
    offices it was an excellent professional opportunity to learn many things sonae sierra provides a
    positive work environment and gives us the opportunity to be involved in a large project in which we
    feel that our work makes a difference
    joana silva trainee at the institutional relations
    environment and communication department romania
    my main tasks were linked to the logistical preparation of the offices because i arrived in the
    country while the company was still in its early development stage i followed the entire process of
    preparation and moving to the new offices in bucharest  i learned that working means more than
    just carrying out strictly defined tasks it means being available and open to take on work and help to
    do what has to be done my eight months in romania taught me patience and perseverance if not
    the first time if not the second time the trick is not to give up but to create other ways and paths to
    achieve what you aspire to

    ensuring continuous improvement
    corporate climate and employee satisfaction survey
    our climate survey invites our staff to give feedback on a range of topics such as corporate responsibility training
    opportunities working conditions diversity company management worklife balance and remuneration
    we launched our first climate survey in 2007 and developed an action plan to follow up on the key findings identified by
    way of example in response to employees request for more feedback on their performance one measure implemented in
    2008 was the launch of a midyear performance appraisal to enable employees to review performance during the first half of
    the year with their direct supervisor and determine areas for improvement for the second half of the year
    in 2008 we carried out our second climate survey the number of employees who participated in this survey increased from 778 in
    2007 to 1126 in 2008 the survey response rate also increased from 75 in 2007 to 78 this year results in all 16 assessment
    categories increased with the most positive results being in the themes of mission and values and corporate responsibility
    aspects of performance management were identified as improvement areas in 2007 and as a result we launched a number of
    new initiatives to address this in 2008 including revisions to our performance management procedures and provision of
    relevant training for those who manage staff 564 man hours of training were provided on this subject in 2008 involving 141
    participants these actions have had a positive affect on the survey results for performance management which improved
    overall by 6 and in the case of the specific question related to receiving feedback by 15 in 2008
    worklife balance was also identified as an improvement area in 2007 in 2008 we introduced a parttime work policy which
    enables all new and existing staff to apply for parttime working hours in the 2008 climate survey the rating for worklife
    balance improved by 36 however we aim to make further improvements in this area going forwards

         in addition to the training listed above we also implement measures on a casebycase basis to improve the sh standards at our shopping
         centres for example in 2008 we created a sh training room at arrábidashopping in portugal in an effort to increase the sh knowledge
         and capability of our teams the training room includes emergency equipment such as fire extinguishers protective clothing and fire
         combat nets this room is also a venue for ongoing learning events covering topics such as life support and emergency procedures




    key achievements in 2008
     performance with respect to our proactive indicators significantly improved for example the number of nonconformities
      per hour of safety preventive observation spo decreased to 79 at the end of the year
     we also performed well against our reactive indicators for example we achieved a 43 reduction in terms of number of
      staff days lost per million worked hours and a 50 reduction in number of accidents and occupational diseases per million
      hours worked both in comparison with the last 3 years average
     we became the first company in europe to achieve certification of our corporate safety and health management system
      covering the areas of development investment and property management across all our company in accordance with the
      ohsas 18001 standard62 this certification issued by tüv rheinland acknowledges the quality of our management system
      and the good practices that we have implemented
     we also achieved additional ohsas 18001 certification for the local sh management systems of 3 shopping centres in
      operation centro colombo in portugal and parque d pedro shopping and shopping penha in brazil
    unfortunately we did not achieve our target for zero fatalities due to accidents across the sierra portfolio a fatal accident
    occurred on the site of manauara shopping development project in brazil we have commented on this tragic incident on
    page 62 of this report

         ohsas 18001 is a standard that validates a management system just like iso 9000 and iso 14000 oriented towards safety  health at the workplace functioning as a
         tool that allows companies to manage and control their performance levels in those areas according to the goals policies and action plans set by the company itself

      personæ project successfully completed

      in 2008 we formally concluded our very successful personæ project which we launched in 2004 with the outcome that safety and
      health is now a core sonae sierra value the aim of personæ was to disseminate an interdependent safety culture in all aspects of
      business and society in each country where sierra operates we estimate that over 70000 people were involved in the projects activities
      such as seminars workshops and behavioural safety preventive observations since the project began we are delighted that our sh
      performance record has substantially improved in a number of areas

       our shopping centres are now safer we have decreased the number of nonconformances detected per hour of spo from 21 in 2005
        to 79 in 2008

       although we have not yet achieved zero accidents we are much closer to achieving this target and have seen a decrease in the sierra
        staff work accident rate see key achievements in 2008

       we have increased awareness of sh issues through rigorous training spos for shopping centres spi audits for construction sites
        and a range of other awareness raising techniques

      thanks to the success of this initiative we are now recognised as a leader in this area and have received a number of international
      awards including the eco prize from the american chamber of commerce in 2006 and the dupont safety award for visible
      management commitment in 2007 we were also invited to share the experiences of our personæ project at the xviii world congress
      on safety and health  for more details see page 14

      although the project has now formally concluded this is by no means the end of our efforts personæ has enabled sierra to develop
      and implement a corporate sh policy and sh management system that guarantees continuous improvement of safety performance
      and will uphold the high standards which we have become recognised for




    personæ awards
    in 2007 we presented a number of tenants and staff with personæ awards in recognition of their efforts towards improving
    sh at their centres to encourage smaller tenants to apply this year we also introduced a new separate category for smaller
    tenants those with shops under 1000m2 or with less than 5 shops in their portfolio winners of the 2008 personæ awards

    case study
    sh management at loop5 prevention is the key to achieving excellence
    loop5 is a new shopping centre under construction in germany scheduled to be inaugurated in
    autumn 2009 works at loop5 have been carried out with reference to some of the best sh
    standards and practices within the construction industry
    in 2008 the site recorded only two minor accidents resulting in only one lost workday out of over
    half a million man hours worked outperforming similar projects several factors contributed to this
    achievement
    incident investigation all incidents including near misses were investigated investigations were
    led by members of the project management team who are also responsible for improving processes
    and standards and ensuring that similar incidents do not reoccur in the future
    safe practice index this tool was used by members of the project management team and
    specialised auditors to assess the extent to which contractors were committed to and aware of
    safety issues the targets set for the number of auditing hours performed per month were achieved
    leading by example our team maintained a positive and proactive attitude at all times which
    raised the expectations of our site workers especially those employed under recent contracts which
    include demanding clauses relating to sh issues
    the approach and initiatives undertaken by the team at loop5 led to a number of changes to the
    sh requirements at our constructions sites we hope these improvements will lead to similar
    achievements at other sites and on future projects




    ensuring continuous improvement
    our safety and health management system includes standard procedures used for identifying investigating and managing
    sh nonconformities at our developments centres and offices we also ensure that necessary correctivepreventive actions
    are implemented and the effectiveness of these measures is evaluated we utilise the following techniques to ensure that our
    operations comply with our high sh standards


     sh management system audits
      in order to comply with ohsas 18001 standards a number of both internal and external audits are carried out in october
      2008 our corporate sh management system was certified in accordance with this standard


     safety preventive observations spos at centres in operation
      these involve auditing safe behaviour within shopping centres under operation we monitor the results of these audits to
      understand trends over time and to evaluate our performance in respect of our goals furthermore we record the number
      of hours dedicated to spos across the organisation


     safe practice index spi at development sites
      the spi is another auditing tool in this case applied to projects under development the index assesses the probability of
      accidents occurring on site construction works through observations made by the sierra development site manager the
      outsourced project management team and site safety coordinator the duration of the audit and the number of persons
      observed are also taken into account


     equipment inspections
      equipment located and operating in shop units and common areas must be inspected on a regular basis not only is safety
      related equipment inspected but also installations for example exhaust ducts in restaurants to determine their safe
      characteristics any issues identified by these inspections are followedup and corrective action is taken

     monitoring and measuring our performance
      we have a number of procedures in place which enable us to monitor and track our performance for example we establish
      corporate sh indicators which are divided in two categories reactive indicators based on sh accidents and
      occupational diseases and proactive indicators based on operational criteria defined by sonae sierra or by the applicable
      requirements including legal ones these indicators focus on actions implemented to prevent accidents
      with respect to sh in 2008 we improved our sh portal to allow staff to transfer meeting minutes and presentations
      internally and to compare site performance with other centres at a corporate level this application enables us to efficiently
      access sh minute meetings and to monitor performance across all our sites


     regular sh meetings
      in 2008 sierra received and responded to a number of suggestions from stakeholders raised through open word sessions
      which are a mandatory part of each regular sh meeting suggestions raised in 2008 included
       a suggestion from a service supplier at shopping penha in brazil to install a safety interlock system next to the waste area
        was used and a new system has now been installed
       a member of our staff at shopping penha asked us to inspect all ladders and remove any faulty ones following a safety
        alert that was issued by the sh office concerning an accident involving a ladder faulty ladders were disposed of and
        new ones were purchased furthermore these ladders were made available for use by service suppliers and tenants and
        any ladders which are brought in by contractors are now safety checked
       a sierra staff member at centro colombo in portugal asked us to implement a monitoring procedure to prevent
        concentrations of gas which could result in explosion as a result of this suggestion the centro colombo management
        team has instructed the maintenance team to monitor gas leaks and malfunctioning ovens inside restaurants


     surveys
      the sh office undertakes its own surveys and includes questions in broader surveys to different stakeholders including
      tenants visitors service suppliers and staff in all surveys we aim to assess the perception of the importance of different
      aspects of sh management and the evolution of those perceptions over time
      in 2008 we also included specific sh questions in the climate survey made to all sierra staff and we commissioned an
      independent survey on sh communication to all staff and a sample of resident service suppliers in shopping centres
      the effectiveness of topbottom and bottomup sh communication including onetoone management
      communication was assessed and the conclusions resulted in an action plan addressed at our sh senior leadership
      workshop in december


     workplace conditions assessments
      these are assessments undertaken by a professional ergonomic assessor to ensure that each member of staff has a
      comfortable workstation that could not in any way be damaging to their health considering potential problems with
      posture eyesight stress etc


     incident investigation reporting and communication procedures
      we investigate the cause of all incidents and communicate lesson that can be learned internally to avoid a repeat
      occurrence we also produce safety alerts which are messages that are sent to all sierra shopping centres describing
      preventive actions which should be taken to avoid certain accidents
      in 2008 we developed a sh document library which is now incorporated into our sh portal this library contains upto
      date sh documents and is accessible via the internet to all our centres enabling them to view and download the latest
      reports news and information
