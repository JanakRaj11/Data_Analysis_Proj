introduction                                                                                                           our progress
we are now half way through the 20152016 financial year                                                              the following table sets out our progress made against the commitments stated in our
and its proving to be a busy one                                                        julie hirigoyen              201314 sustainability update
so this somewhat belated sustainability report covers our                           ceo ukgbc
performance against internal sustainability targets set for
201415 and sets out our targets going forward you will
see that rather encouragingly we made good progress last
                                                                                                                        commitment                              outcome    details
year against several of our internal sustainability targets but
we did also find a few of these hardgoing and weve attempted to explore why in this report                           internal environment

at the end of the day its really quite tricky for us to make a material difference to our environmental footprint     we will conduct a staff survey to       achieved   we undertook a staff survey in early 2015 in order to
here in the building centre we have picked off some of the lowhanging fruit in previous years by installing           seek views and suggestions for                     gauge staff satisfaction with the office environment
electricity metering and monitoring systems tracking our air and rail related travel and purchasing decent            improvements to our working                        feedback was that the office could be improved and it is
carbon offsets to mitigate our carbon footprint we also procure most of our supplies from environmentally              environment                                       with this in mind that we are currently considering options
certified or preferable sources although there is perhaps further for us to go on fair trade and ethical sourcing                                                        for a redesign of the space see below the staff survey
                                                                                                                                                                           will be repeated following any refurbishment work in
however hard it may be i am personally convinced of the need for us to challenge ourselves even further on                                                                order to track staff satisfaction with the outcomes
our own sustainability impacts so this report contains even more stretching targets for ukgbc to achieve in
the year ahead crucially in a year that sees us campaigning for a strong deal to come out of the conference
                                                                                                                        we will obtain and if necessary        achieved   technical issues initially held back this process but we

                                                                                                                        and cooling system                                underpinning future energy efficiency targets in this area
are outside our own direct managerial control and partly because were already operating from a breeam
excellent building but were putting our back into this one and keen to make our own tangible contribution
to combatting climate change                                                                                           we will lobby our landlord to           ongoing    our landlord at the building centre is currently part of a

targets for 201516 and beyond
the arrival of a new ceo along with wholesale changes to the membership of the ukgbc green team has
slightly delayed the introduction of our sustainability targets this year accordingly we have decided to focus
on a smaller number of targets for this year including two that are part of a longerterm strategy these will sit
alongside ongoing followup against a number of the objectives set out above we hope this will help us make
more significant and meaningful progress as well as putting us on the path to making our contribution to
combatting climate change

the  new objectives
 electricity          for
             efficiency   201516
                         we        are as our
                             will improve  follows
                                               office electricity efficiency excluding heating and cooling by
 40 on a 201314 baseline by 2020

renewable energy  we will continue to work with our landlord to ensure that 100 of our electricity in
cluding that used for heating and cooling is sourced from renewable sources by 2020 and sooner if possible
in the period up to this transition we will continue to ensure that all of our emissions from electricity use in
the office are offset using high quality carbon offsets

community and wellbeing  we will sign up as members of the london wildlife trust in order to provide
an easily accessible route for staff to use their available volunteer days locally to contribute to biodiversity in
the local community and to improve employee health and wellbeing

office environment  we will continue to investigate options for refurbishing the office in line with health
and wellbeing principles and to help facilitate our energy efficiency and carbon reduction targets

staff engagement  we will encourage each member of staff to have a personalised sustainability related
objective with progress monitored through the annual staff review process
