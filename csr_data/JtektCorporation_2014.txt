   certification iso50001 evaluates co2 emission reduction results
   obtained from actual activities in addition to the efforts required
   by environmental management system iso14001 towards
   continual improvements
   throughout 2013 an improvement team consisting of plant
   employees conducted energysaving activities achieving a 47
   reduction in gas and electricity usage for air conditioning
   compared with the previous year these results will be shared with
   all employees in the monthly report to improve employee
   awareness we will promote energysaving through actions such
   as production line integration and continually raise our energy use
   efficiency under the guidance of the energy management system

to reduce the usage of water a precious resource jtekt
engages in activities to decrease wasteful usage and recycle
water in fy2013 we engaged in activities to improve the water
usage base unit and water usage by more than 1 compared with
fy2012 resulting in a 95 improvement in the base unit 170
m3100 million yen and a 63 reduction in usage 176000 m3
including the increase in recycling to 786000 m3
we have already achieved our planned target for fy2014 an
improvement 2 higher than fy2012 we will therefore continue
activities toward a target of 05 or higher improvement
