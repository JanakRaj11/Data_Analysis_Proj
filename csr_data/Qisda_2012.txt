                                      the performance of a green product is determined at the early stage of
                                 its design qisda requires its entire rd staff to apply life cycle thinking
                                 at the preliminary stage of product design and development we carefully
                                 analyze the environmental impacts and risks a product may generate

throughout the different stages of its life cycle and hence to improve our
nextgeneration products
      under the assumption that chemical substances that hold potential threats
to the environmental safety may be used in products or in the production
process qisda has formulated a hazardous material management checklist in
accordance with related international regulations and customer requirements
to address this concern qisda also employs a systematic management system
to ensure that its products are complied with international regulations and
customer requests through strict control of components sample approval and
examination of final products qisda has developed a hazardous chemical use
reduction plan to gradually reduce the use of hazardous chemical substances
each year
      since the beginning of 2008 qisdas manufacturing sites in taiwan suzhou
and mexico has met the standards and passed the iecq qc 080000 hazardous
substance process management system certification
      in 2011 qisda obtained the iec 62430 environmentally conscious
design for electrical and electronic products and systems certification in its
major product lines including tftlcds projectors smart phones scanners
multimedia players and lighting devices

2 environmental labels
      first and foremost qisda has carried out the green products concept
in full swing from product research and development to manufacturing phase
it makes environmentallyconscious choices in the efforts to bring these goals
into realization extending a products life cycle saving energy use of recyclable
and low toxic materials reducing the environment impact brought upon by
our products and so on meanwhile to ensure each product complies with
environmental regulations and customerspecific requirements qisda has
reinforced supplier environmental training and management in creating a green
supply chain qisda has successfully assisted its customers in acquiring related
green product labels and environmental certification including
1    china cecp certification                       2   tco certification

                                           since 2009 qisda has been conducting the assessment for ecodesign
                                      of energyrelated products erp directive and environmental product
                                      declaration epd it has been giving a great deal of consideration in evaluating
                                      the environmental impacts of our final products of all the environmental
                                      impact indicators we identified carbon as one of the key indicators ever since
                                      the inception of carbon footprint inventory in 2009 qisda has received pas
                                      2050 certification for products including tftlcd monitors projectors and
                                      ebooks the following figure presents the life cycle data reported to local
                                      environmental protection authorities in 2011 our 24 lcd monitor won the
                                      first carbonfootprint certificate in china
                                           at the same time qisda has been constantly monitoring other
                                      environmental impact indicators beyond carbon in 2011 from the result
                                      obtained in an iso 14025 epd analysis in one projector we discovered a higher
                                      level of carbon consumption as a result qisda will still use carbon as one of
                                      the key indicators in improving the overall quality of its green product design

            development strategy  with environmental safety and health as the core of
            green operation management it puts focus on five major areas in terms of raw
            material usage energy and water management ecological management and
            waste management in the meantime we carefully monitor the operational
            impact on global warning through performing corporatewide greenhouse gas
            inventory every year since the second half of 2011 qisda has launched the
            iso 50001 management system in an effort to identify the opportunities that
            help to reduce ghg emissions and improve its green operation through the
            quantification process
                 in addition to raise the environmental awareness of our employees qisda
            has implemented iso 14001 environmental management systems since 1997 to
            provide relevant training for all staff to ensure that the entire staff considers
            possible impacts on the environment new employees are required to receive

            from its global manufacturing sites as well as the water reuse rate both have
            increased over the years in 2011 environmental protectionrelated investments
            totaled around us151000 or roughly 00065 of the annual revenue
                 regarding the potential environmental impacts brought upon by our
            operations in the local community we have carefully examined the coating
            procedure employed in suzhou china equipped with an activated carbon
            filtration system qisda is able to lessen the potential environmental impacts
            from the waste gas generated in this procedure with low probability and
            seriousness

                                                  overall manufacturing capacity has increased significantly in comparison to 2009
                                                  as a result the types and amount for recyclable waste have also increased
                                                  since the implementation of energy conservation and waste reduction actions
                                                  qisda has maintained its recyclable waste percentage above 8848 which is
                                                  estimated to reach over 90 by 2012 to sum up the accumulated amount of
                                                  recyclable wastes has totaled 37088 tons since 2009 of which 34020 tons
                                                  were generated in the manufacturing site of suzhou china

213 water resource management
     qisda starts its water resource management at the very beginning stages
of product design by applying clean production and taking environmental
protection into consideration of all products manufactured in its worldwide
facilities only domestic sewage with zero waste water is generated qisda
global water consumption has totaled 402000 tons in 2011 with 2010 total
water usage to be around 453000 tons sitespecific water consumption
information of 2011 is provided in figure 23
     in order to realize the full benefits of water management  each
manufacturing site started to monitor its tap water usage from 2011 particularly
in the aspect of leak prevention this effort proved successful with the total
water consumption in 2011 dropped 112 as compared to 2010 in addition
qisda does not pump underground water in any of its global operations
     each manufacturing site around the globe is equipped with wastewater
recycling and reuse systems to control its domestic sewage recycled domestic
sewage is reused to irrigate green areas on manufacturing site grounds take
the manufacturing site in taiwan for instance the amount of reused water for
landscape irrigation is 101 tonsday about 52 of its total water consumption
     for domestic sewage control qisda has hired specialized personnel
to operate and maintain installed wastewater treatment system in taiwan
domestic sewage generated in this site all discharges into municipal sewage
system the wastewater generated in the manufacturing site in suzhou china
discharges to the municipal drainage system for treatment which does not
adversely affect the surrounding water source or land qisda also surpasses the
effluent water quality standards established by governments

resulting from work in workrelated injuries most are cuts or lacerations
caused by the use of manual tools these injuries are typically temporary in
nature and do not require time off however a few incidents of workrelated
injuries do result in time off from work workrelated injuries that require
more than oneday time off fall within the calculation scope of disabling

by the end of 2011 suppliers that have completed qisda supplier social
responsibility investigation accounted for 81 of the total purchasing expense
    on the aspect of supplier environmental responsibility qisda has gathered
some of its major suppliers in 2008 to join eup directive training on product
life cycle inventory including directindirect materials resources usage waste
disposal and transportation energy consumption all those efforts were
aimed to help our suppliers understand the calculation of a product life cycle
environmental impacts and possible impacts on other ecological indicators
to continuously increase awareness on environmental impacts and carbon
emission management qisda has also provided several vendors with guidance
and training on product carbon footprint inventory in the period 20092011

322 conflict minerals policy and supply chain
      conflict minerals survey
    in 2010 qisda for the first time required specific material tantalum and
tim suppliers to sign a conflictfree mineral supply agreement or provide a
declaration statement as alternative to prohibit the purchase of conflict metals
from eastern drc or central africa all related purchasing policies have been
posted on the section corporate social responsibility in qisda official website
httpwwwqisdacomtw to ensure that the metal purchasing policies are in
accordance with our corporate social and environmental responsibility
    in response to the requirement of our customers all suppliers were
asked to respond to conflict minerals reporting template developed by the
electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc and the global esustainability
initiative gesi in 2011 the response rate was 76

     33 green supply chain
         to build up qisdas green supply chain is a vital and enduring task in our
     sustainability development qisda remains vigilant regarding environmental
     protection issues and the revision or updates of regulations
         in 2006 qisda hosted suppliertraining events to share the rohs
     regulations in 2008 it offered consecutive supplier training sessions for
     the upcoming erp directives in 2009 and 2010 qisda held several supplier
     workshops to advise suppliers on carrying out life cycle inventory for carbon
     footprint in response to the international trend of using conflictfree minerals
     in 2011 qisda conducted its supply chain ghg survey and required all
     component suppliers of all business units to respond to conflict minerals
     reporting template developed by eicc and gesi in addition to the required
     supplier agreement of prohibition on metals from the conflict areas
         future management methods include targeting tierone suppliers to receive
     training and to provide data for qisdas verification besides strengthening
     suppliers environmental awareness and corporate social responsibility qisda
     continues to offer promotions and guidance to our suppliers in the hope to
     jointly stay ahead of the demands in environmental protection tasks in the
     manufacturing industry through the support from our firsttier suppliers as
     well as the management and monitoring in further upstream suppliers namely
     the second and thirdtier suppliers qisda is capable of creating a strong green
     supply chain
         qisdas major implementations in building a green supply chain are as follows
     i local procurement
         qisda manages nearly 900 direct material suppliers in 2011 due to different
     product strategies and key component specifications varied in business units
     qisda is committed to implementing local procurement most suppliers
     have factories within close proximity to qisda production sites including
     suzhou china taiwan and mexico although our customers may make partial
     arrangements with appointed procurement qisda has managed to negotiate
     with them to increase local purchase of consigned materials in order to save
     transportation energy time and to reduce environmental pollution based
     on the 2011 procurement data qisda purchased 871 of its materials from
     china 125 from taiwan and other locations in asia while nearly 04 of its
     materials were purchased from america
     ii increasing material commonality decreasing material scrap rate
         in order to reduce unnecessary scrap materials the procurement
     department actively works with the rd department as well as the related
     product department in the beginning of product development to select materials
     and parts that share high commonality the production and manufacturing
     department then sets targets for the material scrap rate according to product
     types so as to cut down the cost of purchasing and replacing different product
     materials and components

iii energy conservation in logistics
     in logistics many practical and efficient ways can be implemented to
reduce the environmental impacts for instance qisda created minimum
order agreements with many suppliers to achieve maximum loads during
transportation since 2008 qisda has kept up expediting the inhouse
production of mechanical components in suzhou china as its efforts to
reduce considerable fuel consumption and pollution generated during the
transportation of bulky packages packaging materials such as cushions and
cartons are recycled according to a minimum recycling rate defined together
with local suppliers who are also required to cooperate fully in recycling
packaging materials for the time being qisda has obtained great results over
the years




                                                                                 55

                                    social responsibility
                      guided by the environmental safety and health policies defined in its corporate
                      sustainability development qisda is committed to giving back to the society
                      promoting labor rights and improving the quality of our living environment
 policycommitment



                      qisda continues to perform sa 8000 evaluation every year to verify that
                      the labor condition in qisda is compliant with international requirements in
                      addition csd has defined key performance indicators in the aspect of social
                      responsibility regular assessments have been conducted to track the progress
