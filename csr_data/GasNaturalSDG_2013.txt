                            between the business activity and the sustainability
                            achievements with this report we aim to transmit a
                            broader vision of our business project and the efforts
                            we are making to shape a global and sustainable energy
                            business model

                            the balance between the gas and electricity businesses
                            has turned us into a really integrated company this
                            allows us to enjoy a beneficial position in the markets
                            where we have a presence and represents an
                            opportunity in those markets we hope to lead in the

sustainable mobility

the estimations for growth of the
urban population worldwide revealed
two huge challenges firstly the
greater demand for infrastructures and
secondly the need for new models of

this trend raised interest in demo
projects aimed at achieving progress
in the use of renewable and non
polluting energy sources in order to
encourage sustainable and competitive
mobility for example the european
commission in its green paper

               streamlining consumption of
               energy and material resources

               the major consumption of
               gas natural fenosa refers to fuels
               and to a lesser extent chemical
               products

               coal consumption increased
               significantly in 2012 as a consequence
               of regulatory obligations to which the
               company was bound more specifically
               it increased 75 yearonyear this
               situation led to a movement in the
               thermal gap causing a 3 reduction
               in consumption of natural gas

               we should also point out that in
               2012 there was a slight reduction in
               consumption of oil derivatives as a             direct energy consumption tj

active participation in biodiversity
corridors for the brown bear

gas natural fenosas commitment to protecting and encouraging
biodiversity is mirrored in initiatives such as the creation of
corridors for the iberian brown bear classified as a species in
danger of extinction

the aim of this project set up by the brown bear foundation
fop is to encourage the movement of bears between the
two subpopulations that exist in spain both in the cantabrian
mountain range to increase biodiversity in the interpopulation
corridor

the objectives mentioned above will be achieved by planting local
species of trophic interest currently underrepresented in the area
reforestation will be carried out on treeless public and private
properties the idea is to create woodlands that can be used
as communication passages allowing the movement of bears
from one subpopulation to another this will assist the genetic
exchange between population in a parallel fashion another
important objective of the project is achieved namely co2 fixation
by the new trees

for many years now gas natural fenosa has been collaborating
in the sponsorship and development of a range of actions to
educate and raise awareness these actions include the release
of material for schoolchildren between the ages of four and eight
in asturias or publishing a hunting manual in areas where there
are brown bears targeted at local hunters in the cantabrian and
interpopulation corridor which will notably help preservation of
the species
