       and governance report 2016

a environmental
  1   emissions aspect a1

       the groups supporting service operation which mainly involved the provision of supporting services to
       sweetener business does not result in significant air and greenhouse gas emissions discharges into water and
       land or generation of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes

       the groups planting and manufacturing operation which is the largest sugar cane grower and sugar
       manufacturer in jamaica has commitment to improve environmental management processes is underpinned by
       continuous improvement in the management of direct environmental impacts across its value chain

       the policies about emission including

             to continuously improve their sustainabilitylinked environmental practices to conserve raw materials
              reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy intensity entrench climate change mitigation and
              adaptation strategies promote responsible manufacturing and undertake sustainable agriculture
              practices

             to introduce environmentallyfriendly initiatives such as reducing unnecessary packaging materials or
              using packaging materials that can be recycled thereby reducing our solid waste produced at scene
              maximise the reuse of the byproducts of our manufacturing processes optimise our water footprint per
              ton of cane produced and implement our water risk management and monitoring strategy

             to create wider environmental stakeholder awareness and improve responsiveness to key environmental
              related performance indicators including threats brought about by climate change

             to undertake rigorous review not only to address legal liability but also to ensure the implementation of
              a precautionary approach in relation to the management of environmental impact

             to leverage improved environmental performance in our supply chain managing environmental impacts
              and focus on weatherrelated supply chain disruptions

       the group has also established the environmental protection policies that include both emission reduction and
       energysaving policies in order to minimize the impacts on the environment

  2   use of resources aspect a2

       the group believes that in the long run due performance of environmental responsibility would definitely
       improve the effectiveness of the utilisation of the groups resources and would raise the economic efficiency of
       the group




                                                                                                 environmental social
                                                                                          and governance report 2016
                                                                                                                         3

            the groups supporting service operation as well as planting and manufacturing operation have established
            the environmental protection energy saving and emission reducing policies and strived to integrate the
            environmental considerations into the daily operation with the policies implemented in practice different
            department was coordinated to ensure the policy direction and effectiveness on environment protection
            the taskforce was also responsible for the planning of the energy saving and emission reducing solutions and
            supervising their implementations the taskforce applied the energy saving objectives into the workshops

            supporting service operation as well as planting and manufacturing operation continue to identify the potential
            and the approaches for energy saving and reducing the amount of energy consumption in order to meet the
            energy saving and emission reducing indicators as requested by the local governments supporting service
            operation and planting and manufacturing operation has already formulated a series of energy management
            systems to raise the efficiency of energy usage

            for the supporting service operation the main use of resource is the electricity consumption accounts for the
            majority of indirect greenhouse gas emissions and its scale is insignificant given the size of the groups operation
            to achieve energy efficiency the group adjusts the central airconditioning system of the office on a seasonal
            and timely basis each year to ensure the indoor temperature is moderate and to reduce electricity consumption
            energyefficient fluorescent tubes or electricitysaving fluorescent tubes are fully installed in order to save
            energy and reduce resources consumption the use of energyefficient fluorescent tubes or electricitysaving
            fluorescent tubes can reduce daily electricity consumption to reduce electricity consumption our employees
            turn on the lights and airconditioning system depending upon usage in the office

            for the planting and manufacturing operation water energy and other materials represent three inputs used by
            all of our operations the policies for water energy and other materials are as follows

            water which is a vital raw material for the operation is sourced directly from rain sustainable secure and legally
            compliant water resources such as underground water and indirectly from municipal service providers water
            consumption volumes are measured using a variety of sitespecific methods to ensure ongoing compliance
            with water use licenses and is reported internally on a weekly basis water discharge volumes and methods are
            monitored to ensure compliance with relevant national statutes eg discharge qualities and quantities as part
            of our overall water management strategy water management models have been customised to improve water
            efficiency opportunities in an effort to reduce water consumption and maximise the recycling of water in our
            secondary processes

            the energy and other material inputs used in the groups production processes are relevant to the extent that
            they impact on the conservation of the global resource base and are the focus of our efforts to reduce resource
            intensity and the management of our total operational costs where practical we use input materials that
            promote environmental responsibility factory byproducts in the form of filter cake and boiler ash are applied
            to cane fields as natural fertilisers the use of our byproducts as nutrient supplements decreases the groups
            reliance on organic fertilisers thereby resulting in decreased costs resource intensity and greenhouse gas the
            ghg emissions while herbicides pesticides and fungicides are applied under control for not exceeding limit
            per hectare of cane grown

            in the sugar production process steam is generated using bagasse which is the renewable fibrous residue
            that remains after the extraction of juice from the crushed stalks of sugar cane this steam is used to provide
            the process heating requirements of the sugar production process and then to generate renewable electricity
            through cogeneration the electricity is primarily used within the sugar manufacturing process to power
            milling refining and packaging processes with excess exported to provide national electricity grids in future



4   environmental social
    and governance report 2016

     in certain period the energy derived from bagasse is not sufficient to provide all energy requirements of the
     production processes and supplementary fuel of heavy oil is required which is nonrenewable

3   the environment and natural resources aspect a3

     the group supporting service operation as well as planting and manufacturing operation continue to put
     environmental protection policies into practice as the group believes that those energysaving and emission
     reduction policies are not only environmentally friendly but also conducive to costsaving the group also
     believes that those policies would eventually lead the group to achieve sustainable development of the
     environment and the business of the group

     the groups supporting service operation as well as planting and manufacturing operation are mindful of the
     role that we play in relation to the sustainable development of the regions in which we operate and our strong
     interdependence with the local communities and natural environments in those areas our management of
     the environment is guided by the commitment to minimising any negative impacts that we may have on the
     environment or which may contribute to climate change

     during these years the groups supporting service operation as well as planting and manufacturing operation
     continue to invest in environmental improvements with the aim of introducing costeffective measures to
     prevent environmental degradation and improve environmental management systems these include the
     adoption the energysaving and emission reduction measures in relation to the cleaner production such as
     the replacement of the energyexhausting old machineries with the new machineries in order to increase the
     efficiency while saving the energy such measures have increased the efficiencies of both energysaving and
     emission reduction and improved the working environment of the workshops and the investment in improving
     water and wastewater treatment infrastructure

4   environmental compliance

     the groups supporting service operation as well as planting and manufacturing operation manages its
     operations in line with environmental permits issued by government agencies in the countries in which we
     have operations and continuously monitors for any noncompliance of permit parameters during the period
     under review there is one legal dispute caused by rainwater flooded one of sugar warehouse of planting and
     manufacturing operation and is alleged some pollutants discharge into river except this event of force majeure
     there is no significant incidents enforcement notices environmental prosecutions or environmental citations
     were issued to any of the groups operations no fines or penalties were imposed by any government agency

     we encourage and plan interaction and engagements with local authorities to discuss changing environmental
     legal requirements and solicit clarity where these may impact on our operations

     in the event that any environmental concerns or complaints are raised from external agencies and the
     communities in which we operate these are treated with utmost importance all entities keep a complaints
     register and any complaints are directed to management for consideration response and action if necessary
     during the year under review no environmentrelated submissions were received through our formal complaints
     mechanisms




                                                                                              environmental social
