gsc operates ethically honestly and with transparency with our stakeholders we do this
by ensuring we have the right oversight of policies and governance practices to identify
and manage risks and that we communicate these expectations with gscers this sets the
foundation for achieving our mission in a financially socially and environmentally
sustainable way this is just the way we do business and we are guided by these
values every day


code of conduct refresh
with todays workplace evolving rapidly we created a taskforce to review our
code of conduct and provide recommendations on items that needed to be
updated and new topics eg the use of social media that should be added
the proposed revisions were approved by the gsc board of directors and the
new edition of the code was published for all employees in q4 of 2015                      governance
the taskforce made up of representatives from various departments also
developed a training video on the code that is now part of the onboarding
program for new hires and accessible to all gsc employees at any time
