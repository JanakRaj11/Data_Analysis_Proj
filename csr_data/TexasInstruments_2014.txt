were in the business of engineering a better tomorrow it starts with understanding the worlds greatest
challenges then we go to work designing and manufacturing the right gamechanging solutions  in a
responsible way

we are focusing on products and technologies with long life spans that could generate sustainable revenue
and returns these products almost universally tackle the challenge of reducing energy use by enabling
greater degrees of efficiency and conservation our innovations are also allowing customers to introduce
their products to new and emerging markets and to improve product safety and reliability

to support our business direction weve purchased and acquired new facilities and manufacturing tools
over the past few years these additions will help ensure continuity of supply and deliver differentiated
semiconductor solutions with the most advanced process technologies available were working hard to
bring these factories and equipment up to tis high standards as we continue our efforts to operate
responsibly with a lighter footprint on the environment globally

weve also spent time working collaboratively across the industry on supply chain and manufacturing
audit standards through the electronic industry citizenship coalition this solutionsoriented approach is
helping build a responsible supply chain and achieve compliance with new regulations while reducing
risks and associated costs

an easy decision weve made over the past year is to continue our investment in science technology
engineering and math education access to qualified individuals and top research is vital to our business
today and long into the future thats why ti and its philanthropic arms granted 7 million to support k12
education programs and more than 26 million to support university programs in 2013

we know that access to the worlds top talent helps us achieve amazing things we are proud our
