specialist tandus in 2012 which merged with tarketts
centiva lvt activities to become tandus centiva his biggest
challenge has been to manage distribution create brand
awareness and incorporate the tarkett brand into his
marketing campaigns in north america the tarkett brand
is known in the residential sector but tandus centiva is more
widely recognized among professionals                                               im no longer a carpet guy
jack explains that tarketts acquisition of tandus changed                           im the flooring consultant
his world enormously allowing tandus centiva to become a
onestop shop for his clients to fulfil almost all their flooring
needs a school has different requirements for the floors in
its classrooms than for those in the gymnasium the kitchen
and the corridors so jack offers his customers the possibil       and given us a real competitive advantage allowing me to
ity to pick and choose among all the products made by               supply 90 of the flooring in a school instead of perhaps only
tarkett businesses  tandus centiva johnsonite and                 30 if we had only soft flooring to offer jack says his
tarkett sports  without the need to establish a separate           accounts are all public government and public education
contract with each of them we have the right product             facilities in california there are more than 10000 schools
the right fit for whatever they need he explains                 and 80 of them have bought flooring from jack

he has also introduced installment and maintenance con             im no longer a carpet guy im the flooring consultant he
tracts and a 10year labor warranty all these developments        enthuses it is the autonomy and flexibility hes been given
have pushed the tarkett group years ahead of its competitors        to be entrepreneurial that hes enjoyed the most in his job n
