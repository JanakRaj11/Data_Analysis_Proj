                                   market trends remain positive burckhardt compression group profited from ongoing positive
                                   developments in its markets during the fiscal year 2014 despite global economic uncertainties
                                   and geopolitical tension overall order intake was held at the high 2013 level compressor sys
                                   tems cs received fewer orders compared to the previous fiscal year but order intake of the com
                                   ponents services and support css business area was sharply higher the groups operating
                                   profit margin was with 157 basically at the same level as last year despite the decision of the
                                   swiss national bank to abandon the minimum exchange rate of the swiss franc to the euro

                                   fullyear order intake passes the half billion mark again burckhardt compressions fullyear
                                   order intake of chf 5141 mn previous year chf 5171 mn surpassed the chf 500 million mark
                                   for the second time in the companys history csss contribution to overall order inflow was sig
                                   nificant as its order intake surged 212 from chf 1308 mn to chf 1585 mn this growth at css
                                   was primarily driven by orders for spare parts the cs business did not quite reach the level of
                                   orders reported for the prior year which however was very high its order intake declined by 79
                                   to chf 3556 mn chf 3863 mn and this is mainly attributable to customer decisions to postpone
                                   some large projects

                                   renewed sales growth thanks to compressor systems at chf 4736 mn plus 64 plus 68
                                   at constant exchange rates burckhardt compressions sales hit another alltime high beating
                                   the previous record high set in 2013 sales at the css business area dropped to chf 1465 mn a
                                   reduction of 37 from chf 1521 mn in the previous year primarily because no major revamp and
                                   engineering orders had been placed in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 consequently the renewed
                                   increase in group sales can be traced to the cs business area plus 117 to chf 3271 mn gross
                                   profit of chf 1528 mn surpassed the previous years figure by 98 or chf 136 mn and the
                                   resulting gross profit margin edged higher to 323 313 both business areas increased their
                                   gross profit margins compared to prioryear levels

                                   to chf 746 mn this amount includes significant foreign exchange losses of net chf 64 mn
                                   mainly attributable to the negative static currency impact on various items in euro in the balance
                                   sheet this negative impact is a direct consequence of the swiss national banks decision to aban

                                   obligations had to be recognized in the income statement mainly as a result of the decision by

                                   was 69 above prioryear level which corresponds to a net income margin of 122 net income

innovation
research  development switzerland

systematic product development strengthens our competitive position growing demand for solutions that reduce the energy
consumption and emissions of reciprocating compressors operating at partial load led us to develop a mechatronic system that
offers advanced power control and maximum energy savings


reliability
manufacturing switzerland

efficient machining of topquality compressor components is a demanding task and that is why almost all of our component
production lines use modern cnc machining centers these multifunctional machines combine several steps in one operation
thus enabling a reduction of throughput time and an increase in dimensional stability




safety
lng receiving terminal canada

these terminals receive liquid gas at temperatures as low as 160 c 250 f laby compressors are used to reliquefy
the gas vapors because their compressor cylinders are nonlubricated thanks to the design without piston rings and gastight
casing these compressors offer the highest availability maximum operating safety and minimal gas leakage




reliability and endurance
redura compressor components

the redura product line consists of rings and packings for reciprocating compressors these reliable robust sealing
elements were developed and designed inhouse and are patentprotected the heterogeneous combination of different
ring types redura sealing systems ensure an ideal sealing performance and maximum service life

   onetime impact on eurdenominated positions on the groups
   balance sheet that could not be avoided by the existing natu
   ral hedge policy given the unique character of this historic

   through local qualified institutions or group treasury the
   objective being the optimization of the net profit of each

impairment tests for goodwill goodwill is allocated to the
identifiable cashgenerating units of the burckhardt compres
sion group crosshead piston compressors and standard high
pressure compressors the recoverable amount of a cashgen
erating unit is determined by calculating its value in use these
calculations are based on cash flows projection for this pur
pose five planning years are taken into consideration applying
the parameters listed below as well as a terminal value with no
growth at all management estimated the planned gross profit
margin based on past developments and the expectations
regarding future market developments growth rates were
adjusted where necessary historical data were used to make
cautious assumptions the assumptions listed below were used
in the analysis of each cashgenerating unit no impairment
losses were recognized for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 sensitiv
ity analyses were done using parameters such as growth rate
and pretax discount rate
    for the cashgenerating unit crosshead piston compres
sors the sensitivity analysis indicated that an impairment can
be reasonably considered unlikely for the cashgenerating unit
standard high pressure compressors an increase of the pre
tax discount rate from 99 to 113 or a reduction of the
growth rate from 32 to 17 would result in a value in use
that would be equal to the goodwill amount
