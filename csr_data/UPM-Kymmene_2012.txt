                  by defining the most important competence development areas and relevant developmental
                  actions for the organisation this plan is then cascaded to every individual in the form of a

                  working with wwf
                  for future plantations
                  wwfs new generation plantations project ngpp identifies and promotes newgenera
                  tion plantation practices new generation plantations are forest plantations that maintain
                  ecosystem integrity protect the high conservation values and are developed through
                  effective stakeholder participation while contributing to economic growth and employment

                  upm has been one of the key members of the ngpp since it began 2008 the ngpp
                  responds to a growing need for a better understanding of the role that wellmanaged and
                  appropriately located plantations can play in future societies the target is to promote key
                  features of healthy diverse and multifunctional forest landscapes compatible with
                  biodiversity conservation and human needs

                  plantations that do not replace natural habitats but help recover overgrazed and
                  degraded land can help build a greener future economy such plantations could help
                  supply the worlds future demand for timber fibre and bioenergy without further depletion
                  of its natural capital they just have to be done right says rodney taylor wwf interna
                  tionals forest director

                  taylor continues the project gives wwf a much deeper understanding of what is
                  possible and the challenges faced by the participating companies there are certainly lots
                  of examples of newgeneration practices if we put them all together we might have a
                  newgeneration plantation

                  in 2011 upm hosted a conference in london to launch the publication of the ngpp report
                  on how this concept applies to bioenergy and carbon storage the report included two
                  upm case studies on sustainable plantation management in the uk we are happy to
                  provide even more transparency to our operations to all relevant stakeholders by sharing
                  our case studies confirms vice president javier solari who is responsible for upm

                     woods renewability is only one aspect of its excellent environmental credentials as
                     a building material in 2011 upm established a new business unit upm living
                     which manufactures woodbased products for home decoration and building
                     materials both for consumers and industrial customers using advanced technology
                     and indepth material knowledge upm timber continues to produce certified
                     nordic sawn timber

                     anu puustinen finnish architect and a member of the upm living design pool says
                     that woods potential as a material is enormous

                     wood is genuine and in itself it is already an ecological product it is not
                     necessarily just a surface either and the wooden structure of a house can be
                     emphasised for example as a visible element of décor she says

                     the other members on the upm living design pool are architects harri helorinne
                     jarkko kallio and ville hara as well as industrial designer jaana karell

upms continuous target is to
improve energy efficiency

research programme resulted
in energy savings of up to 30

fruitful cooperation between

                       significant energy savings
                       in mechanical pulping
                       in paper production a remarkable share of energy is consumed in the production of
                       mechanical pulp one of the main ingredients in magazine paper

                       the aim of upms strategic research programme concerning energy saving in mechanical
                       pulping carried out during 20092011 was to develop and implement new energy
                       efficient production technologies to reach the target of 30 reduction in electricity
                       consumption a reassessment of the traditional pulp manufacturing principles in coopera
                       tion with mills and research was required

                       savings with process development
                       in 2011 new energy efficient pulp production concepts were implemented at several
                       mills the process improvements were made by updating production lines with new
                       technology and by simplifying processes

                       for example the grinding technology was modernised at the plattling mill in germany
                       and madison in the usa in addition energy efficient solutions were implemented in
                       thermomechanical pulping processes at the kaipola and rauma mills in finland and
                       steyrermühl in austria

                       the research that has been done over the years to find energy efficient solutions was put
                       into practice in the successful cooperation between upms rd and its paper mills

                       the results have in many ways been even better than anticipated with energy savings
                       of 1030 in mill applications several million euro savings at the mills encourage to
                       continue the development at other upm mills says vuokko pietarila programme

upm is investigating the
management and the material

                       upm makes its water use more efficient
                       water is an essential raw material in the pulp and paper production process upm also
                       uses water as a power source and 20 of the companys electricity is produced using
                       emissionfree hydropower

                       in 2011 upm carried out several projects aimed at improving water management
                       the water footprint study performed at the german nordland paper mill in 2010 was
                       extended to include a water use sustainability assessment other water footprint studies
                       are ongoing in upms plywood and wood plastic composite businesses

                       by working with the water footprint network upm has taken a leading role in
                       reviewing sustainable water use in the paper industry upms pilot study shows that when
                       forests are managed sustainably paper products will have little contribution for the
                       growing concerns about water scarcity says executive director ruth mathews from the
                       water footprint network

                       at the end of the year upm started to pilot a water management system at the upm
                       hürth mill in germany in cooperation with the alliance of water stewardship aws

                       upm investigates the scarcity of water resources
                       the scarcity of water resources is one of the environmental concerns of the immediate
                       future upm examined the scarcity of its water resources utilising the water scarcity index
                       tool according to the results upm mills are situated in areas where water is abundant
                       and scarcity is not a problem

                       in 2011 a material efficiency programme was launched at all upm paper mills the
                       objectives of the programme are to decrease the amount of suspended matter in waste
                       water and the use of process water consumption these objectives are being pursued by
                       investments and sharing best practices between mills

                       in the beginning of 2011 upm started a threeyear research programme concerning
                       efficient water use in the future pulp mills trial runs have been carried out at upms fray

                   customers as well as the end users who label their products produce valuable

                   maximising the reuse of raw materials and recycling go hand in hand with upms
                   biofore thinking the byproducts from selfadhesive labelstock production are the
                   principal raw material for upm profi wood plastic composite products the
                   byproducts can also be used as fuel in upms combined heat and power plants
                   siliconised release paper can be recycled into pulp and further back into upm
                   paper products by desiliconising

                   previously these byproducts were incinerated or taken to landfills because
                   recycling products that contain paper plastic film adhesive and silicone has been
                   challenging

                   in 2011 rafcycle enabled recycling byproducts from upm raflatacs customers
                   and end users in addition to the byproducts produced at upm raflatacs own
                   factories in addition to being beneficial for the environment rafcycle benefits
                   upm raflatacs customers and end users financially as well

                   with the help of the rafcycle concept upm strives to find solutions and uses for
                   the byproducts of the labelstock industrys entire value chain the interest towards

plywood is a technical material
that has been refined in various
ways in order to improve its
properties such as durability

the new plywood products and
services developed by upm
support the principles of ecodesign
starting from the design process

plywood is a true biofore product
by nature




                                                                                                 a house made by danish architects from
                                                                                                 upms spruce plywood provides a new
                                                                                                 model for sustainable building




                  plywood research and development
                  enables sustainable end products
                  plywood has many good properties the most important being the excellent weightto
                  strengthtoprice ratio which competing materials have not been able to attain

                  upm has developed a new plywood floor solution for trailer chassis that makes it possible to
                  save energy in transportation

                  the new technology which has been developed in cooperation with upms partners allows
                  the floor to be bonded to the trailer chassis eliminating the need for screws bonding
                  provides increased structural rigidity which makes it possible to design lighter trailer chassis
                  in 2011 dozens of trailers using the wisa bonded floor solution were introduced in europe

                  durable and safe furniture in a more efficient way
                  upm grada plywood the formable plywood based on upms new composite technology
                  can be formed after manufacturing making production of form pressed products more
                  efficient it also enables furniture manufacturers to cut out liquid glues and a number of work
                  phases requiring manual labour

                  the composite is extremely rigid which enables thinner structures to be used that are still very
                  durable another significant benefit is that the adhesive used in upm grada plywood does
                  not contain any formaldehyde

                  the plywood house with a small carbon footprint
                  in 2011 upm plywood supported a pilot project by two danish architects in which they built
                  a house using wisaspruce plywood

                  the modules and components of the print a house concept were designed using computer
                  simulation and manufactured using a cnc machine the result was a family house that was
                  easy to assemble on site the house is ecological healthy to live in and it has a small carbon
                  footprint no concrete was used in the construction

                       upms product range is expanding
                       with new innovative materials
                       the new biocomposite upm formi and fibril cellulose provide excellent examples of new
                       innovative products and materials that have a strong synergy with upms current businesses

                       highquality biocomposite material
                       upm formi is suitable for manufacturing both industrial goods and consumer products the
                       new biocomposite has extensive opportunities from electronic and automotive industries to
                       furniture tableware and other goods for everyday living says stefan fors director of new
                       businesses and development

                       the biocomposite is made of virgin wood fibres and clean plastic polymers the share of
                       renewable material can reach up to 60 meaning that the product is recyclable and can be
                       burned for energy at the end of its lifecycle moreover upm formis carbon footprint is
                       3060 lower than traditional plastics

                       fibril cellulose can be used in a wide range of applications
                       in 2011 upm started precommercial production of fibril cellulose at otaniemi espoo
                       finland the target is to commercialise the material by providing different types of fibril
                       cellulose for extensive customer testing

                       in the first stage products are used in paper and packaging materials as well as in the
                       concrete and paint industries upms fibril cellulose can be used to make products tougher
                       lighter or thinner it can also be used in many industrial applications requiring a high
                       stabilisation capacity and high viscosity

                     cooperation based on
                     continuous dialogue
                     upms relationships with environmental and community groups have been developed over the years around
                     tangible projects based on everyday discussions and dialogue upm has long traditions in engaging with the
                     community at most of its production locations

                     cooperation with wwf and other environmental groups
                     in 2011 upm partnered with wwf both in finland and internationally in finland the uns international year

                     and finland the annual event is important in building future generations relationship with nature and forests

                     in 2011 upm collaborated closely with birdlife finland on managing important nesting and resting areas for
                     bird species for example upm and birdlife finland jointly restored peat land area for red grouse and other
                     peat land species

                     uruguay foundation achieves positive results
                     the upm foundation has been active in uruguay since 2006 promoting development in rural areas through
                     education training and entrepreneurship to foster a culture of safe and healthy living in 2011 over 35000
                     people in 45 communities benefited from the activities financed by the foundation

                     in partnership with bio uruguay a local ngo upm foundation promoted sustainable farming practices in
                     sauce de batovi a small rural community of 1000 people located in the countrys largest and poorest province
                     and supported rural families whose livelihoods depend on the land they live in

                     thanks to upm foundations support we were able to profoundly transform the communitys approach to
                     farming both technically and culturally said alda rodriguez bio uruguays leader and project coordinator

                 investing in future talent
                 out of approximately 14000 summer job applications upm was able to provide
                 summer jobs to over 1000 young people in finland they were working at the produc
                 tion plants at upm forest finland at the upm service centre in tampere and at the
                 group head office

                 in 2011 upm forest implemented a trainee programme in finland the 11 trainees who
                 are located in offices across finland are going through an 18month training programme
                 to become versatile professionals in forestry business

                 upm also promoted the youth forum of the finnish paper engineers association by
                 supporting the international exchange of future engineers ten students were awarded a
                 scholarship at upms paper mills and upm raflatac labelstock factories and rd centre
                 across the world

                 getting started during school years
                 in the summer of 2011 upm employed some 160 young people aged 1517 who
                 planted trees in 60 locations across finland in upmowned and managed forests with the
                 help of upm silvesta forest workers

                 around half a million seedlings were planted during a twoweek period and the trees will
                 be ready for harvesting in 60 to 80 years

                 the response from both the young people and the forest workers was positive even
                 though that the summer was quite hot and planting trees is hard work says jukka
                 koivumäki managing director at upm silvesta
