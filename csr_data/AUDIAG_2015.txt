       dont have to be mutually exclusive audis com        and not vice versa
       mitment to its employees is also helping to make
       the group financially stronger so why is there         what can the employee representatives contribute
       really a need for a works council                      to ensuring that the modernization of work will be
           without a works council there is no codetermi     a success story
       nation in the company and no codetermination            a lot back in 2013 we were already tackling the
       no success its as simple as that the fact is that    important issues of tomorrow and bringing the
       if the employees are satisfied and their interests     workforce on board by means of open platforms
       are represented the result is highquality products   our world cafés this made it clear to everyone
       thats the simple little equation of the corporate      that the modern working environment at audi rests
       strategy in addition our works council activities     on several pillars on compatibility of work and
       enable us to know where the colleagues would like       private life on exemplary leadership and on trust
       to see change and we discuss those points openly       and appreciation to continuously build upon
       with the company                                       these pillars we are working together with human
                                                               resources and discussing for example new
       and what needs to be improved today                    approaches to structuring work hours here we are
          right at the top of the agenda is appreciation       studying how we can better take into account the
       of the colleagues this is why we are striving for      needs of people in different life phases while also
       an improved corporate culture and new leadership        trying to bring the term mobile working to life
       principles in the meantime there are working
       groups made up of company representatives and           audi is investing extensively in sites in germany
       works council members that are continuing to            and around the world what does that mean for
       finetune these topics                                 the employees
                                                                   for one thing it means the german sites are
       following the works council elections in march          going to continue growing in the future that secures
       2014 the employee representatives at audi              jobs but it also means a growing number of our
       moved forward with renewed vigor and set up             colleagues will work at locations outside of germany
       specialist committees and commissions what             thats why the audi works council is committed
       new topics were added                                  to fair underlying conditions so that assignments
           aside from the existing committees and commis      abroad will continue to be attractive because regard
       sions  like those for remuneration structures and      less of where in the world audi people work the
       personnel and competence development  we are           working conditions simply have to be just right this
       focusing more closely on the topic of teamwork        is the very reason why we set up the international
