thinking in generations
dear reader

most companies express their sustainability in facts and figures for us as a family business
it in fact reflects a set of values and although we can present key figures and annual financial
statements on the subject we measure it in a different unit generations this is because we
act towards the environment and society in a way that means our activities can also be suc
cessfully continued in the future

in the following pages we will show you how we reconcile economic environmental and
social targets here you will learn more about our values as a company about our commit
ment to employees apprentices and those hungry for further training about our occupational
safety about planzer groups ecological footprint and finally about our own fitness

on behalf of the planzer and baer families we wish you an engaging read with a longterm impact

drive safely
safety is not only an absolute value but a key factor in our business
only if we do everything for the safety of people and goods can we
guarantee our continued existence and success

the industry brings responsibilities with it
as a leading logistics company we have adopted the fcosastag sector solution in the
area of occupational safety this manual with various checklists helps us to guarantee safe
and healthy workplaces the fcosastag safety system covers ten areas

our fcos officers have again set ambitious targets for all the companies in planzer group
in 2015


  establish the fcosastag sector solution risk assessment
  in august 2015 the risk assessments were filed in the new workspace for all contacts
  for occupational safety they have to carry out hazard identification in their branches on
  the basis of the risk assessment with the aid of checklists

  prepare occupational accident statistics for all branches or create programme
  we have created an excel spreadsheet with which the branches can keep occupational
  accident statistics this list is being further developed so that a group analysis can be
  carried out

  introduction of mandatory action and prohibition signs on forklift trucks vehicles
  and entrances and exits to the building
  the mandatory action and prohibition signs were attached to forklift trucks vehicles and
  entrances and exits of buildings



accidents
those responsible report all accidents to the hr department in dietikon the department anal
yses the results using suvas etools the accident investigation with the person affected
takes place facetoface the suva event log serves as an aid for this this system means we
can identify risks and their causes promptly and counter them with technical organisational
or staff measures

ensuring continuing existence with business continuity
for emergency and crisis situations we need not just a plan b but also a plan c we are talk
ing about business continuity management bcm here we react to events that threaten the
groups existence with this systematic approach these would come about if our employees
infrastructure or technologies were impaired in a way that meant we were not able to replace
or rebuild them quickly our bcm was created against the background of the call for crisis
plans by legislators and economic players becoming louder and louder it helps us to manage
emergencies and crises with the aid of scenarios and to guarantee the continuity of our busi
ness  a stability that we need for our future the bcm plan is adapted annually in every sub
sidiary or immediately if there are significant changes

mobilise for more than one
good thing
we support various organisations and bring their ideas far closer
to reality we particularly focus on the topics of health safety and
encouraging the next generation

                                food distribution instead of food waste is the motto of
                                schweizer tafel the organisation collects almost eighteen
                                tonnes of food a day from producers major distributors and
                                retailers and distributes it free of charge to social institutions
                                we have been supporting schweizer tafel with transport
                                services since 2015 in addition we offer schweizer tafel
                                good terms for fuelling its vehicles




nez rouge
traffic safety is one of the rules for survival in transport during the
christmas season nez rouge always engages a network of volunteers
to offer a taxi service to prevent drunk driving we have been financially
supporting this organisation since 2010 and promote its valuable
service on the tail ends of our lorries




                                brain truck
                                road traffic accidents frequently result in serious brain injuries
                                so that other people can understand a life with this disability
                                the benefactors association pro integral has launched the
                                brain truck in this 16metrelong lorry trailer with tent attach

we campaign not just at national level but also for selected
regional projects in dietikon for example we support the
junior team of the football and handball club in addition we
campaign for the lplus initiative of company group competi

       on the move naturally
       as a family company environmental awareness is an inherent quality
       of ours only if we tailor our business activity to nature can coming
       generations also use and enjoy both and because there is no mobility
       without energy we target the right balance and intelligent use of our
       energy consumption

       there is no mobility without energy that is why we do not target a zero footprint in our
       energy consumption but the right balance and intelligent use

       fleet fleet
       for the fleet we rely entirely on the power of sustainability we keep a stateoftheart fleet
       with euro6 vehicles and an electric truck so that we can identify technical problems that
       impact emissions early we carry out regular maintenance on all commercial vehicles

       the truck is electric
       our electric truck is on the road for customers in city traffic in particular we are thus making
       use of the benefits of this 100 emission free quiet technology we will certainly expand our
       investments in this area  always combined with other environmentally friendly measures

       how to drive
       in our inhouse training centres our drivers are
       schooled in environmentally optimised driving and
       environmental handling of their vehicle at these
       centres our dispatchers learn efficient route
       planning and the avoidance of empty runs that cost
       additional co2

building environmental protection
in the last few years solar power systems have been installed on the roofs of various
sites in new builds and conversion projects the latest standards are used for façade
and window materials a building shell of this type guarantees optimum energy man
agement the heating energy needed is provided by condensing boilers with opti
mised management where possible with geothermal probes gas or wood pellets
high speed doors on the cargo handling areas of our logistics centre prevent unnec
essary loss of heat in the area of the docking ramps sensorcontrolled led light
sources are already used in some buildings and illuminate selected areas with a low
energy solution

clean as a whistle
stateoftheart washing facilities for all commercial vehicle types are available for use
at 13 sites across switzerland thanks to a combination of prespray arches and
highpressure jets they wash the vehicle clean as a whistle the plus for the environ
ment is that their own water processing means that only 20 freshwater is needed
for cleaning

energy management on a large scale
our energy use as a large consumer is being reviewed under the moderation of the
energy agency for the economy we put both structures and processes under the
microscope this project results in clear savings targets that we will achieve by
implementing appropriate measures


cool heads in pratteln
planzer transport ags triago building in pratteln is heated by central gasoil heating
with a ground heat exchanger heat recovery ventilation regulates the climate in the
office area and a thermoactive building system heats or cools it in summer triago is
cooled by the low temperatures of the soil via a ground heat exchanger in the ware
house building if required a chiller is used and we use its waste heat to heat the
warm raw water


on trend with recycling and upcycling
the disposal of old truck tarpaulins would generate a significant amount of co2
thats why zurichbased innovation company freitag turns our used tarpaulins into
iconic bags and accessories the planzer tarpaulins can also be found as stools or
living room furniture our trade fair stall made of used euro pallets also repeatedly
steals the show

giving numbers the floor
the complexity of sustainability cannot be reduced to a chemical
symbol nevertheless the co2 figure is already treated almost as
a currency for environmental performance here is an overview
of our 2015 ecological footprint
we collect planzer groups co2 emission figures quarterly and publish them once a year the
analyses below show our transport environmental performance for road and rail transport and
for the entire planzer group we collect the equivalent figures for our warehouse services in a
separate process

 we measure our co2eemissions based on the tanktowheel approach this describes the co2eemissions
   that are released through burning fuel



the aforementioned figures show the emissions of our own
vehicles and those of our contracted drivers on this basis we are
also able to analyse our customers co2eemission consumption
and provide them with the figures when making the calculations
and analysis in transport we strictly comply with european norm
din 16258




warehouse logistics environmental performance 2015
we are able to carry out warehouse logistics work for our customers
at various locations in switzerland in order to handle these jobs we
need a high level of energy resources such as electricity to produce
the service and oilgas for heating the building in addition there is
waste disposal

in 2015 a total weight of 1584798 tonnes of goods were processed in warehouse logistics
the emissions that arose as a result amount to 14603 tonnes of co2  or in other words
9 grams of co2 per kilogram processed the data is based on the record of the effective
consumption figures made by planzer itself the emission factors are based on the figures
of the gemis database version 47
