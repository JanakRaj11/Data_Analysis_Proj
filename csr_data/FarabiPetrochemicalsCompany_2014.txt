reporting process kickoff meeting

the kickoff meeting is an important event for starting the reporting process it is the time when we communicate the action
plan and ideas with colleagues it is also the time to better understand the organizational impacts and possible sustainabilityor
business goals most importantly time to take reporting process decision


we as a sustainability team went outside of premises and dedicatedly did assessment for our business goals and identify the
main positive and negative economic social and environmental impacts of daytoday activities we have also discussed actions
which can help to counterbalance these impacts and through this analysis started to identify material aspects upon which we
wanted to act and report


by the end of the meeting we have reached on following consensus
    main economic social and environmental impacts related to pursuing business goals
    list of aspectsrelated indicators identified that would be addressed and reported as a part of strategy for contributing to a
     sustainable future


sustainability team discussion are vital to the reporting process but also critical are the discussions with stakeholders the
gri sustainability reporting process must take into account both internal and external discussions so in line with this we have
involved our prioritized stakeholders one internal and one external and considered their inputs under sustainability report
contents

by using the above diagram we have visualized and identify our all stakeholders and classify them in groups and individuals as
direct and indirect stakeholders we have a long list of stakeholders after identifying so it was difficult to consult all of them th
erefore we have followed the gri guidelines to determine which groups to engage on our sustainability context by adopting the
concept of prioritization as shown below a template for example




                                             sample report


while engaging stakeholders we focused 2 factors what to ask and how to engage farabi did the engagement process with
prioritized stakeholders by doing a survey through a set of questionnaires covering sustainability aspects related to the business
goals


for this report we are limiting ourselves to engage with 2 stakeholders only employee  customers


we received feedback from engagement process and ensure to include them as a part of report contents by checking complete
ness through materiality principle check

it is necessary to apply tests for materiality determining which aspects are material for organization will help to choose the best
gri performance indicators to report against


materiality is determined by considering both
   the importance of the organizations impact and
   the priorities of the stakeholders


we did this exercise to prioritize and determine our issues which are addressed in this report are based on materiality princip

                                          the cdp supply chain program provides a global system that allows companies with
                                          vast supply networks to collect businesscritical climate change information from
                                          their suppliers cdp collaborated with members to gather information on green

panies leading to a more comprehensive picture of supplychain emissions among members in addition cdp and accenture
conducted an indepth formal survey of member companies to better assess the current state of supplier engagement on climate
change the number of member companies responding to each question varied from 29 to 49 depending on their ability to
provide information therefore percentages stated relate to the number of member companies who answered each question
finally selected members were interviewed to draw additional qualitative insights a team of experts extensively analyzed all of
these sources and conducted outside research supporting to produce this report


scoring methodology
information request were scored on two factors
1 transparency in the form of a numeric disclosure score
2 action on climate change in the form of a letter grade performance band


performance bands are not published for companies who attain disclosures scores below 50 as cdp believes there is insufficient
information on which to base a performance band while disclosure scores under 50 do not necessarily indicate poor performan
ce rather they indicate insufficient information to evaluate performance


farabi is participating in carbon disclosure projects from last 3 years as a part of cdp supply chain member of unilever we
have shown our transparency through reporting at maximum and got the disclosure scores by touching ceiling of 2nd largest
band of disclosure as compared to other reporters eg industry group scores region scores and overall scores as a part of
cdp format we reported our governance structure strategy of climate change and described what our initiatives are how we
set the objectives  targets what are the possible ways for communication farabi has furnished all required information in the
cdp report that explains and talks about risk and opportunity assessment followed by consequences of climatic change as per
cdp report format requirement emissions accounting is a key parameter for evaluating companys performance especially
about green house gas ghg accounting ghg emission for farabi operation has been accounted for scope1 fuel gas  fuel

responsible care is a global voluntary initiative developed autonomously by the chemical industry it stands for the chemical in
dustrys desire to improve health safety and environmental performance the signatory chemical companies agreed to commit
themselves to improve their performances in the fields of environmental protection occupational safety and health protection
plant safety product stewardship and logistics as well as to continuously improve dialog with their neighbors and the public
independent from legal requirements it runs in 57 countries whose combined chemical industries account for nearly 90 of
global chemical production


launched in 1985 by the canadian chemical producers association this dynamic initiative is constantly evolving to meet the
challenges faced by chemical manufacturers and all those in the value chain at global level that evolution was demonstrated
with launch of the responsible care global charter in 2006 at the unled international conference on chemicals management
in dubai uae


through the participation of nearly 60 national chemical manufacturing associations  and through them thousands of chemical
sites worldwide  responsible care forms an essential part of iccas contribution to the united nations strategic approach to
international chemicals management saicm


as part of responsible care initiative the international council of chemistry introduced the global product strategy in 2006
responsible care has fostered the development of the icca global product strategy gps which seeks to improve the industrys
management of chemicals including the communication of chemical risks throughout the supply chain through responsible
care the chemical industry is reporting and tracking its progress on critical elements of product stewardship and is making
further improvements to its current processes

at farabi we continually strive to aline our ohs managements systems and processes to international best practices our
ohs systems and processes are regularly assessed and audited internally as well as independently by third parties in addition
hse performance and programs at farabi are reviewed at board level



following aspects are the hall mark of the ohs systems at farabi

process safety
at farabi process safety information and operating and maintenance procedures are designed to identify and understand the
hazards posed by processes involved in operating the plant we use structured inspection and quality assurance programs to
ensure safety of our operations for all modifications at the plant all the changes to process technology  facilities are duly con
trolled through a robust change management system and we ensure that the fabricated and installed equipment is suitable for
process application incidents related to process safety are recorded separately and investigated to eliminate the root causes
process safety incidents frequency  severity is also stewarded as a kpi


behavior based safety
at farabi we believe that everyone working at plant whether direct employee or third party contractor should have the under
standing of the hazards at the plant and how to protect himself against these hazards this is accomplished by a set of programs
related to safe work practices ranging from basic safety orientation to job specific safety training job hazard analysis behavioral
audits of the working personnel verification of health of tools and equipment used adequate measuring of safe working condi
tions


safety performance  track record is strongly considered during employee appraisal and contractor qualification


workplace health
the workplace health program at farabi includes all aspects related to industrial hygiene and occupational health related to ha
zards at our facility focusing primarily on reducing health risks of employees
we have developed a comprehensive health risk assessment and monitoring program involving measurement of exposure to
toxic chemicals radiation and high noise employees health is assessed through a rigorous annual medical checkup


risk management and emergency preparedness
farabis direction on emergency response and planning is twofold to strengthen systems and procedures according to world
class safety standards and to conduct the business in a socially responsible manner we employ comprehensive emergency plans
at our sites which include defining key roles in case of release of hazardous chemicals simulation exercises to ensure prepared
ness involving external agencies such as jamaa and surprise drills to respond to emergencies

emissions goal and committed to reduce 20 intensity for a period of 10 years by 2023 from our benchmark 0856


2023 sustainability goals for energy intensity
farabi has established energy intensity goals and committed to reduce 2091 energy intensity index for a period of 10 years by
2023 from our benchmark 1425


2023 sustainability goals for water intensity hazardous and nonhazardous waste intensity
farabi has established various subsequent intensity goals and committed to reduce the targeted intensities in 10 years in line
with main organizational sustainability context of 20 reduction of co2e emission intensity
