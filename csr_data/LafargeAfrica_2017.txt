financial performance

the global crash in commodity prices which began in 2015 impacted crude oil prices and resulted in a
signiﬁcantly lower us dollar revenue for the federal government of nigeria this constrained government
expenditure with a negative impact on the overall level of demand in the economy

in addition fx supply to the market was short leading to a signiﬁcant devaluation of the naira the local
currency together all these variables made 2016 a challenging year for lafarge africa with revenue and proﬁt
after taxation down on 2015 by approximately 18 and 38 respectively

from q2 2017 the nigerian economy began to emerge from a period of recession which now gives a positive
outlook for 2017

case study alternative fuels

lafarge africa has become a leader in the industrial transportation of biomass waste  the main
use of biomass a new development in nigeria as component of fuel for instance over 700 jobs were
part of our efforts to combat climate change issues created in our host communities from biomass
this project involves partial substitution of fossil sourcing activities in southwest nigeria and edo
fuels with the use of biomass  a carbon neutral fuel state
                                                                     job creation projection for 2020

our use of alternative fuels reduces the emission of
greenhouse gases generated by fossil fuels this             2000

contributes to our ambition of reducing co2
emissions from our operations
                                                          jobs

in q1 2016 we faced critical gas supply challenges           700

due to the situation in the niger delta our ability to
use partial alternative fuels to sustain our operations
was an important and valuable component in our                                 2016          2020

community
we have positively impacted our local communities we have built and maintained over 120 boreholes in the
last decade for our sagamu community

this is in fulﬁlment of the health pillar of our csr for host communities the provision of boreholes arose
following a needs assessment which identiﬁed lack of access to potable water as a primary need in the
community over the years several villages have beneﬁtted from the boreholes helping to improve the
standard of living and providing access to potable water

in the last 10 years the following impacts have been
recorded
 many community members have beneﬁted from               stronger partnership and collaboration with local
  access to potable water resulting in reduced              communities

   the fencing of the akansoko community market has brought security and safety we
    have not recorded cases of stealing and criminal activities since the construction of this
    fence also accidents and fatalities among traders have reduced to the lowest minimum
    with the fencing of the market traders no longer bring their goods to the road to sell and
    that has reduced accident and also at the close of the market each day the gates are
    locked i want to thank them and tell them not to relent we are happy with what they
    have done so far

case study relocation of communities

we understand the impact of our work on our host               we relocated two villages oke oko

                         independent limited assurance statement to lafarge africa


introduction

report promoting sustainable construction for a better society written in line with the g4 framework of
the global reporting initiative gri our responsibilities for this engagement include to
     provide assurance on the inclusivity materiality and responsiveness of lafarge africa based on
         information reported
        form an independent conclusion on the adherence to the principles set out in the aa1000
         accountability principles standard 2008
        provide recommendations through a management report to lafarge africa

scope of work
our work was limited to assuring lafarge africas performance based on information recorded in the report
from january 1 to december 31 2016 our engagement is type 1 assurance as deﬁned by the aa1000
accountability standard as we evaluated the extent of adherence to the aa1000as principles of
inclusivity materiality and responsiveness and provided assurance to ascertain the adherence to those
principles we investigated performance data the approach to identifying prioritising and responding to
material issues and the alignment of statements within the report to the chosen gri framework

our conclusions are derived from a moderate level assurance implying that we believe there is sufﬁcient
evidence to support the statement such that the risk of our conclusion being in error is reduced but not zero
our liabilities are to the extent of this assurance statement

conclusion relating to aa1000
in reviewing lafarge africas 2016 sustainability report and underlying processes it is our opinion that the
principles of inclusivity materiality and responsiveness as set out in the aa1000 accountability principles
standard 2008 have been adhered to our ﬁndings suggest that
     the report was developed through some stakeholder engagement
     the materiality assessment is a true reﬂection of issues raised by critical stakeholders in the
         reporting year
        lafarge africa have in place systems to respond to issues raised by stakeholders

observations and recommendations
    inclusivity
    observations
        lafarge africa has adopted a more detailed and proactive approach to stakeholder engagement in
         2016 and it has resulted in proper categorisation of stakeholder groups and prioritisation of
         opinions relating to the organisations performance
        employees and communities have featured more prominently and beneﬁtted increasingly from the
         organisations projects including more active engagement with the highest level of management

    recommendations
      to further improve the engagement process there is a need for a synchronised organisation wide
         system of engaging stakeholders with clearly identiﬁed means of engagement and expected
         outcomes this will help to give a birds eye view of the various issues raised by different
         stakeholders and provide a more holistic perspective to prioritising and responding to same
        lafarge africa should increase the number of stakeholders engaged per year from each stakeholder
        group

    materiality
    observations
        the process for determining materiality is consistent with the standard introduced in 2015 and is
         representative of industry issues
        employees have showed a clearer understanding  since the 2015 sustainability report  of the
         importance of material matters and have engaged in more focused engagement with stakeholders
         to identify these matters

    recommendations
       after material matters are identiﬁed post engagement sessions stakeholders should be given the
         opportunity to rate matters in order of importance to ensure that matters are objectively prioritised
        a uniform preferably automated methodology for collecting and documenting milestone
         stakeholder feedback should be incorporated
        a clear process for analysing material issues in light of organisational goals and targets should be
         identiﬁed documented and communicated as needed

                                                             lafarge africa sustainability report 2016   i   77



    responsiveness
         observations
        lafarge africa has introduced new products policies and mechanisms in response to stakeholders
         issues especially with the sustainable procurement policy relocation of communities affected by
         its operations and increased community engagement
        there has been increased internal communication within the organisation on the need for
         responsible business practices and standardised operations across board
        a major achievement is the impact assessment exercise conducted in all of lafarge africas host
         communities this is a strong feedback mechanism for recording stakeholders reception of the
         organisations responses to matters raised
        product responsibility and brand perception boosted by 2016 customer survey response

    recommendations
        external communications revolving around lafarge africas responses to material matters raised
         should be more frequently propagated
        measurement tools should be introduced within lafarge africas plants and departments such as
         industrial logistics and human resources to ensure that progressand at what pacecan be
         measured and increased
        an organisationwide awareness programme is necessary to drive home lessons in sustainable
         business practices and to ensure ownership of the process from identifying prioritising and
         engaging stakeholders to properly eliciting material matters and providing the appropriate
         responses

statement of independence
csrinaction consulting is licensed by the global reporting initiative to train on sustainability reporting
giving us the expertise to draft sustainability reports and by accountability to issue assurance statements
while we have supported lafarge africa in scripting its 2016 sustainability report we have maintained our
independence by conducting a thorough and transparent assessment of available data we can therefore
assert that we have provided objective commentary on the nonﬁnancial performance of lafarge africa as
agreed between lafarge africa and csrinaction our responsibility for the conclusions formed within the
statement is to lafarge africa only
