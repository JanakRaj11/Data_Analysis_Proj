greetings to our valued stakeholders
cj cheiljedang started out in 1953 as a sugar manufacturer one of the basic food ingredients and a basic necessity of our lives during the
sixty years since cj cheiljedang has led the advancement of the domestic food market expanding the scope of business to food ingredi
ents foods feed  livestock bio and pharmaceutical products

this year we still face a very challenging time just as we have last year last year the global economy became more uncertain due to shrink
age of the european market the slow growth of the chinese economy and the plunging oil prices domestically the mers aftermath the
increase of household and corporate debt led to a drastic cut in spending and investment this year the global market faces risk elements such
as another interest rate raise by the united states slow growth of china and other emerging markets and potential threat of terrorism and
an unstable international political climate which may maintain the slow growth trend thus we expect the domestic market will recover only
marginally as well despite these difficulties cj cheiljedang accomplished meaningful achievements in each business division last year and
we will build upon those achievements to continue our sustainable growth for this year

agement philosophy of creation winwin and sharing we enhanced the jeulgeoun donghanghappy companion movement while fur
ther strengthening our global csv project which enabled us to gain recognition as a company with high social contribution not only domesti
cally but overseas as well

this is a valuable outcome made possible by the encouragement from stakeholders who have trusted and supported us and the devotion
of our staff we will not stay content with the achievements but further pursue meaningful csv activities and continue our efforts to build an
innovative business model where social value and corporate growth and profit can coexist as a prerequisite of such efforts we make the

with stronger environmental regulations around the world and heightened interest in the environ
ment of the local communities the importance of environmentally friendly management continues
to rise moreover efforts to minimize their environmental impact have become an essential duty for
global corporations thus many global leading companies establish environmental management
strategies in the longterm perspective and minimize their environmental impact through continued
investments in equipment and rd to achieve sustainable development

the reason for choice

proactive response to climate change
we have set the greenhouse gas reduction goal by 2020 and we are leading green consumption
by expanding lowcarbon products proactively responding to climate change we maintain
a close relationship with business institute for sustainable development under the korea
chamber of commerce and industry and spread ecofriendly policy throughout cj cheil
jedang including the supply chain by transferring environmental management knowhow to
small and medium suppliers in addition we continue our participation in the water donation
campaign with the korean committee for unicef to help supply clean water to the children in
africa

reflecting climate change in management decisionmaking
we decide important issues relating to climate change at the board of directors meeting
through detailed and systematic decisionmaking process matters such as purchasing and
selling emission rights largescale investments on greenhouse gases and energy conservation
and investments to prepare against storm and flood damage are decided for example the
executives in charge of production and the management executives discuss and decide mat
ters important to production such as reducing greenhouse gas emission in relation to climate
change and preparing for storms and flood

establishment of organization in charge of climate change
we launched an organization to take charge of climate change and energy under the engineer
ing team which oversees all of the companys production the new organization implements
activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption an employee at each
business location is designated to take charge of greenhouse gas managing the emission vol
ume and rolling out reduction projects

management and response to climate change risk
based on the climate change risk management system we quickly respond to related issues
we examine various risk elements and changing business conditions owing to climate change
reflect the risk management performance in the kpi of employees in charge providing promo
tion and incentives to encourage them to actively fulfill their roles in addition in order to sup
port competence development for responding to climate change for employees at the head
office and other business locations we provide external training on energy storm and flood
response and other subjects as well as exchanges with experts

definition of climate change risk
we classify climate change issue into two categories and manage them accordingly the climate
risk is divided into the issue of reduction pertaining to the legislation of greenhouse gas emis
sion rights and the issue of adapting to climate change these are also managed separately at
independent departments in order to tackle the legislation of emission rights we calculate the
volume to be reduced based on the expected emission volume we manage the emission quota
as well as buy and sell emission rights meanwhile we have a separate storm and flood manage
ment process in place to prepare for increased storms and floods that may occur due to climate
change to prepare for price risks such as crop fluctuations caused by climate change the pur
chasing department conducts forward contracts and purchasing

reflecting climate change management work in performance evaluation
we have included climate change management issues such as greenhouse gas reduction and
storm and flood risk management in the kpi of personnel in charge at the head office and other
business locations in particular greenhouse gas and energy management is marked high in the
kpi of the personnel in charge at the head office and is linked to the kpi of each business loca
tions so that climate change management work is directly linked to performance evaluation

minimizing environmental impact
we are implementing greenhouse gas reduction activities in accordance with the life cycle of
the product from production to distribution we are putting our efforts to reduce greenhouse
gas reduction during the production process and implementing conservation activities to pre
pare for depletion of raw materials and fossil fuels in addition we continue our efforts to mini
mize waste discharge and recycling byproducts into reusable resources

reducing greenhouse gas emissions
as we were designated as a target company for the emission trading scheme implemented by the
government to manage greenhouse gas goals we established the mediumandlongterm emis
sion intensity reduction plan and continue our activities to reduce emissions we have set to goal of
reducing direct greenhouse gas emissions by 30 until 2020 and we have successfully reduced 10
in 2014 meanwhile we plan to expand activities to reduce emissions so that from 2015 and by 2017
we will be able to manage most of the greenhouse gas emission rights quota stably

verification of reaching greenhouse gas reduction target                           all of cj cheiljedangs
business sites including plants shops education centers and head office undergoes verification
of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of march of every year by a verification institute des
ignated by the government these numbers are reflected in the governments comprehensive
greenhouse gas information system and additional greenhouse gas reduction targets are set
each year and details of the reduction tasks are reported to the government since we began the
public notice of reduction volume we have continued to meet the greenhouse gas reduction
target suggested by the government

  hetbahn 210g was selected as one of the products for the carbon labeling pilot project and
  was the first to acquire lowcarbon certification among processed foods this case involves
  recovering heat from a nearby waste incinerator where waste heat was discharged into the
  air by using an underground pipe to recycle the heat and is one of the representative cases of
  environmental management through this system 100g of greenhouse gas is reduced for each

trends in global business area
customers trust in the global food industry in general is diminishing as issues such as sanitation and
exceeding the regulation for additives surface repeatedly thus global food companies not only observe
the food safety standard verification of the country they are exporting to but also strictly control food
safety at the global level by utilizing various food safety management indexes and establish their own
food safety standards to promote the transparency of their food safety activities

the reason for choice
according to the survey conducted on cj cheiljedangs major stakeholder groups the issue of food
safety and developing products with health considerations for the customers showed a high level of
interest at 51 we understand that building a food safety infrastructure and providing accurate infor
mation is the only way to secure customers trust in this section we describe our efforts to secure
food safety and active communication with the customers

regaining customers trust on food safety
as a global food company cj cheiljedang sees food safety to be of the utmost value to this end
we cultivate food safety experts and introduce cuttingedge analysis equipment to conduct safety
management in all processes including the product launch to distribution in addition we qual
ity and safety center  that is in operation on the companywide level oversees the comprehensive
food safety management work and a safety personnel is assigned to each business location to
conduct food safety inspection over 50 times a year we strive to regain customers trust by build
ing a systematic food safety infrastructure

building the food safety infrastructure
we put our efforts to prevent consumers doubts and secure competitiveness in food safety by build
ing a customer safety and reassurance system throughout all processes beginning from the procure
ment of raw materials through to production consumption and distribution in the aspect of securing
product safety we will provide safe foods taking customers health and safety into consideration

operation of the quality and safety center                      in 1997 we established the food safety
center the first in the country with the duty to supervise food safety management and currently
it has been renamed to quality and safety center the quality and safety center operates the
safety verification system based on the knowhow accumulated over the years and has a guide
line that is more rigorous than the standard presented by the ministry of food and drug safety
and conducts thorough preparation and verification for food safety

introduction of quality management system                    in order to ensure proactive food safety man
agement we operate the cj quality management system as the internal policy together with
verifying the safety of raw materials managed through the qms we continue to secure food safety
based on audit analysis and record tracking

raw material and producer management                         we follow our independent agricultural raw
materials guideline when purchasing agricultural raw materials when purchasing agricultural raw
materials from abroad we adhere to the governments safety verification regulations while also
strictly applying our own quality management standards we commission external expert institu
tions to verify environmental risks to check for trace pesticides and heavy metals and we import
from business locations that meet the iso 22000 standards and ship only raw materials that have
satisfied the conditions set forth in iso 21569 meanwhile our purchasing amount for organic
sugar and organic flour in 2015 was krw 07 billion and we plan to increase the purchase and pro

trends in global business area
global companies are moving toward a mutually complementary relationship with the local commu
nity as corporate citizens not stopping at just social contribution activities or donations we provide an
opportunity for selfsupport creating shared value between the local community and the company



the reason for choice
surveys conducted on cj cheiljedangs major stakeholder groups have shown a high degree of inter
est on implementing strategic social contribution activities linked with business strategy at 25
we believe the reason behind this interest is the reality of domestic agriculture today that is closely
related to the foods business which is one of cj cheiljedangs major business areas in this report
aspect we will introduce rural support programs and employee volunteer activities

since our entry into vietnam as part of privatepublic sector collaboration project in 2014 we are
implementing csv projects to enhance the rural value chain in vietnam vietnam is a strategic country
with close business friendship with cj cheiljedang and we utilize it as the base for sourcing diversifi
cation however vietnams agricultural technology level is low compared to the volume of agricultural
produce and lack competitiveness in infrastructure and processing facilities leading to low income
of the farmers in consideration of these issues surrounding the vietnamese rural area we are imple
menting a global csv project in ninh thuan province in collaboration with our major stakeholders
koica yeungnam university and kwater from 2014 to 2017 the goal of the project is to increase the
income of the residents and enhance their selfsupport capabilities thus enhancing the value chain of
the vietnamese rural area one of the major achievements in 2015 was selecting a chili sees fit for cul

partner in enhancing local communities competitiveness
cj cheiljedang implements jeulgeoun donghanghappy companion with the aim of sharing
growth with the agricultural sector smes and local communities in particular we understand
the importance of agriculture as the essential industry within the food industry and we maintain
cooperative relationships to improve the fundamental competitiveness of agriculture

winwin cooperation with rural areas
from our belief that agricultural development is closely linked to the development of the food
industry we put our efforts into enhancing competitiveness and profitability of the rural farms
agriculture is also a national basic industry directly linked with food security and the root of the
foods industry but low productivity and aging of the rural demographic and free import of foreign
agricultural products hinder the growth and advancement of the agricultural industry cj cheil
jedang contributes the rural communities to secure differentiated competitiveness by developing
and supplying new seeds and providing training in farming techniques and cultivation methods

strategy and principles for winwin with rural communities                               cj cheiljedang sup
plies seeds developed by the company and conducts contract farming and transfers farming
knowhow farmers are able to secure a stable buyer enhance productivity and reduce cultivation
costs that lead to higher income while the company can safely secure high quality raw materials
which in turn consumers can use with trust and this forms an ecosystem of virtuous circle

supplying seeds developed by us                     we develop high value added seeds to enhance agri
cultural productivity and among the seeds developed we supply those with outstanding pro
ductivity to the farms in particular we proceed with contract farming using seeds whose stable
performance have been verified and commercialize the agricultural products harvested as an
example the cj happy bean no 1 is an outstanding seed with high yield and can be harvested
with machines and has been acknowledged to have contributed to the income of the farmers we
will continue to actively develop high value added seeds practice winwin cooperation with the
rural areas and contribute to the competitiveness of the domestic agricultural industry

guidance on farming techniques and cultivation methods                            we regularly visit the con
tract farms to check on the crop situation and encourage the farmers to produce good quality raw
materials in particular we tested a new farming technique that allows the reduction of production
costs and sametime harvesting which substantially contributed to increasing the farms income
the domestic chili pepper industry is steadily shrinking in terms of farming area and output which
is caused by decreased net profits due to higher labor costs we are spreading farming methods to
lower production costs as a way to solve this issue                                                            kimchi cabbage farm in mungyeong
