five years ago in april 2009 i became president looking back         increasingly serious reflecting these adverse factors we again
it was a time when the need to adapt to dramatically changing            recorded a recurring loss of more than 30 billion
business conditions kept us busy my inaugural fiscal year was                   in the following fiscal year ended march 2013 although a
a trial by fire as the effect of the global recession that began in     range of cost reduction measures helped us to move into the
autumn 2008 became increasingly apparent we recognised a                black by posting recurring profit of 177 billion business results
recurring loss of 304 billion in my first fiscal year as president    were still not at a satisfactory level in fiscal 2013 the year ended
from the following fiscal year however the situation turned            march 2014 we were finally able to achieve recurring profit of
around cargo movements picked up more rapidly than expected             584 billion while we cannot yet hail this as a complete recovery
and recurring profit surpassed 100 billion in fiscal 2010 the year     i feel the worst period is now behind us and we have successfully
ended march 2011 just as we were thinking that business results         navigated five hectic years of adapting to new conditions despite

previous mediumterm management plan more than shipping 2013
overcoming two years of recurring loss


i believe companies have a duty to generate earnings with this in               i believe overcoming deficits in two fiscal years and acquiring
mind even though business conditions were changing dramati             the ability to accumulate earnings steadily through businesses
cally it is very regrettable that the group reported deficits in two    with stable freight rates was a major achievement the nyk group
fiscal years while recording the volatile business results de          can declare complete recovery whenno matter how much freight
scribed above we concluded that our greatest business manage           rates deteriorateit is able to eliminate the 55 billion deficit of
ment task was to generate recurring profit with as much stability as     businesses with unstable freight rates towards this end we
possible our previous mediumterm management plan more                embarked on a wide range of measures thus i feel that under
than shipping 2013 reflected this view therefore over the past       the previous plan we did not shirk doing what was necessary
five years the group has made concerted efforts to promote

              realising major benefits by curbing fluctuation risk


              our greatest achievements have been in the container transport               yield management involves managing the profitability of
              area we reduced costs rigorously while curbing orders for new           individual containers initially we introduced this method to north
              vessels reducing surplus vessels and building a fleet able to           american shipping routes which as well as ocean transport
              adapt flexibly to demand changes continuing to reflect a large          encompass rail and truck inland transport networks in fiscal 2014
              supplydemand gap freight rates for containerships have been            the year ending march 2015 we will introduce yield management
              declining freight rates on mainstay shipping routes from asia to        to asian and european shipping routes
              north america and europe for example have decreased almost                 also we are currently using our success with containerships
              us200 per container during the past year on these shipping             as a best practice for introducing slowsteaming operations to dry
              routes the nyk group handles about 11 million containers               bulk carriers and various other vessel types and we are seeing
              annually therefore the freight rate decreases represent a deterio     benefits emerge steadily
              ration in profitability of approximately 20 billion however we have
                                                                                          yield management
              more than compensated for this decline by reducing costs through            a management method based on improving profitability by selling products
                                                                                          at the optimal time and price in light of demand forecasts
              slowsteaming operations and container cargo yield management
              this has been a significant achievement




              growing businesses with stable freight rates through technological capabilities and professional skills
              and a customeroriented approach


              as i mentioned businesses with stable freight rates outperformed        temporarily our efforts have earned us strong trust among cus
              their target under the previous plan by about 30 billion this          tomers in many cases this trust has helped us win longterm
              strong performance reflected positive contributions from longterm       contracts we will shortly be redelivering the highcost vessels we
              contracts in such areas as the offshore business lng carriers          have chartered therefore we expect to improve earnings signifi
              and dry bulk carriers as well as our expansion of the automotive         cantly and restore the stability of this business
              logistics business in particular the offshore business is growing          similarly we attribute the solid performance of the automotive
              faster than expected and has already become one of the groups           logistics business to our customeroriented approach when
              mainstay earners                                                        automotive manufacturers were rapidly increasing their presence
                   in my view technological capabilities and professional skills      in thailand china and other countries local infrastructure was
              are driving the growth of the offshore business because they            inadequate having the foresight to anticipate and build the
              handle crude oil and natural gas companies in this business area        services automotive manufacturers would need we established
              must have advanced shiphandling technologies and skills and             logistics networks and dedicated terminals essential for the
              outstanding safety the capabilities and skills of the nyk group         transport of finished vehicles and by continuously providing
              enable it to more than satisfy these requirements                       services based on this infrastructure we have been able to garner
                   further in energy transport a distinctive feature of the group     customers trust
              is its independent shipmanagement companies training facilities
              and cadet vessels this gives the group the advantage of being
              able to develop its own pool of seafarers with advanced techno
              logical capabilities and strong safety awareness consequently
              we can offer customers safe reliable transport services with
              confidence
                   as for our success in accumulating longterm contracts in dry
              bulk transport i believe this is mainly attributable to maintaining a
              customeroriented approach since 2004 freight rates have been
              rising with the spot charterage for capesize bulk carriers mainly
              used to transport iron ore surpassing us100000 per day in
              these conditions we have managed to procure vessels and cater
              to customer needs although putting pressure on profitability

              has unstable earnings mindful of this we have curbed exposure         small vessels that are aged or have poor fuel efficiency through
              to freight rate fluctuation risk and reduced deficits looking ahead   this strategy we expect the containership business to move into
              however as well as moving into the black we want to restructure       the black from fiscal 2016
              the business so that it can produce stable earnings as part of             by replacing vessels in this way we plan to reduce our fleet of
              these efforts we decided to acquire eight longterm chartered          containerships that are owned under longterm ownership formats
              vessels which are new 14000 teu twentyfoot equivalent unit         to ensure we can meet any eventuality from 74 vessels at present
              containerships boasting the best fuel efficiency in the industry at    to 65 vessels by the end of fiscal 2018
              present the nyk group has 14 operating vessels on the shipping             at the same time our plans require us to make greater use of

              recurring profit surpassed our initial forecast of 400 billion and                          net cash in fiscal 2013
              was 406 billion higher than in fiscal 2012 i think we achieved a                      at the beginning of the fiscal year under review we projected net
              result befitting the closing fiscal year of the previous mediumterm                     cash used by investing activities of more than 100 billion in the
              management plan more than shipping 2013 thanks to focusing                           first half of the fiscal year however we recorded net cash provided
              on cost reduction and such external factors as yen depreciation                         by investing activities this result was not because we narrowed
              however we have to give serious consideration to the fact that we                       investing activities but because offbalancesheet allocations
              did not reach the previous plans initial target of 750 billion                       increased in other words we were able to switch to chartered

              rates accounted for earnings of approximately 1100 billion while                      procure through onbalancesheet allocations
              businesses with unstable freight rates incurred a loss of about
              550 billion although we exceeded the 800 billion we had
              expected from businesses with stable freight rates the losses                           n investment and financial strategies

earnings to increase shareholders equity and reduce interest                                         billion consequently the debttoequity ratio should improve from

             nyk group recorded business results that were less than favour                   nature of business results remains a problem
             able nevertheless the group deserves praise for efforts to                          although i do not think most people associate shipping with

                  another point for consideration which i have mentioned             example rather than just disclosing the amounts of directors
