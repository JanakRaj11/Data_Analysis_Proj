                                              mercury in its elemental form is widely recognised as a hazardous and highly toxic
                                              substance which is capable of poisoning animal life and damaging the environment

                                              legislation such as the rohs directive in europe still allow the use of liquid mercury in
                                              fluorescent lamps since many believe there to be no alternatives to replace the use of
                                              liquid mercury

since january 2008 neonlite started to employ the amalgam        the environmental concern is that all cfls must be recycled
technology in manufacturing all of our cfl products              at recognised recycling points but it is common for lamps to
amalgam an alloy of mercury in solid form generally has         break in the disposal process so therefore solid amalgam
melting points under 200oc by using amalgam in fluorescent       minimises the risk of pollution this protects both the health
tubes there is no loss of mercury at room temperature and        of the users and the environmental impact on disposal
normal atmospheric pressure and the volume of mercury in
the tube can be precisely controlled during manufacture          for industry it is not only the increased commercial benefit
the use of amalgam also maintains optimum luminance               of reduced environmental pollution and increased consumer
levels during tube operation                                     safety but amalgam based mercury can be more accurately
                                                                  measured during lamp manufacture and therefore increasing
the use of amalgam to replace liquid mercury brings               product quality and a reduction in mercury used
significant benefits in both health and safety and
environmental aspects especially at end of life or the           over the past 4 years the average mercury content in
disposal stage where it is common for lamps to break in this     megaman cfl has been reduced 285 to 163mg in
form the mercury inside amalgam can be collected recycled       each lamp and 674 less than the rohs standard ie
and reused more readily since amalgam will not release           5mg see chart below amalgam based mercury is
mercury vapour when it is at room temperature and pressure       inherently safer for workers involved in the production the
it does not pose a health hazard to people nor pollute the        expense of handling liquid mercury safely and measuring
environment                                                      exposure levels is also reduced

communicating our objectives to the end user is key and in september 2010 neonlite initiated a campaign called true green with
this in mind

our campaign objectives were to use the absolute minimum amount of mercury for efficient use of a lamp while also using it in a
safer form the campaign was aimed at highlighting the potential risks associated with the use of liquid mercury in cfls to
illustrate the consumer health issue the following table shows what happens to the mercury in liquid and solid form when a cfl
breaks while in use

minimising toxic acid usage when creating
frosted glass
a layer of silicone on the glass bulb acts as protection
eliminating the use of toxic acids that are usually used to
produce the traditional frosted finishing this sleeve of
silicone also helps to prevent the leakage of mercury as well
as minimising the occurrence of shattered glass which is
obviously dangerous during disposal our lamps are the first
in the world to include this safety feature it also makes
recycling of the mercury and glass much easier as well as
providing a better light tone combined with the energy
efficiency our customers expect

a lamp base that never tarnishes
we use plastic lamp bases made of highheat resistant
acylonitrile butadiene styrene abs resin which also
contains copper and nickel plating these are recyclable and
do not contain any polybrominated biphenyl pbb and
polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbde flame retardants
that pose health hazards and risks to the environment
further committing to the environment and better resource
utilisation the plastic used for the lamp base contains nearly
17 recycled materials

ingenium  a technology for superb performance of cfl
developed by megaman ingenium is a patented stateoftheart lighting technology which can enhance the overall
performance of energy saving lamps it has a longer operating life and supports a greater number of switching cycles

further when compared with other energy saving lamps that are using conventional preheating mechanisms the ingenium
technology employed in megaman energy saving lamps controls and shortens the preheating time this helps slow the
deterioration of the filament and prolongs the life of the lamp from 8000 hours to 15000 hours the components used for
ingenium technology are extremely small as a result the lamps are more compact and lighter compared with others in the
market which helps minimise packaging allowing more units per shipping container and ultimately reducing the carbon footprint
of product delivery

take our classic series in 9 watt which applies ingenium technology the product is now more compact and the size has been
reduced from ø60x113mm to ø45x82mm and consequently the packaging materials have been reduced by 41 with the
reduced product size we are now able to ship 97 more in quantity in a 20foot shipping container in addition the ingenium
technology enables megaman energy saving lamps to offer our customers high luminous efficacy while consuming low power

the certification to global standard this is achieved through
an audit by a third party certification body which in turn
