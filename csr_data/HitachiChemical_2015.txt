                     q2 could you fill us in on the the mediumterm management
                             plan engagement in fiscal year 2015 and the results outlook
                             for its final year
                     in fiscal year 2015 we will put the finishing touches on our mediumterm management
                     plan as we look toward further global growth we aim to reap the benefits of the policies
                     we have implemented to date we also plan to continue building a flexible management
                     structure that will enable us to be more responsive to market developments
                        our ifrsbased targets for fiscal year 2015 are revenue of 5700 billion and operating
                     income of 550 billion this excludes items such as ma that are very hard forecast so in
                     real terms we think we are in a position to achieve the numerical targets laid out in our
                     mediumterm management plan6000 billion in net sales and an operating margin of
                     over 10




                     q3 could you update us the progress of global business expansion
                     our global development is making great strides in fiscal year 2013 the overseas share of
                     net sales surpassed 50 and at the end of march 2015 more than 50 of our employees
                     were overseas for the first time these figures show that our aggressive investment in
                     overseas businesses and ma are bearing fruit
                        the hitachi chemical groups first major foray overseas was around 1990 when japa
                     nese semiconductor and printed circuit board manufacturers expanded outside japan we
                     built production facilities to make epoxy molding compounds and photosensitive dry films
                     for printed wiring boards the second wave was when japanese automobile manufacturers
                     really stepped up their business activities in china and southeast asia targeting a position
                     as a global automotive components supplier we built production facilities in these regions

                     characteristics and needs of these regions and build on our achievements as part of these
                     efforts in april 2015 we integrated four consolidated subsidiaries in thailand three manu
                     facturers and one sales company the integrated company has consolidated each individu
                     al company that had separately developed businesses in manufacturing and marketing

q5 could you tell us how the takeup of hitachi chemical
          group vision of the next 50 years unveiled last fiscal year
          is going
our group is mainly in btob businesses we get to understand our customers needs
through dialogue and have the technological ability to create products that precisely meet
these needs we view this as one of our groups strengths
   however that will not be enough in the future we must be able to identify customer
needs and social issues that are not yet obvious at an early stage we need to be proactive
in offering solutions for these issues with our technology and products
   in fiscal year 2014 we launched our working on wonders beyond boundaries wowbb
activities to create hitachi chemical group of the future these revolve around the
bottomup wow global award activities the wow global award activities involve teams
choosing one of five challenges from the following themes 1 have the ability to identify
needs 2 envision future scenarios 3 create the next core technologies 4 become a
globallypreferred company and 5 develop work styles that allow for cocreation the
wow global award activities celebrates this process of taking on a challenge in the first
year 937 teams from all around the world entered after elimination rounds in the regions
10 teams made it to the final round in tokyo in may 2015 the top four teams were
awarded gold prizes
   kaizen activities in small groups are held to be the special domain of manufacturing sites
but we had many entries from backoffice departments such as administration and hr
which were of extremely high quality the participation rate was an impressive 85 in
japan 27 overseas and 61 on average worldwide reflecting the initiative of our
employees and the power of a bottomup approach


                                                                                                                                       annual report 2015

                        we expect even more entries from overseas when we hold the wow global award
                     again in fiscal year 2015 through continuing these activities we will surely get close to the
                     stage where we can build the hitachi chemical group of the next 50 yearsone that
                     develops innovative solutions beyond the boundaries of chemistry and delivers wonders
                     that exceed societys and our customers expectations

                     q6 could you give some perspective on the next mediumterm
                               management plan fiscal years 20162018
                     traditionally the mediumterm management plan was based on currently apparent themes
                     and issues we forecast the future three years ahead and created a plan based on this as
                     a result there was a tendency for the plan to target shortterm sales and profits it was not
                     possible to incorporate ideas about what sort of shape the company should have in the
                     future and what sort of direction we should be taking
                        this time we asked the question how will the business environment change over the
                     next decade then based on this we decided to first make a solid 10year strategy with
                     an overlay of our vision for the hitachi chemical group 10 years from now once we do
                     that and see what we need to do for the first three years from a 10year perspective what
                     we need to do in the following three years also becomes clear in a stepwise fashion were
                     going to incorporate this kind of scheme into our next mediumterm management plan

q8 what kind of nonfinancial targets do you have
promoting diversity is one of our groups business strategies we have diverse products and
technologies we develop new products by combining or integrating a variety of technolo
gies human resources are the same we operate businesses in new regions and launch
new businesses by bringing together the talents of a variety of people we must offer a
forum and have in place a framework whereby people can display their talents regardless
of age gender or nationality
   as part of these efforts we have changed our compensation system in japan from one
focused on abilitybased pay to one that focuses on an employees role gradebased pay
and this new scheme is being applied at the company and all domestic member companies
of the group once we develop a corporate strategy and create an organization to imple
ment it it is clear what positions are necessary by filling these roles with the appropriate
personnel we get the benefit of each persons potential being realized we plan to have
the scheme in place at all overseas group companies by the end of fiscal year 2015 to help
achieve diversity in the true sense of the word
   from fiscal year 2014 materiality issues that hitachi chemical should deal with was
prioritized and disclosed we are considering setting nonfinancial targets as part of our
performance benchmarks in the next mediumterm management plan including diversity
we intend to set some of these as our own key performance indicators kpis and make our
progress visible

q9 finally what would you like to say to your stakeholders
hitachi chemicals stated mission is to contribute to society through the development of
superior technologies and products
   we believe that one crucial element of this mission is embodied in what we are pursuing
through the open laboratory i mentioned earlier namely making a de facto standard out
of the process of creating new value through cooperation with a variety of companies at
open laboratory we hope to develop nextgeneration components and processes and
create new values by pursuing open innovationinnovation through collaboration among
packageassembly device process and materials manufacturers as well as others involved
in semiconductor manufacture
   further in addition to accelerating globalization we are developing our business without
a distinction between japan and overseas in particular we want our domestic employees
to be outward looking and become worldclass professionals through this we can create
new products and grow the business in a sustainable manner and continue to contribute to
our valued shareholders customers and society as a whole
   hitachi chemical will continue to grow as a group that operates from the viewpoint of
business the organization and people to create new values beyond the boundaries of
chemistry and deliver wonders that exceed the expectations of our customers and society

plan which covers the short term comes last i get the      for all employees to think about the next decade we take
feeling that once the destination is determined all else     this seriously
becomes clear and falls into place as a matter of course     yamazaki the process is the most important thing in

maruyama our company wants to cultivate a culture of
dialogue within the group we view this as a major issue     takei once the mediumterm management plan has
facing a single target aiming for growth and holding dis    been finalized we must create disclosure documents

all of our stakeholders starting with our employees and       next task is working out how to combine these raw mate
shareholders                                                 rials in a story that is well accepted by investors
yamazaki i think investors are looking for the kind of       takegahara the material needed to paint the next pic
attitude where the ceo himself is open about failures to      ture of hitachi chemical including nonfinancial elements
