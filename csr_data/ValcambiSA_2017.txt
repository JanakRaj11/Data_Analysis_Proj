       letter to stakeholders

g41   2015 has been a key year for sustainability the united nations launched the 2030 agenda for
       sustainable development pope francis released an encyclical considering sustainability and
       development and a new agreement to fight climate change was approved to replace the kyoto
       protocol important changes affected also the precious metals sector like the shrinkage of the
       markets the slowdown of volatility and the significant loss of value of precious metals in this scenario
       our company continued to ensure compliance with an evolving regulatory environment and took a
       strategic step towards further transparency and best practices in july 2015 we were acquired by
       rajesh exports ltd indias biggest exporter of gold jewellery this change of ownership opened new
       opportunities for us whilst keeping the management structure as it was
       over the past two years we have entered into a number of initiatives with partners to further strengthen
       our sustainability goals
       valcambi continued to embody best practices in the refinery sector and undertook  with the support of
       experts in artisanal and smallscale mining asm and monitored by a third party academic actor  a
       comprehensive review to upgrade and improve our sourcing procedures across all our business
       segments in particular we have been focusing on creating best practice procedures to ensure
       responsible sourcing from asm mines while it might be considered easier to divest from challenging
       regions and to focus on large scale mines valcambi is committed to engaging with the artisanal
       mining sector that plays a crucial role in offering a way out of poverty for millions of miners and their
       families around the world in line with our aspirations we aim at improving access to markets for asm
       miners and to be an ally to support their gradual legitimization and formalization in line with appendix i
       of the gold supplement of the oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of
       minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas from an environmental perspective in 2015 we
       started a project aimed at achieving water efficiency through a cooling system that will allow cutting
       water consumption of 70 during 2017 we will report these latest developments in our 2017 report
       our success depends on our talented dedicated people and i want to thank each and every one of
       them for their ongoing contribution to valcambis progress their health and safety are our top
       priorities in the past two years we have continued to improve our procedures and training to minimize
       the number of incidents as a part of our commitment to promote further engagement with our people
       we asked our employees children to draw their vision of the future their sketches wonderfully
       illustrate this report
       we are pleased to present our latest sustainability report to demonstrate our ongoing devotion to
       sustainability  not only for valcambi but also for our sector  and to share the progress we are making
       towards further transparency and accountability
       i am satisfied with our current progresses and eager to keep moving forward

        introduction

        the concept of sustainable development emerged three decades ago and is now higher than ever on
        the agenda of many governments civil society organizations and the private sector the definition of
        sustainable development has evolved over time to include new issues and challenges our
        sustainability report reflects this evolution as we are progressing towards more transparency and
        responsibility
g429   our first sustainability report published in 2014 served as a tool to drive dialogue with our key
        stakeholders with this second issue the report has become a valuable way to monitor the progress
g428   on our sustainability performance in 2014 and 2015 though there is room for improvement we are
        confident that we are on the right path
g432   we have chosen to publish this report prepared in accordance with the gri g4 guidelines core
        option
g430   the next sustainability report will cover the years 20162017 and will be published in 2018
        this report complies with the gri g4 guidelines released by the global reporting initiative gri
        which focus on materiality materiality is the guiding principle that ensures reporting is relevant
        credible and focused on what matters it identifies the issues most important to our stakeholders and
        our business and helps us to better inform markets and society about our sustainability strategies
g433   since most of the information contained herein is based on data that have already been externally
        verified and that meet some of the strictest standards in the field of reporting we decided not to ask for
        an external review of this report valcambi commits to be transparent to involve all stakeholders and
        to objectively evaluate progress in terms of economic environmental and social impacts

        the client onboarding phase aims at identifying the counterparties who requested to become a client
        of valcambi the sales and compliance officers identify the applicant individuals or companies and the
        risk connected to the entity its operations and operating environment its due diligence practices and
        sourcing practices making sure the origin of precious metal is legitimate only after the positive
        outcomes of these verification processes counterparties can start a commercial relationship with

        cannot pursue a commercial relationship with valcambi
        precious metals origin can be divided into two groups
        primary feeds                                         precious metal coming direct from mines
        secondary feeds precious metals that have already undergone at least one refining cycle investment
                         products such as coins cast bars or minted ingots greater or equal to 995 
                         jewellery and industrial recoveries from other sectors fall in this category

        materiality analysis
g418   the materiality analysis is a stakeholder engagement process aimed at identifying the topics that have
        a direct or indirect impact on a companys ability to create economic environmental and social value
        and maintain it over time the insights are central to inform sustainability reporting but are also
        valuable to strategic planning
        to identify the issues that matter most to our business and our stakeholders we used a formal
        materiality process engaging a broad set of stakeholders
        the process has been structured along the following phases
                 identification of a preliminary list of key environmental social and governance issues of
                  concern
                 consultation of internal and external stakeholders on the identified issues
                 prioritization of issues to determine associated risks and opportunities
                 systematization of the issues by placing on the materiality matrix that displays their position
                  relative to the degree of stakeholder concern and potential business impact
                 validation of the matrix by the management
g423   with respect to our 2013 sustainability report we present a more structured materiality assessment
        process that helped us to identify and verify supply chain traceability and water consumption as our
        new most relevant objectives energy consumption remains still on the target list but is ranking behind
        the two others
        in 2015 the board approved a project to reduce water consumption in valcambi up to 70 the project
        targets are to be fully implemented by august 2017

        the information included

materiality matrix
the findings of the materiality analysis have been placed on a materiality matrix that displays issues of
concern for our stakeholders and potential business impacts




the vertical axis of the materiality matrix demonstrates the degree of importance stakeholders assign
to the various topics the horizontal axis mirrors the relevance from the perspective of the company
and what may affect our business success in the upper part in the middle and on the right side of the
matrix are therefore the issues on which as part of our strategic objectives a high level of commitment
is planned for coming years such as
         trustworthiness ethical and professional behaviour
         our people health  security
         our clients and their satisfaction
         supply chain and traceability control
         economic performance
         water consumption
we are aware that priorities can change over time our aim is to continue to fine tune this materiality
process to best capture the evolving concerns of our stakeholders

g4ec3   our pension plan is managed by an external third party based on valcambis specifications in regards
         to investment strategy asset classes and risk profile the risk profile chosen is in line with our overall
         risk approach culture risk must be measurable and manageable considering that these assets belong
         to our employees and have the purpose of guaranteeing financial security during retirement we have
         the obligation to find a healthy mix between capital preservation and a return on assets over the last
         two years we have achieved to maintain a coverage ratio of approx 125 and have distributed 5 to
         our employees by paying the cash into their individual pension account the benefits we offer are
         superior to those required by the swiss law on occupational pensions 2nd pillar since a generous
         pension plan is part of our incentives to attract and retain qualified staff
g4ec4   we did not receive any financial assistance from the government in 2014 or 2015

g4ec5    valcambi adheres to the swissmem collective agreement commenced in july 2013 to be implemented
          30 june 2018 and supports
g4la13            equal opportunity and remuneration for women and men and no discrimination regarding
                    sex age nationality religion and sexual orientation
                   introduction of a minimum wage for valcambi this has not been necessary as salaries are
                    above what is stated by the ccl and minimum local wages
g4ec6    the majority of valcambis employees are swiss or italian all four members of our top management
          are local residents




          our environmental performance
g4dma    precious metals refining and manufacturing requires a significant amount of water and energy and
          leads to ghg emissions and waste according to the environmental impact analysis operated to
          achieve iso140001 and opir certification the environmental risks related to valcambis production
          are considered moderate to low
          environmental concerns are high on valcambis agenda we work hard to improve our energy
          efficiency and reduce the use of chemical products monitor our emissions water consumption and
          waste disposal
          we are periodically monitored by local authorities and we carry out internal controls on a regular base
          the results are systematically reported to the authorities apart from being fully compliant with all laws
          and regulations we strive to constantly minimize our environmental footprint and monitor closely any
          new technical development that might help us
g4en31   every year we spend 1 million swiss francs on environmental protection measures mostly devoted to
          minimizing our emissions and treating wastewater
g4en32   we expect our suppliers to actively contribute to reduce the environmental impact of present and
          future products we seek solutions to optimize our environmental impact in the phase of shipping
          transportation and processing




          materials
g4dma    we constantly attempt to reduce the quantities of chemical products we use by taking advantage of
          technical developments and by seeking better solutions for production such as using less
          environmentallyimpactful reagents and sourcing precious metals from secondary feeds
g4en1    during 2014 we consumed approximately 1530 tons of chemicals and materials excluding precious
          metals while in 2015 we consumed around 1201 tons of the same in both 2014 and 2015 as in
          2013 more than 50 of total consumption of materials utilized was made up of the top three chemicals
          used in the refining process all acid and alkaline solutions
g4en2    in 2014 69 of precious metals refined were sourced from secondary feeds and 31 from primary
          feeds as in 2015 78 from secondary feeds and 22 from primary feeds




                                                                                                                       34

         energy
g4dma   in november 2013 valcambi substituted heating oil in favour of natural gas and electricity both energy
         sources have a considerably lower ghg footprint
         the electricity consumed is supplied by the local distributor age sa and originates also albeit not
         exclusively from renewable sources such as hydropower biomass and wind
g4en3   the total 2014 energy utilization amounted to 4675271 gigajoules gj with a reduction of 138 vs
         2013 while in 2015 the consumption has been 4560696 gj with a reduction of 25 vs 2014
g4en6   the reduction in energy consumption relative to 2013 is due to inferior production figures and to a
         better energy efficient management of our resources

                                                                                  467527    456070

          water
g4dma    the water we use is sourced from the public water supply managed by the municipality of balerna
g4en8
          through its subsidiary azienda acqua potabile the totality comes from a groundwater source located
          in the immediate vicinity of our premises
          for production cleaning human consumption and hygienic purposes we purchased 243200 m3 of
          water in 2014 which represents a decrease of around 20 vs 2013 while in 2015 217860 m3 has been
          purchased representing a reduction of 10 vs 2014 the reduction in water consumption is partly due
          to reduced volumes of material worked but can also be attributed to efforts made at minimizing waste
          in december 2015 valcambi approved a major investment to implement a watersaving system for
          cooling processes going forward this will allow valcambi to reduce up to 70 in water consumption
g4en22   in 2014 228000 cubic meters of waste water were released 21 compared to 2013 205000 cubic
          meters in 2015 10 compared to 2014 the water used for contactless cooling represents 81 of
          the total amount and does not require any pretreatment processes it is poured into the adjacent
          creek at a controlled temperature the temperature difference measured upstream and downstream
          of the outflow pipeline remains constantly lower than 3c the water used for contact manufacturing
          processes is pretreated in our onsite waste water treatment plant wwtp before being sent to the
          sewage treatment plant pretreatment processes allow us to release water in the sewer within the
          limits imposed by the federal water pollution control ordinance opac as a result of a study carried
          out in 2014 in close collaboration with the cdacd consortium of water purification chiasso and
          surroundings and the cantonal authorities dtspaas valcambi created a new area for the
          treatment of nitrogenous solutions allowing better management of such solutions also in function of the
          needs of municipal wwtp




          waste
g4dma    in its operations valcambi generates three kinds of waste domestic special and recyclable waste
g4en23   domestic nonrecyclable waste comes mainly from the canteens and is collected by the local garbage
          collection company not tracked
          special waste including potentially toxic waste coming from production processes is collected by
          specialized approved and legally authorized treatment companies for disposal and recycling in 2014
          valcambi produced 39 tons of special waste versus 32 tons in 2015
          100 of recyclable waste is collected by specialized and legally authorized recycling companies in
          2014 1932 tons and 1409 tons in 2015
          the recyclable waste collected was divided as follows
                                        2013         2014        2015

          greenhouse gas  ghg emissions
g4dma    according to the greenhouse gas protocol ggp direct and indirect emissions can be categorized
          as follows
          scope 1 accounts for all direct ghg emissions deriving from sources that are owned or controlled
                      by the company for example emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers
                      furnaces vehicles etc emissions from chemical production in owned or controlled
                      process equipment
          scope 2 accounts for all indirect ghg emissions from the generation of purchased electricity
                      consumed by a company purchased electricity is defined as electricity that is purchased
                      or otherwise brought into the organizational boundary of the company scope 2 emissions
                      physically occur at the facility where electricity is generated
          based on our data direct and indirect emissions of ghg measured in tons of co2 equivalent ton
          co2e are the following
                        2013        2014        2015
g4en15   scope 1    17941 t   13727 t   12772 t
g4en16   scope 2      8629 t     7527 t     7536 t
g4en19   data recorded for 2014 and 2015 show a decrease compared to 2013 these shifts are based on
          reduced annual production and demand as well as to a more accurate selection of energy sources
          heating oil consumption has been completely ceased in 2013
g4en20   valcambi does not emit ozonedepleting substances into the atmosphere

          collar crimes heshe ensures that management and employees are in compliance with the rules and
          regulations of regulatory agencies and value related risks when dealing with potential and current
          business partners
g4hr12   in 2015 concerns were raised by civil society regarding insufficient transparency across the precious
g427     minerals sector and potential violations of human rights these concerns included swiss refineries and
          valcambi sa was explicitly named in a report issued by the swiss ngo déclaration de berne bd
          valcambi took these concerns extremely seriously as we are committed to operating in conformance
          with and going beyond internationally accepted standards and guidelines for responsible business
          practice this commitment is embodied through continuous improvement of our management systems
          for supply chain due diligence including kyc know your client and kyp know your product
          practices
          in conformance with its best practice standards valcambi responded to the concerns raised by bd by
          immediately activating an internal investigation suspending all refining activities regarding import of
          gold from the alleged areas and reviewing all of its internal due diligence procedures with a special
          focus on asm sourcing




                                                                                                                     42

in 2015 with the support from experts in asm and responsible sourcing and monitored by a third party
academic actor valcambi began a process of review upgrade and improvement of its sourcing
procedures across all business segments
in addition valcambi developed best practice procedures to ensure responsible engagements with
artisanal and smallscale mine asm sources while for many it might be considered easier to divest
from challenging regions and focus on large scale mines valcambi is committed to engaging with the
artisanal mining sector that represents an important livelihood and income source for millions of people
around the world in line with these aspirations valcambi aims at improving access to markets for
artisanal and smallscale miners by being an ally to support their gradual legitimization and
formalization as encouraged by appendix i of the gold supplement of the oecd due diligence
guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas
