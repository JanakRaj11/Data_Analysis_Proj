message from
the chairman
sustainability is in this day and age an ever more inescapable issue    this is not the only side of the question the company has acquired
there is concern among ordinary people enterprises governments          vehicles with new generation engines euro 4 and euro 5 allowing
domestic and international organizations and willingness among             it to significantly improve the performance of its fleet with
them all to change behavior and adopt measures that will lead              major cuts in pollutant gas emissions and in noise the city is the
to a more sustainable society whether it be in economic social            beneficiary
or environmental terms
                                                                           the companys efforts in the field of sustainability are not therefore
carris is a company that is aware of its responsibilities as such        simply on the environmental side they also take in the economic
it is especially concerned with and attentive to the issue it has         and the social
defined sustainability practices and put them in place in a way that
is beneficial to the company and also to the urban environment in          on the economic side there was a revision of the code of conduct
which it operates                                                         and also reinforcement of the companys information and control
                                                                           mechanisms and it has made its measures public at the right time
we have tried to give high visibility to this approach we have taken      this concern also covers the management of its public relations
on commitments that have led to a more sustainable company                and in the social sphere the attraction and retention of talent and
and we have carried out specific actions that have allowed                 activities where it demonstrates its social responsibility these
us to continue to reach positive results in the year under review        were all part of the strengthening of its good practices in business
                                                                           sustainability
in this context we should mention a specific point that is relevant
the environmental certification given to the company in the early          the report that follows covers the objectives and the results of all
part of the year through norm iso 140012004                             work done in these areas during the year here there is clear evidence
                                                                           that the commitment has been accepted by all those who work
this is a public commitment to good practices the purpose being           for the company summed up as good practices in sustainability
to reduce the environmental impact resulting from the companys            the company is fully aware that consistent development and growth
operations                                                                need to be based on sustainable principles only in this way will
                                                                           there be a future for us all
