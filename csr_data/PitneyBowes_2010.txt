ethics
we all make ethical decisions every day our approach is to be clear with our
employees about our expectations of them and to provide the practical resources
they can use to learn about their obligations and get guidance on how they can
gear their actions both inside and outside the workplace to reflect the policy and
legal guidelines that govern pitney bowes

code of conduct our code of conduct the pitney bowes business practices
guidelines describes and illustrates ethical and compliance issues that impact
our employees our customers our business partners and the communities in
which we live to reinforce our commitment to ethical behavior and legal
compliance we have linked our standards on ethical behavior to annual
employee performance evaluation and compensation as part of their annual
performance evaluations employees are rated on how well they demonstrate
ethical leadership additionally employees are given the opportunity to voice
their opinions on the ethics demonstrated by their managers and senior
management in our annual employee engagement survey

training each year employees are required to take training on specific company
policy practices and the law covering such topics as records retention antitrust
or anticorruption we use a variety of analytical tools to identify areas of risk
then design programs to mitigate the risks we offer training through seminars
online and via webex and through other channels for employees who do not
have access to a computer

advice and reporting channels we encourage employees to seek advice in
dealing with ethical dilemmas and to report any suspected wrongdoing our
ethics help line operated by a third party 24 hours a day seven days a week
enables employees to report wrongdoing anonymously and in virtually any
language without fear of retaliation employees also can contact the global ethics
 business practices department in person or anonymously through hard copy
mail telephone or email delivered to a special email address all claims of
potential violations of law or policy are reviewed and investigated as appropriate
in the event a complaint is verified appropriate disciplinary action is taken

place across the organization this enterprise risk management system identifies
and prioritizes potential risks to the business including financial environmental
and societal these risks are then assessed in terms of probability severity and
status of mitigation plans the risks identified are reviewed by a senior manage
ment risk steering committee and the board of directors the risk management
process is reviewed independently by the audit committee of the board

the result is a strategic approach towards risk by focusing on those issues that
can impact how well we achieve our longterm goals management is able to
balance risk and reward appropriately and holistically the interests of manage
ment employees and shareholders are further strengthened and aligned

we value the safety of our employees and have a passion for an injuryfree work          these teams from clearwater fl
place we establish projects and processes to control and eliminate hazards we hold      and rancho dominguez ca were
all employees accountable to drive toward a goal of zero workplace injuries and we       just two of more than 26 teams
empower employees to make positive changes in their workplace to improve health           throughout pitney bowes locations
and safety                                                                               that conducted safety evaluations
                                                                                          and training in 2009
our global environment health and safety department works in partnership with
operations leadership to assess workplace hazards establish annual improvement
plans and track performance management has clearly defined responsibilities and
objectives for safety and health business units have committees or safety champions
to coordinate activities

we recognize and reward outstanding safety performance we train our employees
to do their assigned jobs safely and make it clear that sticking to our safety rules is
a condition of employment

in recent years we have tailored our safety programs to address the most frequent
work place injuries sprains and strains account for more than half of all employee
injuries they are usually caused by manual material handling repetitive work tasks
or awkward postures and positions to increase awareness we launched a safety
campaign every body can do it and released a quick stretch video containing
simple exercises we also charged safety tiger teams to make ergonomic assess
ments conduct training and drive improvement

in 2009 two tiger teams completed projects that demonstrate how much can be
achieved with simple changes in clearwater florida a team from sure feed
engineering replaced rolling carts used in inkjet assembly with new ones selected
specifically for the assembly task as a result they not only reduced bending and
twisting injuries but enabled faster cycle times for the same function they also
obtained similar benefits of both safety and speed at a welding station by installing
a power lift to move large assemblies to and from welding tables another team at
presort services in rancho dominguez california instituted changes in the design
of sorting stations that have improved access for employees reduced abovethe
shoulder repetitive motion and speeded up operations by reducing congestion

such attentiveness is making a difference across the company our total us
workers compensation claims fell from 1198 in 2008 to 964 in 2009 and our
total incurred cost of claims dropped by 21 million with the cost per claim down
by 21 percent for additional indicators see the metrics at the end of this section

working with suppliers
to serve our customers with the highest standards of service and product quality
we need corresponding standards in our dealings with suppliers in addition to
strict standards on the technical performance of supplier goods and services
we also seek to ensure that working conditions in our supply chain are safe
that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing
processes are environmentally and socially responsible and that suppliers are
committed to abiding by the laws that apply to them

supplier code of conduct
to formalize these expectations in 2008 we introduced a supplier code of conduct
the code establishes critical benchmarks and examples of good management
practices to help suppliers comply with the codes provisions for supplier
performance in the following areas
 forced labor
 wages and working hours
 nondiscrimination
 respect and dignity
 health and safety
 protection of the environment
 legal and ethical dealings

all of our key suppliers have acknowledged receipt of and support for the codes
standards and provisions we have communicated our expectation that our key
suppliers will apply the codes standards to their extended sources of supply
engaged in the production of goods and services for pitney bowes

we are updating our supplier agreements to include references to the code and
are developing metrics for measuring suppliers compliance with the code we
encourage suppliers and pitney bowes employees to report violations of the
