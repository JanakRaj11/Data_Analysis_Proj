             rewarded with a smile
             by exceeding your expectations
              i would like to begin by offering thanks for the continued support and understanding of all of
              our stakeholders in addition on behalf of everyone at toyota i would like to express my
              wishes for the restful peace of all those we lost to the great east japan earthquake and to
              offer our sincerest sympathies to all who have suffered through this great tragedy
                 when i reflect on the past year i am touched by the support offered by so many of our
              customers and stakeholders as we dealt with the ongoing effects of the global financial crisis
              as well as product quality and safety issues i offer my sincerest gratitude
                 learning from these experiences i continued to ask myself what kind of company do we
              want toyota to be what kind of company should toyota be i realized that toyota should
              strive to be a company that people choose and that people are happy to have chosen the
              global vision we announced in march is strongly imbued with these ideas
                 the great east japan earthquake struck two days after we announced our global vision
              our employees entered the stricken areas in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake and
              began providing support working together with local residents to reconstruct and restore
              communities upon viewing the situation after the disaster our support teams assessed the
              situation quickly worked out what was best for the communities and immediately set about
              their tasks accordingly this represents the very spirit of toyota s power of the workplace
               an asset built up and handed down through 70 years of toyota history priority was given
              to rescuing and preserving life then to the restoration of the communities with restarting
              production only considered after the situation stabilized
                 i personally went to the scene of the disaster not only to see for myself the scale of the
              destruction but also to listen to voices of the people there from this experience i strongly feel
              that assistance for reconstruction and restoration from the disaster must be ongoing and i
              instigated the kokoro hakobu project in which our belief that automobiles carry not only
              goods and supplies but they can also carry human hearts is reflected this project was planned
              and carried out by toyota and toyota dealer employees with thoughtful consideration
                 as part of the project in this july we announced activities we will carry out toward restora
              tion from the disaster through social contribution and                   we will contribute to the
              scholarship foundation created by iwate fukushima and miyagi prefectures for children who
              lost their parents in the earthquake or tsunami and we have set up inhouse training systems
              for the graduates of industrial high schools in the tohoku region i fully expect that those who
              receive this training will support and continue the monozukuri tradition in tohoku and play
              important roles for japan s future
                 this sustainability report introduces various activities we conduct with the aim of realizing
                                                                 a sustainable society based on the eight axes

with conventional crashtest dummies by creating precise models of various internal organs

  lowcarbon society

in order to realize sustainable mobility throughout the future for many years to come toyota works on build
ing of a societal foundation through not only its core products vehicles but also its housing businesses it etc


the smart grid envisioned by toyota
smart grid is a type of electrical grid which attempts to intelligently use electric power utilizing it in mutual collaboration
between power producers including generators of renewable energy such as solar power and wind power and consum
ers of electricity like houses buildings plants etc toyota contributes to develop nextgeneration lowcarbon communities
by working on realization of the smart grid mainly from the users viewpoint such as vehicles houses telematics and so
forth today towards that end toyota is participating in a variety of pilot projects in countries around the world
