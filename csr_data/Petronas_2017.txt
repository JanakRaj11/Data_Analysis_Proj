dear shareholders


it gives me great pleasure to present an overview of pcgs performance for the
financial year ended 31 december 2016 for the period under review we continued
to focus intently on our operational commercial and innovation excellence
and forged ahead with our growth plans the end results have been very positive
as we further cemented our position as a leading petrochemicals player in the
region creating added value for you

it is by no means the best of times for the petrochemicals industry with low oil prices and soft global demand suppressing the margin of our
products within this scenario pcg continued to secure strategic markets in the asia pacific region with optimised cost combined with improved
feedstock supply and enhanced plant reliability we pulled together an impressive performance for the year


pcg continued to focus on the asia pacific region to leverage on the benefits of reduced transport costs as well as hot spots of demand the price
of ethylene a basic product which serves as a barometer of petrochemical commodities for olefins and derivatives od market increased in
the first half of the year due to several plant shutdowns and turnarounds in the region however upon completion of these turnarounds ethylene
flooded the market once again pushing down prices towards year end on average the price of ethylene was 6 lower in 2016 than it was in 2015

          demand was noticeably softer in comparison with supply in the fertilisers and methanol fm market the accompanying decrease in price of
          products was reflected in those for urea and methanol which dropped by 25 and 16 respectively in 2016 compared to 2015


          while such macroeconomic factors and the dynamics of supply and demand are beyond our control i am proud that in areas where we can make
          a difference we have done so pcg continued to persevere with our twopronged strategy of strengthening basic petrochemicals while selectively
          diversifying into derivatives specialty chemicals and solutions underpinned by our focused efforts to enhance our operational and commercial
          efficiencies the results were gratifying in terms of key financial and operational parameters


          operationally we recorded our highest plant utilisation of 96 since incorporation surpassing worldclass benchmark of 85 thus setting a solid
          foundation for our growth with record production and sales volumes as well as various measures to enhance efficiencies the groups revenue
          increased 2 from rm135 billion in 2015 to rm139 billion meanwhile earnings before income tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda grew
          markedly from rm47 billion to rm53 billion providing us an ebitda margin of 38 most significantly for our shareholders we recorded a profit
          after tax pat of rm32 billlion and a higher return on average capital employed roace 3 years average of 12 for the year

                 for further discussion on our fiscal policies and recognition of
                 our financial risks please turn to pages 46 to 47



          on track in our journey to excellence


          operational excellence is imperative for the success of our business our efforts to achieve worldclass benchmark in plant performance through
          effective implementation of internal reliability and efficiency enhancement programmes supported by reliable feedstock and utilities supply
          were rewarded with exceptional results we achieved 100 utilisation rate in the third quarter and averaged 96 for the year this was especially
          significant as increased capacity globally combined with subdued demand has negatively impacted the utilisation rate of many players


          pcg could afford to run at its highest capacity secure in the knowledge of a ready market for our products because of effective sales and
          marketing initiatives while strengthening our relationship with more than 1000 existing customers our team has been proactive in leveraging
          sales channels for highvalue applications riding on pcgs established reputation years of truly valuing our customers and ensuring we meet their
          expectations at every single opportunity have gone a long way towards opening many doors for us

                               tighten their belts and pcg has been no different


                            we have had some significant successes on this score for 2016 thanks to various cost optimisation initiatives
          rashidah alias    not least of which has been our focus on operational excellence which has significantly increased our plant
                            utilisation thus reducing our unit production cost this has been further supported by reduced repair and

                            our plant utilisation hit a record level of 96 up from 85 in 2015 due largely to improved ethane and methane
                            supplies as well as a lower level of turnaround activity across the group along with higher plant utilisation we
                            saw an increase in production and sales volumes this together with a stronger us dollar against the malaysian

                            the efficiencies brought about by increased production volume and lower unit cost together with a favourable
                            foreign exchange environment allowed us to mitigate the impact of thinner spreads to record 14 growth in

section
   four   in early 2016 we set up a sustainable development working committee sdwc to guide us on our new sustainability reporting strategy
          the committee is also responsible for overseeing various systems implemented to monitor and report on our sustainability performance via
          representation in all the relevant departments within pcg in addition sdwc members work closely with their counterparts at each subsidiary to
          ensure stakeholders value creation across the group all decisions by the sdwc are vetted and approved by our management committee mc
          and board of directors which ultimately takes responsibility for the sustainability of the organisation

     six        the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and have been
                applied consistently by the group and the company unless otherwise stated


                21 basis of consolidation


                    i   subsidiaries


                          subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company the group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to variable
                          returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity potential
                          voting rights are considered when assessing control only when such rights are substantive the group considers it has de facto
                          power over an investee when despite not having the majority of voting rights it has the current ability to direct the activities of
                          the investee that significantly affect the investees return


                          the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group from the date that
                          control commences until the date that control ceases


                          subsidiaries that were acquired from petronas upon initial public offering ipo are consolidated using the merger method of
                          accounting other subsidiaries are consolidated using the acquisition method of accounting


                          under the merger method of accounting the results of entities or businesses under common control are accounted for as if the
                          acquisition had occurred at the date that common control was established the assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at
                          the carrying amounts in the consolidated statements of financial position the difference between the cost of acquisition and
                          the nominal value of the shares acquired together with the share premium are taken to merger reserve or adjusted against any
                          suitable reserve in the case of debit differences the other components of equity of the acquired entities are added to the same
                          components within the group


                          all intercompany transactions are eliminated on consolidation and revenue and profits relate to external transactions only
                          unrealised losses resulting from intercompany transactions are also eliminated unless cost cannot be recovered


                          business combinations


                          a business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses business
                          combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are
                          measured at their fair values at the acquisition date the cost of the acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair value of
                          the consideration transferred and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree noncontrolling interests are stated
                          either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets at the acquisition date


                          when a business combination is achieved in stages the group remeasures its previously held noncontrolling equity interest in
                          the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date with any resulting gain or loss recognised in the profit or loss increase in the
                          groups ownership interest in an existing subsidiary is accounted for as equity transactions with differences between the fair
                          value of consideration paid and the groups proportionate share of net assets acquired recognised directly in equity


                          the group measures goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquisition and the fair values of any previously held interest in the
                          acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date when the excess is
                          negative a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss


                          transaction costs other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities that the group incurs in connection
                          with a business combination are expensed as incurred

               noncontrolling interests


               noncontrolling interests at the end of reporting period being the portion of the net assets of subsidiaries attributable to equity
               interests that are not owned by the company whether directly or indirectly through subsidiaries are presented in the consolidated
               statements of financial position and statements of changes in equity within equity separately from equity attributable to the
               shareholders of the company noncontrolling interests in the results of the group are presented in the consolidated statements
               of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as an allocation of the profit or loss and total comprehensive income for the
               year between the noncontrolling interests and shareholders of the company


               losses applicable to the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the noncontrolling interests even if doing so
               causes the noncontrolling interests to have a deficit balance

               interests and the other components of equity related to the former subsidiary from the consolidated statements of financial
               position any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss if the group retains any interest in the
               previous subsidiary then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost subsequently it is accounted for
               as an equityaccounted investee or as an availableforsale financial asset depending on the level of influence retained


         ii joint arrangements

                         associates after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the group from the date that significant influence
                         commences until the date that significant influence ceases


                         the groups share of postacquisition reserves and retained profits less losses is added to the carrying value of the investment
                         in the consolidated statements of financial position these amounts are taken from the latest audited financial statements or
                         management financial statements of the associates


                         when the groups share of postacquisition losses exceeds its interest in an equityaccounted associate the carrying amount of
                         that interest including any long term investments is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except
                         to the extent that the group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the associate


                         when the group ceases to have significant influence over an associate it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in
                         that associate with the resulting gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss any retained interest in the former associate at
                         the date when significant influence is lost is measured at fair value and this amount is regarded as the initial carrying amount of
                         a financial asset


                         when the groups interest in an associate decreases but does not result in loss of significant influence any retained interest
                         is not remeasured any gain or loss arising from the decrease in interest is recognised in profit or loss any gains or losses
                         previously recognised in other comprehensive income are also reclassified proportionately to the profit or loss if that gain or loss
                         would be required to be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets and liabilities


                         unrealised profits arising from transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the groups
                         interests in the associates unrealised losses on such transactions are also eliminated partially unless cost cannot be recovered

                    integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment


                    when significant components of an item of property plant and equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as
                    separate items major components of property plant and equipment


                    the cost of replacing a component of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is
                    probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the group or the company and its cost can be
                    measured reliably the carrying amount of the replaced item of property plant and equipment is derecognised with any corresponding
                    gain or loss recognised in profit or loss accordingly the costs of the daytoday servicing of property plant and equipment are
                    recognised in profit or loss as incurred

         basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property plant and equipment property plant and equipment
         are not depreciated until the assets are ready for their intended use


         buildings are depreciated over their useful lives or over the remaining land lease period whichever is shorter


         leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the group
         will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term

         the depreciable amount is determined after deducting residual value the residual value useful life and depreciation method are
         reviewed at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the amount period and method of depreciation are consistent with
         previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the items of property plant
         and equipment


         an item of property plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its
         use or disposal the difference between the net disposal proceeds if any and the net carrying amount is recognised in the profit or
         loss

               with the accounting policy applicable to that asset the corresponding liability is included in the statements of financial position
               as long term liabilities and other payables


               minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance costs and the reduction of the
               outstanding liability finance costs which represent the difference between the total leasing commitments and the fair value of
               the assets acquired are recognised in the profit or loss and allocated over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic
               rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each accounting period

               at fair value through profit or loss any transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial
               instrument


               purchases or sales under a contract which terms require delivery of financial assets within a timeframe established by regulation
               or convention in the marketplace concerned regular way purchases are recognised on the trade date ie the date that the
               group or the company commits to purchase or sell the financial asset


               fair value adjustments on shareholders loans and advances at initial recognition if any are added to the carrying value of

               derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument and financial assets that are
               specifically designated into this category upon initial recognition


               financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair value with gains or losses
               recognised in the profit or loss the methods used to measure fair value are stated in note 27


               loans and receivables


               loans and receivables category comprises debt instruments that are not quoted in an active market subsequent to initial
               recognition financial assets categorised as loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
               method note 26 v

                    ii financial liabilities


                         initial recognition


                         financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities measured at
                         amortised cost as appropriate the group and the company determine the classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition


                         financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less in the case of loans and borrowings any directly attributable
                         transaction costs


                         the groups and the companys financial liabilities include borrowings trade and other payables and derivative financial
                         instruments


                         subsequent measurement


                         the subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows


                         financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss


                         fair value through profit or loss category comprises financial liabilities that are derivatives financial instrument except for a
                         derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument and financial liabilities that are
                         specifically designated into this category upon initial recognition


                         financial liabilities categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair value with gains or
                         losses recognised in the profit or loss


                         financial liabilities measured at amortised cost


                         subsequent to initial recognition financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method see
                         note 26v


                         gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation
                         process


                    iii derivative financial instruments


                         the group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward rate contracts to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in
                         foreign currency exchange rates


                         derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and
                         are subsequently remeasured at fair value derivatives financial instruments are carried as financial assets when the fair value is
                         positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative


                         any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives financial instruments during the year are recognised in the
                         profit or loss

         iii derivative financial instruments continued


             an embedded derivative is recognised separately from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if and only if it is not
             closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the host contract is not categorised as fair
             value through profit or loss the host contract in the event an embedded derivative is recognised separately is accounted for in
             accordance with the policy applicable to the nature of the host contract


             in general contracts to sell or purchase nonfinancial items to meet expected own use requirements are not accounted for as
             financial instruments however contracts to sell or purchase commodities that can be net settled or which contain written
             options are required to be recognised at fair value with gains and losses recognised in the profit or loss


         iv offsetting of financial instruments


             financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statements of financial position if and
             only if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
             basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously


         v amortised cost of financial instruments


             amortised cost is computed using the effective interest method this method uses effective interest rate that exactly discounts
             estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of
             the financial instrument amortised cost takes into account any transaction costs and any discount or premium on settlement


         vi derecognition of financial instruments


             financial assets


             a financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or the group or the company
             has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full
             without material delay to a third party under a passthrough arrangement without retaining control of the asset or substantially
             all the risks and rewards of the asset


             on derecognition of a financial asset the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received
             including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in
             equity is recognised in the profit or loss


             financial liabilities


             a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged cancelled or expired on derecognition of
             a financial liability the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liabilities extinguished or transferred to another
             party and the consideration paid including any noncash assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in the profit or
             loss

     six        27 fair value measurements


                    fair value of an asset or a liability except for lease transactions is determined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
                    paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the measurement assumes
                    that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market or in the absence of a principal
                    market in the most advantageous market


                    the fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted
                    market bid prices at the close of business at the end of reporting date for financial instruments where there is no active market fair
                    value is determined using valuation techniques such techniques may include using recent arms length market transactions reference
                    to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models
                    where fair value cannot be reliably estimated assets are carried at cost less impairment losses if any


                    for nonfinancial asset the fair value measurement takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits
                    by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and
                    best use


                    when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability the group or the company uses observable market data as far as possible fair
                    values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the input used in the valuation technique as follows
                     level 1  quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identifiable assets or liabilities
                     level 2  inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly
                                  ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices
                     level 3  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable input


                    the group and the company recognise transfer between levels of fair value hierarchy as of the date of the event or change in
                    circumstances that caused the transfers


                28 impairment


                    i   financial assets


                          all financial assets except for financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss and investments in subsidiaries
                          joint ventures and associates are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence of
                          impairment as a result of one or more events having an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset if any such
                          objective evidence exists then the financial assets recoverable amount is estimated losses expected as a result of future
                          events no matter how likely are not recognised


                          an impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables is recognised in profit or loss and is measured as the difference between
                          the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective
                          interest rate the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account


                          if in a subsequent period the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event
                          occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss the impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the assets
                          carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not been recognised at the date
                          the impairment is reversed the amount of the reversal is recognised in profit or loss

           ii other assets


               the carrying amounts of other assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date
               to determine whether there is any indication of impairment the carrying amounts are reviewed more frequently if events or
               changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired as described in the respective assets accounting
               policies


               if any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying
               amount of an asset or the cashgenerating unit to which it belongs exceeds its recoverable amount impairment losses are
               recognised in the profit or loss


               a cashgenerating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows from continuing use that are largely
               independent from other assets and groups an impairment loss recognised in respect of a cashgenerating unit is allocated first
               to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets
               in the unit on a prorata basis


               the recoverable amount is the greater of the assets fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use in assessing value
               in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current
               market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for an asset that does not generate largely
               independent cash inflows the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs


               an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed in the subsequent period in respect of other assets impairment
               losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount an impairment
               loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
               determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised


               reversals of impairment losses are credited to the profit or loss in the year in which the reversals are recognised


     29   inventories


           inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value cost includes raw material costs and production overheads and
           is determined on a weighted average basis


           net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
           estimated costs necessary to make the sale


           cost of stores spares and others consists of the invoiced value from suppliers and import duty charges and is determined on a
           weighted average basis


     210 cash and cash equivalents


           cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and bank balances deposits with licensed financial institutions and highly liquid
           investments which have an insignificant risk of changes in fair value with original maturities of three months or less and are used by
           the group and the company in the management of their short term commitments for the purpose of the statements of cash flows
           cash and cash equivalents are presented net of bank overdrafts and deposits restricted if any

     six        211 provisions


                     a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the group or the company has a present legal or constructive obligation that
                     can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation future
                     operating losses are not provided for provisions are determined by discounting the expected future net cash flows at a pretax rate
                     that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability where discounting is used
                     the accretion in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance cost


                     the amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the net expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the
                     reporting date provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate

     impairment review


     during the year due to the decline in sale prices of products an impairment test was performed on one of the groups methane value chain
     which comprises a plant currently under commissioning and classified as projectsinprogress with a carrying value amounting to rm6893
     million 2015 rm6108 million the recoverable value of this plant was arrived at using valueinuse method determined by discounting
     future cash flows projected to be generated by the plant based on various assumptions while the estimated recoverable value is higher
     than the carrying value of the plant there are inherent uncertainties over the assumptions since the plant is currently at commissioning
     stage


     the assumptions include projected production and sales volume and price which are particularly sensitive uncertain or require significant
     judgment and hence have significant risks which could result in an impairment loss to the carrying amount of the plant within the next
     financial year in particular


     i    a decline of more than 13 of the projected sales volume would trigger an impairment loss and


     ii   a decline of more than 13 of the projected price would trigger an impairment loss

              for management purposes the group has two reportable segments as described below which are the groups strategic business units
              the strategic business units offer different products and services and are managed separately because they require different technology
              and marketing strategies the following summary describes the operations in each of the groups reportable segments

                as basic feedstock for other products to intermediate products including basic and high performance chemicals

              operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements

   most of the groups foreign denominated financial currency financial instruments are in us dollar and since the net exposure is not
   material any reasonable possible change in the exchange rate in us dollar is not expected to have a material impact on the groups profit
   or loss

              price risk


              the group is exposed to price risks that include feedstock and product price risk and basis risk which may affect the value of the groups
              assets liabilities or expected future cash flows price risk is the risk of financial loss due to fluctuation and volatility of feedstock prices
              on purchases and product prices on trades basis risk on the other hand is the risk of financial loss as a result of different pricing term of
              trades


              the group is guided by industry practices and minimises its price risk exposure by proactively and continuously identifying measuring
              monitoring mitigating and reporting price risk within the context of a comprehensive risk management framework

the profit margins the recoverability of the carrying amounts of property plant and equipment of the cash generating units are dependent upon
the recoverable values determined using the net cash flows of the cash generating units of the affected plants this is one of the areas that
our audit focuses on because there are inherent uncertainties and significant management judgment involved in forecasting and discounting
future cash flows of the affected cash generating units to arrive at the recoverable values the inherent uncertainties amongst others include
appropriateness of significant assumptions and discount rates    

in this area our audit procedures included amongst others

 evaluated the impairment test model by comparing it with the requirements of financial reporting standards

 assessed the appropriateness of the discount rates used by comparing these with our expectations based on our knowledge of the industry
  in which the group operates

  of the affected plant and

           of future taxable income the periods over which the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered can be extensive this is one of the areas
           that our audit focuses on because there are inherent uncertainties involved in projecting future taxable income in particular  when the deferred

             subsidiary to determine that these were appropriate and justified by comparing them with internal and external sources and
