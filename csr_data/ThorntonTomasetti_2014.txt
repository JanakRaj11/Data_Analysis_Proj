a message from our chairman
                                                   thornton tomasetti built its reputation both as a structural engineer of iconic buildings
                                                   like yankee stadium and the petronas towers and as a forensic investigator of major
                                                   building failures and collapses

                                                   in recent years many of our projects began pursuing leed certification and we saw a
                                                   rapidly growing interest in green buildings by clients governments and associations
                                                   so in 2012 we added a building sustainability practice joining green building expertise
                                                   to our existing capabilities aligned with our passion to drive innovation in our industry

                                                   we were thinking big but started small for several years the firm had a green team
                                                   tasked with supporting employee interest in sustainability and greening office operations
we aspire to be one of the                       then in 2010 we made a companywide commitment to sustainability when we became
  most sustainable firms in the                    the first firm with a large structural engineering practice to join the american institute
  aec world in the way                            of architects aia 2030 commitment pledging to progress towards climateneutral
  we design our projects and                       buildings founding our building sustainability practice two years later also led to adding
  in how we operate as a                           a corporate sustainability department that helps us practice what we preach while
  responsible business                            reducing business costs inspiring innovation and keeping us on top of industry trends
  in embracing this challenge                     we love challenges and relish the opportunity to make lasting contributions to the aec
  we see an opportunity to lead                    industry and the world in collaboration with our design partners our dreams have been
  by example                                     realized in some of the worlds most iconic buildings we take that same approach
                                                   towards sustainability we aspire to be one of the most sustainable firms in the aec
                                                   world in the way we design our projects and how we operate as a responsible business
                                                   in embracing this challenge we see an opportunity to lead by example in addition to
                                                   leading our field to join the aia 2030 commitment in 2013 we were among the first
                                                   architectural or engineering firms to sign the climate declaration a project launched by
                                                   the nonprofit advocacy organization ceres that brings together businesses large and
                                                   small to support us action on climate change

                                                   our employees are passionately creative technically savvy and care about the
                                                   environment and a good quality of life we started our green champions program page
                                                   8 which recruits volunteers in our offices to help green our operations and seek new
                                                   ways to increase sustainability at thornton tomasetti just a year ago and already we
                                                   have green champions throughout our office locations our commitment to corporate
                                                   sustainability helps us attract and retain the best and the brightest

                                                   the next generation of leaders in this industry want to contribute to a better world
                                                   we look forward to the moment when we no longer talk about sustainability as a goal
                                                   because it has become just the way we work and live

data is gathered from employee surveys expense reports and utility bills comparisons between offices indicate that locations with good public transit systems
have lower carbon footprints the per employee footprint of smaller offices is more sensitive to the behavior of each individual hvac fuels vary greatly in
emission factors an office using steam heating for example will have more emissions from hvac than one using natural gas electricity emissions vary by
region depending on how electricity is generated offices with low emissions may be purchasing recs to offset their electricity consumption
