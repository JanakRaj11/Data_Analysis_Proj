                                                rockline has grown and changed a great
                                                deal since we started our sustainability
                                                program in 2008 what hasnt changed is
                                                our commitment to reducing our
                                                environmental impact

                                                 rockline has always been a company that
                                                 works to do the right thing and focuses on
                                                 continuous improvement  which is really
                                                 what sustainability is all about we
continue to drive improvement in our sustainability metrics we retired our 2015 goals this
year and i am excited to share that we exceeded targets for energy greenhouse gas
emissions solid waste and landill rate and made encouraging progress in transportation
our achievements would not have been possible without the commitment and dedication of
our associates around the world there is still work to be done on our water use we must
continue to look for new and innovative ways to reduce it

transparency is an integral part of our program providing the hard data allows our
stakeholders to see where we hit our goals and where we fell short  knowing that our
work is never done

as we look ahead to 2020 and our next set of targets we know there will be challenges our
intent is to remain fully engaged in identifying opportunities to enhance our sustainable
business practices and to stay focused on the things we can control we will also keep our
eyes on our aspirations and work toward an even more sustainable rockline

we look forward to sharing our progress with you and we appreciate you taking the time
to read this years report as always we welcome your feedback

  our springdale ark facility replaced all production forced air heat systems with 99 efficient ventless
  radiant heaters

  our springdale ark facility added air ducts to utilize exhaust heat from compressors to heat the warehouse




                               energy
  our redditch uk facility is undertaking an energy savings opportunity scheme to help identify
  excessive or unnecessary use of energy within the facility

  our montville nj facility reduced the number of propane forklifts and within the 2015 calendar
  year will be down to one



  solid waste and landill
  our montville nj facility maintained a recycle rate of approximately 99




 propane
  our sheboygan wis facility will begin recycling label backing in 2016
  our montville nj facility averaged 99 days between visits to the landfill
  our booneville ark facility is actively pursuing opportunities for the reuse or recycling of baled
  substrates this will be a continued focus in fiscal 2016




  transportation
  rockline implemented a deconsolidation center in fife wa where 40foot containers are transferred to
  53foot trailers eliminating one container to be drayed inland for every three containers received as a
  result of fifes startup on the west coast and the 2014 opening of the charleston east coast crossdock
  no ocean containers will be coming inland with finished goods

  a redesign of the layout of our liberty warehouse in booneville ark has eliminated 976 forklift miles in

in early fiscal 2015 the environmental sustainability steering committee came together to discuss our next
set of mediumterm goals to guide our work until 2020 our conversation centered on what will make a
meaningful impact on our environmental footprint  and also what makes business sense the committee
determined that we need to continue to build upon our past sustainability performance and renew our goals
in six operational areas that we have control over energy greenhouse gas emissions water solid waste
landfill rate and transportation these renewed goals extend and reinforce rocklines initiative to further
reduce the intensity in these focus areas this direction also aligns with our corporate values of respecting
the environment and investing in continuous improvement rockline is committed to the goals and the
steering committee believes that these targets will continue to drive innovation and transformation enhancing
the way rockline operates across our entire business

addresses some of the challenges rockline is facing and showcases the achievements we have made in our
journey to further our commitment to environmental responsibility

as we retire our 2015 goals there are many victories to celebrate but at the same time we know that our
work toward a sustainable future is never truly inished as we grow we will require more resources and our
focus will be growing with the least possible environmental impact

i want to thank our steering committee for their commitment to rockline sustainability and for their help in
setting the direction for our 2020 goals and i also want to thank our green teams for their dedicated focus
and creativity in inding ways to continuously improve
