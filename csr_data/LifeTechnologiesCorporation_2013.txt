focusing on sustainability isnt just the right thing to doits
smart business this year we named our first chief sustainability
officer cristina amorim who was honored as ethical
corporations 2012 sustainability executive of the year driven
by cristinas leadership our sustainability achievements are
a testament to our employees ingenuity and to our culture of
continuously seeking and delivering a better way to do things
this commitment earned life technologies our first appearance
on the global 100 most sustainable corporations list announced
at the davos 2012 world economic forum

as we continue to shrink our environmental footprint were
focused on creating innovative tools and technologies that shape
discovery and improve life among our 2012 launches was the
ion proton sequencer a revolutionary benchtop instrument
that promises wholegenome sequencing in a day for less than
1000 making sequencing accessible to any lab will accelerate
breakthroughs to help feed fuel and heal the world

with rapidly advancing technology strategic partnerships and
a clear vision for the future we are poised to make an
exponentially greater impact in 2013 and beyond

                                     to ensure progress toward a closedloop system by 2020

                                     in 2012 our sustainability efforts delivered 5 million in

                                     reducing our environmental footprint from 2008 through 2012
                                     we cut energy use by 22 water use by 52 and co2 emissions
                                     by 21 against our 25 target

                                     however owing to growth in demand for specific products and
                                     a oneoff relocation of manufacturing facilities our hazardous
                                     waste increased 47 from 2011 to 2012 despite targeted reduction
                                     efforts we are evaluating mitigation measures for these solvent
                                     wastes to reestablish a downward trend

                                     the people of life technologies who challenge our way of doing
                                     things every single day make our progress toward a closedloop
