message from the president

     enriching lives and helping the environment
     being a publicspirited corporation

     the 21st century has been called the century of the environmentan era when corporations must take
     greater responsibility in answering the publics concerns over global warming pollution and other global
     environmental issues the unitika groups corporate philosophy is to contribute to the public good by
     enabling better living through technology so we have been active in helping create the infrastructure
     needed for greater resource recycling in japan our wide range of environmental preservation initiatives
     includes bringing recycling technology to garbage incinerating and water treatment methods designed to
     reduce environmental impact and providing air water and soil surveys and analysis for environmental
     assessments and preservation
      unitika first started working on environmental issues in 1993 when we created the unitika global
     environment charter and have since used it as the blueprint for subsequent active work on environmental
     issues the charter was followed by the unitika action guidelines created and implemented to concretize
     our environmental management methods and by work on gaining iso 14001 certification throughout the
     group iso 14001 is the international iso standard for environmental management systems we have
     stepped up our certification efforts and now all the major unitika production sites and main group
     companies are certified
      biodegradable materials have recently been gaining attention and were featured at expo 2005 unitika
     has taken the initiative in this area by developing terramac a biodegradable plastic material made of a
     polylactic acid synthesized from corn or other plant resources we have marketed it as a film nonwoven
     fabric fiber and resin terramac is an environmentallyfriendly material with a promising future as a next
     generation polymer with a growing range of applications it can reduce reliance on the earths greatly
     depleted oil resources and helps combat global warming since it doesnt increase atmospheric co2 when
     incinerated
      this fiscal year the unitika group has begun a new mediumterm threeyear management plan called
     new progress 8 np8 np8 is designed to encourage environmentallyaware business models expanding
     business areas such as terramac and our environmental plants it calls for more environmentallyoriented
     management through steps such as an ongoing shift in fuel sources from fuel oil to natural gas this shift is
     already underwaywe started operating gas cogeneration facilities at our uji kyoto plant in october 2004
     and okazaki aichi plant in april 2006 and have scheduled work on another of these facilities at our
     sakoshi hyogo plant next fiscal year these developments are creating steady progress on our goal of
     major reductions in air pollution at group production sites the groups management vision is to be a
     publicspirited corporation that enriches lives and helps the environment and our work on bringing this
     vision to life will continue to include a range of environmentallyoriented corporate activities
      starting this fiscal year the environmental report we put out every year has been reborn as the csr
     report you are now reading which will provide information on a greater range of areas the change reflects
     the increasingly important role that work on the environment and other areas of csr corporate social
     responsibility plays in todays corporations i hope this report will give you a better understanding of the
     groups corporate activities
