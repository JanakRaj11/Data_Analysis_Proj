                                        as projected leoni entered its next growth phase in 2014 albeit not quite so smoothly
                                        we met our targets in terms of sales both our core automotive business and our industrial
                                        business as the second mainstay made gains thanks to which consolidated sales rose
                                        moderately to  41 billion in the past year earnings before interest and taxes ebit were
                                        up 12 percent to  1825 million in 2014 we had originally projected a stronger gain to
                                        more than  200 million but had to adjust our fullyear forecast in october in particular
                                        the ramping up of a major highly complex project at a mexican facility of our wiring
                                        systems division which incurred substantially greaterthanbudgeted initial costs in
                                        the summer months held us back significantly but there was also an adverse effect on
                                        earnings in the wire  cable solutions division due to unexpectedly weak business with
                                        the petrochemical industry
                      dr klaus probst

                                        on the whole however 2014 was a satisfactory year for leoni firstly consolidated
                                        earnings after taxes rose to  1151 million we thus have a solid basis on which to propose
                                        to you an increase in the dividend to  120 per share at the annual general meeting  in
                                        keeping with our policy to pay out about one third of consolidated net income


                                        secondly we bolstered the foundations for our future growth in both divisions even more
                                        in 2014 the wiring systems division increased its global sales of wiring systems and cable
                                        harnesses to customers in the car and commercial vehicle industry at the same time we
                                        launched an aboveaverage large number of new and followon projects which required
                                        heavy preproduction spending and which will provide the full sales and earnings benefit
                                        in the next two years several new contracts we obtained to supply various customers and
                                        vehicle categories additionally underpin our plan for growth alongside followon orders
                                        from our existing customers we also gained further customers for instance from among
                                        the european commercial vehicle and the chinese car industries


                                        in the wire  cable solutions division business involving automotive cables as well as
                                        cables and systems for numerous other strategically important industrial sectors also
                                        grew in 2014 as projected this included sales increases particularly in asia and the amer
                                        icas order receipts which again exceeded the amount of executed business included
                                        numerous significant new orders from the automotive medical technology and robotics
                                        industries among others based on the increasing degree of capacity utilisation and
                                        on our wcs on excellence performance enhancement programme with multifaceted
                                        measures to improve profitability the divisions earnings which already rose strongly in
                                        2014 are expected to continue to significantly outpace the growth in sales in the next
                                        two years as well

                                                                                                shareholders letter       5




both divisions stepped up their commitment overseas during the period under report
with the aim of meeting the mediumterm target of an even split in sales among the three
most important economic regions of europe the americas and asia this objective is also
reflected in our most significant capital investment projects based on the good demand
and order situation we expanded our capacity to produce automotive cables and wiring
systems in both china and mexico in china we also set up a new wiring systems facility
and a plant to manufacture special industrial cables the new plant of the wire  cable
solutions division in india which alongside automotive cables meanwhile also manufac
tures petrochemical plant control cables was also expanded both divisions are planning
additional new facilities and capacity expansion in asia and the americas in 2015


we are investing heavily in germany too in 2014 we started work on enlarging and
updating our wiring systems headquarters in kitzingen to enable us in the future to
provide our staff with a stateoftheart creative work environment an extensive capex
project in the wire  cable solutions division will start in germany in 2015 the factory
of the future at our longestablished facility in roth this involves setting up a modern
facility for developing and manufacturing highquality cables and conductors that meet
the latest standards in terms of technology and factory architecture


the larger amount of business the complex new product startups and the work dedi
cated to our future growth called for significant expansion of our worldwide team at the
end of 2014 leoni employed a total of 67988 people 6397 more than one year earlier

of the entire management board i thank all staff members for their commitment and the

gement board team my colleague dr frank hiller who has been a member of leonis

                      major challenges will have to be mastered in the years ahead as already communicated

                                             corporate governance at leoni
                                             leoni is committed to maintaining responsible and transparent corporate governance the basis of which
                                             consists of statutory rules leoni ags articles of association the rules of procedure for the management
                                             board and supervisory board and the german corporate governance code code we observe these rules
                                             and guidelines in all decisionmaking processes in line with the legal requirements for a german public
                                             company leoni ag has a dual management system that is characterised by the separation of personnel
                                             between the management board as the executive and corporate business management body and the super
                                             visory board as the corporate monitoring body hereinafter we report pursuant to section 310 of the code on
                                             our corporate governance as well as in accordance with article 289a of the german commercial code hgb
                                             on our key corporate governance practices


                                             implementation of the german corporate governance code
                                             in the 2014 financial year leoni ag conformed to all the recommendations and suggestions of the code in its
                                             versions of 13 may 2013 and 24 june 2014 with one exception this concerns the recommendation in section
                                             422 2 sentence 3 whereby the compensation for members of the management board should be guided
                                             by that for senior management and the workforce as a whole also over time given that the overwhelming
                                             majority of leoni staff are employed in noneuropean countries it is the supervisory boards view that this
                                             benchmark for comparison does not provide a suitable guide any demarcation between senior management
                                             and the relevant workforce could furthermore be freely manipulated the supervisory board therefore
                                             deems the legal requirements pursuant to article 87 of the german public companies act on assessment of
                                             management board compensation and the existing practice which considers the trend of wages and salaries
                                             within the company on a regular basis to be sufficient the current declaration of conformity explains this

                       declaration of conformity

                       declaration of the management board and supervisory board of leoni ag pursuant to article 161
                       of the german public companies act aktg on the recommendations of the government commission
                       on the german corporate governance code


                       leoni ag has since issuing its most recent declaration of conformity in december 2013 conformed to the
                       recommendations of the government commission on the german corporate governance code in the version
                       of 13 may 2013 as announced by the federal ministry of justice in the official part of the federal gazette with
                       the following exception and will also in future conform to the recommendations of the code in its version of
                       24 june 2014 with the following exception


                       the supervisory board of leoni ag diligently considers the appropriateness of the compensation for
                       members of the management board based on regularly reviewing the wages and salaries paid within the
                       company however without specifically or in a structured way conforming to the recommendation in section
                       422 2 sentence 3 of the german corporate governance code code the supervisory board is convinced
                       that the existing practice and legal requirements pursuant to article 87 of the german public companies act
                       on assessment of management board compensation based on consideration of the usual compensation is
                       sufficient benchmarks for comparison only make sense when they are realistic provide guidance and
                       leave ample scope for consideration of individual cases in the view of the supervisory board the code
                       recommendation in section 422 2 sentence 3 does not meet these requirements especially in a company
                       like leoni where an overwhelming proportion of staff members are employed in noneuropean countries
                       the supervisory board believes that any demarcation between senior management and the relevant
                       workforce could be freely manipulated and would not result in any more comprehensible standards for
                       comparison the recommendation therefore does not provide an efficient aid to determining management
                       board compensation

 group management report

 leoni increased its consolidated sales by about 5 percent to  41 billion
 and therefore to a new record level in 2014 this growth was based
 on the consistently good demand from the international automotive
 industry and the recovery in other important industrial markets
 both divisions were thus able to expand their business

to step up the globalisation of its business leoni is setting up not only sales offices but increasingly also
additional production facilities in key markets this enables us to offer customers based in these areas local
value creation and a high level of delivery flexibility the focal areas for growth are asia and the americas
  to strengthen our power of innovation we are enhancing and improving our own expertise as well as tech
nologies and our position in innovationdriven growth markets in so doing we are geared primarily to such
global megatrends as the growing demand for new mobility solutions the intention is to further increase              focus on global

sales of new types of products and solutions and thereby to raise the proportion of green technologies               page 52

  leoni rates the systems business and extension of the value chain as key growth drivers that is why we
intend to develop towards being systems suppliers to additional fields of work and to offer more highend
services in such areas as engineering the objective is to further increase the profitable sales in this business
  efficiency constitutes a key success criterion for leonis competitiveness we are raising this by realising
synergies rationalising as well as optimising our business processes and production networks the annual
efficiency gains are to offset increases in staff and material costs

macroeconomic trend

according to the international monetary fund imf the global economy grew at a pace similar to the previ
ous year of 33 percent in 2014 the global economic trend was extremely volatile numerous political crises
and the fact that the economic data of many countries  from various eurozone countries to japan russia and
brazil  fell short of expectations put a damper on the global economy by contrast the relatively strong us
economy and the substantial decline in the oil price in the fourth quarter provided positive stimuli all told
the industrialised countries expanded by 18 percent last year supported mainly by us growth of 24 percent
the eurozone grew by a mere 08 percent and this mainly thanks to the robust performance of germany
the countrys federal office of statistics reported a 15 percent rise in gross domestic product in 2014 based
on provisional figures which benefitted in particular from strong domestic demand
   economic output in the developing and emerging markets rose by a total of 44 percent with china gener
ating an outstanding 74 percent gain by contrast russia and brazil expanded by only 06 percent and
01 percent respectively

by contrast ihs automotive estimates that the output of heavy commercial vehicles in 2014 was at the pre
vious years level slightly fewer trucks and other heavy commercial vehicles were produced in europe south
america and  surprisingly  china whereas output in the rest of asia and particularly in north america rose
  the german electrical engineering and electronics industry increased its output by 25 percent in 2014
according to the german electrical and electronic manufacturers association zvei its sales increased by
30 percent and order receipts were up by 06 percent
  the mechanical engineering sector expanded significantly in the past year the german engineering
federation vdma says that the sectors sales were up by 5 percent worldwide the german mechanical en
gineering companies generated sales growth of about 3 percent and raised their output by roughly 1 percent
which means that the previous record levels dating from 2008 were exceeded
  the global market for information technology and telecommunications also grew considerably in 2014
namely by about 4 percent according to the german association for information technology telecom
munications and new media bitkom this involved stronger growth in the telecommunications segment
than in information technology products and services the chinese market grew especially rapidly in the
united states there was a significant gain and in the eu there was just a moderate one according to bitkom
information technology telecommunications and consumer electronics sales in germany rose by 16 percent
there were considerable differences in performance between segments while business involving it hard
ware and software grew by almost 6 percent in each case sales of consumer electronics telecommunication
services and telecommunication devices declined slightly
  the german medical technology industry generated a 16 percent sales increase in 2014 the spectaris
industry association estimates this puts sales in germany up by 13 percent and international business up by
18 percent



other factors

alongside the macroeconomic and sectorspecific conditions there are a number of other factors that play a
key role with respect to leonis business performance


the prices of commodities especially of copper exert an appreciable influence on our sales we largely pass
on the fluctuations in the copper price to our customers through contractual agreements albeit usually with
a time lag a change in the price of copper will therefore normally result initially in a corresponding effect on     procurement
                                                                                                                       page 83
leonis sales without notable impact on earnings on the reporting dates there may  depending on the price
of copper  be writedowns on inventory or provisions to cover contingent losses on partial quantities of in
ventory the same applies to the raw material of silver which is used primarily in the refining of wire products
  groupwide the trend in energy prices does not have any major impact on leoni
  by contrast personnel costs are a major influencing factor in the countries in which we produce they
are considered in our decisions on choices of location as are reliable legal and political conditions as well as
favourable transport options

further strengthened our position in this important automotive market the new facility  our fifth in the
country  will start delivering wiring systems to a german premium carmaker in china from the end of 2015
we were also able to improve our position in the local automotive industry through the strategically impor
tant first order from a chinese carmaker comprising the supply of transmission wiring our customer base in
the worlds largest automotive market has been expanded to include a major buyer


capacity expansion in the americas in mexico we expanded our capacity for a new largescale project with
a german premium manufacturer with mass production starting in mid2014 it involves wiring systems for
a vehicle model that was simultaneously launched in asia and the americas and is supplied by us in both
regions with the simultaneous start of production on two continents we have completed another important
step towards globalisation in 2015 our production network will be enlarged to include a first wiring systems
facility in paraguay the foundations for this facility were laid at the end of 2014


improved position in the commercial vehicle market the first order from a swedish company enabled us
to expand our customer base in the commercial vehicle segment this means that all major european truck

large number of product startups              as planned we started production for a large number of new and
followon orders during the year under report although the projects already made initial sales contributions
they usually unfold their full impact on sales and above all earnings in the years after the startup phase
among other things 2014 saw the start of production of wiring systems and cable harnesses for several
mainstream and sports car models of various carmakers based in germany and other european countries in
addition the production startup of wiring systems for the premium car of a german manufacturer whose
market launch took place simultaneously in the americas and asia was of particular importance deliveries are                           division strategy and

coming from leoni facilities in china and mexico some rampups also took place in the emobility segment                               page 59

they related to cable harnesses and charging cables for hybrid or electric versions of mostly german main
stream premium and sports cars on top of this there were several product startups for the international
supply industry and for european and us commercial vehicle producers


earnings ebit weighed down by unscheduled startup costs               the rampups of production were mostly
as projected and resulted in the usual expected startup costs however on top of this came unplanned
exceptional expenses in connection with the largescale project with a simultaneous production start in asia
and the americas these expenses were incurred at a facility in mexico which we expanded and changed over
to the complex production and logistical processes involved in customised wiring systems this resulted in
an unexpectedly large requirement for staff high reject rates as well as additional airfreight charges to meet
our delivery commitments during the summer months the countermeasures that were immediately applied
at this facility showed an effect from september onwards and the fourth quarter was once again onbudget
the switch to the new euro 6 standard in the commercial vehicle industry also still had unexpected afteref
fects because of the increased complexity of the corresponding engines which weighed on earnings in 2014
the performance in the fourth quarter was also weighed down by the collapse in the russian rouble and the
weaker russian business all told earnings before interest and taxes in 2014 declined by around 10 percent
year on year to  1046 million

                       in the past financial year leoni benefited from sustained good demand from the international automotive
                       industry and the recovery in other major industrial businesses consolidated sales in 2014 rose by almost
                       5 percent year on year to a new high of  41 billion the amount of business increased in both divisions the
                       wiring systems division grew by more than 3 percent to  24 billion and the wire  cable solutions division
                       by almost 7 percent to  17 billion the sales performance was thus fully in line with the forecast issued at the
                       beginning of the year
                           consolidated ebit earnings before interest and taxes was up by around 12 percent to  1825 million
                       during the period under report the wire  cable solutions division contributed  781 million to this amount
                       and thus almost reached the figure of  80 million or more it announced in early 2014 with lower profit

                       division came to  1046 million and fell well short of the originally projected figure of  120 million or so as
                       high unplanned exceptional expenses on new startups had to be absorbed for this reason the groups ebit
                       target was adjusted from more than  200 million to more than  180 million in october we reached this
                       figure even though additional charges were incurred in the fourth quarter on account of the collapse of the
                       rouble and the economic slump in russia
                           after taxes leoni generated consolidated net income of  1151 million around 9 percent more than in
                       the previous year in line with our policy of paying out around onethird of consolidated net income to share
                       holders we will propose at the annual general meeting to pay out a dividend of  120 per share previous

consolidated sales rise to  41 billion
leoni ags consolidated sales rose by around 5 percent or  1855 million compared with 2013 to
 41034 million in the past financial year and thus reached a new record level this improvement is based on
the sustained good worldwide state of the automotive business and the gradual recovery of the other indus
trial customer industries in europe that are of importance to us leoni generated this increase from its own
resources the scope of consolidation changed only slightly the decline in the average copper price compared
with the previous year reduced consolidated sales by  829 million adjusted for changes in the price of cop

financial situation

finance strategy
the leoni group endeavours to have a permanently solid balanced finance structure the aim is to maintain
an equity ratio of at least 35 percent and gearing ratio of net financial liabilities to equity below 50 percent
so as to lastingly safeguard the companys strong acceptance by the capital market as well as banks and
suppliers we use the capital market to cover our longterm need for finance we obtain shortterm finance
via credit lines from our core banks deutsche bundesbank has rated leoni as an eligible borrower for more
than a decade the rating agencies are not commissioned to issue a rating because this would in our view not
provide any added benefit leoni does not have any financial covenants to fulfil
  planned business growth is normally to be funded via net cash flow furthermore we take care that signifi
cant expansion surges  especially in the case of acquisitions  are backed to an appropriate extent by equity
details on capital management are contained in the notes                                                             notes
                                                                                                                       page 138


financial and liquidity management
the leoni groups financial management is handled centrally by the leoni ag holding company it ascertains
the capital requirement at group level and takes the necessary measures for the entire group of companies in
exceptional cases we have recourse to regional special finance deals the most important objectives of finan
cial management include safeguarding the groups liquidity worldwide optimising finance costs and reve
nue as well as controlling and minimising currency and interest rate risks we use a wide range of instruments
to keep our exposure to individual markets or types of finance as low as possible generally speaking leoni
pursues longterm collaboration with international banks that is based on mutual trust group subsidiaries
are financed mostly in their functional currency the principal financial liabilities in 2014 were denominated in
euros indian rupees russian roubles south korean won and chinese yuan
  among other means the leoni group manages its liquidity via a cash pooling system with pools in the
home countries of the currencies of most importance to the group furthermore leoni ag executes the
majority of the payments for the group
  in order to be able to reliably meet all our financial obligations at any time we use capital market instru
ments such as bonds and borrowers note loans at the corporate level for the whole group and obtain credit
lines in sufficient amounts existing credit lines were extended in 2014 to ensure liquidity on 31 december
2014 there were short and mediumterm credit lines from banks amounting to  5458 million previous year
 4787 million with terms up to 42 months of which  413 million were drawn down at yearend previous
year  138 million
  the offbalance sheet instruments leasing and factoring which we use to improve liquidity are also man
aged at head office factoring in particular is an important addition to the other instruments for shortterm
liquidity management thanks to its flexibility in terms of the sales performance and the associated borrow
ing requirement at the end of 2014 factoring reduced trade receivables by the amount of  1262 million
previous year  1225 million of the other liabilities  213 million previous year  180 million was due
to the receipt of payment on receivables that were sold within factoring agreements details on leasing are

                               interest rate risks on moneyraising measures are hedged with underlying instruments such as swaps and

management training concepts as the young professional development program which we initially ran for
junior staff in eastern europe we furthermore granted scholarships to former apprentices with very good final
results and covered a share of the costs of careerrelated studies and certification courses of our employees


performancerelated compensation leonis incentive compensation program was updated in 2014 as
planned the key aspect of the model for compensating trade and management staff is a variable target
agreement which takes into account both corporate and personal objectives and as a matter of principle
draws on the previous year as a benchmark in addition there is a longterm incentive system for senior
management restructuring of the programme is intended to achieve incentive for more sustainable business
growth on the one hand and a fairer simpler measurement system on the other hand


the top employers institute also provided outside confirmation of leonis appeal as an employer by again

broadening diversity
leoni endeavours to establish a prejudicefree working environment that does not discriminate against
anyone corresponding instructions are contained in the companys own policy documents and in external
declarations on principle which leoni has signed                                                                   sustainability report

furthermore participated in the third leg of the women in management positions project which is intended
to promote the careers of female tradequalified staff and junior managers as well as in the girls days of
schools and universities to provide young women with insight into technical careers
  during the year under report women accounted for 53 percent previous year 54 percent of leonis total
workforce and 28 percent previous year 25 percent of management positions leoni thereby succeeded in
raising the proportion of women in leading positions we also encourage diversity among our partners for
instance in france we are also increasingly working with companies that employ people with disabilities


training and starting a career
leoni employed 166 apprentices at the end of december 2014 previous year 150 and thus more than need
ed inhouse they were learning a vocation at twelve facilities in stateoftheart classrooms and in some cases
dedicated training workshops within the framework of 20 mainstream commercial and trade apprenticeships

                       results of rd work
                       during the year under report leoni again completed various customerspecific development projects took
                       products to the marketability stage and registered proprietary rights the number of submitted patents and
                       utility models rose from 42 to 55 of which 23 stemmed from the wiring systems division previous year 24
                       and 32 from the wire  cable solutions division previous year 18 some of the most significant new devel
                       opments of 2014 are described below many of these innovations also strengthen our position in the green
                       technology segment thanks to weight reduction and the use of environmentally friendly materials


                       saving weight with aluminium in the wiring systems division we took an aluminium busbar that we
                       developed to readiness for production and it is already being used by the first customers these solid round
                       readytoinstall aluminium rods serve the power supply within a vehicle they establish a weight and space
                       saving connection between the battery and the motor the potential of this lightweight metal is tremendous
                       in 2015 our customers in the automotive industry will probably save about 400 tons of material by using
                       leoni aluminium products

                                                                                                                      group management report      91

new high voltage components we extended our range of products for electric and hybrid vehicles with
among other things a newly developed high voltage charging socket that is suited to various types of vehicle
leoni has already obtained initial production run contracts progress was also made in the 48 volt segment
for instance we presented the prototype of a smaller more lightweight highvoltage distributor at first trade
fairs this innovation will probably be ready for mass production from 2016


innovative insulation materials the wire  cable solutions division launched various new insulation mate
rials for automotive cables  for example leoni fluy a copper cable with ultrathin insulation wall thickness
that is currently being trialled in the first test vehicles we furthermore presented halogenfree and thus
especially environmentally friendly compounds which are suited to constant operating temperatures of up to
125 or 150 degrees celsius and are simultaneously especially abrasion proof as well as resistant to dirt and oil


intelligent charging cable with its ievc illuminated electrical vehicle charging cable leoni presented
a concept for an innovative charging cable with a statusindicating illumination function for electric and
hybrid vehicles which is to be developed through to readiness for production in 2015 the ievc displays the
charge status via an integrated illumination unit along the cable it is universally deployable just as robust as
conventional charging cables and especially energy efficient through the use of led technology moreover
the targeted use of biobased materials and recycled copper raises the proportion of sustainable materials in
the charging cable to over 50 percent at the ecartec munich  the leading international fair for the electric
and hybrid mobility trade  our ievc was nominated for the ecartec award in the product conceptvision
category


development partner for medical technology on behalf of a major medical equipment manufacturer
leoni developed various microscope cables for a softwaresupported surgical navigation system this in
volves linking our assembled cables of the navigation module with the various connectable surgical micro
scopes these especially durable robust special cables boast high transfer quality and thus reliably transmit
data energy and power


solutions for specific local requirements to forge ahead with the planned globalisation of the wire  cable
solutions divisions activity we increasingly require products and solutions that meet the specific demands in
the growth markets of importance to us among other products we therefore in 2014 developed technologies
specific to the asian railway industry as well as automotive cable compounds for the chinese and the indian
car market


development projects and collaboration
both of our divisions continued during the year under report to work together with partners on various in
some cases subsidised development projects among other things the wiring systems division participat
ed in the motorized wheel project of various french automotive industry companies which is working on
electrical drive systems that are integrated in the wheel another joint project involved the development of
new processes for bonding aluminium conductors the highteg project involving several universities and
research institutions with the aim of producing thermoelectric generators with which the waste heat in cars
can be used to generate electrical power was successfully completed

                       a significant objective that the wire  cable solutions division pursued in 2014 is the development of new
                       kinds of flame retardants based on nanotechnology which were tested as part of an eusubsidised project
                       here we are collaborating with the école nationale supérieure de chimie de lille furthermore a plan to trial
                       new conductor materials based on nonmetallic substances is of strategic importance to achieve this we
                       maintain close contact with wellknown international institutions other partners for various joint research
                       projects are for example the fraunhofer institute friedrichalexander university in erlangen nuremberg and
                       technische hochschule nürnberg technical university of nuremberg some knowhow was also acquired
                       with outside institutions and development partners in the context of this collaboration but generally to an
                       insignificant extent only
                         to exchange ideas on the latest technological trends with other companies and the scientific community
                       we are also members of various initiatives like the polyking plastics technology network of the university
                       of würzburgschweinfurt the automotive cluster of bayern innovativ the bavarian centre for technology
                       transfer and the enova strategy board for electric mobility we were also again development partners of
                       two teams participating in the formula student universities design competition

in 2014 leoni voluntarily committed itself to reporting pursuant to the us doddfrank wall street and
consumer protection act on the extent to which our products contain conflict minerals which stem from the
mines or smelting works of certain african countries we thereby facilitate the traceability of these substances
as well as the transparency of our supply chain and support our customers in fulfilling their corresponding re
quirements leoni does not knowingly procure any materials that contain such minerals in the future we will
also expect of our suppliers that they provide us only with components containing raw materials stemming
from responsibly managed sources
  leoni commits itself to various social projects and institutions with donations and sponsorship our spon
sorship concept provides for most of this support for social activity to be committed at the various locations
to a lesser extent there are in addition contributions to culture education and science as well as sport the
regional focus in 2014 was on tunisia where with our annual donation we modernised as well as extended
a primary school and supported an organisation that cares for autistic people in germany leoni supported
among other things childrens nurseries schools and facilities for disabled people as well as refugee reception
centres

related accidents and illnesses at work as well as to reduce environmental impact the collaboration between
our two divisions was stepped up during the year under report on this basis and especially in the area of
environmental protection
  in 2014 numerous plants and branch offices were again subjected to internal and external audits that test
and document our she standards the wiring systems division successfully passed the third matrix sampling
test as part of multisite certification to the international iso 14001 environmental protection standard which
currently covers a total of 22 facilities the sites audited were in brazil germany romania and tunisia in
addition five facilities passed repeat audit to the ohsas 18001 occupational health and safety standard we
also conducted internal she audits in ten organisational units in brazil germany morocco mexico and serbia
further plants were prepared for initial certification in 2015
  in the wire  cable solutions division the facility in stolberg germany was certified for the first time to
both ohsas 18001 and iso 50001 our facility in roth also fulfilled this energy management standard for the
first time in addition there was initial certification of a facility of the slovakian subsidiary to iso 14001 half of
all legal wcs entities are thus certified to this environmental standard while seven are also emas validated


she activity


safety to further enhance safety at work eight facilities in the wire  cable solutions division carried out a
selfassessment with respect to occupational health and safety in 2014 the methodology for assessing haz
ards was also improved the wiring systems division prepared a very extensive safety standard for its goods
in and out areas as well as storage as a matter of principle we aim for a zero accident rate our in any case
very low rate of accidents at work was again slightly improved

the responsibility for indentifying assessing and dealing with risk always remains with the respective owner
dealing with risk is prioritised by the maximum possible loss insurance solutions so far as they are commer
cially viable play a large part in this respect as soon as a riskminimising measure has been implemented the
potential maximum loss is reduced by this factor


risk monitoring and reporting via the risk reporting system an assessment of the risk situation is made per
quarter and discussed with the management board the change in the valueatrisk for the budget year serves
as the overall indicator this information and the twelve most significant top 12 risks are presented to the
management board and the supervisory board on an annual basis in the risk management of the divisions
risk reporting is carried out with the help of a risk reporting sheet at least quarterly at the business group lev
el the focus here is on the top 10 risks per division and the top 12 risks at group level the risks reported in
the divisions using the risk reporting sheet are verified by the risk management of the divisions and entered
on a central risk database on a quarterly basis as well as updated with any risk reduction that has taken place
as a result of initiated countermeasures


the management board receives a quarterly risk report with the following content
   top risks per division and for the leoni group
   risk status and trend relative to riskbearing capacity
   current risks with a potential maximum loss of more than  500000
   compliance status of the leoni group
   status of the leoni groups internal control system


the quarterly risk report for the respective fourth quarter is replaced by the report on risk aggregation and
the findings of the risk workshops the risk aggregation takes place immediately after the workshops and is
reported to the management board and to the supervisory board in addition to the ongoing reporting there
is also the option of adhoc risk reporting

managers exchange information under the chairmanship of the corporate risk officer with the management
board the agenda items include process improvement and ensuring the effectiveness of the risk manage
ment system the effectiveness of the risk management system is assessed once a year by the audit commit
tee and the auditors as well as every three years by the internal audit department and outside experts


in 2014 we successfully subjected the risk management system of leoni ag to an external audit of its fun
damental suitability as well as effectiveness and boosted our risk workshops with the addition of outside risk
management experts some of the resulting recommendations for action have already been implemented
we plan to implement the remaining recommendations in 2015 we also launched a project to implement grc

                        internal control system

                        the task of leoni ags internal control system is to document the groupwide controls pertaining the princi
                        pal process risks to fulfil the legal obligations stemming from the 8th eu directive and their implementation
                        in the german act on the modernisation of accounting law bilmog as well as to identify weaknesses in the
                        control system
                          the operational and organisational structure of the internal control system is at leoni divided into four
                        local control levels corporate departments divisions business groupsunits and local companies and a
                        corporate documentation level which is integrated in the risk management system the locally executed
                        manual and itsupported controls are documented in risk management at the corporate level as part of a
                        control selfassessment csa process our control processes are not limited to just accountingrelated risks
                        but also encompass operating and compliance controls the corporate internal control committee which is
                        composed of the persons responsible for control at the respective head offices and the control level manag

process improvement the audit committee examines the internal control systems effectiveness once a
year this may involve the auditors presenting weaknesses in the internal control systems found during the
annual audit furthermore the internal audit department checks on a random basis whether the internal
controls at the four business levels are being carried out recommendations for action that arose from the
external audit carried out in 2012 on implementation of the legal requirements to have an operational and
accountingrelated control system that is fit for purpose were in their key points implemented

presentation of the principal risks and opportunities

the risks to and opportunities for the leoni group are broken down by the classes of strategic risksoppor
tunities and market risksopportunities operational risksopportunities financial risksopportunities and
compliance risksopportunities the principal risks top 12 and opportunities are presented below


strategic risks and market risks
we encounter strategic risks and market risks mainly in the areas of

   price pressure  fluctuation
   procurement market risks
   threat to market position and competitive advantages
   market trends  fluctuation in sales
   location  country risks
   market appeal
   competitive forces
   strategy  organisation  core skills


the four principal risks are


economic slump customers in the automotive industry and among its suppliers account for about 75 percent
of leonis consolidated sales the current business performance of this sector therefore has great influence
on leonis business volume and earnings leoni has accordingly prepared for any cyclical slump in sales by
making its cost structure even more flexible


pressure to cut prices leoni supplies its products to markets that are characterised by fierce competition
the trend prevailing in the automotive industry towards sharing development costs with suppliers also
continues to affect leoni we confront the unabatedly heavy pressure on prices in the automotive industry
with effective stringent cost management in all areas of our company setting up more production facilities in
lowwage countries and resolutely optimising purchasing prices


copper price fluctuation leoni uses copper in all of its business segments the global market price of this
raw material which is subject to substantial fluctuation therefore exerts a major influence on the cost of ma
terials in the group if the price of copper rises for a protracted period of time the lag in passing this cost on
to our customers can exert an adverse earnings effect on the reporting date any substantial drop in demand
could if there is a simultaneous dip in the price of copper lead to us having to sell at lower prices some of our
copper inventory bought forward at higher prices this would likewise exert an adverse effect on earnings if
the price has fallen sharply up to the reporting date copper inventories may be exposed to the risk of devalua
tion a shortage of copper stocks could lead to supply bottlenecks and higher copper prices leoni prefers
longterm and direct supply relationships with copper suppliers to avoid supply bottlenecks

                        fluctuation in the cost of materials contact systems which consist of plastic casings and metal contacts
                        are made mostly with tools stemming from a single source due either to customer requirements or economic
                        considerations rising demand could lead to increases in the costs of our most important raw materials this
                        can result in demands for higher prices and therefore in increased procurement costs for the corresponding
                        components and can furthermore cause supply bottlenecks in the event of shortages international competi
                        tion among our suppliers has hitherto enabled us to largely avoid any increases in the cost of materials


                        strategic opportunities and market opportunities


                        globalisation innovation systems business and cost leadership thanks to its strategic alignment the
                        leoni group has the opportunity to benefit more substantially and more quickly from outside developments
                        ie to expand its market position on a longterm basis and to raise its profitability the primary approaches to
                        this involve the four levers of our strategy by further globalising its operations leoni can better exploit the
                        opportunities in the americas as well as asia and increasingly internationalise its industrial business which
                        is still quite european in nature enhancing the power of innovation provides the opportunity to improve
                        our market position on the one hand with new products and solutions and on the other hand by ongoing
                        optimisation of our processes the systems business lever harbours potential in terms of gearing our range of
                        manufacture even more closely to customer requirements raising the efficiency of our production structures
                        and process entails the opportunity to achieve additional cost benefit and thereby to increase profitability


                        the economic cycle generally speaking leoni has the opportunity to generate more sales than expected in
                        the markets it targets by outperforming the overall market and correspondingly rising demand this applies
                        especially to the americas and asia should for example the automotive markets in these countries grow
                        more strongly leoni could benefit via both direct shipments to these regions and indirectly by supplying
                        product for cars exported from europe


                        commodity prices a more favourable trend in commodity prices would benefit leonis costofmaterials ratio
                        and therefore its margins


                        electromobility green technology and alternative energy generation new trends in technology and so
                        ciety also present leoni with growth opportunities  for instance the growing interest in hybrid and electric
                        drive systems as well as electrical and electronic innovations in vehicles green technology and energy saving
                        are also playing an ever larger role in virtually all of the other sectors of importance to leoni in china and
                        india for example we see mounting potential for alternative energy generation using solar and wind power
                        plant as well as for railway engineering in general the key global trends  of mobility urbanisation environ
                        mental awareness and shortage of resources demographic change globalisation as well as industrialisation
                        and automation  present leoni with additional expansion opportunities in many areas

                                                                                                                    group management report         105

operational risks
we face operational risks mainly in the areas of
   production
   purchasing  logistics
   human resources
   project management
   research  development
   distribution
   information management


the six principal risks are


break in the supply chain to our customers the leoni group had a total of 82 facilities in 31 countries in
2014 policy on choice of location is geared closely to the requirements of our customers which leoni follows
into foreign markets the constant pressure on prices and costs compels us towards disproportionately large
increases in production capacity located in lowwage countries this means that customers in many instances
have to be supplied across several national boundaries there are also political risks in some countries for
example in north africa and the ukraine difficult political situations could at any time result in unrest and
also strikes at our production facilities in those locations or in closed seaports and airports the option of
temporary supply from production facilities in other nonaffected countries is severely limited because of the
customised products in the wiring systems division justintime delivery and the singlesource principle of
some customers extend the reach of this risk further relocation is possible only with a corresponding lead
time necessitated by setting up the required production capacity and recruitment that is why we offer our
customers the option of supply from two facilities in different countries in many cases however our custom
ers have decided for economic reasons to continue to share the risk of 100 percent supply from one country
a break in the supply chain to our customers due for example to unrest cybercrime or natural disasters could
result in a supply bottleneck persisting several weeks owing to the size it has attained leoni operates a con
siderable number of production facilities worldwide which have backup capacity as is prudent and accepted
by the carmakers furthermore preventive measures have been applied at all production facilities and are
documented in a global emergency plan these range from a roundtheclock guard service to extensive fire
protection systems furthermore no leoni facility is located in an area known to be under serious threat of
earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters


startup and project costs we successfully started making a large number of new product startups in the
2014 financial year however the simultaneous production start in asia and the americas of wiring systems for
a german premium car model resulted in an unexpectedly heavy demand for staff high reject rates and addi
tional airfreight costs which squeezed earnings in the third quarter expansion of our production capacity for

                        our customers new model ranges is now progressing according to plan again should we fail to ensure that
                        production starts on schedule and according to the requirements of our customers this could have serious
                        consequences for future business and incur heavy exceptional costs to minimise this risk we enhanced our
                        project management for such large projects by setting it up as a separate organisational unit within the wir
                        ing systems division ongoing monitoring ensures that startup risks are identified and that countermeasures
                        can be applied


                        information management running a company like leoni that operates on a global scale is only possible
                        with the help of sophisticated it systems constant readiness to supply goods and services  especially to the
                        automotive industry that frequently calls for either justintime or justinsequence delivery  also depends
                        on the it systems and their data being available at all times serious disruption such as system outages
                        attacks on our networks loss or corrupting of data could threaten leonis ability to supply temporarily
                        stop customers production and hence result in having to face farreaching claims for compensation leoni
                        therefore constantly works at optimising its it systems in terms of both concept and operation one example
                        of this is having a second backup computer centre as an emergency system an information security and data
                        protection officer who reports directly to the management board demonstrates the very high priority given
                        to security of our information systems and networks as well as to safeguarding the confidentiality availability
                        and dependability of our data


                        product liability  recall leonis output is used primarily for technically sophisticated products and equip
                        ment with high safety standards a failure could have farreaching consequences ranging from downtime
                        costs to contractual penalties and through to personal injury claims we minimise the associated product
                        liability risks by taking effective measures as part of process safety and quality management all plants are
                        iso 9001 certified and some depending on the customer group they supply have additional isots 16949
                        automotive industry en 9100 aerospace or iso 13485 medical technology certification some plants also
                        have an environmental management system certified to iso 14001 there is also insurance cover for operat
                        ing product and environmental liability as well as for product recalls product liability cases and recalls are

is likely to continue in 2015 according to ihs automotive estimates the automotive industry will again
increase its output this year namely by 3 percent or so to more than 90 million passenger cars and light com
mercial vehicles from todays perspective there will be increases in both the americas and asia as well as in
the emea region
   the commercial vehicle industry likewise projects growth ihs automotive says that just over 2 percent
more heavy commercial vehicles will be manufactured in 2015 than in the previous year with rises in europe
and the americas offsetting a slight decrease in asia especially so in china

                        business performance and future direction

                        the leoni groups business performance
                        on the whole our business performed in line with expectations in the first few weeks of this year for fiscal
                        2015 as a whole the management board of leoni ag projects an increase in consolidated sales to about
                         43 billion to which both divisions will contribute business will probably grow more so in the americas and
                        asiapacific but also in the emea region
                          growth in consolidated ebit is again expected to outpace that in sales with a rise to more than  200
                        million in 2015 which would equate to an improvement in the ebit margin to 47 percent this is based on the
                        larger amount of business and efficiency gains in both divisions
                          this forecast is based on the following assumptions the most significant customer groups above all the
                        automotive industry will on the whole perform well according to the statements of the sector associations
                        we expect the price of copper to remain steady we budgeted for increases in personnel costs that differ by
                        particular country based on our experience in the individual regions
                          the target set as part of our mediumterm planning is unchanged we expect a moderate uptrend this year
                        to be followed in 2016 by another growth surge with consolidated sales then rising to  5 billion and the ebit
                        margin widening to 7 percent from todays perspective we will benefit on the one hand from the new prod
                        ucts that the wiring systems division began making in 2014 and 2015 which will then generate considerable
                        contributions to sales and earnings on the other hand the wire  cable solutions division will continue to
                        expand in tandem with the automotive industry as well as the other industrial sectors of strategic importance
                        and improve its profitability thanks to the strategic initiatives it has launched
                          there will be no fundamental change to leonis business policy in the next two years the same applies to
                        our dividend policy which continues to provide for a payout of about one third of annual net income

                                                                                                                      group management report      115

performance of the wiring systems division
in the wiring systems division external sales are forecast to increase slightly to approx  245 billion in 2015
previous year  24 billion with earnings before interest and taxes rising to more than  115 million previ
ous year  1046 million numerous new and followon projects which will not contribute fully to sales and
earnings before 2016 will again be ramped up this year major exceptional expenses which weighed on fiscal
2014 ebit are from todays perspective unlikely in 2015
  at the beginning of january the wiring systems division obtained its first order for wiring systems from the
south korean carmaker hyundai from 2016 we will be supplying product for a midmarket car of currently
the worlds fourthlargest automobile maker which will be manufactured in eastern europe this will boost
our international business and further strengthen our global market position
  capacity will be enlarged in all of the production regions of importance to us and our production network
will be constantly optimised to master the orders already on the books in 2015 we plan to commission our
first plant in paraguay which will manufacture cable harnesses and wiring systems for the car and commercial
vehicle industry
  we also intend to further enlarge our range of products and services in the segments involving electrome
chanical components as well as weightsaving solutions for example through increasing use of aluminium
to bolster our position as a systems partner to the international motor vehicle industry


performance of the wire  cable solutions division
the external sales of the wire  cable solutions division will probably rise to about  185 billion in 2015
previous year  17 billion with earnings before interest and taxes rising to more than  85 million previous
year  781 million all business groups are expected to underpin the sales growth especially so our core
automotive cables business as well as the businesses comprising cables and services for industrial applications
and medical technology
  in regional terms the growth will from todays perspective occur mainly in asia and the americas while
sales in the emea countries will on the whole remain more or less steady the proportions of sales account
ed for by asiapacific and the americas are in the process likely to rise to about 23 percent and 22 percent
respectively two new automotive cable plants one in mexico and one in china which are to start operating
this year will underpin the increases budgeted for these regions for which more capital investment is also
planned we are furthermore and in the context of the strategic lever of globalisation looking into broaden
ing our involvement to other countries a largerscale capital investment project is also pending in germany
in roth we are starting the preparatory work for building the factory of the future a modern facility for de
veloping and manufacturing highquality cables and conductors that will meet the latest standards in terms
of technology and factory architecture
  we intend likewise to enhance our systems expertise and are therefore for example broadening our range
of products and services with solutions for electromobility the railway industry and medical technology
  in terms of earnings the wcs division will benefit from the increased degree of capacity utilisation and the
growing proportion of complex products in addition there will be efficiency enhancements stemming from
such strategy projects on operational excellence and business process harmonisation as the divisionwide
standardised it system preparations for rollout of which in 2015 are underway at several facilities the wcs
on excellence performance programme which aims to generate additional earning potential in the areas of
sales purchasing organisation and production is likely to yield initial benefits

                        capital expenditure
                        the leoni group intends to increase its spending on property plant and equipment as well as intangible
                        assets to about  240 million in 2015 of this total about 30 percent will probably be spent in germany a
                        quarter or more in eastern europe approximately 17 percent in asia 10 percent in each of north africa and
                        the americas with the remainder 8 percent spread among other european countries
                          the wiring systems division will increase its capital expenditure to about  150 million and will expand its
                        capacity worldwide because of the good order situation plant extension work is pending particularly in china
                        central america north africa and eastern europe in addition a new facility will be set up in paraguay further
                        extension and rebuilding of the divisions headquarter in kitzingen is also planned
                          in the wire  cable solutions division capex is budgeted to rise to about  80 million in 2015 and to go
                        towards worldwide expansion of capacity the focus is on business group automotive cables which will build
                        two new plants one in china and the other in mexico and will also expand its capacity to produce automotive
                        cables at other locations around the globe
                          the holding company will from todays perspective invest about  10 million most of which accounted for
                        it projects


                        financial and asset situation
                        leonis financial and asset situation will again present a solid picture in 2015 given the existing longterm
                        finance the extensive credit lines and the expected net income our liquidity is assured on a lasting basis the
                        maturing financial liabilities will be refinanced on schedule we may take advantage of the currently favoura
                        ble market setting for further measures
                          due to the larger amount of cash provided by operating activities cash flow is likely to reach a roughly neu
                        tral level this year despite the once again larger amount budgeted for capital expenditure based primarily on
                        the higher ebit we estimate an improvement in the roce to approximately 14 percent while we expect net
                        financial liabilities to rise to approx  360 million equity is again likely to increase thanks to the expected net
                        income meaning that the equity ratio will from todays perspective rise slightly to more than 35 percent


                        procurement
                        purchased raw materials and components will again be of major significance to leoni in 2015 the wcs
                        division will therefore in the context of its wcs on excellence performance project further improve and
                        globalise its procurement activity and organisation in the wiring systems division the global activity that has
                        been started will be continued and in particular local expertise in asia and the americas will be enhanced


                        employees
                        the number of employees in the leoni group will probably increase moderately this year the wiring systems
                        division will enlarge its workforce especially at new facilities and those expanded for project startups in asia
                        the americas and eastern europe while it will reduce the numbers at other plants as a result of productivity
                        progress the wcs division will recruit new staff above all in the growth markets of china and india as well as
                        to a lesser extent in mexico and various european countries also including germany

                                                                                                                           group management report      117

                                                                                                                           forecast




research  development
our rd work will continue at a high level in 2015 there will not be any significant change in the focal areas
of our development work in the wire  cable solutions division we will focus among other areas on halo
genfree cables for automotive applications data cables for high transfer rates and compounds for specific
local market requirements in growth regions we furthermore intend to broaden our systems expertise
especially so in the medical technology sector the wiring systems division will increasingly globalise its rd
activity and likewise enhance its systems expertise in the areas among others of components and wiring
system architecture


sustainability
we will extend our sustainability management in 2015 because of the increasing importance of corporate
responsibility also for our customers among other things the wiring systems division plans to include
more facilities in occupational safety and environmental certification to raise energy efficiency and to build
improved regional she structures the wcs division intends to apply the kaizen methods proven in
other areas to improvement measures with respect to occupational health and safety there are also plans to
broaden ergonomic workshift times and models the holding companys agenda includes optimisation with
respect to first aid as well as fire protection in mid 2015 leoni will furthermore release its third un global
compact communication on progress and thereby provide information on its latest developments in the area
of sustainability


general statement on future growth
the management board is confident about leoni ags future performance given the favourable order situa
tion in both divisions as well as the ongoing measures towards globalisation and efficiency enhancement we
are well equipped for the planned ongoing earningsoriented growth for 2015 we project a moderate sales
gain to approximately  43 billion and an earnings increase to more than  200 million due to the numer
ous new projects pending in the wiring systems division and the further globalisation we will once again
substantially increase our capital investment in 2015 the financial basis for doing so is still solid gearing
financial liabilities divided by equity should remain well below the upper limit of 50 percent that we have set
   we still anticipate a significant upsurge in sales to  5 billion in 2016 which together with major efficiency
gains will also lead to a strong earnings increase and to a 7 percent ebit margin

                        the granted benefits table presents in the compensation for management board members pursuant to
                        gcgc which benefits the members would have been granted for 100 percent target fulfilment and which
                        absolute upper and lower limits would have applied for the individual compensation components this total
                        compensation gcgc would have corresponded to an amount of  7703 k in fiscal 2014 previous year
                         6388 k the increase was due primarily to the appointment of a fourth management board member
                        effective 1 april 2014 and higher performancerelated compensation as this involves budgeted figures that
                        would only have been matched in the event of 100 percent target fulfilment these budgeted figures must be
                        reconciled with the business performance that actually occurred and conditions precedent a distinction must
                        be made here between reconciliation of the compensation pursuant to gcgc with ifrs and with article 314
                        of the german commercial code hgb any corresponding adjustment amounts versus the budgeted figures
                        pertaining to all variable compensation components are reported in these reconciliations this then results in
                        the actually granted benefits pursuant to ifrs or article 314 hgb
                           the compensation pursuant to ifrs in the financial year amounts to  6856 k previous year  5804 k and
                        pursuant to article 314 hgb consequently to  7280 k previous year  4435 k the increase is attributable
                        to the fourth management board member on the one hand and in the hgbbased expense to payout of the
                        mediumterm component which was already fulfilled for dr probst mr bellé and dr brand at the end of 2014

                        from the individual compensation components in total the management board members received  7275
                        k for the 2014 financial year previous year  5295 k as explained above the increase is attributable to the
                        fourth management board member and payment of the mediumterm component to dr probst mr bellé and

                        the shortterm compensation component refers to the respectively completed financial year whereas the
                        mediumterm compensation component takes account of a threeyear period and is geared to sustainability
                        the weighting between the short and mediumterm components is 5050 and will as opposed to the existing
                        system be raised towards the mediumterm component and thus to sustainability

                        erate an ebit margin of less than 35 percent the discount on the assessed annual bonus will be 30 percent

                        is at least 50 percent otherwise the multiyear bonus is forfeited in full the multiyear bonus thus conforms
                        to the sustainability requirement set out in both the vorstag and the code the multiyear bonus will be paid
                        in the fourth year while 50 percent of the annual amount will be paid in the respective subsequent year as an

                        from the existing system and has an upper limit for each member of the management board in each year of

                        principles of consolidation
                        the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of leoni ag and of all subsidiaries that are either
                        directly or indirectly controlled by leoni ag the group controls an investee when it is exposed or has rights

to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the investee in particular the group controls an investee if and only if it has all the following
elements

   power over the investee ie the group has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activi
     ties the activities that significantly affect the investees returns
   exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
   the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investors returns


if facts or circumstances indicate that one or several of the three elements of control have changed the group
must reassess whether it controls an investee
     subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the time of acquisition ie from the time when the group has
acquired control over the subsidiary inclusion in the consolidated financial statements ends as soon as leoni
no longer has control a change in the ownership share of a subsidiary is without loss of control accounted
for as an equity transaction losses are allocated to the noncontrolling interests even when this results in a
negative balance
     the financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared using uniform accounting policies on the same
balance sheet date as the financial statements of the parent company all intercompany balances income
expenses as well as unrealised profits losses and dividends from intercompany transactions are eliminated in
full
     all business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method based on applying the require
ments of ifrs 3 the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred
measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree for
each business combination the acquirer measures the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree either at fair
value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets
     acquisitionrelated costs are expensed
     any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the ac
quisition date subsequent changes in the fair value of a contingent consideration which is deemed to be an
asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with ias 39 either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive
income if the contingent consideration is classified as equity it should not be remeasured until it is finally
settled within equity
     if the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisition date fair value of the acquirers previously
held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss
     goodwill arises and is upon initial consolidation measured at cost if the consideration transferred and the
amount recognised for noncontrolling interest exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed if this transferred consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the
subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised in profit or loss after goodwill is first accounted for it is
tested for impairment according to ias 36 at least once a year which may lead to an impairment loss impair

                        shares in associated companies and joint ventures
                        it is an associated business when leoni can exert significant influence over its operating and financial policies
                        but does not control or jointly control the decisionmaking processes this is in principle the case when be
                        tween 20 and 50 percent of the voting rights are held
                          a joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have
                        rights to the net assets of the joint venture joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an
                        arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of
                        the parties sharing control the considerations to determine significant influence or joint control are compara
                        ble with those to determine control of subsidiaries
                          shares in associated companies and in joint venture companies are accounted for under the equity method
                        the shares are valued with their purchase price on the acquisition date which is increased or reduced respec
                        tively in the subsequent periods for any changes in net assets of the company such as the proportionate share
                        of net income or loss and by received dividends the proportionate net income or loss is determined using
                        the accounting policies described in this note in line with the treatment of fully consolidated subsidiaries the
                        goodwill included in the carrying amount of companies accounted for under the equity method is no longer
                        amortised either instead of a test for impairment of equity method goodwill the whole investment accounted
                        for under the equity method is reviewed for impairment according to ias 36 provided there are indications
                        according to ias 39 of additional impairment loss the group determines on each balance sheet date whether
                        there are objectively discernible indications that the investment in an associated company or joint venture
                        might be impaired if this is the case the difference between the fair value of the investment and the carrying
                        amount is expensed as an impairment loss
                          the financial statements of the associates and of the joint ventures are prepared using uniform accounting
                        policies on the same balance sheet date as the financial statements of the parent company

                        the functional currency of the individual subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment
                        in which the company operates the financial statements prepared in the respective functional currency of
                        the subsidiary are translated using the closing rate method ie the assets and liabilities are translated from
                        the functional currency to the presentation currency at the closing exchange rate on the balance sheet date
                        while the statements of income are translated using annual average exchange rates arithmetic average of
                        the monthly average exchange rates any differences arising from the translation of assets and liabilities

a foreign currency transaction ie a transaction entered into by a consolidated company in a currency other
than its functional currency is recorded on initial recognition in the functional currency by applying to the
foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency
at the date of the transaction in the subsequent periods monetary assets and liabilities are revalued using
the closing rate at each balance sheet date the resulting currency differences are recorded in the income
statement nonmonetary items are still carried at the transaction rate or if they are measured at fair value
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined
exchange gains or losses that arise from measurement of monetary principally intragroup items are allocated
to operating income ebit to the extent that they involve exchange gains or losses directly related to an
operating transaction

revenue recognition
revenues are generated mainly from the sale of products pursuant to ias 18 sales revenues are generally rec
ognised net of value added tax vat upon delivery of products to the customer or upon fulfilment of service
contracts delivery has occurred when the risks and rewards associated with ownership have been transferred
to the buyer provisions for customer rebates and discounts as well as for returns and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related sales are recognised fulfilment of service contracts occurs when
substantially all performance obligations have been met in the case of longterm development contracts
revenues are recognised according to the stage of completion provided that the contracts meet the condi
tions for applying the percentageofcompletion method pursuant to ias 11 this applies to the development
contracts described below
  interest income is recognised as interest accrues by using the effective interest rate method this means that
the interest income recognised is the amount produced by using the effective interest rate this is the rate
that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial instrument to the
net carrying amount of the financial asset
  dividend income is recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment is established


research and development costs
research costs are expensed as incurred
  development costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to customerspecific development contracts
accounted for pursuant to ias 11 or they meet the criteria of ias 38 for capitalisation as an intangible asset
pursuant to ias 11 for customerspecific development contracts that meet the corresponding conditions the
percentageofcompletion method is applied the capitalised amount where payment is expected after more
than one year is disclosed under trade receivables from longterm development contracts the current pro
portion is contained in trade receivables the percentage of completion is determined according to the ratio
of total costs to costs incurred costtocost method the income from development contracts is reported
under sales in the income statement


government grants
a government grant is recognised when there is sufficient assurance that the grant will be received and
that the enterprise will comply with the conditions attaching to it expenserelated grants are recognised as
income on a systematic basis over the periods necessary to match them with the associated costs grants for
an asset are deducted from the cost of the asset

leases
leases are classified as either finance or operating leasing transactions whereby leoni is the lessee and bears
all substantial risks and rewards typical of ownership from use of the leased asset are accounted for as finance
leases accordingly the lessee capitalises the leased asset and records the corresponding lease obligation
on the balance sheet at the fair value of the leased property or if lower at the present value of the minimum
lease payments the leased asset is depreciated over its economic life if there is no reasonable certainty at the
beginning of the lease that the group will obtain ownership the leased asset is depreciated in full over the
shorter of the two periods of the expected useful life and the term of the lease lease payments are appor
tioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability finance charges are recognised in the income statement all
other leasing agreements entered into by leoni as a lessee are accounted for as operating leases the lease
payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the lease term

assumes that the development expenses can with a sufficient degree of likelihood be covered with future
inflow of cash and cash equivalents and the other ias 3857 criteria are met
  intangible assets acquired separately are upon initial recognition valued at cost the costs of intangible
assets acquired as part of business combinations equal their fair values as at the date of acquisition in the
subsequent periods intangible assets are carried at their cost less any accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses measurement in the subsequent periods should differentiate between intan

impairment testing of intangible assets with a finite life and of property plant and equipment
an assessment is made at each balance sheet date whether there are any indications that an impairment loss

see comments on goodwill above
   if specific cash flows generated largely independently from other assets or groups of assets cannot be
allocated to the individual assets they are tested for impairment based on the smallest overriding cashgen

   if the reasons for applying the impairment charge have disappeared the writedown on the asset is re
versed such reversal is limited to the amount that would have resulted when taking amortisation or impair

   regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment a corresponding test for impairment is applied once

life

     sure measures looming default or overindebtedness as well as insolvency proceedings having been applied
     for or commenced trade receivables with usual payment terms which normally do not exceed twelve
     months are therefore recognised at the nominal amount less appropriate allowances receivables that do
     not bear interest or bear below market interest rates and have an expected term of more than one year are
     discounted with the discount subsequently amortised to interest income over the term of the receivable

                        can however in future periods cause outcomes that result in major adjustment to the carrying amounts of the

                        with a finite useful life is based on calculation of the recoverable amount which is the higher of value in use
                        and fair value less cost to sell to estimate the value in use the group must estimate the probable future cash

   in december 2013 the iasb issued two omnibus standards with annual improvements improvements to
     ifrss 2010  2012 and improvements to ifrss 2011  2013 involving a total of eleven amendments to nine
     standards the iasbs annual improvements process provides a mechanism to make nonurgent but nec
     essary amendments to ifrs that address unintended consequences conflicts or oversights most of these
     changes are to be applied to financial years beginning on or after 1 july 2014


the requirements to be applied in the future are unlikely to exert any material effect on presentation of the
groups financial position performance or cash flows

     depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the considera
     tion to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the principles in
     ifrs 15 provide a structured approach to measurement and recognition of sales revenues the scope of
     the standard covers all kinds of sectors and entities and therefore supersedes all existing requirements
     concerning revenue recognition ias 11 construction contracts ias 18 revenue ifric 13 customer loyalty

                             applies to both firsttime acquisition of interest in a joint operation and acquisition of further interest in the

 10242 k previous year  14167 k in selling expenses in the amount of  857 k previous year  677 k in
general and administrative expenses in the amount of  4975 k previous year  4283 k as well as in research
and development costs in the amount of  488 k previous year  514 k
  intangible assets with an indefinite useful life were tested for impairment as at 31 october this involved
two brands in the wire  cable solutions division specifically in one cashgenerating unit in each of business
group communication  infrastructure and business group industry  healthcare the impairment tests as a
matter of principle based on the recoverable amount of the respective cashgenerating unit on the value in
use in the case of the business group industry  healthcare brand the fair value less cost to sell was drawn
upon and determined on the basis of the level three parameters pursuant to ifrs 13 in both cases the under
lying cash flow forecasts are based on the fiveyear business planning as approved by the management board
the cash flows after the fiveyear period were in the case of the brand in business group communication 
infrastructure as in the previous year extrapolated by applying a zero growth rate the pretax discount rate
applied was 1185 percent previous year 1348 percent in the case of the brand in business group industry 
healthcare a pretax discount rate of 1038 percent previous year 1217 percent was applied for the fiveyear
detailed planning period and thereafter one of 888 percent previous year 1067 percent which corresponds
to a growth rate of 15 percent after the fiveyear planning period neither impairment test resulted in any
need for writedown based on the assumptions applied the fair value less cost to sell of the business group
industry  healthcare brand exceeded the carrying amount of  135 million by  21 million from a pretax
discount rate of 114 percent it would all other parameters being equal fall below the carrying amount
  as in the previous year no writedowns on intangible assets were recognised in the 2014 financial year
  there was no appreciation either in this financial year or in the previous year



17  impairment testing of property plant and equipment as
well as intangible assets with a finite useful life
intangible assets with finite useful life involved a carrying amount of  80533 k on 31 december 2014 previ
ous year  80128 k property plant and equipment came to a carrying amount of  810073 k on 31 decem
ber 2014 previous year  709782 k
  in all cases the cash flows projected in the current fiveyear planning were extrapolated for the impairment
testing
  the property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets with a finite useful life of one cashgenera
ting unit in the wire  cable solutions division were tested for impairment the test was carried out based on
the fair value less cost to sell and determined pursuant to ifrs 13 based on the level three parameters the
pretax discount rate applied was 1058 percent and a discount rate of 908 percent was applied according
to the fiveyear detailed planning period which corresponded to a growth rate of 15 percent the test did
not find any need for writedown from an increase in the pretax interest rate by more than 308 percentage
points the fair value less cost to sell would all other parameters being equal drop below the carrying amount

                        in a second case in the wire  cable solutions division the value in use was drawn upon for the impairment
                        test the discount rate was 1083 percent a discount rate of 933 percent was applied according to the five
                        year detailed planning period which corresponded to a growth rate of 15 percent the test did no find any
                        need for writedown from an increase in the pretax interest rate by more than 254 percentage points the
                        value in use would all other parameters being equal drop below the carrying amount
                            in a cashgenerating unit of the wiring systems division the impairment test was also based on the value in
                        use the discount rate was 958 percent a discount rate of 808 percent was applied according to the fiveyear
                        detailed planning period which corresponded to a growth rate of 15 percent the test did no find any need
                        for writedown from an increase in the pretax interest rate by more than 223 percentage points the value in
                        use would all other parameters being equal drop below the carrying amount

                        the goodwill shown on 31 december 2014 broke down to  70154 k previous year  69586 k for the wire 
                        cable division and  77522 k previous year  78831 k for the wiring systems division the goodwill existing
                        in the wire  cable solutions division as at 31 december 2014 stems from the following key acquisitions

                        division the largest amount of goodwill  66555 k stems from the acquisition of valeo connective systems
                        while  6712 k pertains to the purchase of daekyeung tg co ltd
                            in addition to the obligatory impairment tests of all goodwill that must be carried out at lease once a year
                        the company carries out additional impairment tests during the financial year where there are indications of
                        impairment the obligatory impairment test of all goodwill that must be carried out at least once a year was
                        executed as at 31 october

                                                                                                                       consolidated financial statements      175

                                                                                                                       notes
                                                                                                                        18  goodwill




for the purpose of the impairment test all goodwill was allocated to the cashgenerating units or groups of
cashgenerating units that benefit from the synergies of the business combination the principal goodwill
allocations were as follows
  in the wiring systems division the largest item of goodwill in the amount of  666 million previous year
 674 million was allocated at segment level in the wire  cable solutions division goodwill totalling
 371 million previous year  369 million was allocated to business group industry  healthcare goodwill
totalling  289 million previous year  285 million and of  42 million as in the previous year was allocated
to business group communication  infrastructure and to business group automotive cables respectively
  in all the goodwill impairment tests determination of the recoverable amount was based on the value in
use the underlying cash flow forecasts are in each case based on the fiveyear business planning as approved
by the management board as in the previous year cash flows after the fiveyear period were on principle
extrapolated by applying a zero growth rate the pretax discount rates applied were as follows for the wiring
systems division 1163 percent previous year 1338 percent for business group automotive cables 1330
percent previous year 1472 percent for business group industry  healthcare 1100 percent previous year
1260 percent and for business group communication  infrastructure 1055 percent previous year 1208
percent
  the test for impairment of goodwill found no need for writedown
  the groups management holds the basic view that by prudent judgement any fundamentally possible
change to basic assumptions for determining the value in use of the cashgenerating units or groups of
cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated would not lead to the carrying amounts of the
cashgenerating units exceeding their recoverable amount in the wiring systems division there is one excep
tion involving a cashgenerating unit to which a relatively small amount of goodwill of  67 million is allocat
ed the discount rate was 1063 percent a discount rate of 913 percent was applied according to the fiveyear
detailed planning period which corresponded to a growth rate of 15 percent in the case of this cashgen
erating unit the carrying amount could exceed the value in use as a result of an increase in the discount rate
or if projections of earnings were to worsen based on the assumptions made the value in use exceeded the
carrying amount of  1045 million by  150 million from an increase in the discount rate by 159 percentage
points the value in use would all other parameters being equal be below the carrying amount
  in the wire  cable solutions division there is another exception in business group communication 
infrastructure it includes a brand for which the impairment test is described separately in note 16 an item
of goodwill in the amount of  289 million is furthermore allocated to the business group which was also
tested the discount rate was 1016 percent a discount rate of 866 percent was applied according to the five
year detailed planning period which corresponded to a growth rate of 15 percent based on the assumptions
made the value in use exceeded the carrying amount of  2357 million by  744 million from an increase in
the discount rate by 244 percentage points the value in use would all other parameters being equal match
the carrying amount

                        19  other noncurrent financial assets

                        the other noncurrent financial assets amounting to  1065 k as in the previous year comprised investments
                        classified as availableforsale securities they were valued at cost because there was no quoted price in an
                        active market and their fair value could not be reliably measured
                          the item also included primarily loans to third parties and staff in the amount of  1035 k previous year
                         1355 k and collateral pertaining mostly to rental deposits for office and warehouse buildings as well as
                        staff residential units in korea in the amount of  3566 k previous year  2375 k

                         548178 k on 31 december 2014 previous year  454964 k current financial liabilities and the shortterm
                        proportion of longterm loans amounted to  99776 k on the reporting date whereas the item showed an
                        amount of  41279 k on 31 december 2013 the change is due primarily to reclassification from noncurrent
                        financial liabilities and to having taken out further shortterm loans
                          noncurrent financial liabilities rose from  413685 k on 31 december 2013 to  448402 k in the period un
                        der report this is attributable to the issue of new borrowers note loans as well as to having taken out foreign

people joining the company after 31 december 1981 was replaced by the pension plan of leoni ag in 2013
furthermore the pension plans assets from which payments of pension benefits that had already started
at the time of the closure were made were transferred to leoni ag this transfer of the pension plan did not
entail any change to benefits for either people now in retirement or for future beneficiaries the amount of
pension benefit payments is based on years of service and the salary of the last year of employment
  pension obligations of acquired german companies are generally based on eligible compensation levels
andor ranking within the company hierarchy and years of service or on a fixed amount per year of service all

participate in this plan the pension plan is administered by a trust whose board comprises both employer
and employee representatives there are also outside experts consulting on asset management and actu
arial matters the trust determines the contributions to be paid in by leoni and decides on the additional
contributions to be paid by leoni in the event of any plan deficit the current deficit at the end of the financial
year was  54358 k equating to 295 percent of the defined benefit obligation negotiations between leoni
and the trust are conducted every three years to determine the amounts to be paid in to clear any deficit and
the period over which to do so the amount of committed benefits is based upon the salary of the last year of
employment as well as years of service and contributions of the participants to the fund pension adjustments
are linked to an inflation index reflecting increases in the cost of living

the mortality trend is taken into account in the three major pension plans through the use of generation
tables calculation of the defined benefit obligations with a oneyear rise in life expectancy raises the defined
benefit obligations of the plans as follows in the united kingdom by 278 percent previous year 232 per
cent in germany by 256 percent previous year 254 percent and in switzerland by 190 percent previous
year 120 percent
    the calculation of sensitivities was as part of an observation performed on a ceteris paribus basis based on
changing an assumption whereas all other assumptions remain unchanged whereby dependencies between
the assumptions are ruled out the method for calculating sensitivities is identical to that for calculating the
net pension obligation

information on the due dates of trade receivables is presented in note 11
   28 percent previous year 34 percent of all receivables were covered with insurance limits by a group
master policy with a credit insurer or other local credit insurers insurance excess amounts were disregarded
in determining the total amount insured the amount actually insured was consequently slightly below this
percentage 50 percent previous year approx 51 percent of the noninsured receivables involved customers
that are exempt from contractually compulsory cover the customers exempt from contractually compulsory
cover were mainly major companies in the automotive as well as electronicelectrical engineering sectors for
22 percent previous year 15 percent of total receivables there was no cover from a credit insurer


the table below shows the breakdown of insured and noninsured receivables from customers

the insured subsidiaries must apply for credit insurance limits to the credit insurer for all receivables from
customers that are not exempt from compulsory cover and that exceed the limits specified on the existing
guideline the following specific conditions apply leoni has an obligation to declare exposure to the credit
insurers for all receivables from customers greater than  50 k a cover limit can also be obtained for small
er receivables consignment stores and manufacturing risks are covered by blanket insurance the credit
insurance policy reimburses 90 percent of the insured amount measurement and monitoring with respect to
impairment of the noninsured receivables is supported among other things by the credit screening carried
out by the credit insurer and other service providers
   the subsidiaries that were not insured will be integrated in the master policy so far as this makes sense from
the aspect of the principal customer base and provided there are no regional or political reasons on the part
of the credit insurer against inclusion the subsidiaries that cannot be integrated are to be covered via local
credit insurers internal credit limits are set for major customers that are exempt from mandatory cover and
other noninsured customers limits are applied for without delay on a decentralised basis and are monitored
by head office accounts receivable management
   factoring or true sale factoring for selected customers serves as a further tool to reduce the risk of default
customers with good credit ratings are also included

interest rate risks
we use interest rate derivatives among other means to avoid the risk of changes in interest rate rates such
contracts are signed exclusively by leoni ag on 31 december 2014 there was one interest rate derivative
maturing in three months the agreed reference interest rate was the euribor for three months due to the
early refinancing measures in fiscal 2012 this interest rate derivative no longer fulfilled the conditions for
hedge accounting the changes in market value that occurred up to the date on which the hedge relationship
was ended were recognised within accumulated other comprehensive income they remain in other compre
hensive income and will be reclassified prorata over the remaining term of the derivative to finance costs in
the income statement the residual value recognised in other comprehensive income as at 31 december 2014
amounted to negative  556 k the reclassification to finance costs amounted to  2223 k changes in market
value occurring after the hedge relationship has ended are recorded in the income statement

                        an interest rate swap was entered into for the borrowers note loan in the amount of  25000 k newly taken
                        out in november 2013 in the same amount and with the same term to hedge the risk of changes in values
                        leoni ag receives fixed interest on the nominal amount for the interest rate swap and pays a variable interest

                        term is five years and ten months and the euribor was agreed as the reference interest rate for one year the

                           the changes in market value of the interest rate derivatives totalled  4155 k in the financial year previous
                        year  2420 k which as in the previous year were recognised in full in the income statement
                           we regard the counterparty risk as being very small because all derivative contracts were signed with na

                        interest rate sensitivity
                        consolidated earnings depend on the level of market interest rates any change in this level would impact on
                        the groups earnings and equity the analysis we carry out covers all interestbearing financial instruments
                        that are subject to the risk of changes in interest rates at the end of the 2014 financial year the interest rate
                        derivatives either no longer met the conditions for hedge accounting or the effects were recorded directly in
                        the income statement meaning that the risk of changes in interest rates did not affect other comprehensive

                           when calculating the sensitivity of the interest rates we assume a parallel shift in the yield curve the up
                        ward shift comes to 50 basis points the downward shift comes to just 25 basis points because of the currently
                        low level of interest rates a rate of zero interest is applied as the floor with respect to the currencies that are
                        key to us in this respect the impact of the shift is as follows

currency risks
although we conduct business mainly in euros or in the local currency of the respective country we are
increasingly faced with currency risks due to the globalisation of the markets
    in the groups holding company leoni ag the corporate finance department centrally deals with the
resulting currency risks in collaboration with and based on the conditions set by the currency committee with
respect to limits and terms hedging transactions are executed in line with the existing underlying transac
tions as well as the planned transactions
    selection of the hedging instrument to be used is based on regular indepth analysis of the underlying
transaction to be hedged most of the hedging transactions are in pounds sterling chinese yuan mexican
pesos polish zloty romanian leu and us dollars the objective is to limit the impact of exchange rate variation
on net income apart from the actual hedging transactions we primarily take advantage of the option of
netting foreign currency items within the group to hedge our operating business activity as a further curren
cyhedging measure as a matter of principle we finance our foreign subsidiaries in their respective functional
currencies by way of refinancing in the corresponding currency
    on the balance sheet date there were currencyhedging transactions amounting to  628922 k previous
year  462404 k maturing within 27 months the total market value of forward exchange transactions
existing as of the balance sheet date was negative  13769 k previous year  3030 k forward exchange
transactions amounting to  277149 k previous year  179123 k met the conditions for hedge accounting
cash flow hedge the ones that met the conditions for hedge accounting were all completed in the 2013 and
2014 financial years their total fair value of negative  6224 k previous year positive  503 k was recognised
in other comprehensive income the cash flow from the underlying transactions is expected in the 2015 to
2017 financial years the changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income are derecognised
via the income statement at the time the underlying transaction takes effect
    the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income in the context of hedge accounting came to nega
tive  4641 k in the financial year previous year positive  2970 k an amount of  2092 k previous year

the currency hedging transactions as well as our interestratehedging transactions were signed with first
rate commercial banks meaning that there was no significant counterparty risk either this area is also subject
to regular monitoring

                        exchange rate sensitivity
                        changes in exchange rates that are by prudent judgement essentially possible would affect consolidated
                        earnings due to the fair values of the monetary assets and liabilities additional factors would arise that would
                        affect equity due to change in fair value in the context of cash flow hedge accounting we consider the risk of
                        changes in interest rates arising from the currency derivatives to be immaterial which is why it is not included

capital management
the primary objective of leonis capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating
a good equity ratio and appropriate gearing to support its business and increase shareholder value
    the group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments based on the change in underlying eco
nomic conditions to maintain and adjust its capital structure the group can make adjustments to dividend
payouts to shareholders repay capital to shareholders or issue new shares in order to have as broad a range
of funding options as possible leoni aims to seek approval during its annual general meeting for all anticipa
tory resolutions no changes to the fundamental guidelines or processes were made in either the 2014 or 2013
financial years leoni controls its capital with gearing gearing is defined as the ratio of net financial debts to
equity
    leoni expects a sustained equity ratio of at least 35 percent due to fluctuation in elements of other
comprehensive income that cannot be influenced which may for example be caused by actuarial measure
ment of pension obligations or differences due to currency translation the equity ratio could temporarily also
drop below this figure with respect to gearing a figure below 50 percent is the target to be met on a lasting
basis during periods of acquisition this ratio may be temporarily exceeded in principle the aim is that capital
spending on organic growth that exceeds the market average can be generated from operating cash flow and
that reducing financial liabilities is possible
