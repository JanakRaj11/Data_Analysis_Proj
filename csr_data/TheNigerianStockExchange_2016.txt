the nse recognises that the education sector in nigeria has suﬀered severe neglect in the past which has led to a general
decline in our standard of education according to a research paper by the united states embassy in nigeria an
estimated 10 million out of the 30 million schoolaged children are not enrolled in school the average senior secondary
certiﬁcate examination ssce pass rate over the last 5 years is about 29 and there are academic staﬀ shortages in all
areas particularly in the critical areas of science and technology

therefore to build a pipeline of future leaders who can serve country and companies the nse initiated the adopta
school initiative which was launched with the commissioning of a learning and development centre donated to oke
odo junior college abule egba lagos the initiative is aimed at addressing the challenges experienced by schools in
nigeria through facility and process improvement teachers empowerment and students intellectual advancement
this is implemented through a structured approach of facility and process improvement empowerment of teachers and
the advancement of students intellectual capacity

workplace

our vision mission and core values guide the code of conduct of our employees and create a workforce that supports
productivity at the nse our employees can communicate their concerns and questions conﬁdentially we understand
and value diversity and inclusion and therefore maintain a workplace free from harassment and report potential
violations to the company without fear of retaliation fortunately we did not have any reported grievances about labor
practices during the reporting period and no reported incidence of discrimination the nse does not practice collective
bargaining and as such none of our employees are bound by collective bargaining agreement


at the nse employee satisfaction is critical to our operations we therefore work to ensure open lines of
communication and in 2015 we responded to the need for better compensation and increased staﬀ engagement with a
stream of unique policies and programmes


employee volunteering

members of staﬀ at the nse support our local communities through the corporate entity or personally investing in
communities is a longstanding tradition which has continued to receive positive feedback from employees the nse
employee volunteering scheme was formally launched in 2015 after 2 years of working with employees to build
connectedness between employees and our operating environment for the ﬂagship project a special need focus was
unanimously selected by the csr champions and pacelli school for the blind and partially sighted children was chosen
as beneﬁciary

for the ﬂagship project a charitybased organisation that provides free education to less privileged children in our
operating community it provides only boarding facility which houses over 130 students within the primary school age
range the school has been in existence since 1962 and it is solely run on donations from individuals groups and
organisations

currently we run biweekly reading and mentoring programmes at the school we also had a food drive in november
2015 with the school library and medical center upgraded also in 2015
