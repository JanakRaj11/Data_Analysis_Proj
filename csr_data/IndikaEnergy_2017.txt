2016 sustainability report


    in papua lives were lost local mountain dwellers who were
 persuaded to stop using pork fat to coat their skin and to cleanse
  themselves with soap instead experienced increased mortality
   rates it turned out that the pork fat perceived by outsiders as
   unhygienic had protected them from the elements and from
         infection with malaria that is carried by mosquitoes

   experience teaches that good intentions can go badly awry if
assumptions are made without understanding the views and needs
 of others cultural diversity and differences in customs as well as
 ways of living thorough consideration must be taken of diversity
    in any attempt at assistance and that communities must be
                    consulted on what they need
                                   sokola institute




sokola is a notforprofit organisation providing education for remote indigenous peoples
who are unable to access formal education due to geographic and cultural obstacles the
education is aimed at providing the skills required to manage the many problems that
indigenous and marginalised communities face due to the increasing pressures from the
outside world founded in 2003 by saur marlina butet manurung and other four fellows
sokola is an excellent example of how a small number of individuals with strong passion
and determination can effect real change
indika energy is honoured to have been supporting sokola and its literacy programs

energy sector is set to peak in 2025 and to decrease to only
16 percent by 2050
post 2050 77 percent of new energy capacity is projected
to originate from wind and solar resources with natural gas
nuclear and hydro energy making up the rest for that reason
indika energy sees potential in alternative resources such as
solar energy and deems it wise to keep an eye on indonesias
energy sector policy for signs of concrete regulatory moves
and incentives we constantly challenge ourselves to do
better in every aspect of our business


sustaining our improvement efforts
within this context indika energy group organized a one
day hackathon with our sustainability teams early in 2016 to
discuss how to improve our existing sustainability practices
throughout the year the results of this communal
conference translated into the activation of the
digital indika energy group sustainability platform
to standardize internal capacity the conducting
of a sustainability panel to enhance and push
forward our sustainability strategies and
the development of ever yet more efficient
and effective sustainability programs
for education health community
empowerment         and      the
environment
then in early 2017 with
contemporary trends in indonesian
society creating greater urgency
for social solidarity toward unified
action not only within indika energy
group but within government and
communities across the archipelago
indika energy made the forward
looking decision to establish the
indika foundation
we envision indika foundation not only as a services
umbrella to facilitate the sharing of sustainability
experiences and reconsolidation toward greater
efficiency in effective community engagement among all of
our subsidiaries but also as a way to enhance the core values
of unity in diversity and tolerance within plurality upon which
the modern state of indonesia was founded
for this reason indika foundation will begin collaborating
with wellestablished organizations and other associations to
develop programs and projects especially for young people
intended to facilitate tolerance and social solidarity by focusing
on similarities instead of differences
going forward indika energy intends to harness all lessons
learned to build an increasingly solid business reputation and
empower society to strengthen the solidarity and unity of the
nation

petrosea creates winwin
community economy solution
petrosea a subsidiary of indika energy has taken a visionary step in utilizing indonesias
ancient tradition of gotong royong mutual assistance to resolve an immediate
contemporary business need for greater production efficiency within its operations while
economically empowering the communities in the areas in which it operates for the long run



problem solving through company
community solidarity
in 2016 petrosea encountered an efficiency problem in its
kideco jaya agung project in the legai village and samarangau
areas in order to increase mining operation production the
company required bottom plugs for the blasting phase made
from a specific plastic material generally used for pvc pipes
and plates which cost a relatively expensive rp 40 thousand
per unit on the market at that time
to meet its hefty need for bottom plugs in its mining operations
petrosea hits upon the idea of leveraging this need for a vital
production tool to economically empower the region they
operated in through indika energys concept of consolidating
toward sustainability by inviting the people of legai village and
samarangau to collaborate in the production of bottom plugs
the villagers eagerly stepped up to accept this economic
opportunity to enhance their welfare and began producing
around 3000 bottom plugs monthly which brought the cost
to the company for each bottom plug down to only rp 17
thousand per plug this cost highly competitive in light of
the market price enabled petrosea to save more than rp 69
million per month while providing income of rp 51 million per
month for the people of its operational area
petrosea then further enhanced this innovative sustainability
initiative for creating a viable community industry by
planning and implementing a guidance program
toward enabling the community industry work
groups to form a legally based cooperative in order
to solidly expand their business cooperation with
a number of other kideco companies




  the participating communities have gained an
income of more than rp 612 million per year
           from the production of bottom plugs


  the local community production units
    produce 3000 bottom plugs per
                               month

                                                                                          su stainabilit y re por t 2016  41
