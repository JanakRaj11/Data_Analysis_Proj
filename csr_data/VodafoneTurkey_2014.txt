              we may improve the most by achieving energy efficiency in base
              stations and switchingdata centres which respectively cause 80
              and 15 percent of our energy consumption we not only reduce
              our carbon footprint but also cut energy costs we invest in more
              efficient technologies and seek innovative solutions that reduce
              energy consumption or use renewable energy in addition we
              implement measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our

note 1 as energy conversion factors specific to turkey are revised for 201314 the 201112 and 201213 figures are recalculated using the new conversion factors therefore 201112
and 201213 fiscal year data is revised it is worth mentioning that over 90 of our energy consumption is from purchased electricity and this coefficient is not changed therefore
restatement of previous years data is minor detailed information on conversion factors and methodology is provided in the principles of reporting section of this report
note 2 for 201314 fiscal year it has been possible to enhance the calculation of electricity consumption from base stations due to improvements in the quality of the measurement
methods used to calculate the data however it has not been possible to restate data from prior years retrospectively more accurate method will be used for the following years
 201314 energy data was assured by the independent audit firm ey

              during the 201314 fiscal year we continued implementing our              in order to reduce energy consumption in our buildings we used
              green technology program at our base stations we initiated this        inverter devices in all air conditioning replacement in 201314
              program in 2009 where we use cutting edge technology in our               fiscal year we used leds for lighting in all new buildings with
              newly installed or renovated base stations                               lighting automation in our buildings we benefit from the sunlight

              through energyefficient hightech practices in the vodafone
              turkey network we saved energy we replaced 1350 old                    environmentfriendly fleet management

              by the end of 201314 fiscal year we increased the number of              and greenhouse gas emissions per vehicle in addition although
              base station sites that use 100 renewable energy that are not           the number of vehicles increased 8 compared to the previous
              connected to the grid to 8 in addition we also make use of wind        year our fuel consumption increased 7 we aim to continue our
environment




              energy at suitable base station sites we increased these types of        efforts to save fuel in the coming years

              energy efficiency in switching and data centres                           one of the issues we focus on in terms of environmental
              approximately 15 of our energy consumption occurs in our                 management is generating less waste and using fewer natural
              switching and data centres while building new centres to meet            resources in line with this aim we ensure safe disposal of wastes
              the increasing demand we also aim to reduce the amount of                produced during our operations in the buildings and networks
              energy used and greenhouse gases generated per unit in line              in conformity with related laws and regulations while recycling
              with our climate change strategy we plan to save approximately           paper wastes we also encourage the use of electronic invoices by
              216000 kwh per year by replacing dc power supplies with high            our customers to save resources

telecommunication technologies we replace the devices in                   in 201314 fiscal year we donated approximately 1 million
our base stations with more energy efficient ones and with                  invoices in other words 125 tons of waste paper returned to us
superior technologic features our priority in the aforementioned           from our customers due various reasons including wrong address
transformation is to sell old devices in second hand market if              unclear address or address change to tema foundation as
possible and make them available for use in different technical            planned amount of paper donated to tema fell compared to the

devices in accordance with the laws and international directives           lists and increase in einvoice application
within the scope of our waste management system 1125 tons                 since april 2010 we have been encouraging our customers
of waste materials from network operations have been collected              through campaigns to use einvoices which have legal validity
in 201314 fiscal year in a controlled manner a total of 5795             instead of printed invoices the rate of the postpaid customers
tons of network waste materials have been collected between                 that prefer ebill has increased 7 and reached 57
july 2007 and march 2014 our waste materials from network
