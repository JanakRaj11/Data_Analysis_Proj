                              the benchmark year of fy2012 so that by 2020 co2 emissions will have been reduced by
                              approximately 7 compared to fy2012 unfortunately whereas fy2015 should have seen

all of these measures embody key points relating to csr the first                           thereby contributing to the development of new products and new
point is that csr measures need to be based on strategic thinking                            markets while promoting measures to make a positive contribution to
that combines social significance that will appeal to stakeholders with                      society through a storybased approach that takes ubiquitous design

be implemented on an ongoing basis if they also make sense from the                          secondly it would be advisable for tamron to use practical structural

a further point is that the key to successful csr lies in a company      s                  to refine the measures used to realize csr
employees besides themselves being internal stakeholders employees                         thirdly tamron seems to have neglected evaluation of its csr activities
are also the people who put csr into practice for csr to be effective                      from a business strategy perspective it would be helpful to establish
employees need to be able to decide for themselves what kind of action                       indicators and perform evaluation in this regard strategic awareness
they should take in line with the company    s management philosophy                     and appropriate assessment should prove very useful when reviewing
