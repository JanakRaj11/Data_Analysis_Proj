                 torhausviertel is being considered for inclusion in the list of
                 the unescoworld heritage sites

                 the multistorey car park located in the inner courtyard of
                 bartholomayhaus was in a need of renovation at the end of 2010
                 in 2011 it was completely rebuilt by alstria the car park con
                 tains the original number of parking spaces but is reduced in
                 size through an efficient construction and land use it therefore
                 allows for more efficient natural lighting and ventilation of
                 the ground and mezzanine floors of the enclosed main building
                 in addition the new car park will be equipped with a green roof
                 which is a natural protection against heat and cold and provides
                 a more pleasant visual sight the green roof also eases the load
                 on the sewerage system as rain water will be saved and evapo
                 rates in the green roof it also contributes efficiently to the
                 natural cooling of the building humidification and particulate
                 filtration in addition we promote electric car mobility as
                 we have created a charging station for electric vehicles in the
                 parking garage for our tenants

                 alstria has also taken the opportunity to install a retention
                 basin which collects the rain water of the entire building
                 complex the rainwater is routed to the newly installed rain
                 water harvesting system which recycles the rain water into the
                 nondrinkable water distribution system this technique also
                 eases the load on the sewerage system and excess water will be
                 returned slowly

                 as part of the overall remediation measures alstria has also
                 taken into account the historic facade of the building the fa
                 cade was completed by the reconstruction of the historic porch
                 in addition new windows have been used to reduce not only the
                 energy consumption of the building but are moreover consistent
                 with the historic facade and meet current requirements
