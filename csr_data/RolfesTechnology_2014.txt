             previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are accounted for as if
             the company had directly disposed of the relevant assets ie reclassified to profit or loss or transferred
             directly to retained earnings as specified by applicable ifrss the fair value of any investment retained in

             achieved in stages the groups previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value
             on the date the group attains control and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss

             where the previously held interest was classified as an availableforsale financial asset the cumulative fair
             value adjustments recognised to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are recognised
             in profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment at the acquisition date the excess of the cost of the
             business combination over the groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and
             contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill in accordance with the groups accounting policy for
             goodwill the acquisition date is the date on which the group effectively obtains control of the acquiree the
             excess of the fair value of the net identifiable assets and contingent liabilities of the entity acquired over the
             cost of acquisition results in a bargain purchase which is recognised immediately in profit or loss

             if the initial accounting for business combinations has been determined provisionally then these provisional
             amounts are adjusted during the measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and
             circumstances that existed as of the date of acquisition that if known would have affected the amounts

             to a maximum of one year

             consolidation of associates
             associated companies are consolidated on the equity method of accounting the group considers an
             investment to be an associate when the group does not have effective control and deems effective control
             to be lost when the equity investment drops below 20
             the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost and the carrying amount is increased or
             decreased to recognise the groups share of the profit or loss of the associate after the date of acquisition
             although the indirect shareholding in maxipil pty ltd is less than 20 the group remains to exercise
             significant influence as a result of the significant level of operational involvement finance granted through
             the subsidiaries significant reliance on purchase volumes from agchem africa pty ltd through gallus

     17     financial instruments

             initial recognition

             a financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability
             or equity instrument in another entity

             the group recognises a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when the
             group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument the groups financial instruments
             consists primarily of the following instruments and their measurement principles

             fair value

             where financial instruments are recognised at fair value the instruments are measured at the price that
             should be received to sell on asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
             participants on measurement date fair values have been determined as follows

              where market prices are available these have been used

              where market prices are not available fair values have been determined using valuation techniques
               incorporating observable market inputs or discounting expected cash flows at market rates

             financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value with any resultant gain or loss
             recognised in profit or loss the net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or
             interest earned on the financial asset

             effective interest method

             the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of
             allocating interest income over the relevant period

             the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts including all fees
             on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate transaction cost and other
             premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial asset or where appropriate a shorter
             period income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial
             assets designated as at fair value through profit or loss

             impairment of financial assets

             financial assets other than those at fair value through profit or loss are assessed for indicators of
             impairment at each end of the reporting period financial assets are impaired where there is objective
             evidence that as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial
             asset the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been impacted

             for financial assets measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method the following
             objective evidence is considered in determining when an impairment loss has been incurred

              significant financial difficulty of the debtor

              a breach of contract such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments and

              it is becoming probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation

             for certain categories of financial asset such as trade receivables assets that are assessed not to be
             impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis for financial assets
             carried at amortised cost the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying
             amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original
             effective interest rate the carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly
             for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through
             the use of an allowance account

             subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account
             changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss with the exception
             of availableforsale equity instruments if in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss
             decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was
             recognised the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss

             in respect of availableforsale equity securities impairment charges are included in profit or loss except to
             the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other comprehensive income

             derecognition of financial assets

             the group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
             expire or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset
             to another entity if the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
             and continues to control the transferred asset the group recognises its retained interest in the asset and
             an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay if the group retains substantially all the risks and
             rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset the group continues to recognise the financial asset
             and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received

             classification as debt or equity

             debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the
             substance of the contractual arrangement

             equity instruments

             an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after
             deducting all of its liabilities equity instruments issued by the group comprising ordinary shares are
             recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs

             where the group or its subsidiaries purchase the companys equity share capital treasury shares the
             amount paid including any directly attributable incremental external costs net of income taxes is deducted
             from total shareholders equity as treasury shares when treasury shares are subsequently reissued or sold
             the amount received net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income
             tax effects is recognised as an increase in equity

             derecognition of financial liabilities

             the group derecognises financial liabilities when and only when the groups obligations are discharged
             cancelled or they expire

     18     impairment of nonfinancial assets other than goodwill

             the group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may
             be impaired if any such indication exists the group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset

             if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired the recoverable amount is estimated for the
             individual asset if it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset the recoverable
             amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs is determined

             the recoverable amount of an asset or a cashgenerating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell
             and its value in use if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount the carrying
             amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount that reduction is an impairment loss

             an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation is recognised
             immediately in profit or loss any impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation decrease

             an impairment loss is recognised for cashgenerating units if the recoverable amount of a unit is less than
             the carrying amount of collective units the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of
             the assets of the unit on the following basis

              to the assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit

             an entity assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised

             a reversal of an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation
             other than goodwill is recognised immediately in profit and loss any reversal of an impairment loss of a

             value through other comprehensive income directly to equity

     111 intangible assets

             in the companys separate financial statements intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that the
             expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of
             the asset can be measured reliably

             intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or
             give rise to other contractuallegal rights the amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using
             appropriate valuation techniques

             expenditure on research or on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense when
             it is incurred

             an intangible asset arising from development or from the development phase of an internal project is
             recognised when

              it is technically feasible to complete the asset so that it will be available for use or sale

              there is an intention to complete and use or sell it

              there is an ability to use or sell it

              it will generate probable future economic benefits

              there are available technical financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or
               sell the asset

              the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably

             intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses

             the residual value amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are
             reviewed annually

             intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life

     112 leases

             a lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
             ownership a lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and
             rewards incidental to ownership

             the land and buildings elements of property leases are considered separately for the purposes of
             lease classification

             finance leases

             finance leases are recognised as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at amounts
             equal to the fair value of the leased property or if lower the present value of the minimum lease payments
             the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease
             obligation

             the discount rate used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate
             implicit in the lease the lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the
             outstanding liability the finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to achieve
             a constant rate on the remaining balance of the liability

             lessors shall recognise assets held under finance lease in their statement of financial position and present
             them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease

             operating leases

             operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term the
             difference between the amounts recognised as an expense and the contractual payments are recognised
             as an operating lease asset or liability any contingent rent is expensed in the period it is incurred

             lease income from operating leases shall be recognised in income on a straightline basis over the lease
             term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit
             derived from the leased asset is diminished

     113 property plant and equipment

             the cost of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised as an asset when

              it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and

              the cost of the item can be measured reliably

             property plant and equipment is initially recognised at cost costs include costs incurred initially to acquire
             an item of property plant and equipment and costs incurred subsequently to add to or replace a part if a
             replacement cost is recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property plant and equipment the
             carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised

             property represents land and buildings which are owner occupied from a group perspective

             plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses

             property is carried at the revalued amount being the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent
             accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses land is not depreciated

             property plant and equipment excluding land is depreciated on the straightline basis at rates considered
             appropriate to reduce book values to estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives each part
             of an item of property plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the
             item shall be depreciated separately depreciation ceases when residual value equals more than the
             carrying value of the specific item of property plant and equipment

             the useful lives depreciation method and residual values of the individual items of property plant and
             equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and any revision to these are accounted for as a change in

             the revalued amount is the fair value at the date of revaluation based on periodic valuations by a professional
             qualified valuer these revaluations are made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount
             does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting
             period at least every five years changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income direct
             to equity and accumulated in the revaluation reserve except to the extent that any decrease in value in
             excess of the credit balance on the revaluation reserve or reversal of such a transaction is recognised in
             profit or loss the increase is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease
             of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss any surplus on revaluation to fair value is included
             in equity this surplus may be transferred directly to retained earnings when an asset is derecognised
             transfers from revaluation surplus to retained earnings are not made through profit or loss

             b when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal

             the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is included in
             profit or loss when the item is derecognised gains are not classified as revenue

             rehabilitation cost

             rehabilitation cost is recognised when a present legal obligation arises to restore the environment to its
             previous status or according to stipulated requirements in the mining license a rehabilitation provision is
             recognised at the present value of the estimated obligation and is increased annually with finance charges
             calculated at marketrelated discount rates and is recognised through the profit or loss

             an asset is recognised at the present value of the estimated rehabilitation obligation and is depreciated in
             accordance with the policies applicable to equivalent items of property plant and equipment

             the estimated obligation will be evaluated annually and any increases or decreases in the obligation will be
             recognised in profit or loss in the current year

     114 provisions

             provisions are recognised for liabilities of uncertain timing or amount that have arisen as a result of past
             transactions and are discounted at a pretax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value
             of money and the risks specific to the liability the increase in the provisions due to passage of time is
             recognised as an interest expense

     115 purchase of noncontrolling interest in subsidiary

             the cost of the purchase of shares is measured at the aggregate of the fair value of assets given at the date
             of exchange liabilities incurred or assumed and the fair value of the equity instruments issued by the group
             in exchange for shares purchased in a controlled entity with the excess of the cost of the purchase of
             shares recognised in equity any costs directly attributable to the transaction are recognised immediately

     116 revenue recognition

             sales

              the group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with
               ownership nor effective control over the goods sold

              the amount of revenue can be measured reliably

              it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the group and

              the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably other revenue
               earned by the group is recognised on the following bases

             services

             revenue from the rendering of services will be recognised when the outcome of the transaction involving
             the service can be estimated reliably

             monthly services rendered will be recognised on a monthly basis after the service has been performed

             rentals

             rentals are recognised on the accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement

     119 critical accounting estimates and assumptions

             in preparing the financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that
             affect the amounts represented in the financial statements and related disclosures use of available
             information and the application of judgement is inherent in the formation of estimates

             the following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty
             at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
             carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year

             provisions

             warranty provision

             a warranty provision is raised based on prior experience for defective products sold to be utilised by the
             returning of defective products by customers refer to note 16

             loans and receivables

             allowance for impairment of financial assets

             an estimate is made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts at yearend
             taking into account the difference between the carrying amount of assets and the present value of the
             estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition bad
             debts are recognised directly in profit and loss in the year in which they are identified refer to note 7

             the directors assess the loans and receivables for impairment at each end of the reporting period
             in determining whether an impairment loss should be recorded in profit or loss the directors make
             judgements as to whether there is observable data indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated
             future cash flows from the financial asset

             the impairment of loans and receivables is based on the amounts outstanding which management feels
             will not be collected or only partially collected where possible the impairment is estimated per debtor
             the estimate is based on a review of all outstanding amounts at yearend refer to note 7

             useful lives of items of property plant and equipment

             the directors estimate the useful lives of the classes of property plant and equipment taking into account
             the individual items of the class and the present condition along with any major capital expenditure that is
             budgeted in the near future

             depreciation of items of property plant and equipment

             the directors assess the methods used for property plant and equipment on an annual basis

             residual values of items of property plant and equipment

             the residual values of the individual items of property plant and equipment are reviewed annually by the
             directors the estimate is made after taking into account the condition of the item age and judgement
             relating to useful lives

             decommissioning and rehabilitation obligations

             the directors estimate annually any decommissioning and rehabilitation obligations which might exist at
             yearend the estimate is made after taking into account the extent of the obligation and any requirements
             relating to the obligation this obligation arose out of the mining and water chemical segment and the
             requirements in the mining license refer to note 16

             determination of fair values of intangibles acquired in business combination

             the fair values of product licences acquired in a business combination are based on the discounted
             estimated royalty payments that would have been avoided as a result of the product licences being owned
             the fair value of the other intangible assets is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived
             from the use and eventual sale of the asset

             taxation

             judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes due to the complexity of legislation
             where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such
             differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination
             is made

             the group recognises the net future tax benefit related to deferred tax assets to the extent that it is
             probable that the deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future assessing the
             recoverability of deferred tax assets requires the group to make significant estimates related to expectations
             of future taxable income

             estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application
             of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction to the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ
             significantly from estimates the ability of the group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the
             end of the reporting period could be impacted

             estimated tax loss

             the group bases the tax expenses and deferred tax calculation on the estimated tax loss of the individual
             subsidiaries the estimated tax loss is calculated as per the south african revenue service stipulations
             indicated in the income tax act no 71 of 2008 once sars has assessed the company and agrees with
             the calculation of the estimated assessed loss sars grants the company an assessed loss should the
             situation occur that sars does not agree with the estimated assessed loss it will be rectified in the first tax
             expense calculation being performed with clear indication of such an event

             impairment testing

             the recoverable amounts of individual assets have been determined based on the higher of valueinuse
             calculations and fair values these calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions it is reasonably
             possible that the assumption may change which may then impact on estimates and may then require a
             material adjustment to the carrying value of assets

              1191 critical judgements in applying the entitys accounting policy

                       no critical judgements apart from those involving estimations have been made in the process of
                       applying the groups accounting policies that will have a significant effect on the amounts
                       recognised in the financial statement

     120 treasury shares

             where the company or its subsidiaries purchase the companys equity share capital the shares are treated
             as treasury shares the shares are treated as a deduction from the issued and weighted average number
             of shares and the cost price of the share is deducted from share capital in the statement of financial position
             on consolidation dividends received on treasury shares are eliminated on consolidation

             tax expenses

             current and deferred taxes are recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the
             period except to the extent that the tax arises from

              a transaction or event which is recognised in the same or a different period directly in equity or

              a business combination

             current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited directly to equity if the tax relates to items that are
             credited or charged in the same or a different period directly to equity

             current tax assets and liabilities

             current tax for current and prior periods is to the extent unpaid recognised as a liability if the amount
             already paid in respect of current and prior periods exceeds the amount due for those periods the excess
             is recognised as an asset

             current tax liabilitiesassets for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be
             paid torecovered from the tax authorities using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or
             substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period

             deferred taxation asset and liabilities

             deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the

              the initial recognition of goodwill

              the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at
               the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit and

              investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the group is able to control the timing of
               the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable
               future

             recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will
             be available against which the differences can be utilised

             the amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
             enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilitiesassets are
             settledrecovered

             deferred tax is charged or credited in profit or loss except when it relates to items charged or credited
             directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is recognised in equity

4 investments continued
     the growth rates used by management in forecasting future cash flows are based on the historic experience
     of management and the economic environment in which the investment operates and are as follows

      rolfes colour pigments international  a compound annual growth rate of 15 per annum
      rolfes silica  a compound annual growth rate of 10 per annum
      rolfes chemicals  a compound annual growth rate of 833 per annum
      agchem holdings  a compound annual growth rate of 10 per annum
      tetralon  a compound annual growth rate of 17 per annum
      pwm anticor  a compound annual growth rate of 20 per annum
      pwm  a compound annual growth rate of 17 per annum

     management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which rolfes colour
     pigments international rolfes silica rolfes chemicals tetralon pwm pwm anticor and agchem africa
     recoverable amounts are based would not cause any of the individual carrying amounts to exceed its recoverable
     amount

     the only movement in fair value of investments relates to the new acquisition of agchem property pty ltd as set
     out above refer to note 33 there is therefore no requirement for the reconciliation in the movement from opening
     to closing balances for the fair value of the investments

     it must be noted that the cost of the investment in agchem property is equivalent to the fair value thereof
     this is due to the fact that the external valuation was performed represented the acquisition price executive
     management believe the market valuation represents the fair value of the investment at year end

    management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which rolfes colour
    pigments international rolfes silica rolfes chemicals tetralon pwm pwm anticor and agchem africa
    recoverable amounts are based would not cause any of the individual carrying amounts to exceed its
    recoverable amount

     the recoverable amount of goodwill is calculated by taking into consideration the discounted cash flows obtained
     in the calculation of the fair value of investments in note 4 and adjusts this with net external debt and net assets
     value of the cashgenerating unit

     the recoverable amount of the agchem property pty ltd goodwill was not recalculated at yearend as the
     independent revaluation which was performed for purposes of the transaction was deemed by management to
     still adequately represent recoverable amount of the investment and the goodwill

	in determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the group considers any change in the credit quality
  of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date the concentration
  of credit risk is limited due to a large and unrelated customer base accordingly the directors believe that
  there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts

      the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their carrying values

      fair value of financial instruments
      the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows

       the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on
        active liquid markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices

       the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments is determined
        in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices
        from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments and

       the fair value of shortterm receivables and shortterm payables approximates their carrying amount

      at the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk for loans and receivables the
      carrying amount of financial assets as reflected above represents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk

      financial risk management objectives
      the groups financial department provides services to the business coordinates access to domestic and
      international financial markets monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the group
      these risks include market risk including currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk credit risk liquidity risk
      and cash flow interest rate risk

      the group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to economically
      hedge these risk exposures

      compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a continuous basis the group does not enter into
      or trade financial instruments including derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

      there has been no change to the groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and
      measures the risk

      market risk
      the groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
      interest rates the group enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency
      risk including

       forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the import of goods from
        international suppliers

      foreign currency risk management
      the group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies hence exposures to exchange
      rate fluctuations arise exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising
      forward foreign exchange contracts

      as set out below
      the group reduced its currency risk by negotiating favourable payment terms with foreign suppliers and by
      actively managing its banking facilities for foreign debt repayments the group also manages its foreign currency
      risk through maintaining a natural hedge whereby amounts receivable from foreign customers closely resembles
      amounts payable to foreign suppliers
      it is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency
      payments and receipts within 30 to 50 of the exposure generated the group also enters into forward
      contracts up to two months in advance basis adjustments are made to the carrying amounts of nonfinancial
      hedged items when the anticipated sale or purchase transaction takes place
      the group places orders to purchase raw materials from international suppliers with relevant forward foreign
      exchange contracts evaluated as above for terms not exceeding three months to hedge the exchange rate risk
      arising from these anticipated future purchases
      foreign currency sensitivity analysis
      the group is mainly exposed to currency in euro and us dollars
      the following table details the groups sensitivity to a 10 increase and decrease against the relevant foreign
      currencies the sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and
      adjusts their translation at the periodend for a 10 change in foreign currency rates the sensitivity analysis
      includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the
      loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower
      a positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the currency strengthens 10
      against the relevant currency for a 10 weakening of the currency against the relevant currency there would
      be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity and the balances below would be negative

      interest rate risk
      the foreign currency sensitivity analysis is consistent with those methods and assumptions used in the
      prior year
      the group limits its longterm interestbearing liabilities as far as possible to limit the exposure to interest rate
      risk the group has made arrangements with its bankers to limit the exposure to interest rate risk but this does
      not eliminate the risk since the groups interest rate is linked to prime
      the company limits its interest rate risk by carefully monitoring its cash requirements to limit unnecessary
      overdraft facilities resulting in unnecessary interest expenses
      the group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk as entities in the group borrow funds at floating interest rates
      interest rate sensitivity analysis
      the sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives
      and nonderivative instruments at the end of the reporting period for floating rate liabilities the analysis is
      prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for
      the whole year
      a 50 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management
      personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates
      if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant the groups profit
      for the year ended 30 june 2014 would decrease by r0074 million 2013 r0057 million
      this is mainly attributable to the groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings
      for a 50 basis point strengthening in the interest rate there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit
      and other equity
      credit risk
      financial assets potentially subject to group concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables
      ito credit sales which was r196 million 2013 r1668 million
      it is group policy to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering into sales agreements such credit
      ratings take into account local business practices are factored into a credit risk profile the group uses credit
      references credit history bank codes and credit rating information to determine the credit rating of its new
      applicants the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the fact that the customer base
      is spread over a wide variety of small and large receivables the group does not enter into complex derivatives
      to manage credit risk the group insures international trading through credit guarantee insurance company
      cgic
      credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a potential
      financial loss to the group the group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and
      obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults
      this information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and if not available the group uses
      other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers collateral
      held by the group consist of sureties signed by certain customers the quality of the financial assets impacted
      by credit risk is evidenced by the low number of incidents of default experienced and the low percentage of
      debts writtenoff when compared to revenue over the last three financial years

      liquidity risk
      the group has minimised its liquidity risk by ensuring it has adequate banking facilities and reserve borrowing
      capacity with high quality financial institutions or related companies
      the liquidity risk of the group is managed centrally by the executive directors the budgets are set and agreed

    to subsidiaries
    all companies are incorporated in south africa except where indicated with a 
      indirect

    a significant restriction on the groups ability to access or use assets and settle liabilities of the subsidiaries within the
    group is that resources cannot be readily transferred across certain subsidiaries due to the independent noncontrolling
    interests within the group and individual sureties on banking facilities which exist within the group banking structure

    shareholding alone does not drive the level of control which the group exercises over the subsidiaries significant executive
    management contribution through group leverage on banking facility negotiations and business acumen ensures that
    risks associated with changes in ownership interests that do not result in a loss of control are largely restricted to an
    effective loss on the profit attributable to the parent

    if the group were to lose control of a subsidiary during the reporting period it would most likely be as a result of a disposal
    of the investment or would lead to the potential disposal of the investment this option will only be pursued if the profit on
    disposal is adequate according to executive management

37 discontinued operations
      with effect from 1 july 2013 rolfes holdings limited commenced procedures to discontinue the operations of
      the resins business which resided in the rolfes colour pigment business the resins business proved to be
      unsustainable as it generated margins which were not in line with acceptable parameters within the group
      management felt that the resources utilised within the resins business could be more profitably applied throughout
      other facets of the group

      the operation and the associated assets and liabilities were sold as a going concern on 1 june 2014 a component
      of the assets are under lease to purchase until 30 november 2014

      the assets are being leased until 30 november 2014 the financial results of the resins business have been
      presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and the comparative income
      statement and statement of cash flows have been presented as if the resins business had been discontinued
      from the start of the comparative period
