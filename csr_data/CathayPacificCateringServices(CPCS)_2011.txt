environmental policy


cpcs is environmentally responsible by minimising the impact on the
environment whilst conducting its business




environmental achievements 2010


one of the environmental priorities at cpcs is to encourage the creation of a
green workplace we proactively look for ways to reduce energy
consumptions carbon footprints and encourage our staff to take part in
environmental activities summarised below is a review of the highlights of
actions achieved in 2010


1 replacement of led lightings
led lightings were installed in the lobby inbound and outbound areas to
replace traditional halogen lamps saving approximately 15800 kwh of
electricity per annum


2 installation of light reflectors in the cold rooms
over 390 luminosity enhancement jackets were installed in all the cold rooms
this resulted in doubling the light power lux of fluorescence light tubes whilst
reducing the number of tubes by 360 and saving 190000 kwh electricity
annually




                                        6

3 replacement of evaporator coils
the cold room evaporator coils were replaced in 2009 and 2010 to reduce
refrigerant usage this action has reduced refrigerant consumption by 25
since 2008


4 hydroflow devices installed
water contains mineral salt which accumulate on the inner surface of boilers
as mineral scales this reduces heat transfer efficiency which in turn increases
diesel consumption in 2010 hydroflow devices were installed to overcome this
drawback successfully reducing diesel consumption and saving 96600 litres
of diesel per annum


5 new catering trucks
two new euro v catering trucks were purchased in 2010 with reduced carbon
emissions and consequently contributing to a better environment


6 reducing food waste
                                    reducing food waste is one of the biggest
                                    challenges for an inflight catering facility
                                    in 2008 cpcs took the initiative to donate
                                    food waste end cuts and meat trims to a
                                    local pig farm we have subsequently
                                    expanded this practice to include the
                                    swire sd group


in 2010 cpcs conducted a feasibility study to sell watermelon endcuts to a
juice supplier after conducting several trials and evaluating internal hygiene
and logistics requirements these endcuts are now collected by the supplier




                                       7

and processed into fruit juices this initiative has reduced the need to send
waste to a landfill site whilst also generating additional revenue


7 environmental awareness week

in 2009 allowed staff to purchase or exchange books
cds and dvds so successful was this event that it
was held again in 2010 the money collected from
the sale was donated to unicef

                                    nature and have a better understanding of
                                    the geological treasures available in hong

cpcs preaches to our supply chain on our conviction in sustainable
development    we       favour   suppliers   who   champion   our   sustainable
development policy


our green purchase practice was developed since the implementation of iso
14001 ems in 1996




initiatives in 2010


1 research on sustainable seafood
our purchasing team has dedicated time into sourcing for sustainable seafood
in the market there are different suppliers putting forth different claims about
the sustainability of their products our research focus was to find the reliable
world standards about sustainable seafood meanwhile our team continues
to recommend our customers to change from wild catch seafood to farmed
sources


2 sourcing environmental products
one of our procurement objectives is to replace existing products with
environmental products by phase we have replaced our top used paper
materials such as hand paper towel printed matters and paper with fsc paper
our business name cards used to be made up of 70 fsc paper is now
printed on 100 fsc paper the team also started to source environmentally
friendly plastic products such as biodegradable plastic bag and biodegradable
plastic wrapping film



                                         27

to reduce carbon footprint we aim to source more locally rather than from
overseas


3 preparing suppliers for the minimum wage law
in view of minimum wage law is coming to force in may 2011 our team
proactively met with our contractors in early 2010 to highlight our concern and
have been working closely to ensure a smooth transition on time




action plan for 2011

code of conduct into a more comprehensive sustainable development 
supplier code of conduct guidelines and preference would be set for
suppliers to support cpcs sustainable development




2 sourcing for sustainable products
we look forward to expand our search for sustainable products we would
continue to work with our suppliers to narrow the price gap between the
sustainable products and the standard products so that customers are more
willing to adopt the sustainable products soon

            clean air charter  the commitment of cpcs


1   operate by a recognised world class standard on emission of air
     pollutants even if it is not required to do so here
     commitment of cpcs diesel used by highloaders and boilers are the
     major sources of direct emissions produced by cpcs          currently all the
     new highloaders purchased comply with euro 4 standard              all trucks
     undergo regular checks to ensure the engine is operating normally to
     prevent incomplete burning of fuel emissions from cpcss boiler are
     monitored by tests to ensure the combustion is normal cpcs only uses
     ultralow sulphur diesel


2   use continuous emission monitors cems at significant sources
     commitment of cpcs the exhaust fumes of highloaders are being
     checked during maintenance


3   publish information on energy and fuel use as well as total emissions of
     air pollutants annually and timely if emissions are significant
     commitment of cpcs our fuel consumption is reported in one of the
     data that is being collected in cpcs including our sister companies in our
     current ehs data collection regime


4   undertake to adopt energyefficient measures in their operations
     commitment of cpcs a number of projects have been done to reduce
     the energy as well as fuel needed for our operations for example


     a   energy efficient light tubes are being used to reduce the use of
          electricity ie indirect emission


                                          30

     b   demand control ventilation system installed in canteen to adjust the
          air con according to people traffic to reduce electricity consumption
     c   steam recovery system installed to recover unused steam to preheat
          water to reduce diesel consumption
     d   reflective jackets installed in light box to reduce the number of light
          tubes needed and thus to reducing the use of electricity


5   identify and encourage business measures to be taken on days when air
     pollution is high
     commitment of cpcs we have found this technically challenging to
     implement as cpcs has no control on the flight schedule and thus
     production of inflight meals but cpcs will try every single effort to reduce
     emissions at all times


6   share air quality of business with others
     commitment of cpcs we will share this information through cpcs
     annual environmental report
