                                             foreword 


                       dear partners of agrofair

                       with pride we present to you the first sustainability report of agrofair for agrofair
                       sustainability and corporate social responsibility are not issues that we need to give
                       attention just because people expect that of us for us sustainability is deeply engrained
                       in our mission we were established in 1996 as a company to put a sustainable and
                       socially responsible product on the market over the years we have been communicating
                       about our efforts and activities in various forms about the impact of fairtrade on our
                       producers in latin america and africa about our company in which the producers have a
                       say and a share about the impact that we have on the environment


       this means that 99 of our produce was certified by a sustainable label such as
              fairtrade or organic it looks like we have almost reached the goal

                       the world continues to change the issues that touch us change as well what is
                       constant is our dedication to sustainability fairness in trade and labour relations while
                       running an innovating business with this dedication we have come a long way over
                       2014 we sourced 99 of our trade volume sustainably according to the evaluation of
                       the sustainability initiative fruits and vegetables sifav this means that 99 of our
                       produce was certified by a label such as fairtrade or organic it looks like we have almost
                       reached the goal can it ever become much better yes we believe so labels and
                       certifications have a static character agrofair believes we have to tackle sustainability
                       in an active dynamic way hence our active sustainability programme in which we go
                       beyond the requirements of certifications an active approach of serious sustainability
                       issues is our goal both in our own company and in with our production cooperatives and
                       other partners such as shipping and transport companies


         agrofair believes we have to tackle sustainability in an active dynamic way
     hence our active sustainability programme in which we go beyond the requirements
                                        of certifications
                       this report is the first attempt to tell you how we see sustainability to report what we
                       have been doing this year and to inform you of our ambitions for the future we hope you

     population agriculture has been scaled up and intensified                                sustainability
     this has led to larger yields per hectare but also to depletion
     of natural resources and an increase of pests
     we recognize that we cannot close our eyes to the
     problems the world faces but also that we cannot make
     the difference by operating on our own and cooperation

     the fontagro project
     in search of biological control methods for red rust banana
     thrips and promotion of healthy soils

     some years ago our small organic banana producers from
     ecuador and peru knocked on our door they were hit by a
     massive outbreak of a pest that makes a large part of their
     bananas unmarketable bananas are their major source of
     income so you can understand the effect of this pest it is
     caused by a small insect called thrips that scratches the banana
     peel the skin scars turn reddish brown hence the nickname
     red rust by which the pest is known

     the thrips is a small insect 1  2 mm that hides in the banana
     bunch it reproduces rapidly each insect lays hundreds of eggs
     every month

     in the conventional banana production the thrips is killed by
     impregnating bunch bags covering the banana bunch with a
     strong insecticide this is prohibited in organic banana cultivation
     however consumers expect the organic banana to be just as               thrips
     shiny as the conventional one hence banana buyers do not
     tolerate the red rust spots on the peel even though there is
     nothing wrong with the fruit itself

     the outbreak caused big losses up to more than 30  40
     in some cases and producers were desperate two production
     countries that were hit hard ecuador and peru joined forces
     local universities conducted research and started to understand                in the conventional banana
     the life cycle of the thrips based on this research agrofair              production the thrips is killed by
     supported a followup project to bring the research out of the lab
     and into practice together with agricultural research agencies
                                                                                impregnating bunch bags covering
     of ecuador peru and the dominican republic wageningen                      the banana bunch with a strong
     university and research centre in the netherlands and bioversity            insecticide this is prohibited in
     international a project was started to find biological control
                                                                                    organic banana cultivation
     methods against the red rust thrips the project is cofinanced by
     the regional fund for agricultural technology fontagro

     some of the possible solutions that are being studied are the
     use of native soil fungi that kill thrips traps with sex attractants
     and other small insects that are natural enemies of thrips it was
     also found that certain agronomic practices help to control the
     damage

     when reliable biological control methods are found these can
     perhaps also be applied in the conventional sector and reduce
     the use of insecticides which represents a serious health risk for
     banana workers

     a second theme in the project is the promotion of healthy soils
     soils have a structure and physical characteristics but are               evidence is growing that healthy
     also living organisms in conventional agriculture with massive
     applications of synthetic fertilizer and pesticides of all kinds soil
                                                                                soils are rich in biodiversity and
     life is limited in the organic banana plantations the biodiversity      microorganisms they are helpful
     of the soils can be restored to a certain extent soil life is still    to supress plant diseases conserve
     poorly understood evidence is growing that healthy soils are
                                                                                 moisture and fertility and can
     rich in biodiversity and microorganisms they are helpful to
     supress plant diseases conserve moisture and fertility and             contribute to resilience of the plants
     can contribute to resilience of the plants against stress cover                    against stress
     crops composting biofertilizers erosion control intercropping
     other crops in the plantation are some of the measures that can
     contribute to the health of the soils

     communicating the results of the research projects to farmers            red rust on bananas
     is an essential part of the project this is done by means of
     websites demonstration farms and training of extension workers

     agrofair tries to bring the role of the consumer into the picture
     why is it so important that organic fruit is cosmetically spotless
     does it taste any better than if it has some kisses from nature
     is it worth throwing away 40 of the crop as second class
     fruit this year we are testing the cosmetic impact and consumer
     reception by promoting a second class banana with a special
     packaging and the slogan better tasted than wasted
     the results will be available later this year

     recycle plastic waste
     collecting and reworking of plastic bags from banana farms in peru


     in peru agrofair buys organic certified bananas no
     pesticides or fertilisers are used during the cultivation of
     these bananas in order to protect the bananas against
     insects during growth a plastic bunch bag is placed
     around the bunch

     in many villages in peru there is no collection system for
     household waste therefore people are used to throwing
     their waste anywhere they please until recently this was
     also the case for the plastic bags from banana farms you
     could see piles of plastic waste littering the side of the
     roads outside organic farms not a very organic sight

     in the past year agrofair has spent 20000 of which
     10000 was financed by mvo nederland a csr
     networking organisation for dutch companies to fund
     a consultancy by the dutch waste foundation to look
     for a solution the result is a business plan to build a
     plastic waste recycling plant the plan was designed in
     collaboration with a local plastic manufacturer the next
     step is to fund the business plan a first step was taken
     by a local entrepreneur to acquire a plastic shredder an
     essential part of the equipment with this a start could
     be made to collect plastic and process it on a small scale
     to make it suitable for further recycling in the coming
     year agrofair will invest in improvement and expansion
     of this plant


                                                                     you could see piles of plastic waste
                                                                    littering the side of the roads outside
                                                                                organic farms

                                                  recycle plastic waste 




     agrofair now requires all its producer groups to collect
     the plastic waste from their banana farms this is not an
     easy process as people have never been used to central
     collection and disposal of waste but it is clearly part of the
     development goals that agrofair and its producers have
     set themselves

     the next step is to persuade more banana producers to
     collect their waste agrofair supports local cleaning and
     awareness campaigns for example the recicla de bolsas
     plásticas starting on september 22 in querecotillo this
     is a campaign to raise awareness in order to sensitize
     banana farmers to keep the city clean we are looking for
     alternative ways to solve the waste issue in consultation
     with local governments

     sustainable
     shipping
     analysing social and ecological issues

     shipping is an essential element in our supply chain           104 ships and found that 64 were sailing under socalled
     without shipping no bananas or other tropical fruit           flags of convenience or open registry which is a risk
     shipping is an important cost component in an                  factor in social and ecological compliance 24 of these had
     increasingly competitive retail landscape the cost of          not covered their social standards by an agreement with
     shipping cannot be neglected agrofair has always been          the international transport workers federation itf in the
     concerned with social welfare of our farmers unfortunately    end one ship from the sample was broken up on a beach
     there is no such thing yet as certified fair shipping       at alang india
     this does not mean that shipping lines are not aware
     of sustainability issues and are not making efforts for         we had a workshop this year with a representative of
     improvement on the contrary however this year we             seafarers union nautilus member of itf itf has an
     wanted to form a more comprehensive picture of the issues       initiative for fair transport in the coming year we will see
     and current situation and develop ideas where we could          if this can be a way to better measure performance and
     influence things for instance in our buying standards after   where necessary raise standards
     all it would be a strange idea fair bananas transported
     unfairly we focus on two main issues

      social issues
     the labour rights of seafarers and their working conditions
     such as hours of work safety decent payment accident
     insurance hygiene food and lodging and the right to
     unionise
      ecological issues
     the ecological impact of shipping on the environment for
     example greenhouse gas emissions protection of marine
     habitats and pollution

     a special focus on substandard shipbreaking and safe
     endoflife disposal of ships which relates to both focus
     areas substandard shipbreaking is notoriously dangerous
     for the shipbreakers and hazardous waste and toxic
     materials are released into the environment this applies
     even more strongly to reefer ships using coolant gases
     harmful for the ozone layer and human health

     we work with shipping lines that have an active and
     concrete corporate social responsibility policy this
     includes putting emphasis on environmental issues and
     health and safety according to their public sustainability
     reports

     for the first time we put the magnifying glass a bit more
     on the ships carrying our goods we analysed a sample of

     panama disease
     tropical race 4
     the biggest threat for
     worldwide banana production

     fortunately a resistant replacement was found the current
     cavendish banana the whole banana industry converted
     to this cultivar unfortunately the fungus converted too the
     tropical race 4 mutation has now spread to indonesia
     philippines taiwan malaysia china and australia and
     devastated thousands of hectares banana plantations
     recently the disease made a continental leap it suddenly
     turned up in jordan oman lebanon pakistan and
     mozambique the question is how long it will take to reach
     the heart of the banana export industry in latin america
     and the caribbean

     the panama disease fungus can be transmitted via
     infected soil particles animals drainage systems and
     infected plant material there is no cure for the disease and
     there is no resistant variety

     prevention is the best strategy at this moment simple
     measures can prevent the disease from spreading further
     come clean go clean if you visit a banana plantation
     dont walk with dirty boots from one plantation to
     another do not plant new areas with plant material you
     dont know where it comes from but that is easily said
     thousands of banana producers and workers have never
     heard of the disease governments are not prepared and
     do not have the legal instruments to put infected farms
     in quarantine massive awareness raising is needed
     permanent surveillance capacity building and support
     to weak governments and a lot of research global and
     coordinated efforts are needed to keep this disease under
     control
