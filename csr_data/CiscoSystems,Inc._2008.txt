                                          future global economic growth and social progress depend on providing students with a learning
                                          environment that adequately prepares them to make a living and to contribute to their communities
                                          in an increasingly knowledgebased economy unfortunately however educational practices
                                          have not always kept pace with the needs of todays students and employers cisco is working in

                                          benefits but also have the potential to grow to serve additional populations we also look for strong

cisco and our employees

                                              engaging our employees




                                          we define employee engagement as the connection that our employees feel to ciscos vision
                                          strategies and business execution together with their commitment to helping us realize our
                                          objectives over time we have found that employee engagement is closely related to productivity
                                          and job satisfaction research shows that employees who confirm that they are closely linked with a
                                          company are 20 percent more productive and 87 percent less likely to leave their positions

                                          an important part of cisco employee engagement is the cisco code of business conduct
                                          a resource that employees can rely on for guidance as they strive to act with integrity in the
                                          workplace the code promotes

                                           honest and ethical conduct including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest
                                            between personal and professional relationships

                                          every employee is accountable for adherence to the cisco code of business conduct and we ask

                                          always focused on achieving results rather than putting in time at the office flexibility benefits

                                             here is a testimonial from a 45yearold female cisco employee who works remotely
                                             to be very honest i got involved in healthconnections because of the 100 incentive that cisco provides
                                             to participants then i got the results back and matria did a great job of reaching out to me i knew i needed
                                             to lose weight and figured the more support i received the better it would be i really wasnt expecting
                                             anything out of the program but i can now say having someone call you motivate you and give you ideas
                                             and offer ways to approach the problem differently made a tremendous difference

                                             so far i have lost 27 pounds toward my goal of 40 pounds lowered my body mass index and dropped
                                             two dress sizes when you are overweight you usually think of exercising as a chore now its not a chore
                                             because i have so much more energy but more importantly ive really changed the way i look at foods and
                                             the kinds of foods i eat i travel 7 to 14 days per month so finding a dietary plan and workout schedules
                                             that i can use when traveling is really important to me my coach was terrific in providing me with ideas and
                                             suggestions

                                          networks have become a major force in environmental sustainability efforts and they will certainly
                                          continue to play a key role in the future when we talk about going green we are really talking about
                                          mitigating the collective damage we do to the biosphere that takes more than good intentionsit
                                          requires smart strategies and comprehensive management whether we focus on office buildings
                                          data centers homes or entire cities and regions effective measurement and control are crucial to
                                          successful environmental management we can foresee a time when virtually all the devices used
                                          for managing human infrastructures are able to communicate over the network

                                          in addition people are changing how they think and behave as a result of their environmental
                                          concerns for example as networks become more effective in enabling people to collaborate
                                          across distance they also help reduce our consumption of fossil fuels for business travel and
                                          commuting less traveling means lower greenhouse gas emissions as well as more productive
                                          workers

                                          right now cisco and our customers and partners are demonstrating ways in which network

the cisco ecoboard leads environmental initiatives across the company and assesses their effectiveness the board is composed of
14 leaders representing key areas of ciscos global business

this year the cisco ecoboard made significant progress toward realizing ciscos vision of promoting environmental sustainability
through the power of innovation and collaboration the board worked with employees partners and other stakeholders to
communicate this vision and to act on it by formulating new strategies and measuring the success of existing programs

as part of our commitment to the us environmental protection agency epa climate leaders cisco launched a program in june
aimed at reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by calendar year 2012 based on a 2007 baseline we plan to meet
this goal with a variety of energyefficiency programs and with innovative enabling technologies such as the environmental data tool
for measuring and managing our energy data worldwide this tool is now considered bestofclass by epa climate leaders and will be
shared with other organizations as an iso 14001 bestpractices technology

ciscos collaborative technologies have had a measurable effect on carbon emissions within the company by reducing business
travel and they promise to have a positive impact for our customers as well cisco telepresence collaboration was highlighted in
march at the voicecon ecopanel featuring former us vice president al gore and cisco chairman and ceo john chambers cisco
telepresence was also recognized as one of the new business as usual innovations by the environmental defense fund in its 2008
innovations review

the first connected urban development global conference was held in san francisco in february followed by a second conference
in amsterdam in september these events attracted business government and academic leaders from around the world who want to
use information and communication technologies in cities to enable sustainable development and limit urban environmental impacts

in fy09 we plan to align our environmental sustainability efforts even more closely with our business priorities by means of four key
capabilities market access market enablement differentiation and positioningcompetition we will also broaden our focus from
internal operations to developing more energysaving and sustainable solutions for our customers

as ecoboard cochairs we are committed to further reducing the effects of our operations and products on the environment we
look forward to working with our customers partners employees and communities to further solutions that address
the important environmental challenges that face us all

cisco and the environment
                                          networkenabled cities
                                          for the first time in human history half the worlds population now lives in large urban areas
                                          according to unhabitat and the c40 large cities climate leadership group cities consume 75
                                          percent of the worlds energy and are responsible for 80 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions
                                          that are the chief cause of climate change cisco envisions a future where the intelligent use of
                                          networking architectures can transform urbanized societies not only by boosting productivity and
                                          spurring economic growth but also by supporting environmental sustainability and enhancing the
                                          quality of life

                                          a partnership for urban development
                                          to reduce the carbon they emit into the atmosphere businesses and government organizations
                                          have generally focused on conserving energy switching from fossil fuels to alternative energy
                                          sources and most recently exploring ways to offset or capture and store carbon emissions cisco
                                          and select cities are taking a new approach to lessening their carbon footprints as part of a public
                                          private partnership called connected urban development

                                          the connected urban development initiative focuses on providing solutions that address the many
                                          factors contributing to carbon emissions in urban environments including the use of energy and
                                          natural resources and transportation the initiative demonstrates how to reduce carbon emissions
                                          by introducing fundamental improvements in the efficiency of the urban infrastructure using
                                          information and communications technology

                                          cisco launched the connected urban development initiative in late 2006 as part of our
                                          commitment to the clinton global initiative the program draws on our own expertise as well as
                                          research from the massachusetts institute of technology the first phase concentrated on building
                                          partnerships with three cities amsterdam san francisco and seoul in february 2008 the program
                                          was expanded to include the cities of birmingham uk hamburg lisbon and madrid we will
                                          continue to engage more cities partners and global thought leaders and to scale our efforts by
                                          actively sponsoring and participating with ngos governments and businesses using collaborative
                                          technologies to share best practices

                                          solutions the partners are currently working on include

                                           making vehicle traffic flow more efficiently
                                           improving public transportation services
                                           creating a sustainable model for buildings that incorporates better energy efficiency
                                           establishing energysaving work environments such as shared office space and virtual
                                            collaboration
                                           finding better ways for cities to deliver services to residents
                                           enabling residents to selfmanage their carbon footprints


                                          all the solutions in the connected urban development portfolio require a connected it broadband
                                          network each solution must involve a practical and operational project and each must be replicable
                                          and able to deliver measurable results the diagram below shows how initiatives in the areas of
                                          work mobility energy and buildings are all built upon a solid network infrastructure

                                          cisco networking infrastructure solutions can also improve energy efficiency by facilitating the
                                          design monitoring and control of multiplebuilding management systems traditionally buildings
                                          required several separate systems to handle electrical environmental heating ventilation and air
                                          conditioning security communications and other functions

                                          the cisco connected real estate program integrates the control and management of these
                                          systems with ciscos network infrastructure this enables 24hour onsite or offsite control of all
                                          building systems over a single ip network the technology is even able to integrate devices such as
                                          printers and copiers into the energymanagement system and it can spot unauthorized personal
                                          equipment plugged into office electrical outlets

                                          a study commissioned by the converged buildings technology group a consortium of building
                                          system manufacturers found that this converged network approach generated capital savings of
                                          24 percent during the building construction phase and reduced operating expenses by 30 percent
                                          over the life of a building our own studies also show a dramatic reduction in electrical demand
                                          by more than 40 percent


                                             treehuggers embrace the connected bus

                                             treehugger a popular independent website devoted to sustainability and green topics conducted a survey
                                             of its users to determine how much the connected bus might increase ridership the survey indicated that
                                             a significant portion of respondents would switch to public transportation if they had access to a connected
                                             bus the survey also sparked a lively discussion on the site


                                                  would it make a difference in your transit

                                          as one example of how cisco webex can make an environmental difference companies are using
                                          the technology to establish virtualized contact centers that allow call center agents to work remotely
                                          from localized facilities or even from home saving the cost of setting up a centralized facility and
                                          reducing or eliminating commutes

                                          cisco unified meetingplace and meetingplace express are solutions that integrate voice video
                                          and web conferencing to make remote meetings natural and effective the us postal service
                                          usps with more than 700000 employees uses cisco unified meetingplace with integrated
                                          voice and web conferencing to replace travel to the frequent training sessions held by the agency
                                          we calculate that an effective virtual conferencing solution can reduce annual travel costs by 10
                                          million according to james shipman the uspss advanced computing environment program
                                          manager reducing travel not only saves money it also makes employees more productive
                                          increases job satisfaction and helps reduce the uspss carbon footprint

                                          just like being there
                                          collaboration flourishes in an atmosphere of trust which is based on the personal interactions and
                                          social dynamics that occur when people work in close proximity and meet frequently face to face
                                          building trust is a challenge for virtual teams that collaborate largely by phone and email because
                                          the body language and other nonverbal signals that people use to communicate in person are
                                          absent from the conversations

                                          cisco telepresence is a suite of solutions that melds highdefinition video and highquality audio
                                          and data it makes meeting participants feel as though they are in the same room together even
                                          when they are located on different continents this gives employees back the time they otherwise
                                          would spend traveling and also eliminates the fuel expenditure and carbon emissions that physical
                                          travel requires

                                             the state of missouri was spending 300 million annually to operate and maintain some 32 million
                                             square feet of space in approximately 1000 buildings rising costs for energy and real estate plus an
                                             everincreasing backlog of deferred maintenance were continually driving up expenses in 2005 the state
                                             announced that it planned to reduce its energy consumption by 15 percent by 2010

                                             to accomplish this energyefficiency objective and meet its environmental sustainability goals the state
                                             determined that it would need a real estate asset management solution linking all the buildings statewide
                                             the state of missouri enterprise asset management project begun in december 2006 and deployed
                                             throughout 2007 is considered the most comprehensive initiative of its kind in north americain terms of

cisco and the environment                 according to the us green building council commercial buildings account for
                                           70 percent of total us electricity consumption
                                           39 percent of total us primary energy use
                                           39 percent of total us greenhouse gas emissions
                                           136 million tons of us construction and demolition waste
                                           40 percent of raw materials used globally


                                          cisco connected real estate solutions help alleviate these negative environmental impacts by
                                           improving energy efficiency with better management systems
                                           decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by using less energy
                                           consolidating office space requirements
                                           reducing consumption of materials and equipment
                                           reducing office and electronic waste


                                          connected real estate solutions produce cost savings by enabling building developers owners
                                          and managers to monitor and control all building information systems using a single ip network
                                          employers are also better able to provide flexible customized workspaces for their employees and
                                          building owners can realize higher income by tailoring buildings to the requirements of each tenant

                                          a study commissioned by the converged buildings technology group a consortium of building
                                          system manufacturers found that a convergednetwork approach to building management
                                          can generate capital savings of 24 percent during the building construction phase and reduce
                                          operating expenses by 30 percent over the life of a building additional research conducted by
                                          wsp environment  energy in fy08 analyzed energy and operational cost savings before and
                                          after implementation of intelligent building management solutions the evaluation identified typical
                                          annual energy savings of 15 percent per building

                                          assessing product energy use
                                          network equipment can be divided into core edge and end devices examples of end devices are
                                          digital video recorders ip phones and broadband access routers while individual end devices
                                          do not use as much power as the energyintensive devices located at the core of the network or at
                                          service provider sites they offer the greatest opportunity for saving energy because they are sold
                                          in higher volume the technology and services that cisco delivers can have a significant impact on
                                          the operation and energy consumption of these devices ciscos greatest opportunity for improving
                                          network energy efficiency is to lower the demand for power in end devices while they are not in use

                                          our multilevel approach to addressing product energy efficiency ranges from components

                                          we use a chip design approach called applicationspecific integrated circuit asic optimization
                                          to regulate the function of an asic so it performs a specific task at faster switching speeds voltage

                                             remote systems was active for an average of 16 hours over the span of the fourday meeting

                                             for just this one event cisco estimates that remote conferencing offset more than 199 mtco2e but more
                                             important the executive meeting proved that virtual collaboration can be a successful alternative to travel
                                             even for toplevel management teams



                                          the growth in our emerging markets business is another major impetus to travel because relatively
                                          few employees in these countries must cover large geographic areas furthermore network
                                          infrastructure is less developed in the emerging market regions making it more difficult to replace
                                          travel with collaborative technology

                                          replacing business air travel with remote collaboration virtual meetings is not simply a matter of
                                          installing the equipment business processes management practices and corporate culture must
                                          all change if employees are to adapt well and take full advantage of the technologies we expect the
                                          need for travel to continually decrease over time as virtual collaboration becomes more available
                                          and prevalent in the company and among our customers and partners

cisco and the environment
                                          reducing ghg emissions from operations
                                          in the laboratories and data centers that account for a significant percentage of ciscos energy use
                                          we are working to deploy a variety of greenhouse gas reduction techniques these include

                                           taking detailed measurements of energy use
                                           using laboratory equipment that is more energy efficient
                                           employing virtualized data centers to store data
                                           adding smart powerdistribution units that automatically shut down machines that are not in use
                                           upgrading building mechanical and electrical systems


                                          we are also looking for ways to deploy the cisco connected workplace solution in additional
                                          locations

                                          one of our primary goals is to use networkbased it to reduce energy use in our facilities and to
                                          operate our owned and leased spaces more efficiently cisco is currently piloting a software solution
                                          in the united states to model the impact of various factors on carbon footprint waste reduction
                                          targets and other goals this tool allows us to forecast how the rising cost of energy will affect
                                          operations and expenditures and it lets us model how certain practices can reduce energy use

                                          we are also incorporating environmental standards into new site design and existing site retrofits
                                          and purchasing renewable energy to supplement the companys operational efforts

                                          energyefficient buildings
                                          buildings are estimated to account for perhaps half of all the worlds energy consumption and the
                                          costs associated with real estate represent the second largest expense for businesses after human
                                          resources there is great potential to cut both greenhouse gas emissions and property operations
                                          costs by reducing the amount of space needed for workers

                                          both emissions and costs can be reduced through environmentally conscious building design
                                          and improved management facilitated by networking another important step is to encourage
                                          organizational innovations such as teleworking hot desking or sharing physical resources and
                                          local work centers

                                          to minimize energy consumption within our labs we are pursuing several energy conservation
                                          strategies they include

                                           taking detailed measurements of energy flows to facilitate conservation

cisco and the environment                 we have developed and are piloting two software programs designed to achieve greater energy
                                          efficiency in the companys operations the first automated management power system software
                                          powers down equipment when it is not in use the second tmon is a webbased system that
                                          monitors and reports on equipment power status sending prompts when equipment has been left
                                          on during fy08 these programs were piloted in 116 labs and business units resulting in an annual
                                          energy savings of 5858559 kilowatthours kwh these pilot programs alone saved 703000 in
                                          addition cisco received a 104000 rebate check from its utility provider pge for energy savings
                                          in its san jose labs

                                          cisco is currently working with partners to develop specifications and standards aimed at enabling
                                          these two programs and the related power distribution units smart power strips to be integrated in
                                          our products and distributed globally

                                          we also achieve energy efficiency through retrofit remodeling and expansion projects for
                                          example we upgraded or installed variablefrequency drives on condenser water pumps and
                                          chilled water pumps in 19 buildings at our san jose california campus we estimate that this effort
                                          has the potential to save 12 million kwh a year resulting in cost savings of nearly 156000 a similar
                                          poweroptimization pilot project is underway in ciscos labs in the united kingdom

                                          cisco is a member of the green grid a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy
                                          efficiency in data centers and business computing ecosystems cisco also collaborates with

                                          centers


                                             cisco and pge partner to reduce energy consumption

                                             when demand for electricity is high and supply is short power interruptions can sometimes occur building
                                             enough power plants to satisfy every possible supplyanddemand situation is one possibility but the
                                             cost and environmental repercussions of doing that are unacceptable utilities have instituted demand
                                             response programs as fiscally and environmentally responsible ways to respond to occasional and
                                             temporary peak demand periods these programs offer financial incentives to businesses that volunteer to
                                             participate by temporarily reducing their electricity use when demand could outpace supply

                                             cisco is partnering with local utility pge to reduce electricity use at our san jose california campus
                                             during peak periods ciscos participation in the demand response program is intended to help pge
                                             avoid using fossilfuelbased energy sources such as coalburning power plants thereby reducing the
                                             amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere the energy not used by cisco can then be
                                             deployed elsewhere on the electrical grid

                                             ciscos networkenabled building automation systems simplify the task of complying with demand
                                             response requirements by making it easier to turn off unnecessary lighting switch campuswide systems
                                             to reducedpower modes and raise threshold temperatures for cooling in buildings during a demand
                                             response period cisco also asks employees to take steps to reduce their individual power usage by
                                             turning off unnecessary office lighting and powering down unneeded equipment

                                          during a recent office move the san jose california customer service team moved from traditional
                                          office space in building 18 to a cisco connected workplace environment in building 14 benefits
                                          associated with the move include

                                           44 percent savings in energy load
                                           reduction in square footage per employee from 160 to 106 square feet
                                           54 percent less cabling per employee reducing electronic waste


                                          cisco connected workplace also boosts workplace efficiency by supporting up to twice as many
                                          employees as can be accommodated in a traditional office environment the new space in building

                                          the cisco connected workplace concept has been well received by most employees who take
                                          advantage of cuttingedge technologies and enjoy the space for its natural light and openness
                                          they have also found that the workspace facilitates closer collaboration employees who have found

                                          to help minimize our environmental footprint and improve environmental practices in our office
                                          based operations cisco focuses on four key operational issues

                                           reducing water consumption and promoting the use of recycled water
                                           improving local air quality
                                           purchasing and disposing of food in a sustainable manner
                                           prudently managing waste and hazardous materials


                                          reducing water use
                                          water conservation is part of ciscos larger commitment to a cleaner environment from an
                                          operational perspective ciscos impact on water availability and quality is an important local issue
                                          conserving water in regions where it is scarce and maintaining water purity ensures that more of
                                          this critical natural resource is available to neighboring communities by minimizing our demand for
                                          water cisco can also save and reinvest these utility costs

                                          wherever appropriate cisco reduces water consumption and uses reclaimed water for landscaping
                                          and similar applications in california alone we are saving more than 81 million gallons of water each
                                          year as a result of our water conservation efforts our headquarters in san jose california uses
                                          only recycled water for landscape irrigation and fountains representing approximately 30 percent
                                          of our 700000 cubicfeet of water consumption we installed smart water controllers that employ
                                          webbased technology to automate and optimize watering schedules using weather forecasting
                                          data and horticultural science

                                          in san jose we installed faucets with solarpowered sensors that help minimize both water and
                                          energy consumption we have also completed installation of 473 waterless urinals throughout the
                                          campus which we estimate save 118 million gallons of water a year following the success of this
                                          program we plan to install these appliances at other cisco sites next year

                                          initiatives at other cisco locations include the installation of 450 lowflow sink aerators and 88 low
                                          flow shower heads at our research triangle park facility we expect that these measures will reduce
                                          water used in sinks by over 30 percent and water in showers by over 20 percent per year

                                          improving local air quality
                                          to help improve regional air quality near our headquarters in san jose cisco is cooperating with
                                          the california air resources board by avoiding the use of gasolinepowered lawn mowers during
                                          days when air quality is poor known as spare the air days during fy08 cisco refrained from using
                                          mowers a total of 292 hours when air pollution levels were highest

                                            diverted more than 1621 tons of food waste that otherwise would have been sent to local landfills
                                            the waste was then turned into compost and made available for purchase by gardeners

                                             introduce best practices that improve the companys environmental performance in innovative ways here
                                             are two recycling examples

                                             in bangalore india the implementation team entered into a unique partnership with a certified waste
                                             hauler and a local charity the waste management company collects paperbased waste from all of ciscos
                                             bangalore offices and delivers it to the samarthanam trust for the disabled which provides education and
                                             housing for visually physically and economically challenged residents students at the samarthanam trust
                                             use the paper to make braille notebooks and any material left over is recycled by the trust for additional
                                             income cisco bangalore no longer sends any paperbased waste to the landfill

                                             in richardson texas the iso 14001 implementation team developed an interactive spreadsheet that
                                             provides comprehensive status information on the recycling programs objectives targets and deliverables
                                             this tool was so successful that it is now being deployed to all the other cisco implementation teams

cisco and society                         improvement through feedback
                                          the networking academy takes a pragmatic businessoriented approach to measuring success by
                                          collecting data and applying metrics to outcomes student feedback helps make the curricula more
                                          effective and relevant for students two important tools for improving the courses and enhancing
                                          instructor performance are the comprehensive course feedback survey that every student must
                                          fill out at the close of a class and the student outcome survey that students are asked to complete
                                          several months after their last class

                                          combining data from students course feedback surveys with data from followup surveys enables
                                          the networking academy to understand the relationships between students opinions about their
                                          course experiences and the success they have later in furthering their education applying their
                                          network expertise and finding employment we have found that students with more positive
                                          perceptions about their instructor and the materials provided in their courses are more likely to
                                          achieve success in all these future pursuits

                                          relying on these and other metrics the networking academy is able to continuously improve
                                          educational performance some of the data is shared with instructors and academies to help them
                                          monitor their success other metrics are being used to monitor the success of curriculum changes
                                          and improve resources and training for instructors

                                          reaching out to more students
                                          the networking academy continually seeks to make instructional offerings more inclusive for
                                          example the global translation strategy is focused on the six un languages arabic english french
                                          russian simplified chinese and spanish these languages are spoken by more than 50 percent
                                          of the worlds population we have released 32 courses translated into un languages for the ccna

                                          furthermore to encompass more cultures and meet regional partner priorities we have established
                                          a pilot program that enables partners and the academy community to translate courses this
                                          pilot program includes the following 12 languages brazilian portuguese german greek hindi

                                          networking academy has released eight translated courses for these languages

                                          as of july 31 2008 approximately 16000 students had enrolled in one of the translated versions of

                                          expect that number to grow considerably in the next year

                                          to further broaden student access we have introduced accessible versions of our curricula for
