the requirement to register with chinese customs any branded

across emea to try to prevent the importation of canon products
that although genuine are not intended for sale in the emea
region these products imported and sold without canons
consent by a few resellers can damage consumers experience
and enjoyment of our products and may harm our brand and
reputation such products may not have correct language
manuals and may have had dangerous third party accessories
fitted by the reseller to try to localise the product for the emea
region  for example an electrical power adaptor
