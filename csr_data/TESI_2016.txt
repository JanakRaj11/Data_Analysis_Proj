ownership
the main opportunity to positively build a sustainability
focus lies here at the beginning of the ownership
phase specific goals and relevant themes are
established in a 100day plan typically involving each
portfolio companys top management in workshops
verdane holds positions on the boards of all important
portfolio companies and expects all companies to
consider sustainability when setting strategic goals as
well as having sustainability or esg as a standard
item on the board agenda for example over the past
eight years holding period we helped advance the
ideal of energy efficiency as the core to wireless
maingate which has included helping consumers
understand how and when they spend energy adjust
the pricing of energy and attaining better load
balancing on the grid

exit
we believe that for a wellmanaged portfolio company
the focus on sustainability can create quantifiable
business value during the companys exit process
both by minimising risk for the potential new owners
and by highlighting potential to ensure that
sustainability is captured and used to its full potential
it is one of the parameters used for scoring potential
sellside advisors ie whether the advisors have
relevant sustainability competence to ensure optimal
positioning of the company for exit we also ensure
that sustainability information is part of any information
