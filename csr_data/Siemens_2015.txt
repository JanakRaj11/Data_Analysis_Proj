     strategic framework


     to be successful a company needs more than concrete financial targets
     it also requires a comprehensive strategic framework that closely aligns
     the central fields of company management vision 2020 defines this frame
     work for siemens


     ownership culture
     the most important guarantee for the longterm success of our strategy
     is a strong culture its the origin and foundation for all our consider
     ations we want to reflect the basic values of responsible action within
     a strong ownership culture  throughout the entire company
       see page 42



     customer and business focus
     were sharpening our customer and business focus through rigorous
     positioning and clear priorities for stringent resource allocation for
     this reason were concentrating our efforts on selected growth fields
       see page 88



     governance
     were also strengthening our internal setup by streamlining our company
     structure and making our management even more effective  in a word

           a1  letter to our shareholders




      berlin and munich december 3 2014




      in fiscal 2014 we worked hard we were highly focused and we achieved a great
      deal despite a complex geopolitical situation our overall results for the year were
      very good we increased profit by 25  tackled a great many issues and improved
      our operations even though in some areas we could have been even more success
      ful above all we gave our company a new setup based on our vision 2020 and
      defined the direction well be taking in the years ahead

      were proud of what weve achieved so far particularly because the circumstances
      have been anything but favorable global economic development was very uneven
      in fiscal 2014 and with more than 40 critical hotspots around the world political
      uncertainties were greater than they d been in decades thats why we were right
      when we decided not to pin our hopes on a global economic recovery but to exploit
      our own strengths

      for fiscal 2014 we reported net income of  55 billion with revenue totaling
       719 billion and orders  784 billion we thus reached the targets wed originally
      set for the year and exceeded our goal for profit development while making sub
      stantial progress in strengthening our portfolio these achievements will enable us
      to propose a dividend of  330 to the annual shareholders meeting siemens is
      and will remain a good investment we stand for a longterm reliable and attractive
      dividend policy and will remain a company with a rocksolid financial basis

      nevertheless our performance could have been even better the high charges
      on which we again focused considerable attention in fiscal 2014 are not what
      siemens stands for were working hard to improve our risk management and
      we expect to see successes already in fiscal 2015

      fiscal 2014 was a year of upheaval for our company our companywide vision 2020
      concept is paving the way to the future vision 2020 defines a clear strategic direc
      tion for the new siemens were positioning our company in strategically attractive
      growth fields and demonstrating a clear focus as we gear our setup to these fields

joe kaeser
           president and
         ceo of siemens ag

      id like to extend my thanks to all 343000 siemens employees  and particularly
      to our many people in the worlds crisis regions  for their continuing dedication
      throughout fiscal 2014 the managing board team received tremendous employee
      support for the changes now necessary at our company cooperation with the
      employee representatives was also characterized by a spirit of mutual trust in addi
      tion dr gerhard cromme and the members of the supervisory board diligently
      assisted the work of the managing board providing outstanding support for all our
      activities and projects im very grateful for the commitment of all these individu
      als id also like to extend a special thanks to our customers who gave us their trust
      and confidence in fiscal 2014 well remain an expert and reliable partner for them
      in the future

      vision 2020  our companywide concept
      vision 2020 is our concept for the future and above all for achieving sustainable
      growth we proceeded calmly and carefully in drafting vision 2020 taking all the
      time we needed and then implemented the concept in record time

      in keeping with vision 2020 were positioning siemens along the electrification
      value chain electrification automation and digitalization and the impact of these
      fields on all parts of our company thats what the new siemens is all about our
      new setup will help us close the gap to our competitors we have some catching up
      to do  in terms of growth as well as margin development our goal must be to
      close that gap and well succeed although not overnight one thing however is
      clear vision 2020 has already made us stronger and brought us closer to our mar
      kets well also be investing more in innovation and market access than in the past 
      with the aim of creating sustainable value for our employees our customers and
      for you our shareholders

      for years now weve been focusing on the megatrends of urbanization demo
      graphic change globalization and climate change and now a further megatrend
      has emerged digitalization which consists in capturing and analyzing data and
      then using it to create customer value we want to play a key role in shaping this
      digital transformation businesses related to software and data analytics are
      achieving dynamic annual growth of 7  to 9  and in some fields of digitalization
       even more highly attractive markets await us here and were positioning our
       company accordingly

      our stages on the path to 2020
      our companywide reorganization will be implemented in three phases while the
      measures included in these phases will be reflected in our key financial figures at
      various times were continually addressing all of them with the same intensity and
      the same rigor

       for the short term were improving our performance and efficiency
       for the medium term were strengthening our core business
       for the long term were driving sustainable growth

      let me start with the most important thing our company s longterm sustainable
      development already today siemens is a leader in electrification and automation 
      just think of our urban mobility systems our solutions for the process industry and
      our power plants as well as our outstanding position in power plant instrumentation




110

and control technology power grids and factory and rail automation we aim
to achieve an equally strong position in the field of digitalization in which were
already a key player our worldwide installed customer base gives us not only
access to an enormous volume of data but also an indepth understanding of the
related processes and our customers appreciate these advantages

a company like siemens never stands still this was the case in the past and it will
remain so in the future thats why we intend to continue developing our port
folio with determination and the utmost prudence in order to strengthen our core
business in the medium term weve taken the first steps with our acquisition
of rollsroyces aeroderivative gas turbine business and our decision to acquire
us compressor and turbine manufacturer dresserrand these two acquisitions
will close important gaps in our electrification portfolio for the oil and gas industry
as well as for decentralized power generation

the announcement that were divesting our stake in bsh bosch und siemens
hausgeräte bsh was a further signal that were intent on implementing our
 vision 2020 the siemens brand will continue to be used for household appliances
 so siemens will still be found in the kitchen and in the laundry room however
 bsh will now be managed exclusively by bosch

we can accept the fact that we didnt win the bid for the french company alstom
although objectively speaking our offer was the better one in this connection
one thing is particularly important to me we proved that siemens is capable of
taking action in any situation whats more we had an impact on the transaction
that was not negligible for our competitors

new setup at all levels and in all business fields
our focus on what is essential is also reflected in our companys organization
weve eliminated the clusters and sectors and reduced the number of divisions
from 16 to ten in addition weve substantially strengthened our international
organization

were blazing new trails with our new setup for instance thanks to our digital
factory division were the worlds first company to bundle all the requirements for
the factory of the future under one roof the division will be our driving force
for industry 40 the muchdiscussed fourth industrial revolution in which every
aspect of production  from idea development and manufacturing to services
and recycling  will be totally integrated at siemens were not just talking about
industry 40 were implementing it

in view of the growing strategic importance of the us energy markets weve
relocated the management of our energy business as well as the responsibility for
 supporting our marketing activities throughout the americas to houston texas

to head our energy business weve brought in lisa davis who joined the managing
board of siemens ag on august 1 2014 and has since been making valuable
contributions to its work for our customers and for our company the energy
 landscape has changed dramatically not least because of political factors such as
 germanys energy transition were responding to these shifts




                                                                                          111

      our healthcare business achieved very good results overall in the past quarters an
      accomplishment were proud of however over the long term we anticipate fun
      damental changes and new business models in healthcare markets and technologies

      with the aim of continuing the success story of siemens medical engineering
      activities and of giving them greater freedom and better prospects for the future
      well manage our healthcare business independently within siemens  as a
      company within the company healthcare is not still at siemens or staying at
       siemens healthcare is part of siemens

      weve paved the way for the sale of our audiology business to the investment
      company eqt and germanys strüngmann family of entrepreneurs siemens will
       remain invested in the hearing aid business with preferred equity and will thus
       benefit from the businesss future successes not only is the transaction an excellent
       move from a financial perspective were also convinced that the new investors
       have a clear growth strategy for further developing the hearing aid business over
       the long term

      this step is fully in line with our strategy of strengthening our core business and
      of divesting activities that yield few or no synergies for the company

      looking at my description of our vision 2020 targets youll have noticed that weve
      set very ambitious goals in pursuing these goals we wont be able to please
      everyone because the pace in international competition is far too fast thats why
       we have to set priorities but our actions will be wellfocused levelheaded and
       responsible  as can be expected of siemens

      culture makes the difference
      however strategy isnt the only thing that counts here  since a strategy can
      be implemented only if its based on a strong company culture at siemens this
      means an ownership culture i asked our employees and managers how theyd
      describe ownership culture in one word responsibility was far and away the
      most common answer and thats precisely the point we must always bear in mind
      that we have a responsibility to pass on a better company to the next generation

      our foremost maxim must be always act as if it were your own company im
      convinced that an ownership culture is not only a formula for success at strong
       familyrun enterprises but that it will also be the foundation for our success its
        this culture that will shape siemens
