case studies
conservation and renewables
 a cogeneration facility at the rio allsuites hotel and casino in las vegas
  generates five megawatts of electricity reducing energy loss through transmission
  lines and capturing waste heat to create hot water harveys lake tahoe and
  showboat atlantic city also have cogeneration facilities

 the rincon band of san luiseño indians developed a onemegawatt solar plant
  that provides enough power to offset 90 percent of harrahs rincon casinos
  heating and air conditioning needs as part of the project harrahs rincon casino
  also upgraded heating and air conditioning systems saving 33 million kilowatt
  hours a year

 caesars four atlantic city resorts were collectively named new jerseys clean
  energy business leader of the year in 2009 for taking a comprehensive approach
  to energy efficiency the effort included replacing guestroom thermostats installing
  energy efficient interior and exterior lighting subsidizing public transit for 1400
  resort employees and upgrading air conditioning heating and ventilation systems
  controls in 2008 the four resorts won a regional epa environmental quality award

  and cooling systems implemented advanced control strategies for
  heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment and

  measures these improvements reduced annual
  electricity use by more than 28 million kilowatt
  hours and 8800 mmbtu




  caesars entertainment and the rincon tribe are leading community
  green efforts by example our onemegawatt solar plant has cut our
  grid consumption by almost 25 percent and our expanded chiller plant
  captures waste heat to heat our water at rincon codegreen isnt a
  slogan its a way of life

case studies
reducing waste
waste reduction is central to caesars commitment to environmental sustainability
we are proud to be the first national gaming company to join epa wastewise and
gratified that the epa recognized our hard work with a wastewise new partner gold
achievement award

here are some examples of waste reduction initiatives at caesars

 the ballys  paris las vegas combined codegreen team pursued an intensive
  mapping and walkthrough process to identify new opportunities to eliminate or
  reduce waste this led to a 50 percent increase in materials recovered for recycling
  and a 33 percent reduction in trash other ballys and paris las vegas waste
  reduction initiatives include

    new filtration and bottling systems that produce
     premium mineral water onsite packaged and
     served in reusable glass bottles and sold as an
     environmentally friendly alternative the mineral
     water has greatly reduced the volume of glass water
     bottles that go to recycling served in eight
     ballys and paris las vegas restaurants
     and another 20 caesars restaurants
     across the united states the water
     now outsells premium brands an
     additional benefit is reduced shipping
     which has cut carbon emissions by an estimated 25000 pounds a week

    management provides produce and baked goods at cost to help draw thousands
     of employees to caesars green farmers markets which offer environmental
     education and free cfl light bulbs volunteer carpenters gardeners and
     seamstresses turn excess and recycled materials into everything from gardening
     tables to purses and tote bags to be sold at the employee events the

 harrahs st louis hotel and casino in missouri won the recycling round of the
  companywide codegreen competition by recycling 8000 pounds of batteries
  23000 pounds of fluorescent bulbs five different kinds of metal and wire computer
  and slot machine circuit boards cell phones cds dvds and eyeglasses the teams
  robust employee engagement program includes comprehensive management
  training posters table tents management memos and parking lot receptacles
  where employees are encouraged to drop recyclables from home

 in indiana the horseshoe casino hammond codegreen team identified an
  innovative filtering system that turns waste vegetable oil wvo from its kitchens
  into cleanburning biofuel the fuel is used to run utility vehicles and heats a
  large warehouse all caesars us resorts filter and recycle the daily production of
  wvo or deliver it to outside vendors to be recycled and used elsewhere in 2009
  domestic properties recycled more than 640000 gallons of wvo

 at harrahs louisiana downs casino and racetrack the innovative codegreen
  team encouraged onsite horse trainers to use straw rather than wood shavings for
  stable bedding this enabled a local mushroom farm to use the bedding and manure
  for compost during the racing season the resort now converts nearly 400 tons of
  wouldbe waste into productive agricultural use




    by demonstrating that a corporate recycling program can be operated
    efficiently and sustainably we hope that city agencies will follow our
    lead and get the curbside residential programs back in operation

case studies
using less water
reducing water consumption is essential to environmental
stewardship and an important aspect of our sustainability
strategy caesars has implemented multiple conservation
approaches that have led to a companywide
reduction in water consumption of more
than 200 million gallons a year

 these approaches include installing
  more efficient fixtures offering a
  standardized inroom optout linen
  program at our hotels and serving water
  upon request only in restaurants and at
  banquets

 the innovative technology chosen for an upgrade of the laundry facility that serves
  eight of our las vegas resorts saves 72 million gallons of water a year while
  increasing capacity by 40 percent and reducing energy consumption

 water conservation programs at our golf courses have cut consumption by as
  much as 60 percent these initiatives include replacing irrigated turf in nonplayable
  areas with droughtresistant landscaping which also permits substantial cuts in
  the use of fertilizer and chemicals and increases wildlife habitat here are some
  examples of water conservation and biodiversity initiatives at caesars golf courses

    the chariot run golf course at harrahs horseshoe southern indiana resort
     achieved audubon cooperative sanctuary certification in part for cutting
     annual water use by 27 million gallons from 2007 to 2009 reducing irrigated
     areas from 126 to 76 acres and increasing the use of organic fertilizers from 55
     to 90 percent since 2006 natural habitat has increased 63 percent sparking
     the reemergence of native plant and tree species wildlife corridors have
     been built that connect to surrounding native areas chariot run won a 2009
     environmental leaders in golf award for leadership and sustainability in golf
     course management from the golf course superintendents association of
     america and golf digest

 harrahs atlantic city country club in new jersey reduced water consumption
 by 60 percent through use of drought tolerant grass varieties reduced mowable
 acreage more precise irrigation and an equipment washdown area that
 recycles water the course is now adding and repairing drainage areas which will
 cut the amount of chemicals and machinery required for maintenance

 in southern nevada the cascata and rio secco golf courses replaced grass in
 nonplayable areas with drought resistant landscaping upgraded computerized
 irrigation systems for greater efficiency and changed mowing patterns to reduce
 time spent on fairways and tees the result is reduced fuel consumption and
 greenhouse gas emissions the courses were also among the first to work with
 the southern nevada water authority snwa to implement its water smart
 landscape program

 caesars golf macau in china introduced integrated pest management to reduce
 water consumption and the use of fertilizer and pesticides it also established an
 ecofriendly habitat for ducks and other wildlife the course is in the process of
 being certified by the international audubon society
