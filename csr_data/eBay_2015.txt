since our founding weve believed we have a unique opportunity
to create positive social and environmental impact through our business


a dedication to creating value for our shareholders and society is woven into the fabric of the company  its part of who we are
in 2012 we developed a social innovation strategy and set threeyear goals across three focus areas creating economic opportunity
enabling greener commerce and powering giving in the years since weve continued to formalize our social innovation efforts and
accelerate our impact

following a strategic review of the companys growth strategies and structure ebay inc made the decision to separate ebay and
paypal into independent publicly traded companies in 2015 for more than a decade ebay and paypal have mutually benefited from
being part of one company however we believe that creating two standalone businesses best positions each company to capitalize
on their respective growth opportunities in the rapidly changing global commerce and payments landscape and is the best path for
creating sustainable shareholder value

given these changes were closing our current social innovation goals and developing new strategies to guide this work at ebay
and paypal going forward although were closing these goals sooner than expected weve made substantial progress meeting
several of our goals early and laying a strong foundation from which both companies can build in the pages that follow youll find
updates and final numbers on our goals along with statements from our new ceos devin wenig and dan schulman discussing
the opportunities they see moving forward and their commitment to using the unique assets of each company to drive meaningful
social and environmental impact additional information about our social innovation work can be found on the corporate websites
