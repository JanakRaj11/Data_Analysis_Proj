omnichannel ecommerce is growing fast and customers expect
total flexibility in terms of when where and how they order their
goods one of the consequences of these developments is
shifting supply chains which are becoming much more complex
producers are not just delivering to wholesalers and retailers but
also directly to the end consumer whether consumers receive
parcels or small packages sent through the mail network they
have evergreater expectations for example they expect
international service levels to equal domestic service levels by
providing realtime alerts about the status of their deliveries by
sms or push notification they also expect to be able to follow the
status of their mail or parcels in real time using our track  trace

strong financial position
in 2016 we delivered on our promise to further strengthen our
financial position realising an underlying cash operating income
of 245 million and net cash from operating and investing
activities of 653 million including the proceeds of the sale of the
stake in tnt express of 643 million our consolidated equity
position further improved to 79 million while our net debt
position converted into a net cash position of 86 million this
underpins both the solidity of our financial performance and our
cash flowgenerating capability which are driven by further cost
savings and price increases within mail in the netherlands and
profitable growth at parcels and international

the completion of the sale of our stake in tnt express in 2016
enabled us to further reduce our longterm debt at yearend our
cash balance of 640 million outweighed our remaining short
and longterm debt of 555 million including our eurobonds due
in 2017 328 million nominal value and 2018 177 million
nominal value

we continued to analyse our pension risk as decreasing interest
rates in the first half of 2016 impacted our pension funds
coverage ratio taking into account the funds resilience we
concluded that there is comfortable headroom for further
interest rate declines before substantial topup payments have to
be made in the second half of 2016 the interest rates partially
recovered ultimately although the funds 12months average
coverage ratio declined to 1036 2015 1068 the funds
monthend coverage ratio increased to 1083 2015 1060

the strong financial performance and improved financial position
following the sale of our stake in tnt express in combination
with the bond buyback transaction resulted in an upgrade of our
credit rating in line with our rating ambition our sp rating was
upgraded to bbb with stable outlook while moodys upgraded
its outlook on our baa2 rating from stable to positive

dividend
following the sale of our stake in tnt express with the sensitivity
of our pension obligation to interest rate fluctuations limited and
given our solid results in 2016 our consolidated equity has
improved significantly close to achieving a positive position as a
result we will recommend our shareholders to approve the
reinstatement of our dividend with a first payment based on our
2016 results

on the basis of our outlook for 2017 we trust that we will realise a
positive consolidated equity in the course of 2017 this belief
combined with our increased ambition for 2020 has led us to
adjust our dividend policy going forward with the aim of paying a
progressive dividend

based on our strong financial position and expected future
results we are confident that we will continue to be able to realise
our financial ambitions and create longterm shareholder value

in 2016 it became more challenging to achieve our four strategic
goals in tandem this is because developments in the mail market
do not always align with our ambition for example while
customer satisfaction remains a priority it could be adversely
affected by the need to adapt the number of post boxes and post
offices across the country during the year we worked hard on
maintaining the correct balance between each of our strategic
goals and will continue to do so in the years to come

continue to focus on customer satisfaction and quality
our goal is to continue to improve the quality of our mail delivery
and our customer satisfaction key elements in achieving this are
focusing on our operational performance informing our

underpinning the importance of the ongoing cost savings within
mail in the netherlands we continued our constructive
discussions with a range of works councils and trades unions at
the beginning of the year a new fiveyear social plan came into
effect this social plan which runs until 31 december 2020
applies to all employees that fall under the postnl collective
labour agreement

in 2016 we further reduced costs both through ongoing and new
programmes this included reducing our overheads and staff at
our mail operations and at our corporate headquarters we
restructured our marketing and sales organisation continued to
realise savings from the 2014 restructuring at our operations
organisation and began preparing for new cost saving plans that
will be carried out in 2017

we concluded the redesign of the car company programme in
2016 which involved restructuring about 30 hubs including 450
car routes and 900 scooter routes the programme yielded total
savings of around 18 million other initiatives that contributed to
cost savings include the further reduction of our preparation
centres from around 80 to 54 and the downscaling of our mail
retail network

we also finalised the roll out of our sorting machine extra smx
and began introducing the new sorting machine coding smc
the smc automates part of the manual preparation activities
and introduces more flexibility when realising delivery route
optimisation for example the smc adds codes to envelopes
which helps us simplify our preparation process together this
enables us to futher centralise our preparation centres

section 1 basis of preparation

    this section sets out the groups accounting principles that relate to the consolidated financial statements as a whole at the
    beginning of each section we give an overview of the items explained in that section where an accounting policy is specific to
    one note the policy is described in the sections note to which it relates

    this section further describes the critical accounting estimates and judgements or areas where assumptions and estimates are
    significant to the consolidated financial statements such as postemployment benefits and restructuring

    this section also explains the changes in accounting policies and disclosures resulting from new and amended accounting
    standards and interpretations whether they are effective in 2016 or later years and their impact



11 general information
postnl nv is a public limited liability company with its registered seat and head office in the hague the netherlands postnl provides
businesses and consumers in the benelux germany and italy with an extensive range of services for their mail needs postnls services
involve collecting sorting transporting and delivering letters and parcels for the companys customers within specific timeframes the
company also provides services in the area of data and document management direct marketing and fulfilment

the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of postnl nv and its consolidated subsidiaries hereafter
referred to as postnl group or the company

the consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by postnls board of management and supervisory board on 27
february 2017 and are subject to adoption at the annual general meeting of shareholders on 18 april 2017

12 accounting principles applied
the consolidated financial statements of postnl
have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union eu
 including international accounting standards ias and related interpretations of the ifrs interpretations committee ifrics and
 dutch law
have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for financial instruments and
have been prepared assuming a going concern

the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are included at the relevant
notes to the consolidated financial statements or in case of more general policies in note 54 to the consolidated financial statements
these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless stated otherwise all amounts included in the
consolidated financial statements are presented in euros unless stated otherwise

going concern
despite negative consolidated equity based on the cash flowgenerating capability of the company the current finance structure and
the companys ability to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business postnls financial statements
have been prepared assuming a going concern

in 2016 the company continued its steps towards recovery via a solid financial performance driven by further cost savings and price
increases helped by the sale of the stake in tnt express and despite the decrease in pension interest rates consolidated equity
attributable to the equityholders of the parent improved by 134 million to 79 million corporate equity increased by 538 million to
2742 million also net cash from operating activities positively contributed 110 million to our cash flow balance

the negative consolidated equity does not impact the companys operations the timing of debt reductions access to the available
credit facility or the stock exchange listing as at 31 december 2016 the balance of cash and cash equivalents amounted to 640
million and the company has an undrawn multicurrency revolving credit facility of 400 million its financing arrangements do not
include financial covenants a bond repayment of 328 million is due in 2017 further bond repayments are not due until 2018
although the company remains vulnerable to interest rate changes in relation to its pension obligations it can also benefit from an
environment of increasing interest rates

the company aims to continue to improve its liquidity and solvency in the light of measures already taken or planned management is
confident it will be able to recover towards a positive consolidated equity balance

13 critical accounting estimates and judgements
the preparation of postnls consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrs requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities it also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying postnls accounting policies

estimates assumptions and judgements are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the resulting accounting positions will by definition seldom equal the
related actual results on a continuous basis we evaluate our expectations with the actual results and include the learnings going
forward

the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
consolidated financial statements are disclosed below

postemployment benefits
postemployment benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate
service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made the accounting requires the company
to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate the rate of benefit increases and future mortality rates changes in
these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations funding requirements and pension cost
incurred for details of the current funded status and a sensitivity analysis with respect to defined benefit plan assumptions see note
34 to the consolidated financial statements

restructuring
restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring of our operations and overhead as a response to declining volumes in mail in the
netherlands the scope and measurement of postnls related restructuring provision depends highly on the projected cash outflows
over the future years which are mainly driven by the estimated number of staff that will either be made redundant or apply for a
mobility arrangement for details on the current restructuring provision see note 35 to the consolidated financial statements

impairment of assets
in determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill tangible fixed assets and financial fixed assets management must
make significant judgements and estimates to determine whether the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value the
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use in assessing the value in use the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the assetspecific risks determining cash flows requires the use of judgements and estimates that have been
included in postnls strategic plans and longterm forecasts the data necessary for the execution of the impairment tests are based on
management estimates of future cash flows which make it necessary to estimate revenue growth rates and profit margins

impairment of receivables
the risk of uncollectability of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with and the past due status of
doubtful debtors large accounts are assessed individually based on factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment
history in addition debtors in certain countries are subject to a higher collectability risk which is taken into account when assessing
the overall risk of uncollectability

deferred revenue and revenue related accruals
postnl has to estimate the deferred revenues from stamps sold but not yet used by its customers the company uses a seasonal model
based on historical figures in order to account for the seasonal effects on sales from stamps for example stamp sales for christmas
greetings in november and december additionally the company handles large quantities of international mail and parcel volumes to
and from foreign postal operators although the net outstanding accrual positions reflect our best estimate given the assumptions
involved final settlements might deviate from the outstanding positions

income taxes and deferred tax assets
the company is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions significant judgement is required in determining the provision and
liability for income taxes postnl recognises liabilities for potential tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be
due based on its best interpretation of the relevant tax laws and rules postnl recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered this is based on estimates of taxable income by
jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable




postnl building our future  15 financial statements                   106

contingent liabilities
legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions the cases and claims often
raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to
the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law postnl consults
with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters related to litigation postnl recognises a liability when it is determined that an
adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated

14 restatement
in q4 2016 we identified an error resulting in a vat overstatement for the years 20112015 in the amount of 14 million within the
netherlands as management concluded the yearbyyear overstatements not material for the years up to 2015 but material for 2016
the cumulative overstatement has been adjusted by a positive restatement of 2015s closing equity by 10 million net of income tax
instead of 2015s opening equity impact 8 million and net income impact 2 million

adjustments for noncash costs for pensions and provisions for pensions the ifrsbased defined benefit plan pension expenses are
replaced by the nonifrs measure of the actual cash contributions for such plans for the other provisions the ifrsbased net charges
are replaced by the related cash outflows underlying cash operating income is reported on a monthly basis to the chief operating

      accounting policies

      accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
      interest method less allowance for impairment an allowance for impairment of accounts receivable is established when there is
      objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables
      the amount of the allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
      cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement any reversal
      of the loss is included in the income statement on the same line as where the original expense was recorded

based on the 2016 financial performance a detailed review has been performed of the recoverable value of each cgu the recoverable
value is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal fair value less costs of disposal represents the best estimate of
the amount postnl would receive if it sold the cgu the recoverable value is determined based on the value in use the value in use has
been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows

for both mature markets and nonmature markets the estimated future net cash flows are based on a nineyear forecast and business
plan as management considers these forecasts reliable based on past experience for markets considered nonmature no steady state
has been achieved to date the cash flow projections have been approved by management

postnl has determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development the
weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports the discount rate used in the cgu
valuations varies from 9 to 13 pretax

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values for each individual cgu are the following
maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development in order to determine the revenue mix and growth rate
level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taking into account the nature of the underlying costs
 and potential economies of scale
level of capital expenditure in networkrelated assets and
discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and inflationrelated risks

management has carried out an impairment test for each individual cgu and concluded that the recoverable amount of the individual
cgus is higher than the carrying amount

   accounting policies

   the net defined benefit liabilityasset for all pension and other postemployment plans that qualify as defined benefit plans is
   determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value of the plan assets the
   resulting deficit or surplus is adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling and for any effect of
   minimum funding requirements

   postnl uses actuarial calculations projected unit credit method to measure the obligations and the costs assumptions are
   made about financial variables such as the discount rate and the rate of benefit increases and demographic variables such as
   employee turnover and mortality the discount rate is determined by reference to market rates using highquality corporate
   bonds the assumed return on plan assets equals the discount rate applied in the calculation of the pension obligations at the
   beginning of the year

   service costs are recognised as operating expenses in the income statement gains or losses on the amendment or curtailment of
   a defined benefit plan past service cost and gains or losses on a settlement are recognised as operating expenses in the income
   statement on the date of the amendment curtailment or settlement

   the net interest expenseincome on the net defined benefit liabilityasset asset ceiling andor minimum funding
   requirements is recognised as interest and similar expenses income in the income statement below operating income

   deviations between the expected and actual development of the pension obligation and plan assets resulting in actuarial gains
   and losses are recognised immediately within other comprehensive income net of tax the impact of the asset ceiling andor
   minimum funding requirements is also recognised within other comprehensive income net of tax

   pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or due



postnls main dutch defined benefit average pay pension plan main plan covers the employees subject to postnls collective labour
agreement and staff with a personal labour agreement in the netherlands the main plan is externally funded in stichting
pensioenfonds postnl main fund an independent legal entity which is not owned or controlled by any other legal entity and which
falls under the regulatory supervision of de nederlandsche bank

postnl also runs a number of defined benefit transitional plans which mainly consist of a conditional pension benefit soft pension
ultimately granted and financed towards the main fund at 31 december 2020 or retirement if earlier

main developments during 2016
on 31 july 2016 the main pension funds 12 months average coverage ratio was 1038 below the minimum required funding level of
1040 this triggered the start of a 5year recovery period in which topup payments might apply projections show no expected
topup payment obligation per 31 december 2016 resulting in a pension liability for the main pension plan equal to the unconditional
funding obligation of 97 million when at three subsequent quarter ends the 12 months average coverage ratio exceeds 1040 the
recovery period will end

in 2015 postnl started the payment of the unconditional funding obligation to the main fund by a first instalment of 32 million in
2016 the second instalment of 32 million was paid at 31 december 2016 the outstanding funding obligation amounted to 97
million which will be paid by 3 equal instalments during the years 2017  2019

within the other plans we have ended the funded defined benefit pension plans of our unaddressed business line within mail in the
netherlands as per 31 december 2016 as of 1 january 2017 all active participants moved into a new defined contribution pension
plan we have assessed the remaining employer risks of the ended plans as negligible on the basis hereof we have concluded that the
closed plans can be treated as defined contribution plans consequently the impact of the plan change has been recorded as a
settlement of both the benefit obligations 34 million and the plan assets 30 million the resulting settlement gain amounted to
4 million

further details of the main plan
the main plan is a defined benefit average pay scheme with a basis accrual rate of 1875 of the pensionable base and retirement age
set at 67 years the pensionable base is derived as the pensionable salary with a statutory maximum of 101519 level 2016 minus a
state pension offset

pension cash contributions are bounded by a minimum level of 215 and a maximum level of 275 of the pensionable salary base
the actuarial contributions are calculated by applying a 60month moving average pension fund discount rate the resulting
contributions are increased by 10 if the coverage ratio is below 120 and by 5 if the coverage ratio is between 120 and 130
based on the total maximum premium amount the intended pension accrual can be reduced in any year given the applicable
financing arrangements and current low interest rates it is expected that the accrual rate will be lower than the basis level of 1875
for the coming years the accrual rate for 2016 and 2017 has been set at 162 and 143 of the pensionable base respectively

in the event of a coverage deficit postnl has an obligation for topup payments of at most 125 of the funds plan obligations per
year for at most five consecutive years in determining the topup payment obligation the resilience of the pension fund will be taken
into account the requirement to supplement a deficit will be determined on the basis of the beleidsdekkingsgraad ie the 12months
average coverage ratio on 31 july 2016 the main pension fund had a coverage deficit which triggered the 5year recovery period as
mentioned in the main developments during 2016

by the end of 2016 the monthend coverage ratio of the main fund amounted 1083 2015 1060 including the outstanding
payment of the unconditional funding obligation of 97 million by postnl the increased coverage ratio is mainly explained by the
return on plan assets of 108 which more than compensated for the increased obligation due to the decrease in interest rates and the
effect of the latest longevity outlook the 12months average coverage ratio amounted 1036 per 31 december 2016 2015
1068

the returns on plan assets are linked to the strategic investment policy of the main fund the fund uses interest rate derivates to reduce
the net interest exposure on its assets and liabilities during 2016 the pension fund changed its investment strategy and exposure by
ending the equity derivates the plan assets may from time to time include investments in postnls own financial instruments through
indirect holdings by mutual funds around 75 of the funds total plan assets have a quoted market price in an active market the
unquoted part relates to investments in investment funds which invest in nonlisted assets for example real estate investments and
nonlisted derivatives

the actuarial gain of 25 million 2015 121 resulting from a change in the rate of benefit accrual follows from the maximum level of
pension cash contributions of 275 of the pensionable base given current low interest rates and the applicable financing
arrangements it is expected that the benefit accrual rate will be lower than the basis level of 1875 for the coming years

the positive adjustments of 146 million and 99 million were the consequence of the main funds change from a funded status in 2015
to an unfunded status in 2016 on the basis of ias 19 accounting triggering the release of the 2015 limitation of the main funds
funded status and adjustment of the recorded minimum funding requirement

for 2017 we expect total cash contributions of around 160 million 2016 164 including the third instalment of the unconditional
funding obligation of 33 million 2016 32

key assumptions
the discount rate is based on the longterm yield on high quality aarated corporate bonds taking into account the duration of the
projected pension liabilities of around 18 years the corporate bond yield information is sourced from bloomberg taking into account a
minimum outstanding amount and other defined selection criteria by applying curvefitting procedures a yield curve is generated
using the full yield curve the discounted value of the expected future benefit payments is matched with the comparable present value
when using a single discount rate

the conditional benefit increases are based on the derived consumer price index the assumed rate of benefit increases is based on
advice published statistics and the pension plans ambition level

assumptions regarding the longevity outlook are based on advice published statistics and experience per country the applied
prospective longevity rates are derived from the dutch mortality table ag prognosetafel 2016 taking into account experience rates
based on postal areas as applied by the main fund

sensitivity analysis of the defined benefit obligation
the table below shows the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation at yearend 2016 to deviations in key assumptions with all other
assumptions held unchanged the percentages presented exclude any impact from applying a liability ceiling nor is the impact on plan
assets asset ceiling andor minimum funding requirement included the sensitivity to life expectancy of 11 year is measured by
assuming all plan participants 1 year youngerolder the percentages presented are prior to any effect of liability or asset ceiling

section 4 capital structure and financing costs

   this section sets out the groups capital structure and related financing costs

   we start by exploring our net asset  net debt position the groups key measure used to evaluate total cash resources net of the
   current outstanding debt we next disclose how the group manages its financial risks postnls activities expose the company to
   a variety of financial risks such as market risks credit risk and liquidity risk postnls overall risk management programme
   focuses on mitigating these risks which arise in the normal course of business we continue with a summary of the groups
   financial instruments

   we conclude this section with the disclosure of our equity structure the individual components therein and an analysis of the
   movements during the year




   accounting policies

   postnl distinguishes the following categories of financial assets and liabilities
   financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
   loans and receivables
   heldtomaturity investments
   availableforsale financial assets
   financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

   management determines the classification of postnls financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition

   financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
   financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are derivatives and include the following instruments
   fair value hedges hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm commitment
   cash flow hedges hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted
    transaction or
   net investment hedges hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation

   these instruments are carried at fair value unrealised gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss if a derivative is
   designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge changes in its fair value are considered to be effective and recorded in
   a separate component in equity until the hedged item is recorded in income any portion of a change in the fair value of a
   derivative that is considered to be ineffective or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness is immediately recorded in
   the income statement

   amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit and
   loss for example when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place however when the forecast transaction that is hedged
   results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity
   and included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability

   when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting any
   cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the underlying transaction is ultimately recognised
   in the income statement when an underlying transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gains or losses that
   were reported in equity are immediately transferred to the income statement

   fair value measurement is based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active
   markets 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly prices or indirectly derived from quoted prices
   and 3 inputs not based on observable market data valuation techniques used include the use of recent armslength
   transactions reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis

    loans and receivables
    loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
    market and for which postnl has no intention of trading loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective
    interest method

    heldtomaturity investments
    heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities which
    postnl has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortised cost
    using the effective interest method

    availableforsale financial assets
    availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in
    any of the other categories above availableforsale financial assets are carried at fair value unrealised gains and losses arising
    from changes in the fair value of availableforsale financial assets are recognised in equity when availableforsale financial
    assets are sold or impaired the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as a gain or a loss

    financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
    financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are
    subsequently stated at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption
    value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the financial liability using the effective interest method

availableforsale financial assets 1 million 2015 626
on 25 may 2016 postnl completed the sale of its 146 stake in tnt express to fedex at a price of 800 per share resulting in gross
cash proceeds of 643 million and a profit of 145 million the profit includes the positive effect of 136 million from the recycling
through the income statement of the fair value adjustments previously recognised in other comprehensive income in accordance with
ias 39 the 146 stake in tnt express was considered an availableforsale financial asset measured at fair value with gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value recognised in other comprehensive income in the income statement the profit of 145 million
has been included in the interest and similar income

following the demerger of express postnl and tnt express entered into a relationship agreement and a separation agreement the
relationship agreement provided for the terms and conditions on lockup and orderly market arrangements subject to which postnl
could reduce its shareholding in tnt express over time and included certain arrangements with respect to corporate governance of
tnt express the relationship agreement was automatically terminated in may 2016 following the sale of the shares in tnt express
under the public offer by fedex the separation agreement remained valid for additional disclosure see note 39 to the consolidated
financial statements

43 financial risk management
postnls activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange risk credit
risk and liquidity risk all these risks arise in the normal course of business and postnl therefore uses various techniques and financial
derivatives to mitigate them

the following analyses provides quantitative information regarding postnls exposure to the financial risks described above there are
certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses presented primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a
parallel fashion and instantaneously at the same time for example the impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures
and vice versa is ignored in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that would normally arise from
the market shifts assumed

postnl uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging currency and interest exposures the company enters
into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with its underlying exposures and does not take
positions independent of these exposures none of these financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take
speculative positions

financial risk management is carried out by group treasury under policies approved by the board of management group treasury
identifies evaluates and hedges financial risks and exposures in close cooperation with operating units the board of management
provides written principles for overall risk management as well as written policies covering the financial risks periodic reporting on
financial risks is embedded in the overall risk framework and is provided to the board of management in a structural way

group treasury matches and manages the intragroup and external financial exposures although the company generally enters into
hedging arrangements and other contracts to reduce its exposures these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to
increased operating or financing costs




postnl building our future  15 financial statements                  137

interest rate risk
postnl identifies interest rate risk associated with its financial assets and borrowings virtually all debts are at fixed rates an increase in
the rate will therefore not affect the cost base as at 31 december 2016 postnls gross interestbearing borrowings including finance
lease obligations totalled 555 million 2015 935 all at fixed interest rates financial assets are on average of a shortterm nature

at 31 december 2016 if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1 higher with other variables held constant the
profit before income tax would have been 6 million higher 2015 4 the potential profit increase is entirely attributable to interest
income on the cash and cash equivalents equity would be positively affected by 1 million 2015 2 due to the change in the interest
curve projection applied for the calculation of the fair value of the 177223 million cross currency swap as well as the 6 million
2015 4 positive impact on profit before income taxes see also note 44 to the consolidated financial statements

foreign currency exchange risk
postnl has international operations that generate foreign currency exchange risks arising from future commercial transactions
recognised assets and liabilities investments and divestments in foreign currencies other than functional currencies of the respective
business units of postnl irrespective of whether it is the euro postnls functional and reporting currency or another functional
currency for accounting purposes the european central bank is used as the source

the main currencies of postnls external hedges are the british pound hong kong dollar and us dollar

the board of management has set a policy requiring group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against the functional
currency group companies are required to hedge material exposures via the use of foreign exchange derivatives with group treasury
whereby a financing company operated by group treasury trades these foreign exchange derivatives with external banks as at 31
december 2016 postnl had no net investment hedges outstanding significant acquisitions and local debt are usually funded in the
currency of the underlying assets

as at 31 december 2016 if the euro had weakened 10 against the british pound the hong kong dollar and the us dollar with all other
variables held constant the profit before income taxes on the foreign exchange exposure on financial instruments would have been 0
million lowerhigher 2015 0 in 2016 the net income sensitivity to movements in europound sterling eurohk dollar and eurous
dollar exchange rates compared to 2015 did not change equity would have been negatively impacted by 3 million 2015 7 positive
all related to the move in the hedge reserve

credit risk
credit risk represents the potential losses that the company would incur if counterparties are unable to fulfil the terms of underlying
agreements credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as
credit exposures relating to customers the credit risk exposure is minimised by only transacting with financial institutions ensuring
established credit guidelines are met and by managing its customer portfolio

on the reporting date there was no significant concentration of credit risk across the customer portfolio the top 10 trade accounts
receivable accounted for 12 of outstanding trade receivables as at 31 december 2016 the outstanding receivable of 22
million at 31 december 2015 related to riscossione sicilia has been fully paid in 2016

liquidity risk
prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash the availability of funding through an adequate amount of
committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses
postnl attempts to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available the terms and conditions of postnls
material longterm and shortterm debts as well as its material drawn or undrawn committed credit facilities do not include any
financial covenants there are no obligations to accelerate repayments of these material debts and committed facilities in the event of
a credit rating downgrade a downgrade in postnls credit rating may negatively affect its ability to obtain funds from financial
institutions and banks and increase its financing costs by increasing the interest rates on its outstanding debt or the interest rates at
which the company is able to refinance existing debt or incur new debt

at 31 december 2016 the 400 million committed credit facility maturity date 10 april 2021 was undrawn 2015 undrawn

the following table analyses postnls financial liabilities categorising them into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining
period on the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date the outgoing flows disclosed in the table are the contractual
undiscounted cash flows that contain the redemptions and interest payments

   accounting policies

   equitysettled sharebased compensation plans
   postnl operates a number of equitysettled sharebased compensation plans under which the employees receive conditional
   shares of the group for services rendered the fair value of the employee services received as measured at the grant date in
   exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity

   nonmarket performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of conditional shares that are
   expected to vest the total expense is recognised over the vesting period which is the period over which all the specified vesting
   conditions are to be satisfied in addition for some sharebased compensation plans employees provide services in advance of
   the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense between service
   commencement date and grant date at the end of each reporting period the group revises its estimates of the number of shares
   that are expected to vest based on the nonmarket vesting conditions it recognises the impact of the revision to original
   estimates if any in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity

   cashsettled sharebased compensation plans
   until mid 2016 postnl operated one cashsettled sharebased compensation plan involving a cash payment to employees for
   amounts that are based on the price of postnls shares equal to the gain that would have been made by exercising the notional
   options and immediately selling the shares in the market the corresponding liability for the cashsettled plans was measured
   initially and at each reporting date until settled at the fair value of the rights taking into account the terms and conditions upon
   which the rights were granted and the extent to which the employees have rendered service to date any changes in fair value
   are recognised in the income statement the total expense is recognised over the vesting period which is the period over which
   all the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied at 31 december 2016 no cashsettled sharebased compensation plans
   were in force

amounted to 385681 2015 319503 which related to the performance share plan as shown below

performance share plan
the board of management is awarded a longterm incentive which represents a potential reward of 375 of the annual base salary in
the form of a performance share plan that contains threeyear internal targets the performance share plan contains the following
characteristics

   it is a conditional equitysettled share plan based on threeyear internal targets
   shares are conditionally allocated to the board of management from 2013 onwards
   a conditional dividend equivalent is added to the conditional shares equal to the dividend rights of ordinary shares
   the conditional shares and their conditional dividend equivalents will vest after a performance period of three years
   vesting is subject to the extent to which the longterm targets have been achieved
   if a member of the board of management leaves the company during the performance period due to circumstances involving fraud or
    gross misbehaviour any accrued rights on the longterm incentive plan will terminate and become void and
   if a member of the board of management leaves the company due to other reasons a pro rata performance and timebased vesting
    applies

in compliance with the dutch corporate governance code following a threeyear performance period the retention period for vested
shares expires after two years or at termination of employment if this occurs earlier for compliance reasons a sale of shares may not
occur earlier than six months after termination of the employment any sale of shares for the purpose of using the proceeds to pay for
the tax due at vesting of these shares is exempted

54 summary of all other accounting policies
consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the financial figures of postnl nv and its subsidiaries associates and joint ventures and
have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances all significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation a complete list of subsidiaries associates and joint
ventures included in postnls consolidated financial statements is filed for public review at the chamber of commerce in the hague
this list has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of article 379 1 and article 414 of book 2 of the dutch civil code

subsidiaries
a subsidiary is an entity controlled directly or indirectly by postnl nv control is defined as the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are
currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether postnl controls another entity subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to postnl and are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases

postnl uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries the consideration of an acquisition is
measured at the fair value of the assets transferred equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of
exchange the consideration transferred also includes the fair value arising from contingent consideration arrangements identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on
the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred

the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of postnls share of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary is
recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of postnls share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement

the group treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners of the group for purchases from
noncontrolling interests the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains or losses on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity

when the group ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with
the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss the fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequent
accounting for the retained interest as an associate joint venture or financial asset in addition any amounts previously recognised in
other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or
liabilities this may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled to profit or loss

the noncontrolling interest is initially measured at the proportion of the noncontrolling interest in the recognised net fair value of the
assets liabilities and contingent liabilities losses applicable to the noncontrolling interest in excess of the noncontrolling interest in
the subsidiarys equity are allocated against postnls interests except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses

functional currency and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary environment
in which the entity operates the functional currency these consolidated financial statements are presented in euros which is
postnls functional and presentation currency

foreign currency transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the
transactions monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using yearend exchange
rates foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and balances and
from the translation at yearend exchange rates are recognised in the income statement except for qualifying cash flow hedges and
qualifying net investment hedges that are directly recognised in other comprehensive income

foreign operations
the results and financial position of all group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows
 assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates
 income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and
 the resulting exchange rate differences based on the different ways of translating between the balance sheet and the income
  statement are recognised as a separate component of equity translation reserve

foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings and
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments are taken to the translation reserve when a foreign operation is
sold such exchange differences are recycled in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale

impairment of goodwill
goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset might be
impaired for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped at the lowest levels at which there are separately identifiable
cash flows being the cashgenerating units cgus if the recoverable value of the cgu is less than its carrying amount the impairment
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the cgu and then pro rata to other assets of the cgu
the recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use in assessing the value in use the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the assetspecific risks for the purpose of assessing impairment corporate assets are allocated to specific
cgus before impairment testing the allocation of the corporate assets is based on the contribution of those assets to the future cash
flows of the cgu under review impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period

impairment of investments in joint ventures and associates
postnl assesses on each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that an investment in a joint venture or associate may
need to be impaired if the recoverable value of the investment is less than its carrying amount the carrying amount is reduced to its
recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use in assessing the value
in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the assetspecific risks the fair value less costs of disposal of a joint venture or associate is
reviewed based on observable publicly available market data possible impairment charges may be reversed if there is an indication
that the impairment no longer exists or has been reduced

impairment of finitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment
at each balance sheet date postnl reviews its finitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment for an indication of
impairment if any indication exists the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated the recoverable amount is defined as the higher
of an assets fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its
carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount any impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed only if there has been a change
in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised the recoverable
amount shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in previous
periods a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement

   accounting policies

   investments in subsidiaries and associated companies
   investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are stated at cost less impairment dividend income from the companys
   subsidiaries and associated companies is recognised when the right to receive payment is established

   impairment of investments in subsidiaries
   at each balance sheet date the company reviews whether there is an indication that its investments in subsidiaries might be
   impaired

   an indication may include managements downward adjustment of the strategic plan or other areas where observable data
   indicates a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows these determinations require significant judgement in
   making this judgement management evaluates among other factors the financial performance of and business outlook for its
   investments including factors such as industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing
   cash flow

   if any indication for impairment exists the recoverable amount of the investments is estimated the recoverable amount is
   defined as the higher of an investments fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use if the recoverable amount of an
   investment is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to its recoverable
   amount any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of income

   the investments fair value less costs of disposal represents the best estimate of the amount the company would receive if it sold
   its investments the fair value of each investment has been estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows
   taking into account costs of disposal the determination of the investments value in use is based on calculations using pretax
   cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a nineyear period cash flows beyond the
   nineyear period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates

   impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates or external
   market information used to determine the investments recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised the

a complete list of investments in subsidiaries associated companies and jointlycontrolled entities will be attached to the companys
annual report made available to the chamber of commerce

a detailed review has been performed of the recoverability of the mail investments the recoverable value of each investment is the
higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal the recoverable value is determined based on the value in use as this was
higher than the fair value less costs of disposal at year end 2016 the value in use has been estimated on the basis of the present value
of future cash flows for all investments the estimated future cash flows are based on a nineyear forecast and business plans as
management considers these forecasts reliable based on past experience

the estimated future cash flows are derived from the most recent strategic planning approved by management including inherent
uncertainties like future volume developments and efficiency measures operating income being one of the most critical assumptions
for 2017 is estimated to be in line with 2016 the applied growth rate does not exceed the longterm average growth rates on the
related operation and market

the company has determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development
the weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports the discount rates in the
investments valuations vary from 9 to 13 pretax

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values for the investments of the company are the following
maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development in order to determine the revenue mix and growth rate
level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taking into account the nature of the underlying costs
 and potential economies of scale
level of capital expenditure in networkrelated assets and
discount rate to be applied following the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and inflationrelated risks

as the mail investments are vulnerable to changes in the discount rate and changes in operating income a sensitivity analysis has been
performed for the mail investments the sensitivity analysis included the impact of the following items which are considered to be most
critical when determining the recoverable value
an increase or decrease in the discount rate of 05 and
an increase or decrease in operating income of 5

if the discount rate were to change by 05 this would impact the mail investments by around 220 million a change in operating
income of 5 would impact the mail investments by around 150 million

the detailed review of the value of the mail investments resulted in the recoverable value of the mail investments exceeding their
carrying value by 369 million the recoverable value was derived from the 2016 strategic planning taking into account uncertainties
relating to volume decline within mail in the netherlands the value increase mainly followed from improved business plans within
parcels and spring based on the detailed review management concluded that an impairment reversal of 369 million was present
for the mail investments consequently management recorded an impairment reversal of 369 million in 2016 2015 impairment
charge of 145 within equity the revaluation reserve associated with the initial revaluation of the mail investments has been increased
by the impairment reversal amount

in 2016 the additions to capital of 3 million 2015 3 represented the companys compensation for equitysettled sharebased
payments to the investments employees as the company grants its shares directly to its investments employees without charging its
investments the company recognised in line with ifrs the increase in the investments as a capital contribution

explanation                              based on our professional judgement we consider earningsbased measures as the most appropriate
                                         basis to determine materiality we consider operating income to be the most appropriate
                                         earningsbased benchmark as it provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining
                                         materiality and is one of the key performance measures for the users of the financial statements

we have also taken misstatements into account andor possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the
financial statements for qualitative reasons

we agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of 700000 which are identified during the audit would be
reported to them as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds

scope of the group audit
postnl nv is at the head of a group of entities the financial information of this group is included in the consolidated primary
statements of postnl nv

our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities of postnl nv within the segments mail in the netherlands parcels and
international postcon nexive and spring hong kong

due to their significance andor risk characteristics we performed full scope audit procedures on the significant group entities within
mail in the netherlands and parcels and for postcon and nexive nexive spa within international specific procedures were
performed at one entity within mail in the netherlands spotta and two entities within international being nexive notifiche srl and
spring hong kong




postnl building our future  15 financial statements                     169

for the entities in scope within mail in the netherlands parcels and postcon international the group engagement team performed
the work for nexive and spring hong kong we used ey component auditors who are familiar with local laws and regulations to
perform detailed audit procedures to obtain sufficient coverage for financial statement line items from a consolidated financial
statements perspective

where the work was performed by component auditors we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at
those locations to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on
the group financial statements as a whole the group engagement team has visited all component teams

the group consolidation financial disclosures and a number of complex items were audited by the group engagement team at the
companys head office these included taxation fixed assets goodwill and mail investments impairment testing and pensions we
involved several ey specialists to assist the audit team including specialists from our tax valuations actuarial and treasury department

in total in performing these procedures we achieved by performing full and specific scope procedures the following coverage on the
financial line items




none of the remaining components represented more than 2 of total group revenue for those remaining components we
performed amongst others analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material
misstatements within those components

by performing the procedures mentioned above at entity segment and at group level together with additional procedures at group
level we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the groups financial information to provide an
opinion about the financial statements

our key audit matters
after being appointed as the companys auditor effective for the year 2016 we developed a comprehensive transition plan in
december 2015 which included specific planning activities to ensure an effective transition from the predecessor auditor the specific
planning activities included but were not limited to obtaining an initial understanding of the company and its business including
background information strategy business risks it landscape and its financial reporting and internal controls framework to assist us in
performing our risk assessment procedures we have assessed the opening balances and the selection and consistent application of
accounting policies by discussing the audit with the predecessor auditor and reviewing the predecessor auditors file furthermore in
december 2015 and january and february 2016 we attended closing meetings and audit committee meetings related to the 2015
audit the foregoing has been used as a basis for our 2016 audit plan we discussed and agreed our 2016 audit plan with the audit
committee and board of management of postnl nv in april and may 2016 and have provided status updates progress reports and
key findings from our audit process on a regular basis including the key audit matters

key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgement were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements we have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board the key audit matters are not a comprehensive
reflection of all matters discussed

these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters

we have read the other information based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial

procedures we comply with the requirements of part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code and the dutch standard 720 the scope of the
procedures performed is less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements

management is responsible for the preparation of the other information including the management boards report in accordance with
part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code and other information pursuant to part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code

report on other legal and regulatory requirements

engagement
following the appointment by the annual general meeting of shareholders on 14 april 2015 we were engaged by the supervisory
board on 11 january 2016 as auditor of postnl nv as of the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor since that
date

description of responsibilities for the financial statements

responsibilities of management and the supervisory board for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with euifrs and part 9
of book 2 of the dutch civil code furthermore management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or
error

as part of the preparation of the financial statements management is responsible for assessing the companys ability to continue as a
going concern based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned management should prepare the financial statements using
the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations or has no
realistic alternative but to do so management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the
companys ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements

the supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the companys financial reporting process

our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence
for our opinion

our audit has been performed with a high but not absolute level of assurance which means we may not have detected all material
errors and fraud

misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements the materiality affects the
nature timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion




postnl building our future  15 financial statements                172

we have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit in accordance with
dutch standards on auditing ethical requirements and independence requirements our audit included eg

   identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to fraud or error designing and
    performing audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
    basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error
    as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal control
   obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control
   evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
    made by management
   concluding on the appropriateness of managements use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence
    obtained whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the companys
    ability to continue as a going concern if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in our
    auditors report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our opinion our
    conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report however future events or conditions may
    cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern
   evaluating the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements including the disclosures
   evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
    presentation

because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion we are also responsible for directing supervising and performing the group
audit in this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities decisive
were the size andor the risk profile of the group entities or operations on this basis we selected group entities for which an audit or
review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items

we communicate with the supervisory board regarding among other matters the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit

we provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence and where applicable related safeguards

from the matters communicated with the supervisory board we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of
the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters we describe these matters in our auditors
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when in extremely rare circumstances not
communicating the matter is in the public interest

assured information on our cr performance both internally and externally so that all our stakeholders can make informed decisions to
engage with our company consequently we have integrated the monitoring and managing of financial and cr performance into our
daily data processes and engaged our external auditor ey to provide reasonable assurance on the cr information eys assurance

as part of our materiality process we looked at a combination of internal and external factors including market trends the
competition and regulatory environment our core competences our stragegy postnl 2020 concerns expressed directly by
stakeholders and broader expectations of society as part of this process we created a fivestep approach to determine material
topics identifying stakeholders stakeholder dialogue guidelines and benchmarks selection of material topics and sustainable
development goals

identifying stakeholders
from the analysis of our value creation process we determined our main stakeholder groups the table below outlines our main
stakeholder groups and their interests

stakeholder dialogue
we focus on the interests of all of our stakeholders in different ways enabling us to balance their needs to help us better understand
these needs we organise stakeholder dialogues our latest dialogue was held in october 2015 hosted by our ceo it was attended by
customers investors employees independent parcel deliverers local government representatives and social organisations

the dialogue focused on the question what will ordering and delivery look like in 2020 and what are the requirements for postnl to be
successful additionally a range of other topics were discussed during the session including
focusing on raising awareness on sustainable cooperation among companies that we work with as well as among customers who are
 ordering and receiving mail and parcels
how to transition to fossil fuelfree logistics which our stakeholders see as key to becoming the deliverer of the future

we chose not to organise a specific multistakeholder event in 2016 mainly because our first priority was to implement the results of
the stakeholder dialogue held in 2015

however as described in the chapter implementing our strategy in 2016 we did have great many stakeholder contacts during 2016
including regular interaction with customers employees investors suppliers government bodies and other stakeholders which
frequently involved discussing our sustainability ambitions plans and results

young people are our future stakeholders with their own expectations and ideas about our future business to learn more about these
ideas in 2016 we continued to have contact with the kids council the kids council is an initiative of the missing chapter foundation
and unicef nederland during the year children aged between 10 and 12 visited postnl and we asked them how can we make sure
that all employees are acting sustainably their advice was to increase our internal and external communications on sustainability
issues based on their feedback we launched an internal campaign to stimulate sustainable behaviour amongst our people

we also have regular contact with our suppliers we maintain a sustainable purchase policy urging our suppliers to conduct operations
in a socially and environmentally sound manner and constantly discuss the possibility of improvements with them we will continue to
advocate this policy by setting an example through our own sustainability approach while we use a wide range of suppliers across the
company our independent parcel deliverers and other subcontractors are the suppliers with the most material impact on our cr
performance consequently we have chosen to include the impact of these subcontractors have on our scope 3 emissions
and fatal accidents

we select suppliers that are proactive and innovative in delivering socially responsible products and services helping us reduce the
impact our purchasing has on the climate and society as much as possible additionally we always conduct business on the basis of
general purchasing terms and conditions our business principles and our sustainable supply chain policy this contains policies based
on the latest oecd guidelines we establish measurable objectives and targets to maintain and continually improve our supplier
performance when a supplier cannot meet our standards we will stimulate to develop improvement plans on the relevant themes we
will use the results of our stakeholder dialogue to further refine our sustainable procurement plans

guidelines and benchmarks
our assessment of material topics is also based on dominant topics in guidelines and benchmarks such as the gri guidelines the ten
principles of the un global compact with respect to human rights labour environment and anticorruption which we support and
the oecd guidelines the following benchmarks are particularly important for us

   dow jones sustainability index djsi in 2016 postnl became industry leader in the transportation and transportation
    infrastructure industry for the third year in a row we were ranked as gold class within the djsi in 2016 our score was 86 out of 100
    2015 82 the djsi is a worldwide benchmark in which organisations are judged on a broad range of themes the djsi is important to
    us as we can compare our results over time and benchmark our progress against our peers more information is available at
    wwwsustainabilityindicescom

   transparantie benchmark tb in 2016 our score was 176 out of 200 2015 177 placing us in fortieth position out of 483 the tb

   international postal corporation ipc with a score of 93 2015 93 we were ranked fourth out of eighteen within the ipc
    benchmark the ipc is a worldwide corporation of national providers of postal services it has defined sector goals on reduction of
    carbon emissions an annual questionnaire provides information about the sectors improvements this information is also used to
    benchmark the different postal service providers more information is available at wwwipcbe

   carbon disclosure project cdp cdp has changed its scoring method from 2016 on which made it impossible to compare our 2016
    score with that of previous year in 2016 we achieved an a rating the cdp is an international notforprofit organisation providing a
    global system for companies and cities to measure disclose manage and share vital environmental information more information is
    available at wwwcdpnet

selection of material topics
from the list of material topics that we identified based on the first three steps we made a selection of topics which are most relevant
to our stakeholders and our business in the figure below those topics in the upper righthand corner of the matrix are the most
material and are reported on quantitatively in this annual report the middle section contains topics that are qualitatively disclosed in
the report a number of topics discussed with our stakeholders or identified from benchmarks are defined as nonmaterial to our
business and are therefore not reported on




in the following table we give a short definition for each of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures describing the importance
of each topic for our business we also refer to the pages on which more information about these topics can be found

sustainable development goals
in 2015 the un general assembly formally accepted a new set of 17 measurable sustainable development goals sdgs which form
the 2030 sustainable development agenda

in 2016 we started identifying which of the 17 sdgs are most relevant to us the sdgs were established by the united nations with the
aim of ending poverty protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all after an initial assessment of the sdgs in 2016 we
identified five goals that are most relevant to us in assessing the relevancy we looked at who we are a postal and logistic solution
provider employing around 46000 people that believes that innovation plays a vital role in the development of our company in the
table below we have outlined how we started contributing to each of these goals in 2016 we will continue to report on our progress in
the years to come and add additional goals as and when we believe they become strategically relevant for our company




postnl building our future  16 cr performance statements          182

13 cr reporting process
we established a dedicated cr reporting process that enables us to report on our performance and progress cr data is collected on a
monthly basis using a dedicated it system and is then consolidated and analysed centrally we use companywide definitions when
reporting on the data which are in line with the gri g4 guidelines these definitions which do not differ from the 2015 definitions can
be found in appendix 3 glossary and definitions for the overview of all gri indicators as well as where they can be found in this report
we refer to the gri content index on postnlnlannualreview2016

internal control over cr reporting
all reported data are subject to internal validation procedures on the basis of the data owner first line of defense as well as at the data
validator level second line of defense we have an integrated internal control framework in place which specifies all financial and cr
control procedures and its timing and reporting formats our internal audit department also periodically performs audits on the quality
of data

scope of the report
the report includes cr data from all entities that are either fully or majority owned by postnl in accordance with our policy on cr
reporting all companies acquired in any given year must report cr data from the following year onwards postnl companies that are
divested  a full or partial sale whereby we no longer retain a direct or indirect controlling interest  are excluded from the cr reporting
scope for the entire year in which the divestment took place

in previous years we excluded regioservice and turbopost both of which are part of our german business postcon from our cr
reporting data this was because they are transitioning towards a model in which local entrepreneurs are made responsible for the
businesses in the region during 2016 as part of the finalisation of the strategic review of our german business we made the decision
to continue to invest in our german activities since this decision was made during 2016 we have not yet been able to include
regioservice and turbopost in our cr reporting data for that period we will include regioservice and turbopost in our cr reporting
scope from 2017 onwards

we also did not include employees of joint ventures associates and commissioncontracted workers in our cr reporting scope
commissioncontracted workers are paid by output and do not have a labour contract as subcontractors play an important role in our
business we include the impact they have in terms of absolute carbon emissions and fatal accidents these subcontractors include
independent parcel deliverers and other external parties that transport mail or parcels for us such as air freight carriers

use of estimates and judgements
in determining our carbon emissions we use carbon conversion factors taken from the 2016 uk defra tables specifically for
electricity we use the defra tables for the period 2012 till 2015 and the oecd table for 2016 as electricity is no longer part of the
defra table these conversion factors relate to internationally acknowledged organisations such as the intergovernmental panel on
climate change the international energy agency and the greenhouse gas protocol

figures related to our own carbon emissions where no full data coverage is available are extrapolated to reflect the entire postnl
organisation unless stated otherwise extrapolation is done on the basis of fulltime equivalent fte coverage or square metres the
fte and headcount data in the table for new hires and turnover is based on the number of employees in the netherlands and the data
was then extrapolated to cover the entire company

the accuracy and completeness of cr data depends on the method of measurement the calculation procedure and whether estimates
have been used methods and measurements are in line with those used in former years estimates are based on historical experience
and other factors including expectations that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances

we define coverage as the number of ftes working in entities that report data divided by the total number of ftes in the cr reporting
scope we aim to annually increase our fte coverage the data clarification table in appendix 2 shows the coverage per indicator we
have taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the cr information in this annual report is accurate




postnl building our future  16 cr performance statements              183

the carbon emissions impact for subcontractors is determined based on secondary indicators such as kilometres driven this is
because primary data such as fuel consumption are not available one significant estimation made is carbon emissions as a
percentage of total costs for delivery by subcontractors the estimations made are amongst others derived from tonnes
of carbon emissions per million of euro turnover as reported in the externally published annual reports of royal mail and deutsche post
dhl group this means that there are inherent limitations to the accuracy of the reported subcontractor carbon emissions figures the
most important ones
the subcontractor model is based on operational systems within postnl but for some subcontractor activities planned figures are
 used instead of actual figures
for commercial airline haul the subcontractor model uses volumes and kilogrammes of mail which are based on actual 2016 data
 we use the distance from the netherlands to the hub in the country of destination
to estimate the subcontractor emissions for our international operations we use the latest royal mail figures as per 18 may 2016
 reported in their annual report 201516 in combination with the most recent public figures of deutsche post dhl group as reported
 in their annual report 2015 as published on 1 march 2016

data revision
in 2016 we adjusted our reporting policy for the environmental indicator gas usage in m3m2 building the new policy provides an
improved insight into the development of our gas usage across our buildings as the indicator now excludes buildings that do not use
gas at all like our new sorting and delivery centres within our parcels segment we have adjusted the comparative figures of 2012 to
2015 accordingly the revision had no material impact on the reported co2 efficiency index results of these previous years

customer satisfaction
we measure customer satisfaction through a biannual online survey performed by an independent external research company over
30000 customers both consumers and business customers of our mail and parcels operations were invited to participate
international customers are not included the survey looks at how we resolve complaints the delivery time of letters and parcels and
the quality of our delivery

as part of our postnl 2020 strategy we are focusing on customers experiencing us as a fully integrated company by continuing to
implement one customer base we are able to develop a 360degree customer view this enables us to offer our customers the right
service at the right time this total customer experience is also supported by continually improving the integration of our online
solutions postnlnl and the postnl app the fact our customer satisfaction rate has improved solidly over the past few years
strengthens our belief that our customer focus pays off as we implement our strategy

reputation score
in addition to customer satisfaction we also monitor our corporate reputation the independent reputation institute calculates the
reptrak pulse score for our dutch operations based on a representative sample of respondents from dutch society over the last few
years our reputation score has improved by more than 10

delivery quality mail in the netherlands
one of the elements that our customer satisfaction survey focuses on is delivery quality of mail as a result we focus on making ongoing
improvements to our service level additionally as the universal service provider we have number of metrics that we measure which
determine whether we are achieving the minimum legal requirements one of these is the quality of our mail delivery each year we hire
an independent research firm to test our delivery process by sending trackable letters through our network these letters are scanned
along the entire sorting process enabling us to identify any delays in 2016 the delivery quality for standard mail was 964 well
above the minimum required level of 95

iso 9001 certification
we also use our iso 9001 certification to manage overall quality iso 9001 sets requirements for continuous quality improvements
across the company with a focus on providing better service and quality we encourage all postnl companies to acquire iso 9001
certification in 2016 the percentage of ftes working at iso 9001 certified sites was 98 2015 96

our workforce in general declines in line with the ongoing decline in mail volumes in the netherlands however this is partially offset by
the growth in our parcels and international businesses we expect the number of headcounts and ftes to further decline in the coming
years as a result of our cost savings programmes

as a postal company we hire a relatively high number of parttime employees who work with us for less than a year this is reflected in
our new hire and turnover figures there is a particularly high turnover rate among the under 30s because many students take
parttime jobs as deliverers for those employees affected by job cuts we offer a comprehensive mobility programme to help them
from worktowork

we recognise that having the right talent is vital for the future of the company from the operators of our nextgeneration sorting
machines to senior managers personal development is an important driver for most of our employees it stimulates engagement and is
key for the successful implementation of our postnl 2020 strategy

in 2016 we continued to develop learning based on the 702010 framework this framework is based on the insight that 70 percent of
learning takes place through daytoday practice while only around 10 percent comes from formal training the other 20 percent is
composed of informal coaching and supervision we offer training programmes through our postnl academy which is available to all
postnl employees this digital learning portal enables employees to further expand their personal and professional development in a
variety of ways improving their skills and ultimately their employability the postnl academy is available 247 and employees can
select which learning modules to follow themselves for new employees specific training programmes are in place

we facilitated the career development of high potentials through three career development programmes the programmes aim to
develop high potential employees on the companys leadership competences while taking them to the next level of personal
leadership we frame our development programmes in three career phases
 the young executive programme teaches graduates how to learn effectively using their own knowledge and expertise studying the
  organisation and their local environment and the companys strategy the focus is on improving their performance and personal
  development while developing a personal network within the company
 the young managers in action programme and the innovation challenge focus on professionals with four to ten years experience
  the aim is to create personal leadership develop strategic innovative and entrepreneurial competences and help participants
  discover their creative mind
 the mastering your leadership programme is targeted at professionals with more than ten years experience the aim is to increase
  their ability in interpreting the companys strategy directly into their own business environment while developing and stimulating
  entrepreneurship to generate future business opportunities

in 2016 the number of training hours per fte decreased additionally we retained investors in people iip certification coverage of
well above 90 of our headcount this certification covers a number of areas including hr policies and educational and development
opportunities

we strive for a diverse workforce at postnl diversity is not about getting the numbers right it is about creating a workforce that
represents society and feels safe and secure diversity makes us stronger in 2016 we continued to focus on hiring and promoting
female and cultural talent helping people with a distance from the labour market rejoin the workforce and the creation of a safe and
inclusive work environment we support diversity and inclusion and support networks that foster this in 2016 for example we signed
the diversity charter which operates across 14 european countries and has been signed by more than 7000 companies and
organisations

as an inclusive company we support pride the gay lesbian bi and transsexual network in 2016 our pride network was recognised as
the most engaged network by workplace pride an organisation that defends the rights of lgbts in the workplace we also participate
in events and initiatives to promote and stimulate diversity such as the gay pride canal parade

to help foster a diverse workplace we are concentrating on increasing the number of women in senior positions one way of achieving
this is by continuing with our successful women inclusion network win initiative and mentoring programmes in addition we paid
special attention to female talent in our succession and talent management approach we are also a member of the talent to the top
charter a countrywide platform to facilitate and stimulate recruitment and the development of women to senior positions in private
and public companies based on these and other initiatives we have been able to increase the number of women in management
positions over the last few years

accidents
we work hard to improve the safety of our employees as part of their work our employees drive and walk millions of kilometres each
year which means they regularly face traffic risks by training our employees to drive and work more safely we strive to further reduce
the number of accidents despite all our efforts and initiatives we deeply regret having to report one fatal accident across our
operations in 2016 2015 3 a subcontractor was hit by a car while crossing the road by foot this remains a tragic event and we
remain determined to prevent fatalities the number of serious accidents and lost time accidents decreased in 2016 we implemented
plans to reduce serious and lost time accidents we encourage all of our business units to obtain the ohsas 18001 certification which
is a standard for occupational health and safety management systems and is intended to help control risks the percentage of ftes
working in certified sites increased to 96 in 2016 2015 95

absenteeism
we focus on reducing absenteeism as this is an indicator of the overall health of our employees for example by running preventative
programmes making employees more aware of their health these programmes include enlightenment health tests and a range of
sporting associations available across the company despite our active approach and preventative programmes we saw a slight
increase in absenteeism numbers in 2016

section 4 environmental indicators

   we report on our environmental performance we strive to continually reduce our environmental impact by lowering our energy
   consumption our buildings small trucks and vans large trucks and independent parcel deliverers and other
   subcontractors impact our environmental footprint as do our business travel and company cars

   based on our materiality analysis we selected the most material environmental topics co2 nox and pm10 emissions co2 has a
   longterm impact on the climate while nox and pm10 emissions reduce air quality impacting peoples health

   the co2 efficiency index reflects our efforts to reduce our own carbon footprint we describe which actions were taken to
   improve our co2 efficiency in 2016 at the end of the section we report on our absolute co2 footprint divided into scope 1 scope
   2 and scope 3 emissions in line with the greenhouse gas protocol

as a postal and logistic solutions provider it is clear we have an impact on the environment and that our operations emit carbon as well
as other emissions we focus on reducing our environmental impact among others by offering our stakeholders environmentally
friendly logistics operations

in 2008 we introduced the co2 efficiency index our ambition is to reduce the co2 efficiency index to 45 by 2020 base year 2007 
100 the index consists of three components buildings small trucks and vans and large trucks the co2 efficiency of buildings is
measured as the amount of co2 in kilograms per square meter the co2 efficiency of trucks and vans is measured in grams co2 per
kilometer the impact of each is weighted according to their absolute carbon emissions in the base year to achieve our ambition we
take into account energy efficiency when introducing new technologies for example our nextgeneration sorting machines within our
mail in the netherlands segment and the sorting and delivery centres in our parcels segment additionally we replace fossilbased
energy with biobased energy whenever possible

the improvement in our co2 efficiency index in 2016 was helped by our decision to use 100 green gas for the heating of our buildings
in the netherlands from 2017 on the new energy contracts were signed mid 2016 in line with this decision we decided to already
compensate the carbon emissions of our gas usage as from the second half of 2016

to realise our longterm co2 efficiency index goal we will continue to optimise our logistics processes and move to biobased energy
when possible

our parcels sorting and delivery centres have an a energy label based on stateoftheart building techniques including optimal use of
day light and energyefficient sorting machines in total we operate 920000 square metres of buildings in 2016 we used 95 million
kwh of electricity 2015 98 our total gas consumption was 51 million cubic metres 2015 50

in addition to our energy reduction initiatives we also use sustainable carbonneutral electricity in all buildings in the netherlands and
in italy where we manage our own energy contracts in 2016 83 of the total amount of electricity we used was sustainably sourced
2015 89 for those buildings where no sustainable electricity is used carbon emissions are compensated by gold standard credits
in 2016 13 million cubic metres of our total gas consumption came from renewable biogas 2015 13

mid 2016 we signed new sustainable energy contracts for the period 20172020 our complete gas and electricity consumption in the
netherlands will be carbon neutral from 2017 on we decided to compensate the carbon emissions of our gas consumption already
for the second half of 2016 in line with the goal of the signed new energy contracts

to aid longterm comparability of emissions we use a correction factor called degree days to compensate for relatively mild or severe
winter conditions this correction factor was used in the co2 efficiency numbers presented above kg co2m2

going forward we expect our nextgeneration sorting machines and the further implementation of led lighting to have a positive
impact on our electricity usage in 2016 we installed solar panels on six of our parcels sorting and delivery centres in 2017 we will
extend the installation of solar panels to another thirteen sorting and delivery centres the estimated energy production of these
panels is 48 million kwh in total which is the equivalent of the electricity usage of around 1500 households we expect these panels to
generate over 40 of the centres total electricity needs

as sustainable delivery is one of our material topics we concentrate on reducing the environmental footprint of our logistic activities
our customers and the society in which we operate increasingly ask for sustainable delivery alternatives for our fleet of vehicles the
focus is on optimising our network in 2016 the number of kilometers of our small trucks and vans increased with 5 due to the growth
of our parcel business

over the course of the year the number of small trucks and vans in use decreased to 1584 2015 1760 the co2 efficiency in grams
per kilometer decreased to 237 2015 231 in the last quarter of 2016 we increased the number of green gas trucks up to 295 2015
142 green gas is biobased gas made suitable for fuel usage it has virtually no carbon emissions compared to fossilbased fuels and
has significantly lower levels of nitrogen oxides nox and particulate matters pm10 emissions which helps improve air quality and
health as green gas is not yet available at all fuel stations we use compressed natural gas cng when necessary and offset the carbon
emissions of the consumed cng with gold standard credits

we plan to increase the number of green gas vehicles we operate in the coming years this decision is based on financial
environmental and practical availability of green gas at the given location considerations when vehicles are due for replacement we
investigate if green gas vehicles are suitable if it is not feasible we then introduce euro 6 vehicles also resulting in lower nox and pm10
emissions

we are looking into the feasibility of replacing some of our small trucks with escooters ecargo bikes and ebikes to further improve our
carbon footprint

large trucks are a crucial part of our logistics network forming the link between our collecting sorting and preparation locations
optimisation of our logistic networks in combination with volume growth in our parcels business led to increased loading factors for our
large trucks resulting in 728 gram carbon emission per kilometer in 2016 2015 714 especially the growth of our belgium activities
with its climate controlled transport and relatively high carbon emissions per kilometer impacted the carbon efficiency of our large
trucks

as part of the progress made in our parcel segment we invested in 52 additional large trucks the number of large trucks we operated in
2016 increased to 243 2015 191 we will continue to investigate the possibilities of alternative fuels and keep replacing vehicles that
comply to the highest euro norm to further improve the environmental footprint of our large trucks as we have yet to find a suitable
biobased fuel alternative all our current large trucks run on fossil fuels when vehicles are due for replacement we introduce vehicles
complying to the highest euro norm available this improves our nox and pm10 emission numbers as euro 6 trucks have lower emission
levels than euro 5 trucks

45 absolute carbon emission footprint
in addition to reporting on our carbon efficiency which is described in the previous sections we also report our absolute carbon
emissions in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol the absolute carbon footprint in kilotonnes is divided over three scopes
scope 1 includes all direct carbon emissions generated by sources owned or leased by postnl scope 2 includes all carbon emissions
from purchased electricity and district heating and scope 3 relates to indirect carbon emissions that arise from sources not owned or
controlled by postnl




postnl building our future  16 cr performance statements           192

scope 1
our gross scope 1 emissions stabilised in 2016 the carbon emissions of our gas usage stabilised carbon emissions from our small
trucks and vans remained stable while the emissions of our large trucks increased slightly due primarily to the insourcing of transport
activities

our net scope 1 emissions improved slightly after we compensated the carbon emissions of our gas usage from the second half of the
year in line with the new sustainable energy contracts we signed in mid2016 this resulted in a positive effect of 4 kilotonnes
additionally we purchased 13 million cubic metres of biogas from renewable sources to heat our buildings resulting in a 23 kilotonne
reduction in carbon emissions we also used green gas for part of our small trucks fleet when green gas is not available at the fuel
station we use compressed natural gas cng the carbon emissions of this cng were compensated using gold standard credits this
amounted to 02 kilotonnes of offset carbon emissions in total this resulted in a decrease of our net scope 1 emissions over the past
five years our absolute net scope 1 emissions have decreased by 23

scope 2
our gross scope 2 emissions increased slightly from 40 kilotonnes in 2015 to 44 kilotonnes in 2016 although our nominal electricity
usage decreased from approximately 98 million kwh in 2015 to 95 million kwh in 2016 this increase in emissions results from a
change in the conversion factor used since 2016 defra no longer publishes a conversion factor for electricity as such we used the
oecd conversion factor in 2016 resulting in an 18 increase in carbon emissions at a limited number of locations we use district
heating the carbon emissions of district heating remained stable at 1 kilotonne

we purchased gold standard credits to compensate the carbon emissions of buildings which we rent with an allinclusive square metre
tariff this amounted to six kilotonnes the majority of the electricity we use comes from sustainable sources and is considered carbon
neutral in 2016 the use of sustainable electricity reduced our carbon emissions by 37 kilotonnes in total our net scope 2 emissions
increased in 2016 over the last five years our absolute net scope 2 emissions have decreased by 80

scope 3
our gross scope 3 emissions decreased in 2016 the emissions of our company cars and business travel stabilised while the carbon
emissions of the independent parcel deliverers and other subcontractors declined

in 2016 we operated 1580 company cars 2015 1584 the majority were used by team leaders who visit delivery depots each day
our car lease policy stimulates the use of more fuelefficient cars since the majority of our activities takes place in the netherlands air
emissions by business travel are not deemed material the decrease of emissions from subcontractors mainly relates to the decline in
export of milk powder to china at the same time the growth in intercontinental air freight resulted in carbon emissions higher than
those from our domestic and european markets where goods are mainly transported by truck

our net scope 3 carbon emissions declined due to the drop in emissions from independent parcel deliverers and other subcontractors
we purchased gold standard credits to offset 9 kilotonnes of carbon emissions from company cars and business travel

dear shareholder

you may have seen todays announcement by the board of management and the supervisory board of postnl the boards that they
unanimously reject bposts final proposal we felt it important to write to you directly to clarify the reasons for our decision which has
been taken after careful consideration

background
as a listed company with a diverse shareholder base providing the dutch uso in a liberalised and densely regulated environment we
are one of the largest private employers in the netherlands with over 49000 employees contributing to a large nongovernmental
dutch pension fund our employees are present every day in every street in the netherlands serving over 75 million households we
consequently have many stakeholders to consider in connection with bposts proposal not just because our fiduciary duties require us
to but also because we rely and depend on the daily support of all our stakeholders

our stakeholders have contributed significantly to the success of postnl over the last years our employees our works council and the
labour unions cooperated with us in successfully implementing our restructuring plans our pension fund and employees agreed to
substantially derisk our pension liabilities political support both from the minister of economic affairs and from dutch parliament
resulted in price increases that made the uso profitable and sustainable again and last but not least our long term shareholders have
trusted on our ability to deliver on our transformation process and have proven to be patient over the last few years as we were not in a
position to pay dividends

in the coming period there are several important government decisions due in relation to the dutch postal market which are crucial to
our profitability going forward this makes the general political stance towards postnl a critical factor for the boards to consider

we have repeatedly discussed the importance of strong stakeholder support with bpost during the unsuccessful exploration of a
possible combination earlier this year again in response to bposts recent approach we have reiterated these concerns directly to
bpost in our recent letters and also addressed this in our press releases of 11 and 18 november 2016

in response to bposts approach several of our stakeholders have been explicit in their concerns including in relation to the public
statements of representatives of bpost and the belgian state these stakeholders include members of dutch parliament as well as
members of the dutch government  including the prime minister and the minister of economic affairs  as well as our large postal
customers and employee representatives one of the principal concerns expressed by political constituents is about the 40
shareholding and the related influence that the belgian state would retain in a combination essentially bringing the dutch postal
market back to the times prior to its liberalisation

considerations
postnl has consistently compared bposts proposals to the standalone scenario within a framework that includes key factors such as
price resilience governance including the influence of the belgian state employees and pensions implications for the uso
stakeholder support deal certainty and our expectation whether the combination will in the end be successful

the boards recognise that bposts final proposal represents a considerable premium for our shareholders provided that a transaction
can be completed the boards however are not convinced that a combination of the businesses of bpost and postnl will be successful
nor are they convinced a transaction with bpost can ultimately be realised

the boards are of the opinion that belgian state influence in conjunction with a complicated governance structure at various corporate
levels will make the combination inefficient and not agile to respond to its challenges the boards further lack conviction that the
necessary transformation including the necessary innovation can be achieved at the required pace lastly a transaction with bpost
lacks broader stakeholder and notably political support which support is crucial to the success of the combination




postnl building our future  appendix 4 letter to shareholders       204

as to the lack of political support the boards have carefully considered the outcome of the parliamentary debates held on 15 and 17
november and 5 december 2016 in response to questions raised and motions adopted by dutch parliament the minister of economic
affairs has made it clear that the dutch government has serious concerns about the liberalised dutch postal market if a company that
is subject to the significant shareholding and direct influence of a foreign state would acquire postnl these concerns received support
from a large majority of dutch parliament further to these debates the boards consider it likely that the minister of economic affairs
will seek to implement changes in the dutch regulatory framework to safeguard the liberalised postal market upon an acquisition by
bpost the boards consider it likely that in that case the minister will tender the uso revenue of 876m in 2015 or will adjust the
maximum return on the uso these measures are within the ministers regulatory power to decide

if these regulatory changes would be implemented this would result in a significant deterioration of postnls profitability would
jeopardise its status as uso provider would result in the loss of a large number of jobs would weaken postnls competitive position
would result in the loss of important customers would jeopardise postnls current transition and growth in ecommerce and parcels
and would leave postnl with very little to no room to invest in growth

bpost expressed  both during our discussions earlier this year and in its final offer letter  that it is not willing to accept the risk of
regulatory changes if these would severely negatively affect our business even if bpost were to accept this risk the boards cannot
accept the detrimental consequences of such regulatory changes on our business and our stakeholders

boards position in relation to bposts final proposal
we would like to reiterate that the boards are not principally against a takeover of the company the boards are fully aware of their
fiduciary duties in this respect and the importance of its stakeholders this is evidenced by our willingness earlier this year to enter into
discussions with bpost

however for reasons set out above the boards believe that a combination will not be successful in addition an acquisition by bpost
could trigger the above mentioned regulatory changes and consequently could have a significant negative impact on postnls
resilience its employees its position as uso provider its stakeholder support and its continuity initiating discussions with bpost will in
itself lead to substantial negative consequences for postnl and its stakeholders including its shareholders which cannot be mitigated
and are irreversible in nature this would bring postnl and all its stakeholders in a position that the boards cannot accept the boards
have therefore unanimously rejected bposts final proposal

standalone strategy
we are confident about our standalone strategy which the company is implementing and executing successfully based on his
statements in dutch parliament the boards conclude that the minister of economic affairs will take a substantial different view on the
above mentioned regulatory changes if postnl will not pursue a transaction with bpost as we expressed at our capital markets day on
3 november 2015 and as is underpinned by the q3 results we made significant progress in transforming postnl into an efficient
flexible customer oriented and financially healthy company over the past few years creating sustainable shareholder value this
transformation process evidences that postnl is effectively managing the effects of the declining mail volumes postnl continues to
transform and innovate its business to benefit from the strong growth in ecommerce

we appreciate that in this transformation process we asked our stakeholders and notably our long term shareholders for trust in our
ability to deliver on our promises and for patience to benefit from this transformation process particularly because postnl did not pay
dividends over the last years

we would like to emphasise that we consider shareholder remuneration our top priority and reiterate our expectation and commitment
to resume dividend payments in 2017 in addition we intend announcing measures to improve the value proposition for our
shareholders at a capital markets day to be scheduled around the presentation of our q4 16 results in preparation thereof we will
contact you as we would like to engage in a dialogue with our long term shareholders allowing you to share your views



yours sincerely
on behalf of the board of management and supervisory board of postnl
