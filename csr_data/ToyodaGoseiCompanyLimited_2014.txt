              weight reduction of about 40 was achieved in the intercooler piping parts that are located
              around the engine by making them of plastic instead of metal for this we needed to ensure
              selection of new materials that were resistant to long life coolant llc and heat and maintained
              the ﬂow volume of the coolant we were able to reduce weight with no loss of function by using
              a new process that enables molding of hollow piping shapes with threedimensional curves and
              establishing the best molding conditions the use of plastic material also alleviates shape restric

           water is an important resource and toyoda gosei is trying                            tively introducing visualization of water use at each plant
           to use less water through reuse discovery of waste and                             and working to discover waste and make improvements

               growing the led business

           led products are characterized by energy eﬃciency and long         have been focusing more eﬀort on led light sources for
           service life we develop and produce these environmentally         room lighting and plan to grow our business in this ﬁeld
           eﬃcient products at every step from elements to light
           source modules we are also developing surfaceemitting
           led room lamp units for automobiles in these units the
           entire lamp gives oﬀ a uniform light that is 25times brighter
           than conventional light bulbs while reducing power
           consumption about 84 leds have been widely used as a
           backlight light source for liquid crystal displays in notebook
           and tablet computers and automobile meters recently we                        overhead console                        surfaceemitting led room lamp unit

                                       the purpose of this report is to explain to all stakeholders the activities of toyoda gosei as a
                                       global supplier of products and services in the ﬁelds of polymers and optical semiconductors
                                       following is my opinion as a third party from the perspective of environmental reporting
     independent                       toyoda gosei is making good progress in its fifth environmental action plan which serves as a
        opinion                        roadmap for the company s environmental eﬀorts from 2011 to 2105 this plan was prepared                                                    corporate data
                                       based in their basic environmental policy all targets for the year have been achieved and
                                       some for 2015 have even been achieved ahead of time this appears to be the result of activi
                                       ties by all employees for the action items laid out in each area i hope they will continue this
                                       progress never forgetting the support they receive from stakeholders
                                       in the area of research and development further advances are being made in the develop
                                       ment of lightweight parts made of plastic instead of metal to reduce the environmental impact
                                       one speciﬁc example is their report on intercooler piping this was a very interesting example
                                       of both reducing the environmental impact from production and raising competitiveness in
                                       japan by sharing with suppliers technical information that incorporated the company s propri
                                       etary knowledge in this case the information was on the development of more compact
                                       molds that reduce the weight volume by half compared with previous molds
