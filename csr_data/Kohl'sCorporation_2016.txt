 the most sustainable building is one that already exists
 with this in mind the kic was constructed from an
 existing warehouse facility a more sustainable approach        build great
 than building an entirely new structure                        teams

 its open floor plan is flooded with natural light the result
 of high windows and skylights when artificial lighting is
 needed it comes from highefficiency led sources and
 adjusts efficiently based on the level of daylight available    drive

 to ensure maximum efficiency in the parking lot
 suntracking solar trees generate enough energy to
 power 270 office workstations
 several innovative waste reduction strategies were
 tested at the kic smart printtocloud technology
 not only makes work flows more efficient and improves
 confidentiality  it also helps reduce the average amount
 of paper recycled monthly from 11 pounds to 1 per person
 through a partnership with terracycle kic associates
 collected nearly 8000 foillined granola and energy
 bar wrappers in the first five months of the program
 these items are then upcycled into products like wallets
 and purses food services and dining facilities use
 silverware and china instead of disposable dishware
 and composting is available throughout the building
 allowing associates to reduce food waste and properly
 divert compostable paper towels in the restrooms in
 2015 more than 19500 pounds of organic and food
 waste was diverted from landfills and turned into nutrient
 rich compost
