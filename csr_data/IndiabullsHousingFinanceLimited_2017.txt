a momentous year for midincome affordable housing

towards its mission of housing for all by 2022 the government in
coordinated actions with sectoral regulators unveiled a slew of measures
to lineup incentives and direct efficient funding to affordable housing

midincome affordable housing got a boost with the inclusion of
households with incomes up to  18 lakhs per year under the credit
linked subsidy scheme clss of the pradhan mantri awaas yojana
pmay

factoring the upfront subsidy under the pmay scheme and tax savings
from deduction available against home loan repayments the effective
home loan interest rate for midincome affordable housing is at nearzero
levels these nearzero effective home loan rates are in stark contrast to
the prevalent rental yields of 3 in urban india making home purchase
extremely compelling

demand in midincome affordable housing remains strong propped up
by a young working population two thirds of which is below 35 years of
age and rising urbanisation moderating residential prices robust wage
inflation and fiscal incentives to home buyers and builders has lead to
tremendous improvement in affordability

the average age of the firsttime home buyer is falling a change in the
home loan distribution model towards a more digital internet driven
mobile platform is imminent indiabulls ehome loans is an industry
