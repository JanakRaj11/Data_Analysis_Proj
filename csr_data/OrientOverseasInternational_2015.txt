oocl receives recognition from hko wmo and ioc
for valuable contributions to the observatory and
maritime communities

oocl was presented with two awards by the hong kong
observatory hko on 6th june 2014to recognise our
outstanding efforts in providing vital weather observation
data in 2013

thirtyseven oocl vessels participated in the hong kong
voluntary observing ship hkvos program by the hko to
voluntarily provide marine climatology data needed to help
identify prevailing weather conditions for preparing
forecasts and warnings to the maritime community while
we are happy to see more companies joining the program
oocl by far has been the biggest hong kongbased
supporter of the program since its inauguration

both the oocl asia and the oocl jakarta were
presented with the diamond award and the gold award
respectively for their outstanding contributions oocl
asia in particular received special recognition as being
the only participating vessel which has made over 500
weather observation reports in 2013 since each report
usually takes up to 30 minutes to complete that means
oocl asia volunteered at least 250 hours contributing to
the hkvos program which helps improve safety in the
maritime community

apart from the quantity of the reports made the oocl
asia and the oocl yokohama were also presented with
first time participation certificates jointly issued by the
world meteorological organization wmo and
intergovernmental oceanographic commission of
unesco ioc for the high quality of the reports sent

according to the hko observational data received from
hkvos program are highly valued by the international
scientific community for climate research and climate
change studies the data provided makes significant
contribution to the wmo and ioc
