report
the consumption of the earths limited natural
resources  and resulting pollution  is seriously
undermining the planets ability to sustain life
wwfaustralia walks the talk when it comes
to implementing sustainable practices and we
continually strive to reduce the footprint of our
offices from broome to brisbane and beyond
overall we are making progress on our way
to achieving some ambitious targets in our
priority areas

  principles sustainability culture
  into practice    since relocating our three largest offices  melbourne brisbane and
                   sydney  to greener more efficient buildings we have seen dramatic
                   improvements in sustainability behaviours
                   our staff are dedicated to minimising their own impacts on the
                   environment every day by
                   p reducing our energy and transport use and completely offsetting
                      any associated carbon emissions
                   p increasing our waste recycling
                   p conducting paperless meetings and
                   p improving the sustainability of our procurement decisions
                   this approach depends on a culture of sustainability on improved
                   awareness and behaviour changes
