as part of a special pilot program today the elinoil associate company
elin biofuels produces its own biodiesel at a stateoftheart plant which it
has built in volos true to the decision made in 1999 to expand the use of
environmentally friendly fuels

at the biodiesel production plant in volos waste cooking oil is used as a raw
material every liter of used cooking oil collected and converted to biodiesel
saves 33 kilos of co2 emissions if we collect from all the different sources of
waste cooking oil available eg household use restaurants fast food outlets
etc it is clear to see the potential that exists for reducing co2 emissions in
greece all that has to be done is for this used cooking oil to be collected
and channeled into the production of biodiesel elin biofuels has begun to                      to investigate and
operate in the collection of waste cooking oil maximizing the potential we         objective
