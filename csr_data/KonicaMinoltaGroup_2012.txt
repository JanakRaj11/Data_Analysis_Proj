                                   with a changing society

                                   in recent years the world in which we all live and work has
                                   undergone drastic changes including sweeping changes in
                                   the global environment and economy as it turned out the
                                   first year of our medium term business plan g plan 2013
                                   fiscal 2011 was a year of trial and tribulation immense
                                   natural disasters such as the great east japan earthquake
                                   and ensuing tsunami and the floods in thailand threatened
                                   the very core of peoples way of life they also caused
                                   interruptions in the supply chain which brought various
                                   industries to a halt many unpredictable situations remain
                                   not the least of which are the european debt crisis and the
                                   dramatically high yen
                                          we are determined to remain essential to society and
                                   stay worthy of its support in these hard times we recognize
                                   this requires very fine attunement to the unceasing change
                                   the world is going through we must correctly identify what
                                   tomorrows society will need and how we can provide
                                   unique value to meet that need
                                          in september 2011 we announced our new brand
                                   communication message to the world giving shape to
                                   ideas the message articulates our commitment to taking
                                   on the challenges faced by our customers and the broader
                                   society and giving shape to the ideas that will lead to
                                   solutions this is the commitment shared by every person at

                                   pledge to make it a reality
                                          we hope that this message will better communicate
                                   our vision to stakeholders and help make their ideas real and
                                   bring their hopes within reach we are certain that our effort

                                   the concept of giving shape to ideas is by developing and

   i wish we could dye beautiful fabric more quickly

 inkjet textile printing enables high productivity
 high quality prints
 in inkjet textile printing the designs are created on computers and sent to a
 printer making textile printing plates used in conventional printing unnecessary
 and significantly reducing the time it takes to deliver product by spraying only a
 few picoliters of printing ink accurately on the fabric inkjet textile printing can
 easily create highquality prints and achieve effects such as color gradation fine
 lines and overlaid patterns that were very difficult to do using conventional
 printing methods the nassenger pro 1000 printer launched in 2011 boasts
 extremely high productivity with the ability to print 1000 m² of fabric per hour
 when operating at maximum capacity with its low environmental impact high
 quality and high productivity demand is high in fashion and fabric centers

  can lighting be both exciting and
  environmentally friendly




  advanced led lighting uses flat surface light
  emitting technology
  led lighting that consumes low power lasts longer and emits less heat is in great demand
  because it has a low environmental impact and is economical konica minolta has developed flat
  surface light sources by applying its optics and film technology to guide and diffuse the light of
  led point light sources the lineup includes two types of lighting a flat lighting device that takes
  up less space and a highpotential lighting device that can be used for light designing these
  new types of lighting devices are perfect for a wide variety of lighting situations

we want to reuse rare earth elements

rare earth recycling technology enables
limited resources to be reused at low cost
there are only a few supplier countries of rare earth materials worldwide and
there is concern that limited supply will lead to higher costs clearly rare
elements must be used efficiently if we are to realize a sustainable society
konica minolta has been working on developing a recycling technology for
cerium oxide a rare earth element used as a polishing material for glass
substrates for hdds using the materials technology gained from the
development of film konica minolta has successfully developed a way to
separate and remove the glass particles from the waste liquid produced during
the polishing process using a chemical agent the system does not require
large machinery allowing recycling to be done quickly and at low cost

                                    groups valuecreation process i am also very impressed by the groups new policy on conflict
                                    minerals in the future i would like to see the group focus on making public the groups
                                    initiatives in the later stages of the value chain such as its customer satisfaction surveys


                                    3 improving public disclosure of information
                                    improvements are being made in areas identified as problems in fiscal 2010 one of these
                                    improvements was the public release of engagement channels for each stakeholder another
                                    was the fact that although until fiscal 2010 the only items that were described for initiatives in
                                    areas other than the environment were qualitative targets and major items implemented in
                                    fiscal 2011 quantitative targets were published in part along with 2011 achievements and
                                    selfassessments as well as targets for fiscal 2012 as a result the groups plandocheckact
                                    pdca process is far easier to understand however the newly released fiscal 2012 targets are
                                    almost all descriptive and seem to have a lower disclosure standard compared to the fiscal 2011
                                    quantitative targets target management using key performance indicators is essential to the
                                    successful promotion of csr management thus i recommend that the group review the
                                    disclosure method in order to ensure it can disclose annual quantitative targets in advance and
                                    their results next year with a view to solid selfassessment

indicators for which medium and longterm reduction targets         with a relatively large environmental impact and target setting
have been set including co2 emissions from manufacturing           however we would advise the company to apply appropriate
