                     we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing and the related
                     implementation guidance issued by the chamber of auditors of the czech republic those
                     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether
                     the information presented in the annual report that describes the facts reflected in the financial
                     statements is consistent in all material respects with the financial statements we have checked

                     work as auditors was confined to checking the annual report with the aforementioned scope and

                     records of the company we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

                     we conducted our review in accordance with the applicable international standard on review
                     engagements and the related implementation guidance issued by the chamber of auditors of the
                     czech republic those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate
                     assurance as to whether the report on related parties is free from material misstatement the
                     review is limited primarily to enquiries of company personnel to analytical procedures applied to
                     financial data and to examining on a test basis the accuracy of information and thus provides
                     less assurance than an audit we have not performed an audit and accordingly we do not
                     express an audit opinion


                     based on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the report
                     on related parties of telefónica o2 czech republic as for the year ended 31 december 2009 is
                     materially misstated

letter from the chairman of the board of directors

                     to our shareholders


                     let me use this opportunity to review the activities development and the results of the
                     telefónica o2 czech republic group in 2009 the past year in particular from the second quarter
                     marked a significant turnaround for the worse in the macroeconomic environment in the
                     czech republic this negatively translated into a change in the behaviour and in particular in the
                     greater economizing of our mobile customers and by extension pressed our revenues down as
                     in the previous years our activities focused on accommodating  to the maximum extent possible
                      the wishes of our customers this strategy proved to be paramount in the recessed economic
                     environment as it helped us to mitigate the effects of the external factors our successful market
                     proposition consisting of new and innovated services which were very positively received by the
                     market helped us to maintain our rate of growth of our customer base both in the fixed and the
                     mobile segments our simple and clear offer has brought us more customers in slovakia as well
                     as improved financial performance


                     our services were targeted at responding to the trends in the highly competitive
                     telecommunications market in the czech republic demand for fixed and mobile services based
                     on broadband internet access data services digital television over a fixed line and converged
                     services was among the trends that were still growing strong at the same time we focused on
                     maintaining our revenues from mobile voice services by means of active migration of customers
                     to postpaid services in the area of it and business solutions we completed the integration of our
                     activities in this segment into one organisation unit of business solutions and the merger of our
                     subsidiaries active in this field of business as a result we strengthened our position among ict
                     providers in the czech marketplace thanks to the abovementioned activities we also confirmed
                     our innovation leadership in the segment of integrated business solutions and maintained our
                     primacy in the czech telecommunications market


                     in the financial area we concentrated on compensating to the maximum extent possible for
                     the negative effects of the economic environment our continued drive for efficiency helped us
                     maintain operating profitability and deliver on our oibda and operating cash flow targets


                     and now allow me to delve deeper into a review of the developments of the past year  our
                     accomplishments  and into our expectations from 2010


                     in the fixed access segment we continued to focus on slowing down the rate of decline in
                     this area by means of adding more value to the fixed line in may we introduced a brand new
                     concept of services for the residential segment unlike the previous offer of service bundles
                     affiliated with a voice tariff the new concept was built on our o2 internet and o2 tv services
                     without the requirement to pay additional fixed line fees customers could choose from a menu
                     of bonus services to complement either of the main two services or to subscribe to any other
                     fixed or mobile service with a discount a similar proposition was prepared also for our business
                     and corporate customers the new service concept began to bear fruit in the second half of the
                     year  by bringing new customers to o2 internet and helping to slow down the decline in the
                     number of fixed lines the number of retail adsl connections increased by 99 thousand in 2009
                     which is up 401 on the year 2008 the number of cancelled fixed lines fell at the same time to
                     123 thousand compared to 176 thousand in the previous year

                     for our business customers whose behaviour showed a shift in preference from traditional fixed
                     voice services to mobile voice and voice over ip services we prepared o2 neomezené volání
                     a modern voice solution in the form of a converged voice service the new service came with
                     unlimited fixed and mobile calls for a flat monthly fee i am confident that the service will help
                     in countering the trend of declining voice traffic generated from fixed lines and in increasing the
                     penetration of broadband internet


                     in the mobile segment we continued to concentrate on migrating customers from the prepaid
                     service to contracts by means of active promotion and improving the offer of unlimited o2 neon
                     tariffs the new tariff o2 neon l came with unlimited calls to any number in the o2 network
                     on weekends and offpeak we responded to the market demand for having expenditure under
                     full control by offering o2 zero a new tariff unique on the czech market which did not require
                     any commitment or payment of monthly subscription fees the price for calls sms and mms
                     were a single rate to all networks at any time of day as a result of these activities the number
                     of contract customers went up 117 in 2009 and their proportion in the total customer base
                     reached 569 at the end of the year the incremental increase of their overall share also helped
                     us in maintaining the growth rate of voice traffic


                     during the year 2009 owing in particular to the success of new tariffs o2 napište and
                     o2 nahlas we significantly slowed down the rate of decline in the number of prepaid
                     customers if the customer topped up credit regularly they could choose from several bonuses
                     including cheaper calls and sms in our network on weekends and in the evening our offer of
                     100 extra credit navíc gave new customers who topped up for the first time a bonus of 100
                     of the value of their topup with the aim of stimulating the activity of our prepaid customers
                     we organised a competition dobij a vyhraj followed up by another programme odměna za
                     dobití after each topup customers could depending on the amount of their topup claim
                     a prize or get a discount on future o2 services as a result the decline in the number of prepaid
                     customers in 2009 fell 398 year on year


                     we responded to the fastgrowing demand for internet connectivity in a mobile telephone by
                     accelerating investment in the expansion of our mobile 3g network based on the umtshsdpa
                     technology during the year we gradually covered all 13 regional capitals with the service while
                     gprs edge and hscsd services were available in other parts of the czech republic at the
                     end of 2009 we had the broadest portfolio of mobile data services which gave us a significant
                     competitive edge on the other mobile operators in the czech republic the expansion of our
                     3g network coverage was accompanied by an acquisition offer to new customers who could get
                     o2 mobilní internet for a cutrate price  either as a standalone service or in combination with
                     other services within our new service concept in the area of mobile data services we started
                     offering our blackberry service to all our customers it had previously been available only to
                     business customers


                     in the area of ict services we pursued the development of managed services ip centrex
                     managed lan and wan we were also very deeply involved in implementing modern technology
                     in the sectors of government and public administration we won a tender to implement in close
                     partnership with česká pošta the project for an information system of data boxes which became
                     a breakthrough project in the area of egovernment


                     the success of our simple and easy to understand tariffs o2 fér in slovakia helped us increase the
                     customer base and improve its quality during the past year the number of customers increased

                     almost 10 as a result our revenues and financial performance increased too we committed to
                     our longterm plans for slovakia by increasing the registered capital of telefónica o2 slovakia by
                     approximately eur 150 million to eur 200 million


                     as i already mentioned at the beginning the financial performance in 2009 was negatively
                     affected by the unfavourable macroeconomic climate and also by mobile termination fees which
                     went down another factor that impacted on the yearonyear comparison of revenues for 2009
                     were the universal service revenues total consolidated revenues reached czk 599 billion in
                     2009 which is down 74 on the previous year business revenues fell 73 to czk 598 billion
                     our operating cost efficiency measures in commercial and noncommercial areas and the effects
                     of booking several oneoff items accounted for a 97 decline in consolidated operating costs
                     as a result the consolidated operating income before depreciation and amortisation oibda
                     fell 44 to czk 271 billion which is a slower decline compared to revenues the result was an
                     oibda margin of 452 compared to 438 in 2008 this helped us maintain an aboveaverage
                     operating profitability in comparison with other operators in the region of central and eastern
                     europe the continuing decrease of depreciation of tangible and intangible assets and the
                     lower income tax rate compensated for the lower oibda and resulted in an increase of 03
                     of the consolidated net profit for 2009 which reached czk 117 billion as i already mentioned
                     above our investment in 2009 was directed at the expansion of the 3g network coverage
                     we also continued to invest in areas with a potential for growth which include mainly the
                     development of adsl and iptv technologies we also made investments in information systems
                     and technology with a view of improving the efficiency of individual processes and by extension
                     our operating efficiency the total capital expenditure fell 198 year on year in 2009 down to
                     czk 65 billion


                     in 2010 we will keep our focus on satisfying the needs of our customers through offering new
                     products and innovating our existing services i am confident that we will keep on adding
                     customers at the same rate as in 2009 and stay ahead of the competition in this respect we will
                     continue to concentrate on active promotion and improvement of our consumer proposition
                     expanding our portfolio of fixed and mobile bundles with a view to stabilising the downward
                     trend in the area of fixed lines we will also continue in our active promotion of simple tariffs
                     that bring a lot of value to the customer our activities will deliver a growth in the number of
                     customers and raise the bar of our financial performance


                     we expect that the challenging environment affected by the economic recession and precarious
                     political situation in which the consumer behaviour is hard to predict will last at least for
                     the first half of 2010 mobile revenues will be under the additional strain of falling mobile
                     termination fees in addition to the above activities aimed at satisfying the needs of our
                     customers we will continue to exercise operating cost saving measures in the commercial and
                     noncommercial area with a view to maximise free cash flow generation which is among our
                     strategic priorities

                     economy which translated in an acrosstheboard slump in revenues from telecommunications
                     services the decline was not as significant as in other sectors but compared to the previous
                     period of growth it was prominent according to companys estimates the telecommunications
                     market in the czech republic contracted by approximately 5 on the previous year


                     revenues from the fixed line market recorded a yearonyear slump of approximately 9
                     while the mobile market revenues were down by approximately 6  in stark comparison to

                     of registered sim cards with a 13 month activity criterion on the other hand exceeded 130 an
                     accurate figure cannot be determined due to differences in the czech operators methodologies
                     of accounting for mobile customers which is among the highest penetration rates in europe


                     among european union member states the czech republic has for a long time been in the upper
                     echelon of countries with the highest volumes of voice traffic in mobile networks this however

                     its stead a flexible combination of broadband internet with other fixed line and mobile services
                     came to the market the new concept lets the customer choose only those services they really use
                     and save at the same time


                     combinations of mobile and fixed line services were offered also by vodafone as part of its

national and international wholesale services

                     the year 2009 saw a culmination of the market consolidation trend in the czech republic
                     which was driven by the worsening macroeconomic trends tmobile and vodafone followed in
                     the strategic footsteps of telefónica o2 and embarked on a course of gradual transformation
                     from purely mobile into comprehensive providers of telecommunications services with
                     a broader portfolio of options including fixed access the operators responded to the economic
                     developments by an increasingly strict cost control and by implementation of economizing
                     measures in the wholesale market this demonstrated itself in the form of increased pressures to
                     drive down the prices a higher rate of migration to services with a lower arpu and the general
                     stagnation of demand for services


                     telefónica o2 also presented an innovated portfolio of products following changes in the
                     legislation the company began to offer the socalled naked adsl in which the alternative
                     provider purchased only the adsl line without the need for a telephone connection together
                     with the increased demand for leases of transmission infrastructure on the part of mobile
                     operators the service acted to an extent as a stimulus in the wholesale telecommunications
                     market in the second half of 2009 the year 2009 also saw a revived interest in ethernet data
                     services a large part of new services sold was however only a result of migration from the
                     traditional service of leased lines


                     in the area of international data and internet services the growing demand for international
                     transmission capacity on the part of international partners has produced additional requests for
                     extra capacity especially for international ip connectivity telefónica o2 registered a growing
                     demand and increased sales of highcapacity international leased lines lambda 25 and 10 gbps
                     the companys own international ip connectivity also increased in collaboration with other
                     members in the telefónica group and other international partners telefónica o2 successfully
                     implemented several rather large international vpn projects it also expanded its functional
                     integration collaboration with telefónica international wholesale services the economic
                     recession caused a downturn in the demand for new international leased lines existing lines were
                     cancelled by customers and there were also pressures to drive down the prices


                     in the area of wholesale international voice services telefónica o2 further strengthened its
                     leading position in the markets of central and eastern europe the company increased the
                     number of direct lines interconnecting it with other mobile and fixed line operators in europe
                     and beyond and it shifted its attention to russia and the middle east compared to 2008 the
                     volume of transit services was up 5 and reached a record of nearly 15 billion minutes the
                     company also expanded its proposition to mobile operators  it added a service of video call
                     transit to foreign mobile networks


                     at the end of 2009 the fixed line network of telefónica o2 was interconnected with the
                     networks of seventeen operators of fixed networks of public electronic communications and its
                     mobile network was interconnected with the networks of eleven operators of public electronic
                     communications in the czech republic

consolidated         were negatively impacted by the challenging environment and mobile termination rate mtr

revenues             cuts in addition revenues from universal service negatively impacted the yearonyear revenue
                     comparison in the second half and full year 2009


                     the total consolidated voice revenues voiceoutgoing interconnection and other wholesale
                     services monthly and oneoff charges from voice services and connection charges amounted to
                     czk 387 billion in 2009 down 88  year on year


                     in the highly penetrated mobile market in the czech republic the total mobile customer base
                     increased by 30 year on year and reached 4945 thousand at the end of 2009 the number
                     of contract customers went up 117 year on year reaching 2814 thousand at the end of 2009
                     with 295 thousand net additions in the year 71 year on year this solid performance was
                     driven by the steady uptake of o2 neon tariffs and the customer migration from the prepaid
                     to the contract segment at the end of 2009 contract customers represented 569 of the base
                     45 pp year on year the number of prepaid active customers reached 2130 thousand at the
                     end of 2009 down 67 year on year it is worth highlighting the improvement in the trend
                     of the prepaid customer base net losses in 2009 in 2009 the prepaid customer base decreased
                     by 153 thousand which was 398 less than in the previous year this is a result of a successful
                     customer proposition navíc which motivated customers to regular topups


                     the blended monthly average churn rate reached 21 in 2009 01 pp higher compared with
                     2008 largely because of the higher prepaid churn


                     in terms of usage mobile traffic5 carried in the czech republic grew 111 year on year to
                     8155 million minutes in 2009 due to the higher contract base and successful proposition of
                     o2 neon tariffs


                     in 2009 the blended arpu6 reached czk 514 down 91 year on year largely due to customers
                     optimizing their behaviour and the mtr cuts the contract arpu reached czk 753 in 2009 down
                     143 year on year the customer migration from the prepaid to the contract tariffs contributed
                     to contract arpu dilution the prepaid arpu decreased by 121 year on year to czk 223 in 2009
                     which was a consequence of customers optimizing their behaviour in the current economic
                     environment and of the migration of high value prepaid customers to contracts however in the
                     fourth quarter 2009 the prepaid arpu improved to czk 224 from czk 222 in the third quarter

                     end of december 2009 with 193 thousand net losses in the fourth quarter helped by the solid
                     uptake of naked accesses following the introduction of our new broadbandcentric proposition
                     for the full year 2009 the company lost 123 thousand fixed accesses down from 176 thousand
                     in 2008 302 year on year

                     to 2002 million minutes as a result of continued losses of fixed telephony lines due to mobile
                     substitution

                     63 year on year to reach czk 154 billion in 2009 this decline was driven mainly by the lower
                     number of fixed accesses and the introduction of new broadbandbased consumer proposition
                     including naked adsl in may 2009 on the contrary revenues in the mobile segment improved on
                     the back of continuous growth in the number of contract customers

                     due to the lower voice traffic generated in the fixed network a higher proportion of mobile
                     customers on flat rate based tariffs and the lower revenues from roaming


                     the revenues from interconnection and other wholesale services declined 44 year on year to
                     czk 100 billion as a result of mainly the 227 reduction in mtr and the lower revenues from
                     roaming visitors which have not been fully offset with a growth in international transit services
                     in fixed line segment


                     the revenues from sms  mms  value added services decreased 36 year on year to
                     czk 49 billion in total due to the higher revenues from sms included in monthly charges on

                     in the czech republic sent and received a total of 3564 million sms which translates into
                     a yearonyear increase of 70


                     the revenues from leased lines and fixed data services went down 92 year on year
                     to czk 35 billion mainly due to lower revenues from leased lines which were not fully
                     compensated by a growth in ip based data services


                     the revenues from internet including monthly and oneoff charges mobile data and iptv grew
                     146 in total on the previous year and reached czk 74 billion in 2009 which is largely a result of

                     and o2 tv customer base the number of retail adsl accesses reached 677 thousand at the end
