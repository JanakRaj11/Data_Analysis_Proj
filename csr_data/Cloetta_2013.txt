chairmans comments
2012 was a tremendously eventful period for cloetta as i look back on some of the major changes i must say that i am proud of how
much we accomplished during the year a few of the highlights include the merger between cloetta and leaf but also an extraordi
nary general meeting a new board of directors a new president and management a rights issue to finance the acquisition an issue
in kind a refinancing a new commercial organisation in sweden a decision to rationalise production divestment of the distribu
tion business in belgium and the adoption of new policies and working methods and all of this took place at the same time that we
experienced a combination of unusually weak market development in our industry and record high raw material prices
     consequently much of the boards work during the year has focused on supporting our management team in the execution of
these changes but also following up and ensuring that all of the decided changes were carried out in an efficient and correct manner


aims of corporate governance
corporate governance is about ensuring that the company is managed as effectively as possible in the interests of the shareholders
but also that cloetta complies with the rules required by legislators and the stock exchange among other things in the form of corpo
rate governance i see this as the boards foremost responsibility to all shareholders corporate governance is also aimed at creating
order and systems for both the board and the management in addition by having well defined structures rules and processes we
can ensure that the management and employees are focused on developing business and thereby creating shareholder value
