      in 2016 and what were the main highlights and outcomes for
      the business
  a 2016 was a very good year for sonae sierra both in terms of our
      operational performance and from a strategic point of view                                    during 2016 we continued to
      we delivered a total net profit of 1812 million up 28 compared                          successfully execute our strategy
      with last year which was mainly driven by a very impressive
                                                                                                   recycling capital at a higher pace
      indirect profit indeed our indirect net profit reached 1245 million
      marking a 54 yearonyear increase that reflects the value                                 than previous years pursuing new
      created by the opening of parklake in romania yield compression                              development opportunities and
      in portugal and spain and the gains made from asset sales our                                strengthening our professional
      direct net profit of 567 million was slightly below the 61 million
                                                                                                          services business
      achieved in 2015 this was as expected and due exclusively to the
      impact of our capital recycling strategy
      we successfully recycled capital at a higher pace than in previous                                          fernando guedes oliveira
      years enabling us to release funds for developments whilst                                                 chief executive officer
      retaining control of fund and asset management in line with our
      strategy at the beginning of the year we sold 41 of our stake in

      investment partners gip in which sonae sierra has a 10
      interest and is responsible for fund and asset management
      in brazil we sold boavista shopping a noncore asset
      another key pillar of our strategy is to rebalance our allocation of
      capital to give greater weight to developments and emerging                   furthermore the improvement in economic conditions in southern
      markets the opening of parklake in bucharest romania in                    europe has contributed to strong sales and rental growth

      increase development exposure                                             expand professional services
      we aim to increase our exposure to developments in europe                 we have affected a paradigm shift in our business model to
      and emerging markets this will be achieved through a                     become an outwardlooking clientfocused company within
      combination of acquiring exposure to new development                      this model we will intensify our focus on providing retail real
      opportunities and reducing our exposure to investment                     estate services to clients when executed alongside our
      properties we will also shift from a shopping centre focus to            disciplined approach to the use of capital service provision
      exploring urban regeneration and mixeduse development                    allows us to maximise returns enter new markets and build
      opportunities that are retailcentred we will reduce the                 new relationships this in turn enables us to optimise the
      financial capital invested over the long term through our                 resources of the company under market fluctuations and
      capital light strategy and investors will be invited to share the         improve knowhow on markets partners and projects
      risk and return




                                                                   capital recycling
      capital recycling transverses both pillars of our strategy within the context of increasing investor demand for retail assets in european
      markets but ongoing constraints in accessing debt to support business growth capital recycling acts as an enabler to our future growth
      by releasing capital to finance new developments reducing our exposure to investment risks and protecting future returns by securing
      management contracts this will be achieved by selling new projects after completion preferably through investment management
      which will keep a minority position and reducing our investment in our core portfolio to a minority position through which we can ensure
      a foothold to provide services




      our sustainability strategy
      since 2013 our sustainability strategy has focused on five areas that are designed to create shared value for our business society and
      the environment the strategy was born out of the challenging market conditions that followed the global financial crisis between
      2008 and 2009 and the culture of austerity that we inherited in southern europe the same conditions that prompted us to develop
      the professional services component of our business model also led us to focus on the value we can create in everything we do as a
      retail real estate owner developer and manager  be it economic social or environmental value
      while the global sustainability challenges we identified in 2013 remain valid our business strategy to reduce the capital invested in
      our core portfolio increase our exposure to new development opportunities and enhance our service delivery has directly affected our
      business model and therefore the materiality of our existing sustainability strategy meanwhile the greater emphasis on our services
      business opens up new opportunities to deliver value for clients by supporting their sustainability objectives
      in 2016 we therefore undertook a strategic review of our sustainability strategy to assess its continued ability to deliver shared value
      within the context of these changes to our business model our revised sustainability strategy  which will be launched in early 2017 
      builds heavily on our previous commitments to deliver shared value while providing greater alignment between our business model
      and sustainability goals
      both our existing and revised sustainability strategies are explained in more detail below for the purposes of this report which covers
      the 2016 calendar year we report our performance against the objectives set out in the current strategy the new strategy will form
      the framework by which we report in our sustainability performance in 2017 and beyond

      sonae sierra recorded a net profit of 1812 million in 2016 which compares with 1417 million in the same period of 2015 an increase
      of 28
      in 2016 direct net profit reached 567 million which represents a 7 decrease compared with last year this was as expected and
      due to the impact of our capital recycling strategy on a likeforlike portfolio basis and excluding the impact of fx changes direct net
      profit increased by 8 as a consequence of the improved shopping centre operational results the growth of our professional services
      the lower interest rates and the effective financial risk management
      indirect net profit reached 1245 million compared to 807 million in the same period of 2015 the positive variation in indirect net
      profit was mainly a consequence of the yield compression in portugal and spain which accounts for 68 of the value created the
      opening of parklake and the improvement in the operational performance of our iberian and brazilian assets

      balance sheet
      the total assets of the company reached 24 billion of which 2 billion correspond to investment properties and 65 million are
      properties under development
      the value increase in investment properties resulting from higher property valuations the opening of parklake and the favourable
      effect in the yearend exchange rate of the brazilian real was partially compensated by the partial disposals of loop5 algarveshopping
      estação viana shopping luz del tajo and the full sale of boavista shopping and by the share reduction in the sierra portugal fund
      properties under development continue to reflect the companys strategy to focus on development opportunities with investments in
      nuremberg the mcarthurglen designer outlet málaga jardín plaza cúcuta zenata shopping centre and the norteshopping expansion
      the net worth as of 31 december 2016 is higher than at 31 december 2015 as a result of the 2016 net profit and the favourable
      yearend exchange rate of the brazilian real better than at 31 december 2015
      bank loans decreased compared to 31 december 2015 mainly due to contractual loan amortisations and the disposals referred above

      sonae sierra brasil
      sonae sierra brasil contributed 178 million to the consolidated net profit of sonae sierra an increase of 23 when compared to
      2015 mainly due to higher value created in the operating assets and to the gain on the disposal of boavista shopping
      the decrease in ebit is explained by the adverse change in the exchange rate average depreciation of the brazilian real of 49
      versus the euro and the disposal of boavista shopping on a likeforlike portfolio basis and excluding the impact of the fx change
      ebit increased by 17 which is mainly explained by higher rental income as a consequence of the quality of our assets and
      management approach
      value created in investment properties reflects the positive impact from operational cash flows yields remained flat despite the
      challenging macroeconomic environment
      investment properties reached 426 million in december 2016 an increase of 95 million when compared to 31 december 2015 which
      is explained by the appreciation of the brazilian real end of year rate and the increase in the value of operating assets

      the above table identifies the material boundaries for each aspect identified in our 2015 materiality review boundaries are split between aspects
      under our direct operational control development property management asset management and corporate those related to professional
      services and those that relate to the activities of our suppliers and tenants for specific limitations regarding the boundary and level of coverage
      for each of the above aspects see g423 the relevant disclosure on management approach for each material aspect and data qualifying notes
      for individual indicators

      we have not provided a further analysis of material boundaries according to geographyregion as the aspects that fall under our direct control relate
      to our operations that are located in countriesregions which typically share many legal social and environmental characteristics meaning there are
      no dramatic differences in the materiality of each aspect the exception is emerging markets where despite our development projects in colombia
      and morocco we predominantly provide third party services and the actions of our clients fall outside the scope of this report unless otherwise
      stated furthermore we apply a consistent approach to managing these material aspects across our owned shopping centres where differences do
      occur for example in relation to the localised impacts of climate change and water availability these are often felt at an individual asset level and
      not at a broader country or regional level in these instances our management approach allows for a more tailored approach see g4ec2 and the
      dma for water

      g4ec2       financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organisations activities due to climate change

      the impacts of climate change in the form of extreme weather events  flooding heat waves weathering subsidence etc could cause physical and
      local depreciation to assets and those with unreliable energy supplies could also depreciate faster than others on the other hand adapting existing
      buildings and developing and acquiring new buildings which perform better in predicted climate change scenarios could help to maintain and
      enhance asset and portfolio value in the long term
      in 2009 we commissioned a study to investigate the financial risks associated with climate change on a sample of our portuguese assets focusing
      on three components energy mainly electricity water and insurance costs the results revealed that
       the increased demand for energy and the anticipated increase in the price of energy is expected to reduce profitability by a maximum of between
        2 and 5 in 2030 and between 3 and 6 in 2050 with variations between different shopping centres
       in the case of water it was not possible to estimate the potential increase in demand due to climate change but the impact of increases in water
        costs was examined with the conclusion that these could reduce profitability by between 015 and 2
       the likely increase in insurance costs was estimated at 21 this could affect profitability by between 01 and 07
      in portugal algarveshopping and norteshopping were selected for a more detailed assetlevel study the results of the study revealed that
       increased demand for energy due to higher temperatures combined with projected price increases are likely to impact on operational shopping
        centres profitability in the long term for example at norteshopping an estimated reduction of profits between 2 and 57 could occur in 2030
       water costs are also expected to rise but estimates vary significantly and the impact on profitability would be less significant for example
        between 005 and 014 at norteshopping and slightly more at algarveshopping due to higher water costs in this region
       insurance costs are likely to increase by around 21 due to the increased frequency of extreme weather events and other risks associated with
        climate change the impact on profitability is likely to be around 01 at norteshopping and 07 at algarveshopping
      in 2013 we commissioned a highlevel review building on the 2009 study to explore the business case for climate change adaptation it reviewed
      the following key business drivers as a consequence of climate change physical damage to property assets evidence of climate change risks
      affecting operational and asset value based on sonae sierra management acquisition and disposal activities evidence of climate change risks
      affecting insurance premiums and policy developments since 2010

      results and adjustments continued
      g4ec2       financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organisations activities due to climate change continued

      the findings highlighted that the strongest driver related to climate change adaptation relates to the possible transfer of risks usually absorbed by
      the public sector to the insurance industry or directly to the private sector other drivers include physical damage to sonae sierra assets from
      extreme weather related events conversely there was no evidence that climate change risks have had an impact on disposal activities for sonae
      sierra but there is increasing awareness amongst valuers at present there is a limited business case for adaptation measures based on legislative
      and policy drivers as there are no plans for introducing legally binding directives requiring property companies to adapt to climate change and it is
      unclear how the costs of planning for climate change adaptation at a national level will be absorbed
      at an operational level insurance premiums for sonae sierra assets are unlikely to be immediately affected however if insurance products were to
      become unavailable in the future due to an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events this would impose a significant
      burden on the state if this scenario were to happen then the private sector may need to absorb the costs directly and the risks to asset and
      operational value would substantially increase
      in the context of this study sonae sierra has pursued a number of soft adaptation measures which do not require large levels of capital investment
      these include
       maintaining a register of relevant climate change adaptation policies in all countries of operation
       updating our due diligence procedures to ensure key risks related to weather related events are evaluated
       updating our building standards based on lessons learnt from weather damaged assets and to anticipate potential requirements for hard
        adaptation measures in the future
       monitoring of the impact of climate change risks on insurance premiums and asset values
      furthermore we will continue to review the relative materiality of other environmental impact areas in terms of the risk and opportunity they might
      present to the business as part of our risk management working group we use a standard risk management framework to evaluate environmental
      issues according to the likelihoodfrequency of occurrence and the scale of impact should they arise as well as energy and climate change other
      potential risks and opportunities include water and waste pages 88 to 91 and 98 to 100 the issues identified are addressed through the resource
      resilience and safe people and ecoefficiency focus areas which form part of our sustainability strategy

      disclosures on management approach
      report the impacts that make this aspect material
      during the development of our sustainability strategy we identified several instances where our company has a positive indirect economic impact
      on our stakeholders and the communities where we operate these include job creation and skills development opportunities the impact on local
      businesses including suppliers from our activities and the impact on our tenants businesses one indirect impact which could be viewed as
      negative is that our business has the potential to contribute to household debt by promoting consumerism
      while it is difficult for us to measure the significance of these indirect economic impacts in the context of external benchmarks and stakeholder
      priorities the feedback we have received in previous years from stakeholders such as tenants and local community members has further
      highlighted to us the importance of these issues to some key stakeholder groups
      this aspect was identified as material according to the most recent materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a
      number of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material

      initiatives related to the commitments above set out in our sustainability strategy are managed by our prosperous retailers and leveraging
      knowledge working groups the working groups are responsible for planning and overseeing the implementation of our actions in relation to each
      focus area the prosperous retailers working group is a multidisciplinary team consisting of representatives from several departments including
      shopping centre management and sustainability for information on our leveraging knowledge working group see page 111
      during the development and operation of our shopping centres we carry out feasibility studies to identify consumers needs in retail services and leisure
      activities in order to design and adapt shopping centres to match market needs and enhance the existing retail offer these studies consider factors such as
      demographics within the catchment area and socioeconomic indicators and constitute a form of community needs assessment for our business activity
      these factors are also tracked through our geo tracking surveys that provide wider intelligence on the social and economic profile of our catchment areas
      and the competitive landscape for operational shopping centres see stakeholder engagement page 66 and customer surveys pages 133 to 134

      specifically we have developed several projects with reference to prosperous retailers which are designed to create economic benefits for local
      people and businesses in the locations where we operate shopping centres
      these include our coop store project that supports small businesses by exploring the idea of cooperative business models to reduce the
      operational costs for new startup businesses products and brands it is specifically targeted at entrepreneurs
      other initiatives include the rising store competition through which we aim to support and collaborate with entrepreneurs by helping them to set
      up their own business and bring their innovative ideas to our shopping centres
      the competition was launched in portugal in 2015 and received 110 entries from which five winning applications were selected the winning
      entrepreneurs received support with the development of their project and business plan and were given rent free store or kiosk space in one of five
      shopping centres across our portuguese portfolio for a six months period  with the option to extend this for a further six months at a discounted
      rate for more information see page 33

      report the impacts that make this aspect material
      the development and operation of our owned shopping centres  as well as the delivery of our corporate activities and third party services  is dependent
      upon the availability of a range of natural resources including land metals stone timber water renewable and nonrenewable sources of energy and
      systems such as natural climate regulation and ecosystem services our activities in turn have adverse impacts on these resources through the
      production of greenhouse gas emissions waste and wastewater and in some cases through the urbanisation of previously undeveloped land

      in 2016 sonae sierra invested more than 127 million in environmental initiatives equivalent to 22 of direct net profit environmental aspects are
      clearly important to sonae sierra and efforts to improve energy and resource efficiency are also sustainability priorities for our business partners and
      services clients this is supported through the most recent materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which highlighted aspects such as
      water energy waste and emissions as the top four most material issues to sonae sierras business for further details see our response to identified

      suppliers and tenants across our shopping centres development projects and in our corporate offices

      specific actions  service supplier engagement
      regular she meetings with our security maintenance cleaning and waste suppliers discuss common environmental issues and highlight basic
      housekeeping procedures that help to reduce our environmental impact such as waste disposal and recycling good practice guides for tenants
      and service suppliers set out best practice guidelines covering the various activities each group undertakes to reduce the risk of safety accidents
      and environmental incidents

      specific actions  resource resilience
      resource resilience is one of five focus areas that underpin our sustainability strategy a resource resilience working group was established in 2013
      to investigate potential lines of action focusing on energy and water supply strategies the working group identified three potential lines of action
      including onsite renewable energy generation converting tenant waste to energy and the roll out of water recycling and reuse systems at the time
      converting tenant waste to energy with the possible exception of parque d pedro shopping in brazil and onsite renewable energy generation were
      not deemed economically viable we did however proceed with the roll out of water reuse and rainwater harvesting systems and a number of actions
      designed to improve water efficiency and reduce water consumption were incorporated into our sheds following this initial work responsibility for
      monitoring the future viability of onsite energy generation and waste to energy solutions moved to the sustainability office

      sonae sierras environmental accounting ea model details the current costs capital expenditure and economic and environmental benefits
      resulting from the implementation of our safety health and environment management system excluding safety and health issues the model
      allows sonae sierra to break down expenditures by legally mandatory socalled baseline expenditures and extrabaseline expenditures eg legionella
      monitoring in countries where no legal requirements exist in this way it is possible to estimate the economic effort of the company to strive to
      achieve more than just complying with legal requirements the ea is structured by environmental domain and specific activities and the presented
      figures include all shopping centres owned by sonae sierra in operation for the current reporting year
      capital expenditure and current costs are calculated from the companys financial controlling frameworks classifying them by assigning one or
      several environmental activities along with its related percentages and legally nonmandatory fractions current costs include the human resource
      effort that is environmentally related and corporate environmental expenditure
      benefits of the period can be physical or economic and are computed as differences in performance between 2015 and 2016 they are based on
      validated data also presented throughout this report economic benefits can be revenues monetary inflows from environmental conservation
      activities for example from waste recycling or savings avoided consumptions pollutants disposal or costs compared with the previous period

      significant actions are capital expenditure items corresponding to costs higher than 3500 for which environmental criteria were considered
      efficiency of resource use and have an associated quantifiable environmental physical benefit andor economic saving when compared with basic
      technology or prior existing situations these actions produce effects throughout the assetequipments operating period the effects of actions
      from previous years and those implemented throughout this period are shown in the table the implementation date of the significant actions is
      assumed to be 31 october meaning that the benefits physical and economic for a full year are six times larger than the shown figures the
      benefits of significant actions from previous periods are likely to be underestimated since data started to be regularly reported in 2010 and data
      reported prior to 2011 was not exhaustively checked or validated nevertheless over the years the contribution of the unreported significant actions
      from the past will tend to decrease
      because the ea excludes legally mandatory expenditure the presented figures regarding capital expenditure and current costs differs from the
      table detailing g4en31 expenditure benefits can eventually include items resulting from compliance with legally mandatory requirements
      eg implemented actions from building energy certifications may impact the benefit reduction of electricity consumption

      benefits figures were normalised taking into account some operational data between periods such as shopping centres opening hours and number

      disclosures on management approach
      report the impacts that make this aspect material
      although the sourcing of materials used in shopping centre development and operations is controlled by our contractors we are aware that our
      business activity does entail a significant impact in terms of the extraction of raw materials including timber stone and metals principally through
      the use of semimanufactured goods and parts which are derived from raw materials whilst the extraction of raw materials adversely impacts on
      the natural environment the reuse of existing materials for example from demolition waste and the use of manufactured goods fabricated from
      recycled materials can help to promote a more sustainable closed loop approach to waste management and materials use
      this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number of
      criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material aspects and
      boundaries on pages 61 to 62 above

      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
      policies and commitments
      we engage with our suppliers with the aim of encouraging them to adopt more responsible business practices our responsible procurement policy
      commits us to among other things privileging the use of materials which are locallysourced have recycled content have lowtoxic content have a
      long life and can be recycled or reused andor are sourced from companies which adhere to ethical andor environmental standards

      goals and targets
      although we aim to prioritise the use of more sustainable building materials during the construction of our development projects we have not set a
      specific target in relation to this goal

      responsibilities and resources
      responsibilities and resources for managing the materials aspects are covered by our safety health and environment management system
      shems see safety health and environment management system on page 49

      gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices to reduce and optimise raw material extraction purchased for
      direct use
      for sonae sierra it is difficult to control the selection of raw materials used in shopping centre development projects as our development
      contractors source materials generally premanufactured goods on our behalf this compromises our ability to gauge a clear understanding of the
      scale of our impacts in terms of raw material consumption nonetheless our safety health and environment development standards sheds
      prohibit the use of materials which are known to have negative impacts on the environment and on the health and wellbeing of building occupants
      as well as timber products derived from nonsustainable forestry during construction our shems ensures that efforts to reduce material use and
      waste are considered and whenever possible we reuse materials on site reducing the need for raw materials

      gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices for selecting materials and engaging suppliers including
      specifications for certifications or utilisation of preferred or prescribed lists of products and materials
      as noted above it is difficult for sonae sierra to control the selection of raw materials used in shopping centre development projects in 2012 we
      conducted a study to establish a methodology to record the recycled content of the most significant materials used during the construction of new
      projects including concrete brickwork steel glass and insulation the aim was to help us to identify which materials we might prioritise when
      seeking more sustainable alternatives the defined methodology was applied to the construction of parklake in romania which was completed in
      2016 for more information see results and adjustments below

      disclosures on management approach
      report the impacts that make this aspect material
      according to the international energy agency iea the built environment is responsible for around 40 of the worlds total primary energy
      consumption and 24 of carbon dioxide co2 emissions as governments around the world ratify the cop21 paris agreement regulations on the
      energy consumption and ghg emissions of buildings are likely to become more stringent consequently high energy consuming and carbonemitting
      buildings are likely to become less attractive to investors and occupiers in the future on the contrary more ecoefficient lowcarbon assets which
      generate their own energy onsite from renewable sources are likely to sustain their value in the long term
      for sonae sierra energy includes both energy consumption and energy security we have developed a dual strategy to reduce our reliance on
      volatile fossilfuel derived energy markets by improving the energy efficiency of our owned shopping centres and implementing measures to
      increase our selfsufficiency in relation to energy use
      this aspect was identified as material according to the most recent materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a
      number of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
      aspects and boundaries on pages 61 to 62 above

      policies and commitments
      we are committed to increasing the energy efficiency of our activities within the scope of our safety health and environment she policy and
      management system procedures see pages 49 to 50 above
      with respect to our focus on resource resilience we have set an objective to increase our resilience with regards to natural resources specifically
      we are monitoring opportunities to generate renewable energy on our sites to remove our reliance on fossil fuel based energy purchased from
      suppliers

      goals and targets
      our strategy pages 19 to 21
      specifically we have a long term objective to strive to increase the energy efficiency of our operations aiming to attain a maximum average
      electricity consumption of 400 kwhm2 mall and toilet area per year across sonae sierra owned shopping centres by 2020
      with regards to resource resilience we have identified an action to develop partnerships with energy service companies to set up onsite
      renewable energy generation systems with a particular focus on photovoltaic systems see results and adjustments below

      responsibilities and resources
      responsibilities and resources for managing energy aspects across our portfolio are covered by our safety health and environment management
      system shems see safety health and environment management system on page 49
      responsibility for monitoring and implementing actions identified with regards to resource resilience rests with the sustainability office

      gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices on energy management through all relevant stages of the lifecycle
      energy efficient designs including energy performance targets and innovative engineering solutions are included in our safety health and
      environment development standards sheds within the sheds we specify the use of energy efficient boilers air conditioning units and other
      fit out equipment such as lighting and appliances rules to encourage greater energy efficiency include lifecycle consumption analysis and
      performance criteria covering hvac equipment and common area lighting as well as recommendations for energy efficient tenant lighting
      we also require development managers to explore possible renewable and lowcarbon technologies during design such as passive solar design
      or natural ventilation
      we are especially committed to designing buildings that will achieve high energy efficiency ratings under the european unions energy performance
      of buildings directive since 2013 we have also aimed for all our own new development projects and major expansions where we have direct control
      to target as a minimum breeam good leed silver or dgnb bronze our most recent development project parklake which opened in
      september 2016 achieved breeam excellent certification
      our construction contractors too can be big energy users during initial construction major refurbishments or expansions we make sure
      contractors strictly adhere to our shems which includes guidelines for monitoring energy consumption and achieving greater energy efficiency
      during the operations phase we ensure shopping centres are run as efficiently as possible see safety health and environment management
      system on page 50 since 2013 we have rolled out an energy modelling tool bright project which enables us to calculate the optimised theoretical
      energy consumption of a shopping centre and then compare this with its actual usage making it possible to easily detect and remedy any
      inefficiency the methodology allows us to adjust targets for each shopping centre which together with more reliable data should improve energy
      efficiency across our portfolio we also procure green electricity through the grid to power shopping centres in portugal germany italy and spain
      for an update on the bright project and details of specific projects in 2016 to increase energy efficiency see operational performance page 34

      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts continued
      country regional and industry regulations and policies for energy and emissions
      our organisation is subject to regional and national regulations and policies concerning energy and emissions at the regional level these include
       the european unions energy performance of buildings directive 200291ce and the 2010 recast of the same directive which mandates
        among other things that buildings undergoing major renovations must upgrade to meet minimum energy performance requirements that
        energy performance certificates epcs must be shared with prospective buyers and tenants of a building and that from 2020 or 2018 for public
        buildings all new buildings should be nearly zero energy

       european union regulation ec n 1005 of 16 september 2009 that starting from the 1 january 2010 replaces the regulation ec 20372000
        on the management of ozone depleting substances for general protection of stratospheric ozone this includes obligations for operators of
        refrigeration air conditioning or heat pump equipment and fire protection systems

       regulation eu n 5172014 of the european parliament and of the council of 16 april 2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing
        regulation ec n 8422006 the regulations objective is to protect the environment by reducing emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases

       directive eu 20152193 of the european parliament and of the council of 25 november 2015 that establishes rules to control emissions of
        certain pollutants and dust into the air from medium combustion plants as well as rules to monitor emissions of carbon monoxide

      at the national level these include
       building regulations in countries where we develop new shopping centres for example in germany all properties where a building permit was
        issued after 1 october 2009 were required to meet the revised 2009 building regulations which demanded a 30 increase in energy efficiency of
        hvac and lighting systems and a 15 increase in thermal insulation compared with the 2007 regulations

       energy efficiency requirements for operational buildings in countries where we own and manage shopping centres for example in spain from
        2010 the use of heating and cooling in new and existing nonresidential spaces was limited in accordance with a maximum temperature of 21c in
        winter and a minimum temperature of 26c in summer also in spain the royal decree 2352013 sets out energy efficiency certification
        procedures for buildings

       legislation implemented at a national level in response to eulevel legislation for example portugals decree number 68a2015 germanys law
        on energy services and other energy efficiency measures edlg from november 2010 italys decreto legislativo 1022014 and spains royal
        decree 562016 of 12 february that all result from the transposition of directive 201227eu of the european parliament and of the council of
        25 october 2012

       legislation implemented at a regional level such as the orden 20 may 2015 which establishes the periodicity of atmospheric emissions controls
        in potentially polluting activities according to their classification in the aragón autonomous region

      at an industry level we subscribe to several voluntary commitments to reduce energy consumption and ghg emissions associated with our
      activities these are reported under g416 on page 60 above

      report the evaluation of the management approach
      monitoring
      the monitoring of our performance in relation to the energy aspect is covered by our shems see governance safety health and environment
      management system pages 49 to 50 and disclosures on management approach for the environmental aspect overall on page 76 above
      our performance in relation to actions identified under the resource resilience focus area of our sustainability strategy is monitored by the
      sustainability office

      results and adjustments
      in addition to indicators g4en3 g4en5 cre1 g4en6 and g4en7 below we monitor the electricity efficiency excluding tenants of our owned
      portfolio which in 2016 was 397 kwhm2 mall and toilet area11 a 4 improvement compared with 2015 this was influenced in part by efficiency
      improvements and cooler weather conditions in portugal and brazil where the most significant reductions were achieved our performance means
      we exceeded our 2020 target of 400 kwhm2
      regarding onsite renewable energy generation systems solar panels are currently used to heat water at uberlândia shopping in brazil during
      2016 we continued to explore potential options to install onsite renewable energy systems across our investment portfolio while no viable solution
      has been forthcoming we will pursue this further in 2017 for examples of specific projects in 2016 to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy
      consumption on our sites see operational performance page 34 and the case studies on our website

           this indicator includes all shopping centres owned by sonae sierra and in operation during the full reporting year there is a slight mismatch between the numerator and the
           denominator since energy consumption in technical areas and cold and hot water that is supplied to some tenants is considered but those areas are not

      disclosures on management approach
      report the impacts that make this aspect material
      as demand for fresh water becomes ever greater around the world due to population growth urbanisation increased economic activity and climate
      change we need to ensure we have adequate supplies for all our shopping centres particularly those in areas that are vulnerable to shortages such
      as portugal brazil greece and spain
      for sonae sierra water includes both water consumption and water scarcity we have developed a dual strategy to reduce our reliance on the
      availability of fresh water supplies by focusing on improving the water efficiency of our portfolio and using innovation and technology to rethink how
      water is used and managed at sonae sierra owned shopping centres by improving the water efficiency of our portfolio and integrating systems for
      rainwater harvesting and water reuse on our sites we can reduce our exposure to water scarcity risks and minimise our water footprint which
      prepares us for potential future legislation and avoids costs
      this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number of
      criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material aspects and
      boundaries on pages 61 to 62 above

      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
      policies and commitments
      we are committed to increasing the water efficiency of our activities within the scope of our safety health and environment she policy and
      management system procedures see page 49 above and exploring ways to reuse water under our resource resilience focus area see page 20
      with respect to our sustainability strategys focus on resource resilience we have committed to rollingout the use of technologies for harvesting
      rainwater and reusing water to as many sites as feasible in order to reduce and eventually remove the need to procure water from third parties and
      to reduce pressure on aquifers

      goals and targets
      our strategy pages 19 to 21
      specifically we have a long term objective to attain a level of water consumption at or below 3 litres per visit aggregated across all sonae sierra
      owned shopping centres by 2020
      under our resource resilience focus area we have also set the following long term objectives
       at least 10 of total water consumed at sonae sierra owned shopping centres to be reused grey water or harvested rainwater by 2020

       develop and implement a long term strategy to ensure a secure water supply at owned shopping centres with a particular focus on locations that
        are vulnerable to water shortages by 2020

      responsibilities and resources
      responsibilities and resources for managing water aspects are covered by our safety health and environment management system shems

      lifecycle  policy and practices on drainage and discharge of water
      we aim to ensure a secure water supply at all of our owned shopping centres with a particular focus on locations that are vulnerable to water
      shortages we use the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd global water tool to identify the areas where we are
      developing new centres that are at risk of water stress or scarcity
      when these projects go forward the companys safety health and environment development standards sheds define that specific equipment
      like water chillers must be avoided in order to minimise our vulnerability to water shortages in areas with water use restrictions we also ensure
      that water efficient design including equipment specifications and water recycling engineering solutions is maximised where feasible we integrate
      rainwater harvesting and grey water recycling systems on new projects and refurbishments to reduce the need for freshwater or municipal water
      consumption during the fit out process we set requirements for water efficient sanitary equipment such as sensor spray taps waterless urinals
      and low flush toilets
      since 2013 we have also developed a water calculator dive project to assess the water needs of every shopping centre taking into account its
      occupancy location and design it allows us to set consumption targets for the main water systems eg wcs irrigation which together with real
      time monitoring enables us to identify unusually high usage patterns and put in place tighter control mechanisms
      for shopping centres exterior areas and when landscape projects are defined we specify efficient irrigation systems and favour the use of
      autochthonous plant species in exterior landscaping
      for examples of specific projects in 2016 to increase water efficiency and increase the reuse of water on our sites see operational performance

      we incorporate solutions that reduce pollution to local water sources our owned shopping centres may have up to five different wastewater
      collection systems which enable different types of wastewater to be reused andor treated according to their characteristics wastewater
      discharges are analysed regularly by externally certified laboratories in order to control the contamination levels of our water discharges to
      municipal sewers streams etc
      during the design phase we are committed to incorporating solutions that reduce pollution to local water sources for instance to prevent pollution
      from rainwater runoff we specify filter drains and porous paving in external paved areas and stormwater management plans are implemented to
      contain or decrease stormwater runoff according to the sites characteristics additionally our sheds guarantee that equipment like grease and
      hydrocarbon separators or wastewater treatment plants are installed minimising pollution through the pretreatment of these effluents before
      they are discharged
      during construction works we also place demands upon our contractors to avoid the risk of water pollution from construction activities
      during the operations phase wastewater discharges are regularly analysed by externally certified laboratories and where there are no legally
      established monitoring requirements the following biochemical parameters are periodically analysed
       biological oxygen demand bod5

      results and adjustments
      in addition to gri indicators g4en8 g4en10 and cre2 below we monitor the water efficiency excluding tenants of our owned portfolio which
      in 2016 was 34 litres of water per visit12 see operational performance page 34 meaning we did not achieve our 2016 target of 334 litres per visit
      the positive evolution in the water efficiency of our assets in portugal and spain was offset by increases in brazil germany italy and romania
      which were largely due to a rise in the number of leaks
      we currently have more than 41 groundwater harvesting or water reuserecycling systems in place across 25 shopping centres 58 of our
      investment portfolio that is included in the scope of our sustainability indicators the systems implemented to date are enabling us to make cost
      savings of more than 680000 per year and avoid the withdrawal of 400000m3 of water from municipal supplies for shopping centres located in
      waterstressed areas the implementation of water efficiency measures and reuse measures has even greater significance

      construction water indicator
      the construction water indicator measures the quantity of water consumed during the construction phase of development projects this indicator
      is calculated for each project by dividing the total water consumed at the construction site by the total construction cost of the project water
      consumption is monitored and recorded on a monthly basis at each project from the start to the completion of the development works

      disclosures on management approach
      report the impacts that make this aspect material
      as noted under energy the built environment is responsible for around 24 of carbon dioxide co2 emissions as governments respond to growing
      international and domestic pressure to tackle climate change regulations relating to buildings energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg
      emissions are becoming more stringent there is growing evidence that high carbon emitting buildings are becoming less desirable to investors and
      occupiers by reducing the energy consumption and ghg emissions associated with our owned shopping centres we aim to avoid costs and make
      our properties more attractive to future investors
      this aspect was identified as material according to the most recent materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a
      number of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
      aspects and boundaries on pages 61 to 62 above
      see also key noncontrollable risks page 23 g4ec2 page 70 and energy on page 83

      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
      policies and commitments
      we are committed to reducing ghg emissions within the scope of our safety health and environment she policy and management system
      procedures see page 49 above we also endorse several external policiescharters which commit us to reducing our impact on climate change for
      further details see page 59 above

      goals and targets
      we have set long term objectives to
       achieve an 85 reduction in ghg emissions per m2 of gla by 2020 compared to the 2005 level ghg protocol scopes 1 and 2 plus business air
        travel

       implement climate change adaption measures identified in our 2013 climate change study by 2020

      responsibilities and resources
      responsibilities and resources for managing emissions aspects are covered by our safety health and environment management system shems
      see safety health and environment management system on page 49

      gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy on carbon management including policy position on carbon offsetting
      in 2006 we developed a climate change strategy to reduce our direct and indirect ghg emissions this covers scopes 1 2 and business air travel
      part of scope 3 according to the guidelines of the ghg protocol developed by the world resources institute wri and the world business council
      for sustainable development wbcsd
      our primary strategy to achieve this is through energy efficiency initiatives we have not established a policy with regards to carbon offsetting
      although we have compensated for co2 emissions in relation to some minor events it is part of our strategy to advocate more sustainable practices
      at an industry level and information on our advocacy positions can be found on pages 59 and 126 to 127
      aside from the energy used by our shopping centres themselves we also seek to reduce the energy consumption and ghg emissions generated by
      associated activities such as construction activities by prioritising materials with recycled content vehicle emissions produced by people visiting
      our shopping centres or by staff travelling to and from work or on business trips many of our centres are working to improve access by public
      transport and encourage its use by featuring public transport timetables and cycle storage facilities
      emissions are also produced by tenants occupying our centres and we advise and educate our tenants about saving energy and reducing ghg
      emissions from their activities for example through our she good practices guide and sustainability benchmarking see also stakeholder
      engagement page 65 and tenant engagement and satisfaction pages 137 to 138
      in 2013 we performed a materiality assessment to review our most material scope 3 ghg emissions based on the corporate value chain scope 3
      accounting and reporting standard published by wri and wbcsd by ranking all scope 3 emissions generated by our business activities according
      to their significance and the level of influence we have over them we can focus our reduction efforts where they are more relevant

      this indicator includes indirect emissions from all shopping centres owned by sonae sierra and in operation during the full reporting year all corporate offices with a shems lisbon
      maia and são paulo and all development projects completed within the reporting period it also includes other indirect emissions deemed relevant and material to the indicator
      business travel commuting hotel stays which are not necessarily allocated to shopping centres or other specific locations within the boundary of the carbon footprint
      this indicator includes emissions from
      tenants electricity consumption with the exception of manauara shopping and river plaza mall where the electricity consumed by tenants is fully purchased by sonae sierra most
      tenants purchase their own electricity the average tenanttype energy intensity per square meter is known from a recent energy performance study to calculate ghg emissions
      from electricity consumed by tenants an estimation was made based on this energy intensity tailored to each shopping centres specific yearly occupation occupied gla by type of
      tenant and also the amount of electricity kwh purchased by sonae sierra on behalf of its tenants the energy that was purchased on their behalf by sonae sierra is not double
      counted and in the case of manauara and river plaza mall it corresponds to all the energy that their tenants consume
      business travel flights ghg emissions are calculated using the atmosfairde carbon from flights calculator this calculator uses a set of emission factors which are sensitive to the
      distance travelled the type of seat economy business first class the number of stopovers and it includes radiative forcing to account for the emissions in high altitude emissions
      from flights are assigned to the country that is home to the sub company that purchased the tickets
      business travel trains ghg emissions are calculated by multiplying the distances travelled by train by countryspecific emission factors emissions from train travel are assigned to
      the country that is home to the sub company that purchased the tickets
      hotel stays ghg emissions are calculated by multiplying the number of room nights in hotels by sonae sierras employees by a representative emission factor of the industry
      emissions are assigned to the country that is home to the sub company that requested the reservation
      employee commuting sonae sierra regularly conducts a climate survey to understand how its employees go about their daily commuting the survey allows for the estimation of
      the yearly distance travelled by our employees per transport mode to calculate ghg emissions these transport mode distances are multiplied by their respective countryspecific
      emission factors
      visitor trips sonae sierra regularly conducts mall tracking surveys to understand how visitors travel to sonae sierra shopping centres the surveys allow for the estimation of the
      distance travelled by transport mode of an average mall visitor to calculate ghg emissions these transport mode distances are multiplied by their respective countryspecific
      emission factors the result is an average carbon emission factor per visitor per shopping centre finally this specific emission factor is multiplied by the total number of yearly visits
      waste ghg emissions are calculated by multiplying the different amounts of waste in tonnes by the emission factors that are specific to the destination that is given to each type
      as is known
      materials development ghg emissions are calculated by multiplying the different amounts of materials used for construction in tonnes by their specific emission factors
      emission factors are sensitive to the materials being new or recycled in origin

      aspect       effluents and waste
      disclosures on management approach
      report the impacts that make this aspect material
      the construction and management of shopping centres can generate large volumes of waste that if not managed properly ends up in landfill
      landfilled waste is not only an inefficient use of resources the waste and the land it can generate damaging greenhouse gas emissions such as
      methane and carbon dioxide as well as pollutants that can leach into the soil and groundwater consequently disposal of waste in landfill is
      becoming more tightly regulated and more costly in most locations where we operate
      on the other hand good waste management can reduce environment impacts and be more cost effective for businesses as it avoids landfill tax and
      waste disposal costs a closedloop approach to waste management can also cut costs and environmental impacts associated with the consumption
      of raw materials
      this aspect was identified as material according to the most recent materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a
      number of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
      aspects and boundaries on pages 61 to 62 above

      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
      policies and commitments
      within the scope of our safety health and environment she policy and management system procedures we are committed to reducing the
      quantity of waste generated by our activities and to achieving high levels of waste recycling we are also committed to reducing our impacts in
      relation to wastewater production

      goals and targets
      we have set long term objectives to
       ensure that all discharges to local water courses comply with sonae sierras wastewater quality standards and pollutant limits by 2020

       increase the proportion of total waste by weight that is recycled recovered or reused and obtain a minimum recycling rate of 65 across our
        sonae sierra owned shopping centres by 2020

       reduce the proportion of waste by weight that is sent to landfill below a maximum limit of 18 across sonae sierra owned shopping centres
        by 2020

       increase the proportion of total waste by weight that is recycled recovered or reused and obtain a minimum recycling rate of 90 across our
        main corporate offices by 2020

       maintain a high level of performance in terms of waste recycling in construction projects and aim to increase the proportion of construction
        materials with recycled content

      responsibilities and resources
      responsibilities and resources for managing effluents and waste aspects are covered by our safety health and environment management system
      shems see safety health and environment management system on page 49 as well as our owned portfolio we also monitor these indicators
      for our corporate offices
      our site managers at each shopping centre projects under development and corporate offices are responsible for ensuring that waste is managed
      efficiently this includes providing appropriate storage areas and equipment that are well maintained preventing spillage and scattering during
      transportation and producing monthly reports of waste volumes we also provide staff with detailed instructions on waste codes rules for waste
      storage and final destination waste separation rules for nonhazardous waste and hazardous waste and waste transportation in each country
      particularly the documentation required

      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts continued
      gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices that promote waste avoidance as the first step in the waste
      hierarchy
      our sheds include a series of design requirements to maximise the waste separation potential of every shopping centre we develop so that once
      the shopping centre is in operation waste can be effectively sorted and sent for recycling and recovery a site specific waste strategy study is
      undertaken during construction to establish adequate provision of space for waste segregation bins and compactors temporary storage and
      internal preferential routes for disposal
      we take a progressive approach to waste management during construction works encouraging contractors to operate waste management plans
      aware of the difficulty that arises from the construction process being directly controlled by construction companies we are committed to gradually
      designingout waste produced during construction for example through offsite prefabrication during construction our shems ensures that the
      reduction of material use and waste is prioritised where possible we specify end of life recycling for building components which is particularly
      relevant for our refurbishment activities in addition construction companies are required to report back to us the results of their waste
      management
      during the operations phase we aim to progressively improve each shopping centres waste recycling rate the majority of waste handled by sonae
      sierra is largely generated by tenants activities aside from seeking to influence tenants practices there is little that we can do to reduce waste
      production in our centres all countries offer regular training for tenants on topics around waste avoidance segregation and recycling

      monitoring
      the monitoring of our performance in relation to the effluents and waste aspect is covered by our shems see disclosures on management
      approach for the environmental aspect overall on page 76 above
      with respect to effluents our wastewater quality standard controls wastewater quality beyond existing legal requirements this is set out in our
      wastewater management procedure and includes identifying all wastewater discharges into municipal drainage systems andor wastewater
      systems and monitoring wastewater quality in accordance with the technical instruction for wastewater management
      we analyse the results and in any cases of nonconformity we produce a report setting out corrective actions
      wastewater discharges are analysed regularly by externally certified laboratories in order to control the contamination levels of our water
      discharges to municipal sewers streams etc see gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices on the management of water quality
      through all relevant stages of the lifecycle page 89

      results and adjustments
      in addition to indicators g4en23 and g4en24 below we record the total waste recycled as a proportion of waste produced which was 65 in
      2016 a 5 improvement compared with 2015 and the proportion of waste that is sent to landfill across our owned portfolio which was 17 in
      201615 a 15 improvement compared with 2015 see operational performance page 34 all countries apart from germany and italy improved
      their performance in 2016 with significant increases in brazil and spain as a consequence we met our long term waste recycling target ahead of
      schedule and exceeded our long term target for the proportion of waste sent to landfill for specific examples of projects in 2016 to reduce waste
      and increase recycling see the case studies on our website
      as well as our owned portfolio we also monitor these indicators for our corporate offices and on completed projects the improvements to our
      waste recycling rate and the reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill were driven by a number of actions introduced in 2015 these
      included training and awareness raising on waste separation for our cleaning staff and office employees in our corporate offices we managed to
      reduce paper consumption by 22 see g4en27 on page 103 for more information

      by applying sustainable design standards on new projects and significant expansionsrefurbishments we can prepare for new and emerging
      regulations whilst ensuring that our owned shopping centres are more attractive to investors and occupiers
      this aspect was identified as material according to the most recent materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a
      number of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material

      ensuring that our owned shopping centres as our products comply with high safety health and environmental standards this includes standards
      for environmental design and operation

      goals and targets
      we have set a long term objective to obtain a building certification for all new owned shopping centres and certify the safety health and
      environment management system shems for all sonae sierra construction projects and owned assets that we have managed for two or more
      years in a maximum period of three years

      and construction sites efficiently
      through our years of experience in designing constructing owning and managing shopping centres we have identified the sustainability features
      which are most important for our operations our safety health and environment development standards sheds have been developed with
      reference to our own experience best available techniques international certification schemes such as leed and breeam and internationally
      recognised safety standards such as the national fire protection association nfpa and european safety standards
      during the construction and operations phases we operate shems in all our construction sites and owned shopping centres which are based on iso
      14001 and ohsas 18001 standards applying these standards enables us to guarantee that all she risks are identified and controlled it is also part
      of our policy to seek third party audit and certification of the shems across all our sites and we aim for all our new development projects and major
      expansions where we have direct control to target as a minimum breeam good leed silver or dgnb bronze by doing so shopping centres
      ensure that their management systems are aligned with sonae sierras corporate policy and that she procedures have been fully implemented it
      also demonstrates to our stakeholders our visible commitment to managing our she impacts and helps us to reduce the costs associated with
      those impacts
      for further information about our sheds and shems see governance safety health and environment management system pages 49 to 50

      during all stages of the lifecycle  organisationwide environmental initiatives in place to design new assets which minimise
      environmental and end user human health impacts and to redevelopretrofit existing assets to such standards
      we have a corporate procedure applicable to all owned shopping centres and a similar one for offices to guarantee that acceptable indoor air
      quality is maintained this involves conducting regular monitoring of critical air quality indicators including volatile organic compounds voc
      emissions periodic indoor air quality audits which cover a range of different parameters and legionella monitoring
      during the design phase the sheds include standards which guarantee the use of the best equipment for legionella control and the ongoing
      monitoring of indoor air quality parameters for example cooling towers must be made from materials that are corrosion resistant must not
      contribute to microbiological growth must be easy to clean and should entail drip eliminator devices

      professionals building or construction personnel and building operators
      our sheds described above and on page 50 enable us to minimise she risks and enhance the ecoefficiency of our operational shopping centres
      beginning with their design and construction during the operations phase we engage with end users including tenants service suppliers visitors
      and employees through a range of initiatives covering sustainability impacts
      we provide she training for tenants include she issues at tenant assembly meetings and raise awareness of how they can improve their she
      performance by identifying opportunities to reduce energy consumption through our sustainability benchmarking within the scope of our shems
      we monitor tenants compliance with our she requirements for shopping centres by performing inspections on tenant units and following up on
      any nonconformities detected regular she meetings with our service suppliers discuss common she issues and highlight basic housekeeping
      procedures to reduce she risks good practice guides for tenants and service suppliers set out best practice guidelines covering the various
      activities each group undertakes to reduce the risk of safety accidents and environmental incidents
      we undertake regular customer surveys and aim to play an active role in raising visitors awareness of sustainability concerns by promoting a large
      number of events and campaigns with environmental and social themes this includes efforts to communicate our own she progress to visitors

      specific actions  biodiversity and habitats
      the development of land can have an impact on biodiversity particularly when projects are built on undeveloped greenfield sites that are likely to
      be rich in biodiversity or perform valuable ecosystem services and functions we strive to minimise biodiversity loss on our sites and have established
      a number of measures to protect habitats at our development projects and existing assets these are supported by long term objectives to
       promote the use of previously developed land or brownfield land for new sonae sierra shopping centre projects and protect and enhance
        biodiversity wherever possible
       strive to protect and enhance biodiversity on both existing sonae sierra sites and new projects and add value to new projects by actively
        integrating biodiversity whenever possible taking into account the regional context
      measures including environmental due diligence environmental impact studies eis the sheds and a site specific shems are applied to all our
      new developments eis are performed when required by legislation and identify the potential environmental impacts of each projects design
      construction and operation on the sites biodiversity and specifies mitigation measures in all other cases preliminary environmental evaluations
      pee are performed according to sonae sierras specifications the sheds include a standard related to long term impacts on biodiversity and our
      shems require that all the recommendations of the eis that refer to biodiversity compensation on greenfield sites are implemented where full
      mitigation of biodiversity impacts is not possible
      at our operational shopping centres and our corporate offices biodiversity impacts that may result from daytoday activities such as waste
      disposal and water consumption are monitored through our shems procedures we also seek to raise awareness of biodiversity through marketing
      events and other initiatives among shopping centre staff andor visitors
      the construction of parklake which was completed in 2016 took place solely on previously developed land a consequence of our objective to
      promote the use of previously developed or brownfield land is that it can often be adversely affected by contamination from previous activities
      we take remedial action to address any contamination so the land meets the required standards for its intended use at parklake this required
      the decontamination of 1072m3 of brownfield land

      prequalification of suppliers and contractors relating to health and safety and including the existence of formal agreements
      and health and safety due diligence for new projects and investments
      our service suppliers management procedures for development and property management define the various steps that should be followed from
      the preselection and bidding process through to contract closure and postcontract evaluation both our development and property management
      businesses have integrated the requirements of sonae sierras shems into their service suppliers management procedures so that these are set
      up in a way to ensure that our main suppliers performance meets with sonae sierras she requirements
      within the scope of these procedures all contracts with critical suppliers must include she clauses and subcontractors have the same level of she
      requirements as contractors if no formal contracts are signed then the service supplier must sign a warranty declaration to guarantee that she
      requirements will be met we have also established she regulations for service providers which include for example the obligation for suppliers to
      adopt protective measures to minimise risks that workers are exposed to compliance with these regulations is checked during work supervision and
      for long term contracts including contractors from construction sites sh performance is evaluated during works execution
      all new shopping centre development projects must implement a sitespecific shems and achieve certification in accordance with the ohsas
      18001 standard for the entire construction phase for expansion and refurbishment works to existing shopping centres with costs between 25 
      10 million or less than 10 of the assets omv contractors must comply with a safety health and environment management plan shemp
      contractors cannot begin any activity without the validation of this document by the sites sh coordinator and sonae sierras prior approval
      each of our development projects has a full time sh coordinator to validate contractors risk assessments and if necessary establish additional
      control measures the sh coordinators and outsourced project management teams carry out permanent sh supervision and planning on
      construction works identifying and correcting unsafe actions wherever necessary
      we investigate the causes of all level 4 and 5 accidents critical near misses and fire incidents and communicate these across the company so that
      lessons can be learned to avoid repeat occurrences this is done through alerts a communication tool that is used during the construction and
      operational phases of our owned shopping centres we also hold regular she meetings and carry out emergency practice drills on all construction
      sites and owned shopping centres

      specific actions  procedures to identify and evaluate safety and health risks to people
      prior to the commencement of construction or refurbishment works design teams consider our sheds during the concept and architectural
      development phase of all our new shopping centres refurbishment or expansion projects and minor works the sheds aid us in minimising sh
      risks from the outset of each shopping centres development and into the operations phase the implementation of the standards is mandatory for
      all projects and is checked through a final audit carried out by a third party compliance with local sh regulations is also verified by competent
      authorities prior to opening as part of the licensing procedure for new shopping centres
      safety and health due diligence studies are undertaken in existing shopping centres to be acquired so that we can understand the potential safety
      and health liabilities that sites may contain and therefore guarantee sufficient budget in our investment plans to adequately deal with these issues
      we also operate a corporate risk matrix that is used by centres to create a tailored risk matrix based on the sh risks to people during the
      operational phase this includes defined procedures for routine activities nonroutine activities such as fit outs and improvements to tenant units
      and emergency procedures for more information see specific actions  programmes related to assisting workforce members their families or
      community members regarding serious diseases below

      gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and procedures for the procurement transport handling use and disposal of all
      hazardous materials
      during the design phase within our sheds there is a specific requirement which is included within the design team and contractors service
      agreements which prohibits the use of certain hazardous materials and substances as defined by sonae sierra throughout the construction works
      for the construction phase the use and disposal of hazardous materials is controlled by the implementation of our she procedures for
      development namely the shems for new projects the safety health and environment monitoring plan for major refurbishments and expansions
      and the small works procedure for minor interventions the onsite sh coordinators and development teams maintain a record of hazardous
      materials which come onto the site and are disposed of from the site
      during the operations phase and within corporate offices we have a procedure in place that sets out the main safety recommendations for handling
      hazardous products including the hazard characteristics of products the labelling rules storage incompatibilities and recommended protective
      measures these are supported by posters to raise awareness among service suppliers around the correct storage and handling of these products
      where possible we work with service suppliers to replace hazardous products with less hazardous alternatives that share similar characteristics

      specific actions  programmes related to assisting workforce members their families or community members regarding
      serious diseases
      we provide education and training counselling and prevention programmes for employees their families and community members regarding
      serious diseases or potential long term damage to health these programmes cover commonly identified risks associated with sonae sierra
      activities see below as well as emerging health risks that could potentially affect our stakeholders
      sonae sierra has defined a transversal procedure in our shems aimed at identifying and evaluating sh hazards and risks to sonae sierras
      stakeholders the evaluation is made for all activities covering offices shopping centres in operation and development projects and through which
      we identify the potential consequences to people identifying both injuries eg cuts burns etc and occupational diseases eg musculoskeletal
      disorders hearing loss etc
      as we evaluate a hazard we have to consider existing control measures and deficiencies the periodicityprobability of the hazards occurrence and
      its potential severity any nonacceptable risks that are identified must result in the implementation of additional risk control measures until the
      risk is classified as acceptable examples include
       in our shopping centres we identified that the inspection and testing of emergency generators could cause loss of hearing capacity to avoid this
        we implemented several controls such as short term worker exposure to noise regular noise measurements and communication of results and
        the mandatory use of suitable hearing protectors
       in our offices we identified the possibility of musculoskeletal disorders from handling air conditioning units for maintenance to avoid this we
        provide mechanical transportation equipment training on its use and regular inspections to ensure it is being used properly
      all matrices are validated by qualified technicians either country safety health and environment coordinators in offices and operational centres or
      safety  health coordinators in development sites and then approved by the respective site manager additionally in all countries where this is
      demanded by law an occupational doctor also provides followup and feedback to sonae sierra employees in regular consultations and evaluates
      each employees workstation to avoid any future occupational disease
      regarding shopping centres under development we have acknowledged that the task of identifying the number of workers that are exposed to a
      specific risk at a specific moment is extremely complex due to site specific factors and that the time and effort required for this identification will
      not produce relevant benefits to sonae sierra we focus most of our efforts on ensuring that all existent risks in each construction site have proper
      control measures in place we have identified that workers on construction sites are more exposed to noise vibration dust and working with
      concrete knowing this and to minimise the associated risks measures including worker rotation awareness raising and the use of personal
      protective equipment have been implemented

      bringing together the different knowledge sharing initiatives that we have examples of these initiatives include sierra shots which typically last one
      to two hours and are opportunities for employees to share insights that are deemed relevant and useful for their colleagues in brazil we organise
      an educational subsidiary programme which helps our employees to get a degree and also improves their chances of career development
      in all geographies we operate an onboarding programme which ensures that employees have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their
      work this includes an introduction to our approach and policy regarding safety health and environment we have also continued to roll out best
      behaviour with ethics sierra training to increase knowledge of our code of conduct and raise awareness of the different types of corruption
      employees may be confronted with see anticorruption pages 124 to 125 in brazil we run an integration programme with the same objectives

      we also contribute to and participate in the sonae group management  leadership ml academy which was launched in 2013 this learning
      academy integrates a variety of courses into a comprehensive curriculum that caters to our employees training needs in accordance with their
      career development goals
      building on this in 2016 we took steps to strengthen our skills base and support our evolution into a retail real estate services company by forming
      the sierra academy the academy will support our business model and expansion into new markets by focusing on the training and development of
      existing employees and new hires in our internal procedures and all aspects of shopping centre management this is particularly important as we
      enter markets where the local skills and experience we need are not readily available the academy will provide a centralised training programme for
      all new hires whereas previously this had been delivered through a variety of different channels including our onboarding programme and oneto
      one training with experts from across the business
      our goal is that the academy sets the reference standard for the shopping centre sector and delivers value to the business by promoting immersion
      in sonae sierras values increases internal networking and fosters talent by the end of 2016 we had formalised the academys structure and had
      developed 11 technical modules focusing on shopping centre management functions including two with sustainability specific content covering our
      shems in 2017 we plan to expand the number of courses to include behavioural contents and enlarge the academy to other functions

      employees and set in place training and development plans that meet individual and countryspecific needs professional development is delivered
      through a mixture of existing programmes and adhoc onthejob experiencebased learning to ensure employees receive the most relevant
      training
      ensuring sonae sierras culture and values are embedded across our operations as we expand into new markets is also a priority and an important
      goal of our learning and development programmes one challenge we face is to ensure our training is both relevant and effectively delivered given
      the different cultural background of the countries we operate in

      specific actions  career development
      the ml academy was set up to develop the management and leadership skills of seniorlevel employees across all sonae group companies
      businesses areas and geographies to accomplish this a training program was designed in partnership with recognised business schools and
      partners to develop our talent at various organisational levels ranging from the operational to the strategic the academy allows us to
       develop a unique learning model
       support career development
       reinforce the alignment between our employees and sonae groups business strategy and culture
       promote internal mobility between geographies and companies
      in 2016 63 sonae sierra employees were enrolled in the ml academy

      specific actions  leveraging knowledge
      leveraging knowledge is one of our sustainability focus areas and through this we aim to empower our employees by building their skills and
      knowledge to unleash their potential on an individual basis and raise the standard of knowledge attainment at a collective level in the communities
      where we operate we are exploring how we can transfer knowhow in the company while increasing knowledge in our communities and have
      identified three priorities
       sierra with universities to partner with universities and either share our knowledge or create new knowledge with students
       we share with communities to extend our knowledge to the employees of the organisations that we wish to maintain strong links with such as
        municipalities fire brigades and local authorities
       engage value chain through knowledge to help qualify our tenants or potential tenants both owners and employees by strengthening their
        business skills and knowhow
      under each objective we have identified short term targets see results and adjustments below
      the knowledge pillar of our revised sustainability strategy aims to deliver value for our business and clients by building the human and intellectual
      capital required to support our transition to a retail real estate services provider while ensuring high levels of staff productivity and attracting and
      retaining the best talent the pillar will be supported by annual targets which we will use to assess our progress

      aspect       diversity and equal opportunities
      disclosures on management approach
      report the impacts that make this aspect material
      companies where unfair treatment is present are at risk from lawsuits and fines for discrimination and are more likely to experience highlevels of
      staff turnover absence and poor team work on the contrary by applying the principles of equality and diversity and ensuring a meritocratic culture
      companies can attract a wider range of potential candidates increase levels of employee satisfaction retention and collaboration
      the value of having a diverse workforce is therefore widely recognised and promoting gender diversity in particular remains a priority for our
      company and industry as a whole women remain underrepresented at most management levels in the corporate pipeline and the disparity is
      greatest in senior leadership in sonae sierra while the ratio of male to female employees is roughly equal on a global level women only occupy
      25 of senior management positions and 13 at senior executive level
      this aspect was identified as material according to the most recent materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a
      number of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
      aspects and boundaries on pages 61 to 62

      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
      policies and commitments including gri g4 cresd specific action  policy on gender
      equality including how gender is incorporated into procurement policy and plans
      we have a nondiscrimination and diversity policy that states our commitment to a meritocratic culture this is reinforced by our code of conduct
      which outlines our commitment to creating a workplace where each individual is treated fairly and where we recruit select train and remunerate
      based on merit experience and other professional criteria
      until now our company has not encountered barriers to gender equality in the workforce in the core countries where we operate however we
      acknowledge that this could become a more significant issue as we move into new markets such as north africa where the social environment may
      inhibit equal opportunities in terms of education and by extension access to employment in sonae sierra brasil gender equality has not been an
      issue although the number of men in managerial positions is higher

      goals and targets
      as stated above sonae sierra has a commitment to a meritocratic culture although we do not set specific quantitative objectives or targets
      relating to this aspect

      responsibilities and resources
      responsibilities and resources for employment aspects including diversity and equal opportunity and equal remuneration are described under the
      disclosures on management approach for training and education on page 111

      gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policies and practices regarding gender equality in the workplace
      we have some policies in place which among other objectives can support diversity by promoting a more flexible workplace namely
       parttime working policy
       working from home policy
       flexible work schedule policy
      within the framework of these policies we have made particular efforts over the past couple of years to introduce more flexible work arrangements
      for employees whose job function enables them to take up these options
      the communication of these policies along with other practices to promote gender quality such as mentoring programmes and career advice has
      been strengthened following the launch of embracing diversity in 2016 developed following an extensive employee consultation the programme
      aims to deliver a significant and sustained investment to change company practices and culture so women can achieve their full potential

      monitoring
      sonae sierra demonstrates its commitment to nondiscrimination in recruitment and treatment of staff in the workplace by monitoring workforce
      diversity according to a range of different characteristics within our code of conduct we pledge to treat each individual fairly and recruit train and
      remunerate based on merit experience and other professional criteria it is in our interest to ensure that the human resources talents and skills
      available throughout the community are considered when employment opportunities arise thereby selecting the most suitable person for the job
      based on their qualifications and experience
      the sierra ombudsman which is described on page 67 constitutes a formal procedure which employees as well as other stakeholders can use to
      report workrelated concerns including any breaches of our code of conduct
      we monitor employee satisfaction once every two years through our corporate climate and employee satisfaction survey which asks our
      employees to rate their satisfaction with a range of factors including equal opportunities and compensation the most recent survey was conducted
      in 2015 and in 2016 we conducted an additional survey as part of embracing diversity to better understand the reasons why relatively few women
      hold senior management positions in sonae sierra

      advisory panels caps to make sure that local communities are consulted on and involved in the development and operation of our shopping
      centres in a way that creates long term relationships and is sensitive to local cultures in order to select cap members we identify local stakeholder
      groups and invite them to participate based on the issues that are relevant to them our local shopping centre teams are empowered to develop
      actions in response to issues raised through the caps using the part of the development or shopping centre marketing budget which is available for
      community projects

      specific actions  community day
      sonae sierra organises a community day once a year across all our corporate offices and owned shopping centres the initiative was created to
      boost volunteering among our employees by providing a suitable framework through which they are incentivised to spend one work day
      volunteering on a project that will improve the wellbeing of their local community local activities are coordinated by community day ambassadors
      and every office and shopping centre team is free to choose the project and cause they will donate their time to this flexibility allows for projects
      that are relevant to the context of each country and region and tailored to meet the needs of the local community it also gives staff the motivation
      to make this initiative their own and has generated considerable enthusiasm over the years

      during the development stage we carry out feasibility studies to identify consumers needs in retail services and leisure activities in order to design
      shopping centres that match market needs and the existing retail offer these studies consider factors such as demographics within the catchment
      area and socioeconomic indicators
      our caps described on page 120 above also enable us to obtain useful feedback from local community representatives and in this way monitor
      and respond to our impacts on local communities

      environmental safety and health and cultural issues linked to our sustainability activities as well as more technical visits for older students
      employees from across sonae sierra participated in a diverse range of initiatives as part of our annual community day programme of activities in
      2016 community day provides an opportunity for employees to support their local community and encourages them to think about how they can
      support their communities more frequently
      one such example was in lisbon where employees from our lisbon office spent their community day supporting the quinta de s miguel temporary
      childrens shelter in amadora the shelter provides a refuge for children up to the age of 12 who have been the victims or physical emotional or
      other abuse
      the experience inspired them to do more so they decided to harness their enthusiasm for the shelter and its mission by volunteering to support the
      children throughout the year in their own free time they engaged with their colleagues in the lisbon office and centro colombo to organise a
      number of fundraising initiatives to enrich the lives of the children from office cake sales to gift collections employees were able to donate much
      needed equipment to the shelter and provide unique experiences for the children these included educational themed events to cinema trips and a
      threeday summer holiday camp

      environmental impact studies or preliminary environmental evaluations are carried out on 100 of new development projects and on major

      locations of historical architectural and archaeological value and data on important socioeconomic indicators within the study area when we begin
      new projects we perform a feasibility analysis which involves analysing the competition and impact of our activities on competitors performance
      our geo tracking studies evaluate the impact of our shopping centres on local consumer habits on an annual basis in 2016 geo tracking studies
      were performed at 20 44 of our shopping centres
      aside from these we do not have any local community impact assessment programmes in place across our portfolio
      during the commercial licensing phase of new shopping centre projects we are obliged to comply with the planning obligations defined in each
      country and by each local authority for example in some locations we must set aside part of the site for the creation of green spaces and if this is
      not possible on the site in question we must pay a compensatory fee so that green spaces can be created in alternative areas the development of
      transport infrastructure around new shopping centre sites including roads bicycle paths and parking spaces footpaths etc is another example of
      infrastructure developed for community benefit in some instances to meet with mandatory requirements of local authorities and in others to meet
      with our own safety health and environment development standards eg regarding the promotion of sustainable travel

      and integrity
      the code of conduct includes one specific guideline on the avoidance of bribery and corruption by stating that it is forbidden to give or accept any
      reward or benefit with the purpose of influencing someones behaviour to obtain a commercial advantage

      received the code of conduct and agree to comply with its provisions

      indicates in its report that the fees collected from sonae sierra represent less than 5 of its revenue on a global basis
      within the context of our property management activities the procedure of getting bids for the services we contract out to suppliers minimises the
      risk of anticompetitive behaviour in the supply chain taking into consideration the strong involvement of several corporate organisational
      structures related to this process shopping centre management and central operation departments this procedure also ensures a clear coherent

      government was not represented in the stakeholder feedback reviewed as part of the most recent materiality review conducted in 2015
      nonetheless sonae sierra undertakes lobbying activities under its own initiative and through industry organisations targeting local national and
      regional government
      we engage with local municipalities and meet with government members to discuss issues related to shopping centre activities that can have a
      significant impact on our business activities from planning regulations to infrastructure development and trading hours for this reason this aspect
      was deemed to be material to our business

      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
      policies and commitments
      we do not have a specific policy covering public policy our approach is underpinned by our values which represent the principles through which we
      set all our activities and relationships with our partners furthermore our code of conduct sets out our ethical principles which include strict
      compliance with the law and acting with honesty and integrity in all we do specifically this includes our commitment to political neutrality

      goals and targets
      we do not set specific objectives and targets in relation to public policy

      responsibilities and resources
      interaction with local authorities is primarily dealt with at a local level by national development managers the exception is portugal where due to
      the large number of assets we own in the country this falls under the responsibility of the institutional relations ir manager the ir manager also
      oversees our international activities via our membership of trade bodies such as the international council of shopping centres icsc with
      additional oversight and liaison provided by the head of sustainability and corporate communication who reports directly to our ceo

      specific actions  significant issues that are the focus of public policy development and core position
      we participate in lobbying activities under our own initiative and through industry associations with local authorities and national governments
      for example in 2016 we continued to work with the portuguese council of shopping centres apcc to lobby for changes to national regulations
      covering safety practices while we support the principles behind the legislation our argument is that the proposals do not reflect the circumstances
      specific to our industry similarly we have opposed national proposals to exclude electronic cigarettes from the indoor smoking ban as it is not
      practical for our security staff and shopping centre employees to check whether or not an electronic cigarette contains tobacco
      we are also involved in defining policy positions led by industry organisations including the european property federations epf responses to a range of
      european union directives and legislative initiatives during 2016 we contributed to epf discussions with the eu commission regarding the energy
      performance of buildings directive the energy efficiency directive and the renewable energy directive two such examples include our ongoing support for
      common voluntary eu epcs for nonresidential buildings as an alternative to national epcs and our contribution to epf discussions on proposals to equip
      residential buildings with building management systems in this instance we drew on our extensive experience in applying complex building management
      systems in highenergy consuming buildings to highlight the challenges of applying similar systems to smaller lowenergy consuming buildings

      public positions
      sonae sierra supports political endeavours to encourage greater social cohesion and environmental responsibility in line with our business and
      sustainability strategies we also try to influence new legislation likely to significantly affect our business in order to minimise any adverse impacts

      we have not identified any risks related to conflicts of interest

      gri g4 cresd additional guidance  public policy participation that results in positive contribution to public policy
      development
      during 2016 sonae sierra supported several initiatives that benefitted our industry and stakeholders these included changes to legislation around
      security practices to make it more relevant to shopping centres and continuing the ban on using electronic cigarettes indoors
      on a wider level we work with the icsc to encourage members to operate their businesses in a sustainable responsible and efficient manner
      we support efforts to build a collaborative approach between retail developers owners managers and users to reduce the negative environmental
      impacts of our industry and contribute to position papers in response to legislation such as the eu energy performance of buildings directive
      through our membership of the inrev sustainability committee we are working to increase awareness among investors and fund managers of
      sustainability issues for the nonlisted real estate sector this has included contributing to the development of the inrev sustainability reporting
      guidelines which were published in 2016 we are also signatories to the paris pledge for action which welcomes the adoption of a new universal
      climate agreement at cop21 in paris and pledges support to ensuring that the level of ambition set by the agreement is met or exceeded

      escalator and travellator accidents between 2013 and 2015 we conducted several studies in portugal and spain to identify the areas with the
      highest risks of slips as a result we have implemented a range of antislip measures including antislip treatment to floors and travellators
      additional matting near entrances and training for cleaners
      if necessary we work with our suppliers to put in place preventive measures for example we developed a protective handrail in cooperation with
      the escalator manufacturer schindler portugal the handrail was developed in response to a number of accidents involving children on escalators
      at shopping centres not owned by sonae sierra so far handrail protectors have been or are being introduced across all our owned shopping

      report the impacts that make this aspect material
      engagement with customers is vital for any business anticipating and responding to customers needs is essential to sustained revenue generation
      in the context of this aspect customers refer to shopping centre visitors please see tenant engagement and satisfaction for tenant surveys
      we engage with visitors in order to understand what drives their behaviour and purchasing decisions by responding to feedback from these visitors
      we can improve the quality of our shopping centres and promote more sustainable practices in retail and consumerism this is likely to result in
      higher footfall and sales as well as other benefits thereby supporting the long term success of our tenants and our own businesses
      this aspect was identified as material according to the most recent materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a
      number of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
      aspects and boundaries on pages 61 to 62 above

      report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
      policies and commitments
      we do not have specific policies or commitments concerning the frequency with which we conduct customer surveys mall tracking surveys see
      monitoring below are conducted regularly but their exact frequency is determined by individual shopping centre budgets
      sonae sierra and service suppliers who conduct surveys on our behalf are required to comply with the international chamber of
      commerceesomars international code on market and social research the code sets out a selfregulatory framework for market researchers
      covering issues such as compliance with national and international laws ethical conduct and the use of personal information
      other customer feedback tools include the customer contact management system which gives visitors an opportunity to provide feedback directly
      to our shopping centres complaints can also be presented to the sierra ombudsman see page 67

      goals and targets
      mall tracking surveys include a set of questions that relate to the customer experience although we do not set a target to achieve a minimum
      satisfaction level if visitors provide written feedback via the customer contact management system we have response targets as outlined in our
      service level agreement sla see below

      responsibilities and resources
      responsibility for visitor satisfaction and engagement lies with our shopping centre managers supported by the central marketing department
      see monitoring for details on visitor surveys and feedback mechanisms and how we respond

      report the evaluation of the management approach
      monitoring
      we regularly undertake mall tracking surveys at our shopping centres to help us understand our visitors profiles their behaviour and requirements
      these surveys monitor trends in visitor satisfaction expectations loyalty and behaviour shopping centres develop action plans on the basis of the
      survey results paying particular attention to critical success factors affecting visitor numbers and short term actions necessary to correct any
      negative results we also conduct specific corporate responsibility surveys to better understand visitor attitudes towards sustainability and target
      our initiatives and communications accordingly
      in spain we supplement mall tracking surveys with product audits of our owned shopping centres these annual audits help shopping centre
      management teams better understand the quality of the shopping centre experience from an endusers perspective the audit checks the building
      condition the quality of its services including wcs and security and the main points of consumer contact such as directories and information points
      the findings feed into the annual improvement plans for each shopping centre to ensure we continue to offer an exceptional retail experience
      we have a customer feedback system in place called customer contact management which provides a unique source of learning for our shopping
      centres we encourage visitors to submit their suggestions and complaints either verbally or in writing if verbal contacts cannot be resolved
      immediately we escalate them to written contacts and request that customers submit their feedback in writing or we submit the feedback on their
      behalf via a form we ensure that the shopping centre manager personally responds to all suggestions and complaints received
      when visitors offer their time to provide written feedback it is essential to show that we take their views seriously the first step is to ensure an
      adequate answer in a short period of time this timing is measured against the sla the objective is to respond to customers in three working days
      but acknowledging that this is not always feasible the sla target is 70 answered in three days 95 in one week and 100 in two weeks

      compare the performance of different tenants with similar operations in the same centre or similar units in different shopping centres if we detect
      that a tenant has a very high effort ratio we arrange a facetoface meeting with the store management team to seek to understand the reasons
      for this and if possible help the tenant to find a solution

      marketing events communications our sustainability activities and satisfaction with our shopping centre management teams survey results are
      used to develop action plans to address aspects which receive low scores and ultimately drive continuous improvement in tenant satisfaction levels

      and optimise the tenant journey from their first point of contact with sonae sierra through to leasing store fit outs and ongoing communications
      and information provided by shopping centre management teams and our corporate offices the goal was to improve the tenant experience by

           4 our work is summarized as follows
               interview of sonae sierras employees responsible for the preparation of the eesr 2016 and for the reported
                data so as to know and understand the management and reporting principles systems and procedures
                applied as well as the associated control mechanisms
               review of the compliance and consistency of the eesr 2016 content with the gri g4 guidelines disclosure
                of information requirements and whenever applicable with the gri cresd requirements
               review of the processes criteria and systems used to collect consolidate present and validate the data
                for 2016 relating to the information reviewed by us
               review of the procedures and criteria in place to monitor and measure progress against 2016 sustainability
                targets and management actions
               analytical data review and tests on a sample basis of the calculations made by sonae sierra relating to
                the quantitative data as well as tests to corroborate the quantitative and qualitative data included in the
                scope of our work by obtaining and reviewing related evidence thereof and
               review of the consistency of the sustainability information included in the eesr 2016 and related publicly
                available reports and that it does not contradict any significant information included in the 2016 sonae
                sierras consolidated report and accounts

           conclusion
           5 based on the work described in paragraph 4 above nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
              that in all material aspects the sustainability information included in or publically available and related to
              the eesr 2016 referred to in paragraph 1 above has not been reliably and consistently prepared and that it
              does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of the gri g4 guidelines for the
              core option and whenever applicable with gri cresd as well as with the criteria defined by sonae sierra
