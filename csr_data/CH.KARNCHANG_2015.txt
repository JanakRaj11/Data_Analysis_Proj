based on the summary of tap water and artesian water of the machinery center displayed in the table above it
can be seen that the quantity of water consumed in 2014 decreases when compared with 2012 and 2013 because
it is foreseen that the consumption of artesian water may cause land collapse therefore the machinery center
turns to use more tap water

the mrt blue line projecttrackwork contract5                           srirat outer ring road expressway project

presently construction under contract 5 had not been
commenced because the construction area had not
been delivered currently civil work is being carried
out by other contractors therefore the activities of
the contractor under contract 5 are just procurement
and storage of materials and equipment for use in
installation of the railway

with regard to monitoring the quality of surface water
ch karnchang had conducted in one project only ie
mrta blue line extension portion bang suetha phra
section and hua lamphongbang khae section under
contract 2 as it is underground construction and
closed to chao phraya river area and under contract
5 which is the rail system of the whole project
therefore it involves the portion of chao phraya river
similar to the construction of civil work under contract 2
