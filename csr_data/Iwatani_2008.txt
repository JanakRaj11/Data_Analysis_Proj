iwatani is expanding clean energy
supply networks while looking
ahead to the future of
a hydrogen energy based society
networks of reliability established by iwatani
guided by our corporate philosophy become a person needed by society as those
needed by society can prosper iwatani has supplied various forms of energy                       president
indispensable for adding comfort to our lives and our society we have long experience
of supplying lpg and natural gas both highly evaluated as clean sources of energy
and started manufacturing the cleanest of clean energies hydrogen 30 years ago
since which time we have led the hydrogen business in japan
since iwatani started delivering lpg to households in 1953 it has steadily expanded
its sales networks and now supplies this fuel to around 31 million households for
natural gas we have established a supply system that extends from north kanto to the
chugoku and shikoku regions for hydrogen we have been developing production and
application technologies and promoting numerous projects over the years in an eﬀort
to realize a hydrogen based society the history of iwatani is one of its eﬀorts to
expand clean energy networks in anticipation of the coming hydrogen society




the power of networks helps to further enrich society
  the early realization of a hydrogen energy based society has become an
increasingly pressing issue however it is obviously impossible to build such a
society by a single company much more power is needed to orchestrate the
technology and wisdom of industry government and academia iwatani as a leading
hydrogen supplier has been actively promoting the construction of networks suitable
for the hydrogen energy based society through various eﬀorts such as participating
in various national projects and holding hydrogen energy forums in 2007 we carried
out the fuel cell and hydrogen car caravan promotion which involved touring the
japanese archipelago to raise the awareness and understanding of people for
hydrogen and establish networks of people and organizations the caravan traveled
a total of 5930 km across the nation in 33 days and visited many local schools
government oﬃces and environmental npos en route to boost exchanges with them
special attention was given to science lessons for children the bearers of the future
in this way we could contribute to expanding networks having abundant potential
towards the hydrogen society expanding clean energy networks including those for
hydrogen is one of the major themes in our environmental activities we have been
and will continue to be utilizing every opportunity to address this theme in order to
realize a richer and less carbondependent society as expected by the world

iwatani s dual generation system
my home generation  solar power generation
iwatani considers it an important theme to develop environmentally
friendly energy and cost saving home energy systems such as our dual
generation system which combines my home generation using lpg with
   solar power generation in order to provide more efficient and less
environmentally harmful home energy solutions while looking ahead a
decade from now we are developing a dual generation system of fuel
cells for home use and solar power generation
