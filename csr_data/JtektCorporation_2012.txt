     i believe that important elements to developing csr activities are dialogue       prevention methods in most cases however this is not done
      engagement spreading  social responsibility sharing and under            in jtekts csr report the president gives a statement and provides jtekts
     standing social trends  creating social value in this report jtekt clearly     new framework for compliance reinforcement which i believe is worthy of
     state that dialogue is the basis raise spreading of csr internally as a       mention however according to newspaper reports the amount of money
     keyword in the pick up section and feature social background at the              involved in this case was the greatest ever the japan fair trade commis
     beginning of each social and environmental report in this way jtekt is           sion filed a criminal complaint and the prosecutors office pressed charges
     opening the door to the important elements of csr activities and sending          jtekt was exempted from prosecution through the leniency policy
     out a strong message that they are heading towards a new stage this is            considering the circumstances it is likely that there will be ongoing investi
     what makes readers sense that the jtekt vision 2015 will be realized              gation and restrictions on jtekt due to court cases etc so i would have
     in preparing the csr report jtekt proactively responded to the issues i laid      liked to have seen more details disclosed in light of the fact that laws are
     out for them in our exchange of opinion and they are constantly improving         becoming increasingly stringent towards price cartels in japan and
     the quality of the report year after year making it easier to comprehend         overseas i believe it is necessary to set up countermeasures independent of
     being more specific using quantitative expressions and expanding the              regular compliance either way i would like to see this issue disclosed from
     range of disclosed items this report is divided into two halves the first half   various perspectives in the future
     covers the materiality expressed in gri guidelines as 5 keywords giving           i hope to see the below two items incorporated in csr activities and the
     them stronger appeal moreover as i mentioned at the outset jtekt                csr report next fiscal year first jtekts own csr verification and reporting
     emphasize social background and divide the section up into concept             in accordance with iso26000 jtekt has already referred to this standard
     and major activities making it extremely easy to understand if they were        when they revised their csr selfimprovement tool however there is no
     to also add a section on issues  future response at the end of the              verification reporting on csr as a whole i ask that jtekt verify expose any
     section i believe the report would better fulfill jtekts responsibility of       areas yet to be addressed prioritize and take action secondly i would like
     explaining their activities and lead to concrete improvements new items of        to see jtekt report about csr in practice from the perspective of establish
     disclosure in this years report include total work hours work outside of         ing management suitable to the local community in line with the 4th
     regular hours percentage of paid leave consumption number of women in            company image of providing management that translates to the world i
     managementtrack positions number of managers and percentage of                   call this perspective glocal csr and many corporations are putting this
     employees who took childcare leave i would like to see jtekt continue to          into practice in a range of domains i believe these two items are essential
     disclose more information through guidelines and benchmarks                       perspectives and actions to becoming a truly global corporation
     jtekts coverage of mental health issues in previous csr reports has set an
     example for other companies to follow however i hold this years inclusion
     of mental health for fixedterm employees in particularly high regard as it        tamio yamaguchis profile
                                                                                        after 25 years at a newspaper company mr yamaguchi held a position
     exceeds the boundaries of occupational type i firmly believe that the disclo     as the manager of public relations at an environment venture company
