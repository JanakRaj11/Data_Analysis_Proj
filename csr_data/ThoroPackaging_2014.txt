       carbon neutral printing
       thoro has continued to oﬀer a carbon neutral printing option to our customers via natureoﬃceusa
       since august 2011 this program oﬀers customers the option to purchase carbon credit certificates to
       oﬀset the carbon dioxide emissions of each folding carton job for each job a customer can choose
       which climateprotection project best suits their company the total carbon dioxide emission of the
       job is calculated and the appropriate numbers of credits are purchased to oﬀset that output

       each job receives a very specific natureoﬃce certificate with a unique tracking number that is
       printed on each carton with the natureoﬃce logo the tracking number can be looked up on the
       natureoﬃce website to see the particular amount and project supported by that job this oﬀers a
       way for the end user to validate the claim and see more information about that project such as the
       native forest reforestation carbon sequestration project in hawaii preserving the unique native
       woods of the koa tree

  this report is about the last 4 years of sustainability eﬀorts of thoro packaging based in corona california we have examined the social
  economic and ecological sustainability eﬀorts of the company the force that drives any program in a corporation are the people thoro
  has implemented an impressive array of programs that support the development of the sustainability program
  thoro has also understood that suitability programs within an organization do not add to the expense but rather to the profitability of
  the same sustainability in itself suggests to save reuse and recycle egsell waste for further use and therefore costs are reduced in the
  long run
  at thoro the implementation of energy saving devices and the drive to reduce consumption has shown that economic growth does not
  have to go handinhand with an increased use of resources
  with the use of green energy thoro has committed to go deep into the carbon neutral system by purchasing only certified green
  power to supply the operation since 2011 thoro is also certified as a carbon neutral print supplier which is an elite industry group in the
  usa the continued growth of thoro and the high rate of customer satisfaction are proof that thoro is on the right track toward a
  cleaner more profitable and sustainable future
  thus ecological impact has been dramatically reduced by the use of better energy and the opportunity for employees to recharge their
  car batteries at the shop
  thoro is a leader in reusing recycling and extending life periods of products which minimizes the impact on the environment the water
  savings program implemented has helped save money but more important the company has reduced the consumption of one of the
  most needed resources we have
  we have compared thoro to other companies similar in size and revenues mostly with companies in europe since there are no similar
  companies in the packaging industry in the united states we have found that thoro is in the top with other european companies of its
  kind but the single and most advanced company in california and the united states based on a eﬀort b implementation c results and
  d continued improvements
  this report and summary were prepared by natureoﬃce usa an independent consultancy with oﬃces in europe usa  south america
  and west africa natureoﬃce works with governments and private industries and is proud to work with leaders like thoro to create a
  smarter and cleaner way to operate a business
