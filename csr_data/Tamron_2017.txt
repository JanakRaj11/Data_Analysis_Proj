    message from the president
                             practicing csr in our core business
                             at tamron through our core business of making lenses as thenew eyes for industrywe
                             strive to be a company that creates joy and excitement and which contributes to society
                             and the environment in addition to our core products such as interchangeable photographic
                             lenses and surveillance camera lenses we also embrace a dogged pursuit of quality through
                             our focus on new fields such as automotive ultracompact camera modules and products
                             for mounting on drones to respond quickly to cuttingedge technologies and engage in
                             development with a longterm approach to new fields and environmental friendliness we
                             have established a new research and development center we have long positioned our
                             three plants in aomori as our mother plants and together with plants in china and vietnam
                             forming a threepoint production system tamron is able to swiftly respond to customer
                             needs and provide products that deliver excitement peace of mind and safety
                             unfortunately we have failed to meet our companywide environmental goals on co2
                             emission reductions this is due to factors including the fullscale launch of the vietnam plant
                             in fy2016 which added to power consumption in a way we had not envisioned during the
                             2012 benchmark year we will revise our goals to better reflect circumstances and working
                             from fy2016 as a new benchmark year work towards cutting co2 emissions by 1655 on a
                             unit sales basis by the year 2030 starting with a reduction of approximately 13 in fy2017
                             on the topic of corporate governance to further enhance independence and objectivity
                             in areas such as the new appointment of directors and determining of their compensation
                             tamron has established an arbitrary committee chaired by an outside director to reinforce its
                             systems moving forward we will strive to engage in fair and transparent management as we
                             endeavor to raise tamron  s corporate value
                             to coincide with the recent widespread adoption of international csr procurement efforts
                             tamron has established the tamron supplier code of conduct which complies with the eicc
                             code of conduct and works to promote csr procurement together with our suppliers we
                             will strive to develop supply chain management that is mindful of labor human rights the
                             environment and ethics on a global scale

                             human resources development and working styles that
                             support csr management embracing atm in work

    president  ceo          approach work in a proactive manner with the overall optimization of the tamron group in
                             mind we recognized that work is not everything there is to life it is equally important that
    tamron co ltd
                             employees strike a healthy worklife balance continually thinking of work ways to work

    shiro ajisaka            flexible thinking and promotes avirtuous circlein the workplace we also believe part
                             of employees    time outside working hours should ideally be devoted to individual skill
                             development creating a pleasant working environment for female employees is another
                             priority at tamron s head office the tamron kids daycare center has been established
                             and we encourage employees to take childcare leave which has led to a higher percentage
                             of female employees in management positions through these initiatives we cultivate
                             professionallymindedselfdisciplinedemployees and believe this better equips tamron to
                             fulfill customer needs and make active contributions to society

                             supporting the ten principles of the un global compact

                             compact as part of its global expansion we recognize that these 10 principles represent
                             guidelines that truly multinational corporations must put into practice and as such we have
                             reflected these principles in our action declarations and compliance action guidelines and
                             thoroughly educate our employees on the principles including those in our overseas sites

    2 the flex zoom lock mechanism quickly locks or unlocks the zoom at any position simply by sliding the zoom ring back or forth this improves shooting convenience by preventing the lens barrel from moving
        unintentionally under its own weight
    3 the fluorine coating is a coating with excellent water and oilrepelling properties applied to the front surface of the lens element the coating makes the lens surface easier to wipe clean and offers excellent
        durability
    4 a low dispersion ld lens reduces chromatic aberration for improved sharpness it does this thanks to its extremely low dispersion index which reduces the tendency to separate diffract a ray of light into a
        rainbow of colors the lens also uses glass elements with a low refractive index this type of lens elements reduces axial chromatic aberration that is particularly problematic at the telephoto end and lateral
        chromatic aberration which poses issues at the wideangle end
    5 an extra low dispersion xld lens element corrects chromatic aberration to more sophisticated and thorough degree producing sharp image quality with high contrast

    lenses underpinning safety and security

    lenses for automobiles
    as an important pillar of its businesses tamron manufactures
    and markets lens units including infrared models for indoor and                                                                camera lenses for detecting pedestrians at night
                                                                                            lenses for sensor cameras                including infrared camera lenses
    outdoor security cameras in order to contribute to the safety                          lanekeeping assist systems etc
    and security of society in recent years we have also focused on
    the development of lenses for automobiles
    broadly speaking there are two categories of automotive lenses
    first is automotive camera lenses installed on vehicles the other
    is lenses used in traffic monitoring systems installed at points
    above roads in the area of automotive camera lenses tamron
    develops lenses for rearview cameras and birdseye cameras
    and so on used for visual confirmation as well as sensing                              headlight lenses                        lenses for surrounding vicinity surveillance monitors
                                                                                             light dispersal                       for rear side and birds eye views
    type lenses for use in emergency brake assist systems and lane
    keeping assist systems
    as regards traffic monitoring lenses tamron has developed a
    zoom lens that can be equipped with autofocus and remote
    operation capabilities making it possible to flexibly monitor
    different types of road at different distances and which
    incorporates image processing technologies so that users can
    extract the information they need for specific applications
    in june 2016 partial revisions were made to road vehicle safety
    standards and the ministry of land infrastructure transport
    and tourism began to allow the use of camera monitoring
    systems cms1 in place of components such as rearview mirrors
    progress is also being made in the development of selfdriving
    systems leading to a growing demand for highperformance
    lenses tamron will continue to support the safety of vehicles by
    creating high quality high performance lenses tailored to each
    individual application
    1 a ccording to the new standards the camera monitoring system must
        provide an equivalent field of view to rearview mirrors that are currently
        required to be installed

      trends in co2 emissions
      since fy2011 co2 emissions from tamron  s head office the three
      plans in aomori prefecture tamron optical foshan in china and
      tamron optical vietnam have been on the rise but in fy2016
      overall co2 emissions fell 74 compared to fy2015 levels
      viewed by geographic location our sites in japan saw a 3
      decrease while tamron optical foshan saw a 79 decrease
      and tamron optical vietnam which began operations in 2013
      reduced emissions by 12
      in fy2017 we will begin introducing solar power generation
      at tamron optical foshan and continue to examine ways
      to make energy saving improvements at the three plants in                                                                             streamlined electric power management sensor being
