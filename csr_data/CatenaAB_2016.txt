we maintain frequent contacts with municipalities and
other parties to safeguard societys cargo flows efficiently
in terms of cost and the environment for the benefit our

8 logistics  trends
  annual report 2015  catena ab




       three trends 
       smarter better and faster
       the trend for smarter better and faster logistics is driven by the requirements
       of industry and commerce industry seeks to reduce its inventory to reduce
       costs and working capital more expensive citycentre locations mean that
       centrally located shops are reducing their storage capacity combined with
       rapidly growing ecommerce this demands smaller more frequent cost
       efficient environmentally friendly deliveries which in turn imposes fresh
       requirements on new customised logistics premises



                                 following recent years focus                                         increasingly both con

       be higher the highest marginal benefit can probably be        in terms of environmentally efficient distribution
       derived from what is usually called last mile logistics
       today transporting a container from china to sweden
       and transporting it to an urban area within the country is
       relatively simple it is only when the container is opened
       and the goods are to be distributed in different directions
        to warehouses shops or direct to consumers that the
       number of traffic movements and thus the cost escalates

the ceo comments on the
years sustainability work
with regard to catenas sustainability efforts 2015 was an eventful year
we have continued to work with the sustainability targets that we set out
within the framework of the business plan that applies until 2020 in 2015
we focused primarily on improving energy efficiency in our properties and
on ongoing work with sustainable logistics and societal development
during the year we have recruited an energy and tech
nology developer to work exclusively with saving energy
we have also implemented an energy monitoring system
that allows for more methodical monitoring and analysis
at the same time practical energy efficiency efforts out
among our properties continued to produce good results
    in efforts on sustainable logistics and societal devel
opment we have been active in meeting local government
leaders in various places around sweden the aim is to
establish a dialogue on logistics issues and to ensure that
these matters become a part of community planning par
ticularly when planning new residential areas here we
notice that catena contributes a perspective that has partly
been lacking in these discussions
    in the metropolitan areas the predominant topic of
discussion is city logistics or urban logistics in other
municipalities where catena operates we are mainly dis
cussing longdistance cargo and how we can together make
these municipalities more attractive hubs for logistics
    we are continuing the process of building an organisa
tion that interacts closely with the operations from hav
ing been centred around helsingborg we now also have
two wellfunctioning regional offices in gothenburg and
nyköping during the year we increased our personnel
by five people strengthening the organisation in business
development administration and management at the
same time this has led to a rejuvenation of the company
and more women in management
    as we now look forward to 2016 i believe the year
will be pervaded by efforts to integrate the properties and
new employees brought in with the addition of tribona
ab we are also looking forward to continued expansion
both through new construction and acquisitions of exist
ing properties in the right locations

   the right location reduced dhls carbon emissions
   in early 2016 dhl moved into a new terminal in sunnanå outside
   malmö this made them the first tenant at the catenas logistikpo
   sition malmö in connection with its move to sunnanå dhl vacated
   its former terminal in central malmö  entailing major environmen
   tal gains with the amount of long distance cargo traversing central
   malmö being greatly reduced

   it is very important to us that we locate our freight terminals as
   close as possible to ring roads and major thoroughfares this
   particular change has resulted in a saving of 400 tonnes of co2e
   per year of which 350 tonnes derives from reduced transport and
   the remainder from new property technologies says per karjer vice
   president corporate real estate at dhl nordic ab

   dhls move to logistikposition malmö is a typical example of how
   logistics properties in the right location can reduce the environmen
   tal impact of transports besides the strategic location catena and
   dhl have worked together to reduce the energy consumption and
   environmental impact of the terminal building

   we have focused greatly on smart lighting control and invested in
   geothermal heating the property is also environmentally certified in
   accordance with the green building standard throughout catena
   has been a professional partner and a keen listener an additional
   step was taken by preparing for a photovoltaic installation on the
