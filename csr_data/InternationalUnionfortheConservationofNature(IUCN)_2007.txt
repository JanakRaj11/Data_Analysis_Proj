1       about this report
11 scope                                       12 our approach
this report analyses the sustainability of      this report began from scratch by
iucns operations and represents a ﬁrst        gathering information from invoices
step in reporting against the sustainability    and sending emails asking for data
reporting framework of the global               progressively a picture was built up of
reporting initiative gri it examines         iucns environmental performance also
trends in the use of paper electricity gas    as the process advanced data collection
and water and looks at staff commuting         became more organized and integrated into
patterns although this report examines         daily activities much of the operational
mainly the environmental performance of         data for headquarters is now collected
iucn operations the other elements of          on a routine basis by the administration
sustainability reporting  social economic     department
and governance  are equally important
and should be integrated into later reports    the data presented is incomplete or missing
                                                in some respects for instance this report
this 2006 report focuses mainly on the          is missing data on the amount of paper
performance of iucn headquarters in             used in outsourced publications to some
gland switzerland due to the availability     degree this undermines the importance of
of data for the indicators measured we         data pertaining to white paper purchased
are grateful to the iucn ofﬁces in meso         at headquarters nevertheless this report
america orma south america sur            still presents an initial broad picture of
asia aro eastern africa earo and           consumption trends and can give guidance
europe rofe and the pakistan china           for future action
and vietnam country ofﬁces who were
able to provide information for this report
which is summarized in section 7 future        13 scoring system
environmental reporting will endeavour to
                                                a scoring system using trafﬁc light colours
include data from all iucn ofﬁces and will
                                                and smileys was used to illustrate the trends
also attempt to report against the entire gri

sustainability reporting framework
                                                judgments on good or poor performance
                                                were based on whether trends were positive
where possible wwf international was
                                                or negative and on iucns performance
used for comparison as they have a similar

                                                           are unsustainable and should
                                                           be targeted for improvement
