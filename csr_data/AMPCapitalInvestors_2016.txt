with australian companies specifically in relation to governance              address in companies it is clear that governance standards for
issues and wrote to over 25 companies outlining the reasons for               australian companies are generally high by global standards but
not supporting a proposed annual general meeting resolution                  there are still areas for improvement especially regarding the
                                                                              disclosure of esg issues
amp capital has found that discussions regarding remuneration
are often an opportunity to raise broader esg concerns topics                other initiatives included presenting to a group of nonexecutive
discussed have included cyber security general concerns and                  directors regarding amp capitals esg capability and some
advice about good governance structures and esg performance                  of the issues raised in the esg approach to investing giving
and reporting continuing the trend from 2014 we have found                  a presentation at the annual australian investor relations
that directors as well as chairmen are increasingly interested in             conference on expectations for company disclosure of esg
engaging with us on esg concerns and broad strategic issues                  issues and addressing an audience of over 100 senior australian
we have found that cyber security has resonated particularly                  executives to give a global perspective on business finance
strongly as an issue with directors                                          and ethics




                                     we believe that positive company engagement is leading to a
                                     higher standard of governance generally however there are still
                                     individual examples where governance could be greatly improved
                                     internationally we believe we are starting to see some small
                                     improvements in governance standards but there remains much
                                     to be done

success with encouraging listed retailers to sign the bangladesh
accord on fire and building safety the accord our focus switched
to key underlying issues identified and reinforced during the field
trip to bangladesh particularly the living wage issue and the lack
of freedom of association
in bangladesh the minimum wage increased by 77 in 2013
but even for workers who are lucky to receive the new minimum
wage it is clear that the new minimum wage is insufficient to
live on also only approximately 5 of the 5000 factories in
bangladesh  and none of the factories we visited in 2014  have
union representation we believe retailers have a vested interest
in tackling these issues following in the footsteps of international
leaders on supply chain risk management to establish sustainable
supply chains

engagement activities
taking the opportunity of company meetings to raise company
specific esg issues
the amp capital esg research team as part of its analysis of
companies raises companyspecific esg issues in their meetings
with company management and directors
in addition to the corporate governance meetings discussed
previously the amp capital esg research team had over
90 meetings with companies where we had the opportunity
to raise companyspecific esg issues most of these meetings
were attended alongside amp capitals equity and fixed income
investment analysts which reinforced the link between investment
decisions and esg issues the response from companies was mixed
but we have noticed a general acknowledgement that companies
need to be prepared to discuss these issues with investors the
continued focus on esg issues by amp capital in our investment
meetings has reinforced to companies the increasing importance
that investors are placing on esg issues
engaging with other investors and stakeholders to provide a
deeper understanding and an investor perspective on a range
of esg issues
the amp capital esg research team had over 70 noncompany
meetings where we actively engaged other investors and
stakeholders to develop a better understanding of an industry
or issue the range of topics covered varied significantly from
attending the icgn conference in london engaging with a broad
crosssection of australian industry bodies and nongovernment
organisations on reviewing australias climate change policy
options through to our continued engagement with non
government organisations on human rights and supply chain
issues we are also increasingly being asked by the media to
comment on the investor relevance of a range of esg issues
in addition amp capital continues to be a signatory to the access
to medicine index with an estimated two billion people still not
having access to healthrelated products the access to medicine
index considers how the large pharmaceutical companies are
addressing this issue in an affordable way during the year
access to medicine released their 2014 ratings of companies to
provide insights into how companies in the sector are addressing
these issues
in 2015 amp capital became a signatory to the access to nutrition
indexs atnis investor statement this was done to support the
work being done by the access to nutrition foundation and also
as we plan to use the atni to help assess companies in the food
and beverages sector using it to identify potential engagement
opportunities with companies in the sector
the atni is produced by msci and is financed by the wellcome
trust the bill  melinda gates foundation and the childrens
investment fund foundation there are two ideas behind the
index to allow companies to benchmark their own performance
on nutrition against their peers and to provide an objective source
of information for stakeholders including investors the access to
nutrition foundation aims to make the atni a useful investment
tool with signatories to the atni currently managing over
us3 trillion in assets
