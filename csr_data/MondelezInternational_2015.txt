foods we make are safe we needed to evolve our

nutritious foods and live healthier lives and thats

of our five business growth strategies

future of cocoa farming this is why we include
these areas as crosscutting themes throughout
our cocoa life program

gender equality benefits everyone and is essential
if cocoa communities are to thrive yet the cocoa
industry is still plagued by gaps in income and lack
of opportunities for women in cocoa communities
our priority is to address these issues headon in
our supply chain while also advocating for others
to do their part

women are often the cornerstones of their
communities we know from talking with
community leaders that empowering women
has a positive impact on their children families
and villages therefore we are focused on
collaborating with local governments suppliers
and third parties to help address this challenge
in early 2014 we published thirdparty
assessments done by harvard university and
care international which revealed striking gaps
in income and opportunities for female cocoa
farmers for example in ghana female cocoa
farmers earn 25 percent to 30 percent less than
their male counterparts and in côte divoire
women in cocoa communities earn up to 70
percent less than men in both countries women
struggle with lower farm productivity smaller
farms and less access to financing and farm inputs

based on those insights we strengthened our
action plan on womens empowerment in cocoa
communities we have taken steps in ghana and

   2014 to announce the first global timeline
   to slow and then end forest loss the new
   york declaration on forests strives to cut
   forest loss in half by 2020 and end it by
   2030  and also calls for restoring at least 350
   million hectares of degraded forest lands by
   2030 an area greater than the size of india
   when implemented the declaration would
   cut emissions of global warming pollution
   between 45 and 88 billion tons every year 
   the rough equivalent of removing from the

   a trillion pounds of coal or turning off every

   reduced packaging in many of our products in 2014
    by finding a way to eliminate the shipper box for picnic bars sold in russia we were able to
     reduce packaging by 35 million pounds 1594 metric tonnes per year

    in latin america we reduced the pouch and display height of tang which resulted in more
     pouches per display unit and optimized paperboard and cardboard consumption the changes
     created package reductions of nearly a million pounds 441 metric tonnes per year

    by replacing the oreo cookie tray with a film wrap we were able to reduce packaging by
     650000 pounds approximately 300 metric tonnes per year in china

eliminating waste

knowing that the vast majority of the waste we
generate is from our factories it is there that
we continually search for innovative reduction
solutions these solutions led to production
changes and employee training programs that
have resulted in measurable results

today we are recycling or reusing the bulk of our
manufacturing waste from 2010 to 2014 we were
able to reduce net waste by 57 percent per tonne
 far exceeding our 15 percent goal

have increased whole grains by 23 percent across our portfolio new products in 2014 such as our
honey maid go bites wheat thins baked pita chips and barni mini biscuits combined with our efforts
to increase whole grain content in products like our prince biscuits in the eu are helping us reach our

percent and sodium by 26 percent

sugar

there has been an increasing interest in sugar consumption and its impact on weight gain and other
health considerations we believe the best way we can help people reduce the amount of sugar
they consume is through our efforts to reduce calories and offer portion control options reducing
sugar without reducing calories is not a benefit when it comes to reducing the risk of obesity unlike
a beverage when sugar is removed from a food it must be replaced with something else and that
replacement is usually another carbohydrate that has the same or similar amount of calories as sugar
over the years we have introduced products with less sugar and calories such as our lower sugar
tang products we also have a number of sugarfree options such as powdered beverage clight in
latin america sugarfree version of halls more than 90 percent of our gum is sugar free  which also
supports oral health
