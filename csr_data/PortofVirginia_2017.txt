       sustainability is one of our six core values

       sustainability is one of our six core values it is also one of the driving factors behind every decision
       we make at the port of virginia as a key economic engine for virginia we must ensure we can serve
       that critical role for generations to come that means we must be sustainable financially operationally
       and environmentally as stewards of tomorrow it is our mission  and our privilege  to do so

       in fiscal year 2016 we handled a recordbreaking 146 million containers  and did so more safely
       swiftly and sustainably than ever further we did so profitably for the second consecutive year we
       were able to grow our rail volume by double digits reduce our turn times and improve workplace
       safety  our highest priority we welcomed the first 10000 teu twentyfoot container equivalent
       unit vessel through the newly opened locks of the panama canal and continued working with our
       partners at the army corps of engineers to ensure our shipping channels are deep enough wide
       enough and safe enough for this new era of large container ships in anticipation of the expected
       increases in volume we embarked on a capacitybuilding project on a scale unlike anything ever
       done here before

       the port of virginia is built on the foundation of six anchor
       values mindfulness innovation fortitude helpfulness
       sustainability and accessibility it drives everything we do

       engaging with and educating our communities remains a priority our marine incident response
       team mirt welcomed its 25th class of first responders from across the globe to our worldrenowned
       marine firefighting school as reliance on technology becomes more necessary we work with
       partners including the us coast guard to train against cyber security attacks in support of our
       mission to improve virginias waterways our aid to local ports program provided 1 million to cities
       throughout our region for projects including dredging dock and slip upgrades wharf improvements
       and jetty rehabilitation

       we have a clear path forward and are using our values to guide us as we plan for our future with
       strong support vision and leadership from our board of commissioners our general assembly and
       administration we are using the momentum gained over the past two years to propel us forward with
       confidence and clarity

       sustainability starts with our people it takes innovation creativity and a drive for continual
       improvement but we cannot do it alone

       it will take all of our efforts we invite you to join us and become stewards of tomorrow

       the improvements at nit south have the potential to help create over 120000 additional jobs across the commonwealth




                  stewards of our money and yours
       by attracting new jobs and businesses to the region growth at the port of virginia equates to growth
       across the commonwealth we strive to make the most of all of our resources  especially our
       financial resources thats why we constantly seek out and take advantage of available grant dollars in
       fiscal year 2016 port projects supported by 169 million in state and federal grants added value
       to virginia communities and contributed to our fiscal sustainability
       for example a transportation investment generating economic recovery tiger grant from the


          in fiscal year 2016 port projects supported by 169 million
                in state and federal grants added value to virginia
               communities and contributed to fiscal sustainability

       us department of transportation paved the way for an expansion of the norfolk international
       terminals north gate complex in 2015 when completed in summer 2017 this 26lane gate will more
       than double the terminals gate capacity we would not have been able to undertake that project if it
       werent for tiger funding

       this year us maritime administration marad committed more than 476000 in grant funds
       to our 64 express barge service from our terminals in hampton roads to the richmond
       marine terminal rmt well use those funds to help purchase a 52000pound forklift for rmt
       and 40foot generator power pack for our barge the forklift will enable rmt to process new types
       of inbound and outbound cargo the generator will enable our barge to carry refrigerated cargo
       expanding our service capabilities to rmt and supporting growing grocery and wine market
       opportunities for the surrounding communities as well

                                    a rubber tire gantry crane rtg helps move cargo at nit



       using additional grant money we purchased four previously owned rubber tire gantry
       cranes rtgs for approximately 3 million euro doing so saved us half the cost of new equipment and
       cut the time to put into service by 15 months new equipment was also on the agenda this year with
       the newly minted 40year lease at rmt we were able to secure federal funding to buy a 4 million
       350ton mobile harbor crane it replaces old equipment and increases the velocity at which containers
       move on and off terminal at rmt as we drive more and more cargo along the interstate
       95 corridor

       the maritime incident response team mirt maximizes federal dollars through the port security
       grant psg program recent psg awards will fund our cyber security and maritime domain awareness
       initiatives by upgrading command and control systems at the port police command center additional
       grant monies covered our 48foot mobile port authority command 1pac1 unit

       pac1 is designed to be deployed to an incident or event to provide support command and control
       communications and continuity of operations pac1 features radio satellite cell phone communications
       equipment and computers to support incident command functions pac1 is also equipped with
       marine radar and an automatic identification system ais to conduct maritime operations it is not
       only available for use by mirt member agencies but also by partner agencies like other equipment
       acquired through grants it is frequently in use averaging one deployment every week

       beyond the use of grants financial stewardship means streamlining port processes to be more
       convenient and costeffective weve streamlined and standardized our schedule of rates sor to align
       cyclical rate increases reducing the amount of relevant paperwork annually from four documents to
       two the sor now encompasses and standardizes more rates and services for all of the facilities under
       the port of virginia umbrella

       at the port of virginia financial stewardship allows us to meet our goals we can move more cargo
       while serving the commonwealth responsibly

        all port colleagues and patrons are required to
                                                   the single most important lesson that every member of
          attend a comprehensive safety orientation
                                                   the port team must understand is that all mishaps have
                                                   a human element and therefore can be prevented said
       ronald babski vice president of health and safety at the port our colleagues and partners on the
       ground interacting smartly and safely with each other every day demonstrate our commitment to
       building a safer workplace

                                 all mishaps have a human element
                                  and therefore can be prevented
                             ronald babski vice president of health  safety at the port

       our leadership must continually set the right example to foster a safer workplace our executive safety
       leadership and supervisor safety leadership training programs educate port executives and
       managers on the proper strategies to reduce accidents improve employee morale and analyze incidents
       in 2016 a combined 192 executives and supervisors participated in those training programs

       from the top down all new port colleagues and patrons are required to attend a comprehensive safety
       orientation the orientation complements our original document the operational standards which
       details key safety procedures for all port activities

       to reinforce safe behavior at all levels the terminal safety infraction policy tsip was instituted
       to reward excellence and correct unsafe activity tsip requires all port workers contractors
       vendors and others to comply with 35 fundamental health and safety rules across all facilities port
       leadership recognizes compliance by documenting excellence sending letters of recognition and
       presenting small tokens of gratitude such as a safety vest to team members meanwhile corrections
       to noncompliance are provided through citations ranging from a written warning to a suspension and
       remedial training

       along with tsip our 51 program ensures safe behavior and the rewards that go along with
       reinforcing it on a daily basis the 51 program requires managers and supervisors to positively
       recognize equipment operators five times for excellence for each time an operator is decertified or
       retrained for noncompliance with more than 1200 exchanges in 2016 tsip and the 51
       program are where the rubber meets the road within our health and safety strategy

       ultimately our commitment to health and safety across our terminals results in a more productive
       sustainable workforce while one onthejob injury is too many year after year the port of virginia
       maintains a belowaverage number of lost work days due to injury compared to industry average

                                                 mitigate risk and respond to events with practiced resiliency
                                                 to prepare for everything from fluctuations in the shipping
                                                 industry to rising sea levels our port employs a thorough

                                                 risks rather than preparing for challenges at a department
       or agency level we work to bridge the gap between on and offterminal stakeholders and to create a
       framework for addressing risks as a unified entity whether those issues are related to the web weath
       er or work site

       cyber
       moving cargo around the world requires more than ships trucks and trains it requires sophisticated
       software and equipment that enables that cargo to move safely swiftly and sustainably cyber security
       is an integral part of our overall security measures we work with the us coast guards cyber com
       mand and the federal bureau of investigation to protect our facilities employees and partners against
       a breach cyber exercises like cyber crucible a firstever tabletop exercise program for us are
       an integral part of preparing for and protecting against 21stcentury threats

       nature
       our ports location along the east coast requires preparation
       for natural disasters hurricanes noreasters snow and ice
       storms  even the occasional tornado  can impact and
       impede port services

       the answer to these potential threats begins with analyzing
       our infrastructure we identify potential vulnerabilities within
       our facilities and operations allowing us to prioritize invest
       ments and harden infrastructure accordingly for instance
       an ongoing resiliency study seeks to map terminals
       against projected storm surges and flood risks the goal
       is to identify infrastructure that requires strengthening or re
       location eliminate potential points of failure and assign risk grades for every imaginable scenario its
       through these efforts that an informed capital budget is created

       sea level rise is of particular interest and concern to us hampton roads is the secondmost susceptible
       region in the us to rising sea levels and because we are a catalyst for commerce disruptions to
       port operations can have widespread economic impacts on the region thats why we work with off
       terminal stakeholders in academia local government industry and the military on studies to identify
       threats and propose resiliency strategies for our port and the community at large

       occupational
       protecting our colleagues health and safety is job number one ongoing training and an
       emergency notification system prepare port employees for potential threats in 2016 we trained
       136 colleagues during a simulated active shooter exercise that incorporated both personal
       response techniques and law enforcement response providing this type of situational awareness
       training further reinforces our core values in our colleagues

       in addition to fostering more business and increasing safety accommodating larger vessels also offers
       the ability to move cargo more inexpensively and with fewer emissions in turn passing savings on to
       consumers and reducing our impact on the environment with nearly 15 million cargo containers
       moving in and out of our ports terminals in fiscal year 2016 alone were on track to grow those
       numbers and sustain them through a deeper channel passage

       the port of virginia moves more cargo via rail than any other east coast port at norfolk international terminals
       two 2000horsepower ultralow emission locomotives reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 80 percent and consume
       50 percent less fuel than conventional diesel locomotives off terminal we partner with norfolk southern and csx
       to connect the middle of the country with the rest of the world by moving freight to and from our terminals to
       cities including columbus chicago and memphis and as is the case with barges transporting cargo by rail takes
       trucks off the roads thus reducing wear and tear on roads and providing another more environmentally friendly
       way to move cargo and expand our reach into multiple markets well beyond virginia

       in fiscal year 2016 fy16 the port of virginia welcomed 15 college students into the summer intern
       ship program after the program had concluded three of those students began work at the port
       aiding us in building a costeffective workforce with talented and experienced colleagues meanwhile
       our ports involvement with the communities in schools outreach program exposed five high school
       students to career opportunities in the maritime industry

       in total our fy16 community outreach efforts comprised more than 40 events in various areas
        from the support of local colleges and universities to community service organizations our volunteers
       partnered with csx and skw constructors to clean more than 35 miles of shoreline removing
       6000 pounds of trash from the elizabeth river as part of the annual chesapeake bay founda
       tions clean the bay day our commitment to the sustainability of the elizabeth river grows year after
       year having earned us 17 consecutive river star awards from the elizabeth river project

       our volunteer council spearheads much of our community involvement in fy16 through the councils
       leadership we raised 29000 for the united way and delivered 2100 pounds of canned goods
       to the foodbank of southeastern virginia

       in addition to serving our communities atlarge our programs support the needs of our port partners
       as well as publicly owned marine facilities truck drivers are an integral part of our supply chain 
       moving nearly twothirds of the port of virginias cargo its fitting that our employees delivered gift
       bags safety vests and hats to more than 1000 of those drivers during national truck driver
       appreciation week in september

       in fy16 we were able to present seven awards across hampton roads through our annual
       aid to local ports program a grant program allowing local governments to apply for a portion of
       1000000 in designated funds as an example in fy16 the city of newport news received more
       than 630000 for the replacement of a bulkhead at the seafood industrial park

       without the grant the city would be unable to deliver full funding to make this major upgrade to one
       of our prime revenuegenerating assets without sacrificing other capital improvement needs said
       florence kingston director of the department of development for the city of newport news

       from isle of wight county to the eastern shore thousands of dollars were awarded for marine facility
       improvements aid to local ports is one of the many ways we contribute to the sustainability of the
       communities we touch throughout the year

       partnered with the city of richmond the richmond transportation planning organization and virginias
       office of publicprivate partnerships to study the best use of the currently underutilized industrially
       zoned land around rmt we hope by encouraging the development of whats known as the commerce
       road corridor we can help attract even more port users to the area

       attractive location for logistics and manufacturing said jane ferrara chief operating officer of
       economic and community development for the city of richmond our partnership with the port of
       virginia connects the city to a global market and creates tremendous economic opportunity to drive
       new investment and highquality jobs along the commerce road corridor

       fiscal year 2017 it will be integrated the virginia inland port and pinners point container yard with the

       this leadingedge tos allows for automated gate and transfer services that make operations safer for
       port employees and motor carriers navis a system used across several ports worldwide replaces an
       older custombuilt system thereby reducing the need for a large internal management staff and costly
       downtime as a result of maintenance

       also on the horizon is the development of an advanced enterprise asset management eam program
       that will support our capital spending and strategic capital decision making with more than 2 billion
       of total assets it is important for us to manage what we have how we maintain it and how and when
       we replace it through a wellplanned eam system assets such as infrastructure finances and human
       capital are strategically prioritized and managed to maximize investments while minimizing downtime
       through predictive maintenance practices
