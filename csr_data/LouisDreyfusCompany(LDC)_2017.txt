comparison by region
looking at our metrics for this year the global increase in the volume of
commodities we processed has resulted in absolute values increasing but
overall improvement in most indices as resource usage was diluted across
the higher volumes we handled efficiencies and improvements were made
in a number of areas as demonstrated by the improved consumption per
unit rates recorded by the end of the year
