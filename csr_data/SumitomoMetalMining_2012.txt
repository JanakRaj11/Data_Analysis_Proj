                    our aim has long been to become a major player in                   in 2008 we established our csr vision for 2020
                    the nonferrous metals industry and we have made                   which covered our six key csr areas and accordingly
                    excellent progress toward that goal in the shape of                 we undertook various activities in pursuit of that goal
            such new activities as our participation in the sierra gorda       however in 2011 after a careful assessment of what we had
            copper mine project in chile                                      and had not accomplished we made modifications to our
                the key element of the threeyear business plan is             roadmap toward realizing it during those three years social
            realignment of our businesses we operate three core               conditions had undergone change both in japan and
            businessesmineral resources smelting and refining and           overseasand so had the needs of society we had to ask
            materials the mineral resources business is being                 ourselves once again what contribution we could make
            transformed to maximize our profits as a resources supplier        through our main lines of business and we made the
            beyond simply securing stable access to raw materials for our      necessary revisions to the roadmap as a consequence
            own smelters and refineries the smelting and refining                 our overseas expansion during the period of the three
            business is undergoing realignment to accommodate changes          year business plan has also uncovered problems that we had
            in such areas as demand costs and new technologies in the       previously failed to perceive for example we are of course
            materials business we are concentrating on particular sectors    aware of human rights issues such as poverty and child labor
            this involves focusing on materials in the environment and         in emerging nations but it is difficult to fully understand these
            energy domain for which there is high social demandsuch           issues from our perspective here in japan when we begin
            as cathode materials for secondary vehicle batteries and leds      operating in a region where such issues are ongoing problems
            for ordinary lightingand withdrawing from areas with low          however it is our responsibility to face up to them earnestly
            expectations of growth we have also reorganized our               we hope to apply the experience we have gained in this
            businesses so that all manufacturing activities fall into one of   manner to the resolution of specific social issues

            to providing constant support for the reconstruction                  contribution through our business operations one
            efforts in affected areas through our business activities            activity where we employ our strengths to help
   we supply the basic materials advanced materials and                achieve sustainable coexistence with society and the global

   represent the future for the affected communities as well as         both for society and the company
   by providing support that leads to positive development in                 we are therefore looking to advance our technological
   other communities for example we are currently considering          development by further enhancing our research framework
   joining forces with an npo that supports human resources              for example in order to advance rd related to recycling and
   development to help create an appropriate system for                  other effective uses of resources we will tap our integrated

        we have also established a system which is not confined
   to the communities affected by the great east japan
   earthquake whereby the company will assist private
   participation by employees in volunteer activities

            in october 2011 an armed group attacked taganito                    i want our employees to learn about the issues facing
            on the philippine island of mindanao where the smm                  society and fully understand them so that they can
            group is building a plant i am delighted to say that no             reach the point where they are able to not only explain
   one at the plant site or in the local community was injured          them to others but also consider them from the perspective of
   construction of the plant has resumed and we expect                  their own jobs i hope that through their jobsand also
   commercial production to begin on schedule it was a very             through other activities such as overseas experience and
   unfortunate event but in a way it has forced us to break out         private volunteer activitiesthey will think about how social
   of our shell as a company                                            issues might be resolved and take appropriate action and
       since our aim is to be a major player in the nonferrous          once they have attained their target i trust they will aim for a
   metals industry our operations extend all over the world            new target applying all the knowledge and experience they
   however in some respects we have treated those activities as         have gained
   somewhat of an extension of our domestic business our
   approach has always been that its important to recognize that
   social conditions differ by country and by region and to
   become fully acquainted with the needs of local communities
   in addition to meeting international standards however we           nobumasa kemori
   are now aware that more is needed it is possible that                president and representative director
   something much worse than the taganito incident could
   happen elsewhere we plan to apply the lessons we learned
   from this experience so that we can become more sensitive to
   local issues in our efforts to become a genuine major non
   ferrous metals company

             mineral resources division
               csr in our business
             the mineral resources division carries out activities such as mineral exploration and mine
             development in order to secure resources for the production of gold copper and nickel
             smm makes a companywide effort to promote the effective use of resources which is one
             element of our csr policy and our basic stance is to use resources effectively to achieve
             coexistence with nature and local communities the mineral resources business cycle is
             inherently long and therefore we currently advance the business from a medium to
             longterm perspective based on a longterm vision covering up to 2021 we are also working
             to increase recovery of target metals from ore mined at existing copper and gold projects to
             ensure that resources are utilized not wasted                                                          pogo mine



               issues in the six key csr areas

               environmental preservation                                                                   respect for people and human rights
             in the mineral resources business its essential that consideration is shown toward         employee development is advanced primarily
             the environment during development and operations at the pogo mine we                      through onthejob training ojt with the
             ensure compliance with alaskas stringent environmental regulations by taking                hishikari mine in japan and the pogo mine
             comprehensive environmental measures such as employing a system that ensures                overseas also serving as places of learning
             no cyanide escapes from the process prior to new mine development projects                 human resources are secured through
             we submit environmental impact statements eis to the relevant governments                 various means in japan for example we hire
             and in countries and regions where laws are yet to be established we voluntarily             people midway through their careers in
             observe international standards as we go about our activities                               addition to new graduates overseas we
                                                                                                          actively seek human resources locally
               contribution to society and local communities                                                 for the solomon project we hired more
               stakeholder communication                                                                  than 200 local workers to take part in
                                                                                                          exploration activities through activities like
             we help to fulfill the needs of communities where we operate by providing                    these we are creating opportunities for
             support for education and community growth such as giving donations to                      workers to learn skills such as how to use
             schools in the solomon islands we contributed grants to help fund participation            mining equipment and analyze ore samples
             in the beijing 2008 olympic games and we did the same again for the 2012                    these initiatives represent our efforts to
             london olympics                                                                             bring about selfsustaining growth in the
                 when starting a project in a community we proceed cautiously obtaining the             local community in the future
             approval of local residents through briefings and other painstaking efforts in all
             communities we enter agreements with each landowner and make efforts to
             ensure residents rights are not violated
                 in peru we encountered cautious opinions about mine development due to
             concerns about the pollution of water sources in these cases too we persist
             with ongoing dialogue in order to communicate the companys social and
             environmental initiatives and give people in the community peace of mind


               my approach to csr
             the fundamental idea of csr is to become a company that society can trust and i
             believe there are four central elements to this the first is looking after people a
             company that cares for people well will be able to attract talented human resources and
             enhance its corporate value the second element is consideration of the environment
             we have to be as careful as we possibly can to avoid damage to our credibility within
             society due to incidents like harmful substance leaks the third is social contribution the
             smm group has a public duty to provide a reliable supply of nonferrous metals and
             every employee needs to remember that as they go about their job the final element is
             information disclosure i believe we must communicate these ideas and activities of ours
             across society

               my message to employees
             csr cannot be forced upon employees with each employee observing the smm group
             code of conduct in their work activities taking the initiative and acting autonomously
             the quality of the workforce as a whole will improve and it will become the foundation
             for sustainable corporate growth
                                                                                 yukio kawaguchi

                                                                                                                        introducing business operations




nonferrous metals division
 csr in our business
the nonferrous metals division carries out production of gold silver nickel lead zinc
chemical products wrought copper and copper alloy and special steel products as we
engage in smelting and refining in the vicinity of mines in which we have invested and taken
an interest it is more important than ever before that we make full use of the resources
taken out of the ground and show consideration toward communities where we set up
business and the surrounding environment
    only around 05 of copper ores and 12 of nickel ores actually become resources
and improving recovery from ores is an ongoing challenge waste material left after refining
nickel intermediates is buried in tailings dams and therefore we have to ask local residents to
relocate and the impact on ecosystems might become a problem but through additional
recovery of resources from residue we can reduce the volume of waste material and reduce
the area taken up by dams turning recovered iron into resources and paying taxes on their              anode casting wheel toyo smelter  refinery
sale will also benefit local residents


 issues in the six key csr areas

 effective use of resources                                     environmental preservation
at the taganito project scheduled to start operating in      by extracting iron from nickel mine waste and turning it into a
fy2013 we had to determine what to do with the               resource we are indirectly causing a reduction in the development of
waste material left after refining to be able to sell iron   iron ore resources the smm group is also helping to curb global
contained in the waste as iron ore chromium in the           warming as its nickel hydroxide is used as a cathode material for
iron has to be removed niihama research laboratories         hybrid vehicle batteries we are currently working on recovering nickel
have developed an efficient way to do this and we are         resources from endoflife vehicles for recycling back into battery
now working with iron and steel works on making               materials
effective use of waste material
    in the zinc business the current business format of
smelting zinc from imported ore is no longer feasible
                                                                occupational health and safety
costwise to keep the smelter running and preserve           unable to attain our target of five or fewer occupational accidents in
employment in the community we are looking for ways          one year we will be directing further energy into safety management
to continue operations using recycled raw materials           promoting greater bottomup efforts from the front line of
obtained in japan in the copper business after              operations to do this we will get small groups to have solid
identifying needs within the japanese market for slag        discussions on why safety is important as we need to get employees
which remains after smelting we generated a demand           to the point where they will act autonomously
for 200000 tons to be used in cement aggregate



 my approach to csr
corporations naturally pursue profits but they have to make sure the profits do not go
counter to their social responsibilities improving the substance of our business also
benefits society and so we are always thinking about how to translate costs spent on
environmental preservation for example into business advantage i think that unless we
advance csr activities through our business acknowledging it is worth it both from a
cost perspective and in terms of social recognition they will not last




 my message to employees
i would like employees to be able to initiate csr activity themselves rather than wait for
instructions from above its therefore important that middle managers encourage
younger employees to change their way of thinking elements of csr that are stressed in
the csr report like thinking about stakeholders and helping to resolve social issues
should be natural for our employees as members of a corporation and of society and so

             materials division
               csr in our business
             the materials division was established in 2012 through the integration of the advanced

             manufacturer by supplying products of a high quality this is achieved by staying aware of what
             society demands from the smm group and manufacturing products with the right functionality
             and price to meet those needs
                 specifically this involves contributing to energy and resource efficiency through products
             and actively pursuing recycling operations such as the recovery of precious metals from waste
                                                                                                               6inch sapphire substrates and ingots

             people in charge of overseas subsidiaries also gather regularly in japan to build a            from customers recognizing that society
             common understanding about business policies and management                                   increasingly demands efforts within the

               occupational health and safety                                                               human rights we choose appropriate
                                                                                                            suppliers and ask for their understanding
             the entire division is addressing safety management to prevent occupational
                                                                                                            before doing business with them
             accidents if an accident does occur thorough investigation and analysis are carried
             out to determine why it happened and what should be done to prevent it
             happening again and the resulting measures are introduced across the division in
             all workplaces under its control


               my approach to csr
             i believe it is a necessary ongoing challenge for us to stay aware of how consistent our
             corporate activities are with societys needs and to contribute to society through our
             business the materials division employs more than half the workforce of the entire
             smm group compared to the mineral resources and nonferrous metals divisions
             many of our products have short product cycles and that alone means we have to stay
             well aware of our corporate responsibility to protect our employees jobs and lifestyles i
             think its vital that we select and focus on strong businesses that will become a
             foundation for corporate growth and create work environments where employees feel
             secure


               my message to employees
             the smm group has a duty to supply products of a high quality to society and this is
             also the duty of each individual employee who works for the company as well as taking
             pride in your work while being attentive to the benefits that our products provide to
             society i want you to review your job processes in pursuit of further quality and
             efficiency improvements
                                                                                      yasushi hashimoto

               experts we asked them what they thought smm group needed to do to grow into a better global
               corporation and to help build a sustainable society and about what employees should bear in mind
               and the action they should take the dialogue took place on april 25 2012

               mr wakabayashi as you continue to expand your overseas                                      corporate activity affects because passing over someone
               operations i think you will need to consider human rights in                                who is affected could potentially lead to serious problems
               terms of international standards its important that you stay                               how to determine your sphere of influence and how to
               aware of those standards and consult the definitions and                                    respond if something does happena framework for

               social issues because you will need employees who can                                        corporations wanting to go global but dont think of human
               accurately grasp the issues to work out what contribution to                                 rights only in terms of the negative aspects its very

               mr wakabayashi i also think its important when                                            will be an advantage when you become a major player in

comprising employees of any age or gender who can                                 mr sato smm what youre saying is that praise from an
operate anywhere in the world                                                    ngo delivers a much stronger message than a corporation
 iso 26000 international guidance on social responsibility for organizations   coming out saying we did this we did that being self
a broad range of stakeholders including corporations consumers labor           congratulatory i too would like to pursue activity together
unions governments and ngos were involved in creation of the guidance
which aims to contribute to sustainable development
                                                                                  with ngos rather than just engage in dialogue
                                                                                  ms kuroda in last years csr report you said you place
                                                                                  importance on communication with local communities and i
building good community ties through                                              believe thats very important in connection to your business
shared understanding based on                                                     through such communication with local communities you
communication with partners                                                       begin to see the kind of contribution you should be making
                                                                                  to the community
ms takahashi corporations are a part of this planet too
they are a part of society as such stakeholders and
corporations are partners working together to make the
planet and society better i believe corporations need to be
willing to lead the way and instigate activities
ms kuroda partnership is the general rule under iso
26000 the global standard of today calls for multiple
sectors of society including corporations ngos and other
organizations to cooperate pooling resources and ideas in
order to resolve issues faced by society or communities that
a single sector cannot tackle alone i would like to see the
smm group take a more integrative approach in its
relationships with communities and stakeholders instead of                        mr hashinaka smm developing a business facility
dealing with one at a time as in smm and local                                  particularly a mine leads to the creation of a small town
communities or smm and ngos                                                   since you need company housing medical centers stores
mr sato smm i agree we fully understand that                                  and schools its therefore necessary to pursue development
corporations residents of local communities and                                  thats oriented around the community so as not to destroy
governments are all part of a wider circle each relating to                      the preexisting culture i feel that communication is
the others in a variety of ways this is indeed something we                      essential in that sense
have to work towards                                                             ms takahashi with regard to social contribution i would
ms takahashi communication is the basis for all                                  like to see you advance efforts in communities with the aim
cooperation with your various stakeholders when                                  of resolving social issues rather than being overly concerned
                                 considering ways to                              about receiving high praise from society
                                 communicate i think the idea
                                 of shared understanding
                                 should be embraced
                                                                                  revisiting sumitomos dna when making
                                 internally for example                         tough decisions and adding current
                                 executive officers and                           knowledge to succeed internationally
                                 employees might take part in
                                 volunteering activities                          mr kogure the most important consideration when
                                 together and i think taking                     expanding overseas is corporate identity the smm group
                                 part in activities with outside                  has existed for 420 years thanks to the dedication of those
                                 stakeholders too would                         who have gone before that is your greatest asset and i
                                 similarly generate the sense of                  believe people overseas will see it that way too
understanding being shared                                                       ms takahashi do you have many opportunities to reacquaint
ms kuroda building good relationships with ngos also has                         yourselves with sumitomos dna or business spirit
advantages engaging ngos in your operations right from                           mr asai smm yes we do they are drilled into us
the start can facilitate ties with the community and there                       constantly from the time we start training as new
are cases where a companys image has improved because                            employees when faced with tough business decisions they
an ngo sent out a message saying its efforts were a good                          represent a starting point to revisit to help us work out a

impact of the companys operation on a community several                          ms takahashi and that leads to the smm groups csr

             wellestablished csr framework and the sumitomo business       party or when giving instructions remembering there is a

smm should indicate specific procedures taken to incorporate human                    we have described some procedures of how investment assessments are
rights considerations when investing                                                 implemented in our explanations of activities and we will continue

rather than touch upon human rights in different areas it would be                   after reviewing the reports design we have enhanced the composition
better to make human rights matters more visible under a single                       for each of the six key csr areas and have grouped topics related to
heading                                                                              human rights together as much as possible

                                                                                      provided comments on initiatives within their divisions

it is hard to grasp specific initiatives   i couldnt see how initiatives             targets and initiatives were made more specific through changes to our
relating to the six key csr areas         related to or would be linked to          roadmap and have been reflected in plans for next fiscal year
please make improvements                  targets

efforts of group companies                 the smm groups csr policy is              coverage of group company initiatives has been expanded overall
should be highlighted more                very well stated but i feel it hasnt     clarification of the relationship between activities and the csr policy
                                           permeated through to group                 has also been included for each of the six key csr areas
                                           companies yet

csr activity goes on indefinitely and so i think we need ongoing                      feedback on action expected of employees was received during the
forwardlooking efforts and as many aspects have not yet permeated                   stakeholder dialogue and comments from division general managers
through to all employees we should be advancing activities that get                  have also been included
employees more involved

i think comments from stakeholders like people actually living in local               comments sought from outside parties with a significant interest in
communities rather than socalled experts would offer more specific                 each of the six key csr areas have been included on the pages covering
insight into the opinions of people outside the company                              each area

in regard to respect for people and human rights i felt explanations to              comments on the direction and progress of initiatives relating to
employees were insufficient i cannot ascertain what a rewarding                      worklife balance were provided by related personnel
workplace is supposed to be or how one is to be created

i would like to see more content dealing with activities overseas eg               a lot of information on overseas activities and comments from overseas
china the philippines and south america                                           employees has been included as well as examples of communication
                                                                                      with overseas communities

i want to know about the issues and risks we face how we respond to                  introductions to specific initiatives in the six key csr areas were written
them and any trouble we might be having                                             with a focus on the approaches to and motivation behind work
                                                                                      processes and efforts to enhance crisis management were outlined as a

            stakeholder comment
     resource processing technologies initiated through mine development are used for processing large volumes
     they consist of lowcost processes making them ideal for application to recycling waste processing and
     environmental remediation it is hoped they will evolve into resource recycling technology that will bring about
     a swift resolution to environmental and resource issues through our research relating for example to the
     recovery of phosphorus from sewage sludge full recycling of waste concrete the recovery of cenospheres
     from coal fly ash and the recovery of rare earth materials from waste fluorescent lamps we have shown that
     the application of resource processing technologies enables the relatively lowcost recovery of valuable
     materials from resources which would previously have been discarded or used as cement material
         smm has paved the way for commercial nickel refining operations that use lowgrade nickel oxide ores as
     the raw material this and other accomplishments demonstrate smms technological prowess but i also feel
     they have been a driving force behind recent advances in rd activities kyushu university conducts joint
     research with smm through our comprehensive collaboration service with many achievements in terms of                   tsuyoshi hirajima
     both research and human resources development i believe this kind of collaboration on research between                 professor
     industry and academia is vital not only for enhancing japans technological prowess but also for developing            department of earth resources engineering
                                                                                                                             kyushu university graduate school
     human resources for the resources field and it will have an influence on future university education i hope
                                                                                                                             of engineering

     we will make effective use of lowgrade and hardtoprocess ores as resources by
employing proprietary technologies while targeting the acquisition of new resources
through active exploration and mine development recovering accessory elements in ores
besides targeted metals and turning them into resources is another important initiative in
the area of recycling we will press ahead with our nickel metal hydride nimh battery
recycling operation and we will look to establish processes for recycling items like lithium
ion liion batteries effective use of products will involve promoting slag reuse by
improving and maintaining the quality of slag
     through these initiatives we aim to become and continue to develop as a company
that generates resources using innovative technology

   water usage
freshwater usage increased modestly in fy2011 the smm
group has commenced initiatives to reduce water usage with
a view to preserving biodiversity
    the niihama division of nippon ketjen reduces water
usage through repeated use of water for cleaning aluminum
hydroxide cake
    seawater usage decreased about 18 due to suspension
of the toyo smelter  refinery for full furnace renovation

  roadmap revisions
                the previous roadmap prescribed that 50 of new products should be products
                with low environmental impact given our aim to contribute to society through
       point
        01      our business the revised roadmap prescribes expansion of the materials business
                targeting products with low environmental impact which includes existing
                products not just new products
                        creating energy materials for powergenerating solar cells and fuel cells etc
                        storing energy materials for powerstoring secondary batteries
                        saving energy materials for devices which make a large contribution to energy savings

                zero industrial waste emissions means reducing the volume of industrial waste
                that undergoes final disposal to zero if products such as iron pellets generated
       point    by recycling operations intermediate processing of industrial waste are not all
       02       reused they must inevitably undergo final disposal as reducing this amount to
                zero is difficult a target for industrial waste final disposal volume to achieve by
                2020 will be set and reduction efforts made


         stakeholder comment

   i am pleased to be involved with smms taganito project thpal in the philippines through the provision
   of finance
       i even had the chance to visit the location and i was impressed by the communitys high regard for
   smm this is due to environmental efforts such as carrying out a baseline study of vegetation and social
   initiatives which besides the introduction of a social development program based on guidelines provided
   by the local government include many selfinitiated community contribution activities as well as the
   establishment of a framework for conducting regular hearings to identify the communitys requests
   relating to the project and reflecting those findings in csr activities
       even after operations begin at thpal i hope smm will persist with its social initiatives as well as its
   efforts to build medium to longterm relationships of mutual trust with the local government and the             junsuke arita

environmental impact and we have partially revised our csr vision for 2020 believing
we should contribute to society by expanding our business of supplying materials used
in such products we aim to contribute to society through technologies employed
within the smm groups materials business
    in order to preserve biodiversity besides the contribution we make through our
products its vital that we lower our impact on the environment during manufacturing
this involves saving energy unit energy consumption and reducing co2 emissions
industrial waste chemical substance releases and water usage each job process we
perform at our workplace also has a role in reducing environmental impact for example
through energy savings reduction of vehicle idling waste reduction reuse and
prevention of constantly running water i hope all employees of the smm group will get
actively involved in these efforts and i look forward to working with them on this

   risk management for mining waste                                    due to the same reasons as for the rise in sox emissions
   the smm group carries out appropriate management of                 looking only at business sites in japan nox emissions
   mining waste generated by the mineral resources business           decreased by around 21 one factor was the suspension of
   such as topsoil spoil tailings sludge and slag                 the toyo smelter  refinery due to full furnace renovation
        oxidization of rocks spoil containing sulfide minerals can   work another factor was the 30 decrease in nox emissions
   cause acidic water that contains sulfate ions or water              resulting from a reduced coal use ratio at hyuga smelting
   containing heavy metal ions and therefore wastewater from          see fig 2 on the following page

         stakeholder comment
    smm employees account for about a third of the membership of our sobiraki district neighborhood association
    the federation of neighborhood associations comprises 14 neighborhood associations combining the activities
    of each individual neighborhood association and collaborative activities between our associations means that we
    conduct routine activities like community cleanups every week there are also major events such as the yusuzumi
    festival held in the cool of a summer evening and the cultural festival in autumn which attract close to 1300
    participants from elderly people to children smm employees and their families actively participate in these
    community events fitting in as members of the local community many smm companyowned houses are located
    within the sobiraki district federation of neighborhood associations talking with the employees who are
    relocated here and listening to stories of their experiences around the country and back home is fun for us and
    indeed an asset nowadays
        once a year smm employees attend the board meeting of the federation of neighborhood associations its
    an opportunity to hear about how the companys business is faring participating in the meeting i was surprised          tamotsu hisaishi
    to hear that materials that are essential for our lives are being made in factories located in our neighborhood and       chair of the federation of
    that they have stateoftheart technology i was also relieved to hear about their safe operations                      neighborhood associations
        im interested in the preservation and utilization of industrial heritage for the purpose of conveying the history    sobiraki district niihama city
    of manufacturing and community development to the next generation i hope that we can find ways to                        ehime prefecture
    collaborate with local companies and the government in this endeavor


   subcommittee chairmans comment
in reconsidering the corporate citizenship subcommittees csr vision for 2020 we took account of the                 kazushi ino
valuable opinion of external experts that the smm business has been handed down for just over 420                  chairman of the corporate
                                                                                                                      citizenship subcommittee
years and given that it has continually developed alongside society this should be brought to the
                                                                                                                      general manager of legal
forefront despite discussion among members of the subcommittee we could not come up with any                        general affairs dept
suitable wording to express this we also thought that it would sound a little too pretentious if we put
this opinion into words ultimately we decided on a company in which employees are proud to work
along with the company on social contribution activities rooted in the area rather than the former a
company respected for its social contribution which could be interpreted negatively it expresses the
hope of being a company where employees feel joy and pride in smms activities to coexist sustainably
with society
     although social contribution activities are wide and varied rather than viewing them simply as a
kind of charity where a portion of our profits is donated to such and such a place our aim is to pursue
the true nature of smm by really racking our brains and putting in a big effort into this area moreover
we hope that employees will also develop themselves through volunteering and other social contribution
activities and will share with the company the joy and pride felt from having a relationship with society
and nature
     the sumitomo business spirit has always shown a very clear approach to the coexistence of business
and society it embraces the idea jiririta koshiichinyo meaning that sumitomos business must
contribute to the development of society at large not just development of the company itself i really
hope that all the group companies and employees will realize the significance of these words and will
put them into practice both at work and in their private lives

                                                              contribution to society and local communities




the eiti principles
1 we share a belief that the prudent use of natural
   resource wealth should be an important engine for
   sustainable economic growth that contributes to
   sustainable development and poverty reduction but if
   not managed properly can create negative economic
   and social impacts
2 we affirm that management of natural resource
   wealth for the benefit of a countrys citizens is in the
   domain of sovereign governments to be exercised in
   the interests of their national development
3 we recognise that the benefits of resource extraction
   occur as revenue streams over many years and can be
   highly price dependent
4 we recognise that a public understanding of
   government revenues and expenditure over time
   could help public debate and inform choice of
   appropriate and realistic options for sustainable
   development
5 we underline the importance of transparency by
   governments and companies in the extractive
   industries and the need to enhance public financial
   management and accountability
6 we recognise that achievement of greater
   transparency must be set in the context of respect for
   contracts and laws
7 we recognise the enhanced environment for domestic
   and foreign direct investment that financial
   transparency may bring
8 we believe in the principle and practice of
   accountability by government to all citizens for the
   stewardship of revenue streams and public
   expenditure
9 we are committed to encouraging high standards of
   transparency and accountability in public life
   government operations and in business
10 we believe that a broadly consistent and workable
    approach to the disclosure of payments and revenues
    is required which is simple to undertake and to use
11 we believe that payments disclosure in a given
    country should involve all extractive industry
    companies operating in that country
12 in seeking solutions we believe that all stakeholders
    have important and relevant contributions to make
    including governments and their agencies extractive
    industry companies service companies multilateral
    organisations financial organisations investors and
    nongovernmental organisations

        stakeholder comment
   everyone seems to be rushing to grab a seat aboard the global train globalization entails overseas
   operations and the hiring of foreign personnel which narrows down opportunities for employment and
   makes it harder than it is already for women to advance in society its only recently that society has
   started crying out for equal employment opportunities for men and women if globalization continues it
   will merely highlight the factors that make it difficult for women to work in japan today and corporations
   will hold back from hiring female students out of the fear that they will resign at some point this will
   make it even harder for female students to find a job after graduation 60 of our students go on to
   work for japanese manufacturers their ambition is to succeed internationally and to create an affluent
   japan smm currently employs six graduates from our university including three women as a
   corporation assuming a heavy responsibility in resourcepoor japan smm is very popular among
   students in recruitment i was worried that female students might be shunned but you carefully convey       toshiaki mikuriya
   your recruitment policy to students and have again picked an ambitious female student to join your            director
   workforce in 2013 i hope you will stick to your current stance and continue hiring many students willing     career development center

     internally we intend to make further progress on fostering employees with strong
human rights awareness starting with informing and educating employees about the
smm group policy on human rights established by smm in 2010 as well as increasing
opportunities for active utilization of diverse human resources
     with regard to regions where we operate and the international community we need
to ascertain how smms business activities affect the human rights of stakeholders such
as local residents and customers and develop a rigid framework for ensuring that negative
impacts are avoided to do that we will advance new activities in human resources
development involving further enhancement of training for senior management at
facilities in japan and overseas and human rights audits of overseas facilities
     through these efforts smm aims to fulfill the revised csr policy to continue sound
business activities smm shall respect human rights and shall try to be a company in
which diverse human resources take active parts i sincerely hope everyone in the smm
group will get fully involved in this important area

                                                accommodating diversity is
               that efforts are made to promote a worklife balance so that

                   to address this situation a team of eight female
               employees from various backgrounds was formed in

underground mining techniques involving the digging of drifts
in the ground which means the impact on the surface is
relatively low even so there are occasions when we inevitably
have to ask local citizens to relocate to make way for
development of the mine or the construction of associated
facilities on such occasions we seek the approval and
understanding of local citizens and offer alternative land at

         stakeholder comment
    providing even greater safety and security
    i have been providing smm with education for managers and supervisors as well as services to business sites
    such as observation of operations guidance and lectures since 2009 safety performance and issues differ
    from site to site but i am convinced of the determination of everyone from general managers all the way
    through to the frontline operators to make progress on realizing the csr vision for 2020 smm is advancing
    some superb activities which include improving employees sensitivity to dangers through companywide
    implementation of hazard simulation training at the ojikan facility and using the jco study center to
    communicate lessons learned from past accidents to make sure they stay in the memory
        from what i have seen of frontline operations so far i would suggest the following activities need to be
    advanced from the point of view of those departments in order to improve safety performance further
      when an accident or a serious close call occurs pursue the real reasons that led to human error and put in          noboru furusawa
       place real countermeasures and to that end build upon the use of risk assessments as an accident                   expert on safety and human
       prevention measure                                                                                                  resources development

      identify all nonroutine tasks and all tasks and rules that workers find hard to perform or observe and aim
       to achieve a proven record of zero accidents by cutting down the number of negative elements
      achieve companywide uniformity of safety specifications for equipment for example in regard to simpler
       smaller and more maintainable machinery and equipment
       implementing these activities will definitely make frontline operations more resilient and will also lead to
    enhanced problemsolving capability allowing smm to grow and evolve into a company that can provide even
    greater safety and security i say this both out of expectation and with knowledge of smms potential

the occupational health  safety subcommittee has modified its roadmap for realizing our csr vision
                                                                                                             takashi sugiura
for 2020 of no occupational accidents throughout the smm group in the next phase of the three            chairman occupational
year business plan we have set a target of 10 or fewer employee accidents and as part of our efforts       health  safety subcommittee
to achieve that target we will be opening the smm anzen dojyou within the ojikan facility early in         executive officer

     the smm anzen dojyou will be used to develop human resources who play a central role in                 environment control dept
ensuring workplace safety those who train there will then return to their workplaces where they will
foster a safety culture by providing education and guidance on the 3ss hazard prediction risk
assessments work observations and other activities hazard simulation training is already underway
with around 3000 smm group employees and 1700 employees of manufacturing partners having
participated as of the end of june 2012 i believe the addition of the smm anzen dojyou will allow an
improved standard of safety within the smm group with a shift from employeedependent safety to
safety preserved by the workplace organization
     in the area of health we are looking to reduce the number of control class 3 workplaces with
divisions setting reduction targets
     the assurance of safety as well as physical and mental health brings happiness to employees and
their families they should all therefore get involved in realizing no occupational accidents zero
incidence of occupational disease and workplaces where protective equipment is unnecessary

         stakeholder comment
   i believe sumitomo metal mining is genuinely trying to raise stakeholders understanding of its activities
   by disclosing information the company has also been recognized for its investor relations activities
   winning a best ir award in 2011
       one of the reasons smm won this award is that the top management publicly states the targets to be
   attained under threeyear business plans and regularly reports on progress the companys stance of
   responding swiftly to accidents and disasters and disclosing information on an ongoing basis also gives
   stakeholders peace of mind i personally learned about the history of the besshi copper mine and
   overseas projects through the companys business strategy progress briefing session and the annual
   report i realized that the stance of overcoming difficulties through dialogue with the parties concerned
   is fundamental to csr activity
       i think the challenge now will be adapting to globalization risks which previously went unnoticed by
   the japanese sensibility will emerge diverse values including those of foreigners and women for               yoshiko sato
   example have to be understood consideration for our planets precious environment is essential but            secretary general  chief research
   smm has built up a csr mentality which will enable further advancement i look forward to more                   fellow and program director
   activities which earn smm the trust of stakeholders                                                             japan investor relations association jira

importance of csr communication with ngos and business partners the ability to                     general manager
engage in smooth communication with both ngos and our business partners will be                     pr and ir dept
particularly essential as globalization of our business continues and we will therefore
persist with awareness activities and advance sharing of leading examples among
overseas facilities
     our new roadmap for realizing the csr vision for 2020 addresses communication
with stakeholders by laying down specific initiatives for communicating with each
stakeholder category identifying four common themestransparency accountability
attentiveness and dialogue activities targeting employees will aim for twoway
communication across the entire smm group including overseas facilities frameworks

with local communities and efforts will be made to build collaborative ties with business
partners and citizen groups to keep initiatives aligned with these goals we will apply the

suppliers to complete surveys about chemical substance
management acquisition of environmental certification
progress on energy and resource savings and waste

in which it is involved



  initiatives relating to conflict minerals
the democratic republic of the congo and surrounding
countries produce large amounts of minerals such as gold tin
and tantalum rebel forces and other armed groups use these
resources as a major source of funds thereby expanding and
prolonging conflicts
     besides requesting nations to ban arms exports to
countries involved in conflicts the international community is
trying to stem conflict with ever stricter demands such as
asking the mineral resources industry to boycott minerals sold
by armed groups
     laws and other regulations are also being put in place in
the united states the doddfrank wall street reform and
consumer protection act became law in july 2010 the act
defined specific minerals produced in applicable countries or
regions as conflict minerals and obligated corporations listed
on american stock exchanges to report to the securities and
exchange commission sec on the use of conflict minerals
     in the electronics industry which uses large amounts of
elements like tantalum and gold for mobile phones and pcs
major corporations have led formulation of the electronic
industry code of conduct eicc the code asks companies
when procuring raw materials to go beyond legal compliance
and promote compliance with global standards on social
responsibility relating to such areas as labor conditions and
employment practices health and safety ethical employment
practices and environmental protection
     given the above circumstances the smm group agrees
with and declares support for the principles of the extractive

               div                               at first i didnt know how
                                               best to deal with the
               government firefighting authorities so i collected
               information from the people responsible for performing the
               same duties in the sumitomo group and made it a policy to
               visit the relevant government office at least twice a week
               even if i had no applications or reports to make
               furthermore when making notifications etc i was able to
               provide detailed descriptions of the relevant materials
               products and equipment by drawing on my past practical
               experience in the field so now its easy for us to consult          project briefing given at a meeting in which we participated at the
               with each other and i feel that the relationships of trust          invitation of the nature conservancy
               have deepened
                    i believe that routine communication is important for
               building and maintaining relationships of trust with the
               firefighting authorities and other government agencies the
               same could be said for any working adults this routine
               communication includes 1 submitting reports and arriving
               for meetings before the agreed time on the appointed day
               2 treating others with courtesy and respect 3 seeking
               advice immediately on any points in question and not
               missing any regular visits 4 checking any documents in
               detail with site supervisors before making notifications or
               applications and 5 conducting preliminary examinations
               before an inspection and checking that specifications are as
               per the application or notification i believe that the most
               important thing in maintaining a good relationship with an
                                                                                    following a community meeting at koghe
               administrative agency though is to behave faithfully
               conscious of being a representative of your workplace with
               pride in your work and a sense of responsibility

     risk management



               issues and targets
             smm will make intense efforts to eliminate contributors to risk
             actualization and ensure readiness particularly with regard to
             largescale earthquakes pandemics of virulent new influenza
             viruses and smm groupwide serious risks3 and will focus
             on lowering incidence and minimizing damage in the case of a
             risk being actualized
                  at overseas facilities we will make efforts to establish
             more effective operation of risk management systems
             specifically more model plants will be created for business
             divisions other than the materials division and best practices
             at those plants will be pursued elsewhere
             3 risks which if realized are expected to have a major influence on or
                cause significant damage to the smm group as a whole and cause
                irreparable damage as influence or physical damage to smm if swift
                and appropriate action is not taken the group must unite in
                determining action to take in the case of these risks being realized

                each facility within the smm group reviewed its earthquake
                preparedness the process highlighted concerns that problems
                would occur during the initial response to a crisis since systems
                were not consistent different regulations were in place for
                responding to each type of crisis including earthquakes
                pandemics of virulent new influenza viruses smm groupwide
                serious risks and kidnappings or terrorist activities overseas
                and the response headquarters included different leaders and
                personnel under the new crisis management regulations we
                have installed an executive officer with jurisdiction over the
                safety  environment control department as the head of the
                response headquarters and introduced a single contact point
                for when crises occur a swift initial response to crises is also
                ensured by having head office divisions recognize response
                headquarters functions as part of their own duties in addition

     thirdparty opinion

as with csr report 2011 this years report has been evaluated by makoto teranaka
a visiting professor at tokyo keizai university and expert on human rights issues
who helped formulate the smm group policy on human rights                                                                          makoto teranaka

the united nations guiding principles on business and human                           however i do think that stating the respective terms of
rights has had an impact on many corporations operating                               reference of the board of directors the president and the
outside their home country iso 26000 and oecd guidelines                             subcommittees which are core elements of the csr
have also evolved to assist implementation of the uns                                promotion framework would clarify the division of
framework in particular the requirement that enterprises set                        responsibilities within smm to outside parties leading to even
up due diligence procedures for assessing circumstances for                           greater trust
protection of human rights prior to an activity has forced                                 here i would also like to suggest that the smm group
corporations to review systems for managing value chains the                         policy on human rights which is stated on pages concerning
absence of such management systems is also likely to                                  human resources be included in the smm group csr section
complicate disclosure about use of conflict minerals required                         given its substance and impact please consider this for future
by recent bylaws of the united states securities and exchange                         layouts
commission sec these are the same types of systems                                      again in regard to the executive message i have great
already prescribed and put in place by many corporations in                         praise for the way the taganito attack was touched upon even
response to environmental issues and application is now                              though it must be a difficult topic to bring up however i
being extended to human rights for corporations with                                 think a more detailed explanation of the incident including
overseas operations in particular this goes beyond internal                         specific details and smms response should have been
management many considerations need to be taken into                                 included in the report given its significance from a risk
account such as suppliers circumstances and the lifestyles of                       management standpoint smm has taken a progressive
residents in the local community corporations will need to act                       approach to this kind of problem for example through the
outside the former boundaries of common practice and so far                           international council on mining and metals icmm and
few have been able to establish solid due diligence                                   describing how you applied that experience to bring about a
procedures i would like to think smm can respond quickly to                          solution through what kinds of policies and actions would
these developments using the experience and information                               provide an example for other corporations i hope you will
gained for example through the extractive industries                                think about this
transparency initiative eiti thereby enhancing your                                     in closing i note that smm like last year has not attained
competitiveness and allowing you to set the global standard                          its target for employment of female management track
    i read this years report with particular interest in how                         employees the fact this situation persists suggests to me too
smm was actually going to put such csr management                                     much attention is given to numerical targets and you dont
frameworks in place the content is becoming richer with                              have effective measures for achieving them if that is the case
every issue and a joy to read through the presidents                                a more appropriate strategy might be to realign your target
definitive statement about the companys stance on csr is                             toward realizing systems and work environments favorable to
important key officers mention their perceptions on csr on                           women ultimately leading to an increase in the number of
their respective pages but there is great significance in having                     female employees
the top representative systematically lay out managements                                 business activities impact the lives of ordinary people and
approach to csr as pervading through the whole company                               the more global the corporation the greater is the significance
    the report also explains that smm has a csr promotion                             of this statement i truly hope that smm becomes a
framework headed by the president it is clear smm leaves no                          progressive global corporation which thinks about the human
doubt that csr is to be tackled as a companywide issue                              rights of ordinary people
