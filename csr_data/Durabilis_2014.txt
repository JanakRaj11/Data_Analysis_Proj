as mentioned in the 20102011 global activity report we decided to temporarily focus on narrative reporting           issues considered relevant by our stakeholders
and take a step back in quantitative reporting because of three reasons

 the rapidly growing number of businesses combined with limited resources                                              structures and systems to ensure oversight
 different stages of data management among the businesses                                                              and control
