waste  recycling
we adopted our zero waste policy in 2007 our first priority is to make sure we only use
what we need whats left is either reused or reclaimed and finally recycled or composted
constant employee education helps us achieve our zero waste goals we have staff train
ings instructional signage and continuously looking for creative ways to divert waste from
the landfill


in 2014
           we switched to 25 recycled content toilet paper

           we now have four master recyclers on staff

           cigarette butts are recycled through the terracycle program where they are
           shipped back to rj reynolds tobacco company to be transformed into plastic
           blocks for reuse

           the small things add up in 2014 the green team added remember these come
           from trees stickers on all paper towel dispensers to encourage awareness about
           using less
