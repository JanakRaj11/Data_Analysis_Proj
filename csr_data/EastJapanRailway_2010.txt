business environment has remained
uncertain due to the impact of the deep
global recession that struck the year

the reduction of expressway charges
and the opening of a new access route
between ueno nippori and narita
airport have brought increased levels of
competition among transport providers

extreme safety levels
since its establishment jr east has constantly regarded safety as its top management priority and under the
terms we published in 2020 vision we are continuing to work with an unwavering commitment to achieve
what we regard as extreme safety levels as a part of our fifth fiveyear safety plan 2013 safety vision we
will invest approximately 750 billion yen on safety during the five years that start in fiscal year 2010 through
increased construction and enhancement of safety facilities we intend to become a group which our customers
regard with a feeling of ease and peace of mind based on assured safety
if we are to successfully enhance safety levels i strongly believe that we need to instill in each and every
employee the ability to identify problems and work toward their solution on an individual basis in other
words our employees must think and act for themselves furthermore the sangen principle three actualities
actual locations actual objects and actual people will remain critically important this means that in order
to fully understand the reality of our operating situation all our employees must be prepared to experience
front line conditions which will allow them to meet the people and understand the objects involved as a
truly professional organization the jr east group holds the sangen principle as our standard of action
which through a policy of individual thought and action will allow us to reach extreme safety levels thereby
guaranteeing our customers peace of mind

railway technology from japan to the world
with the increase in the speed of global warming railways are attracting worldwide recognition as a form of
transport capable of delivering very low levels of co2 emissions per unit of transport
during our more than a centurylong history of railway operations including the japanese national railways
 jnr period we have nurtured and benefited from many topnotch engineers and accumulated a vast
hoard of railway construction and operational capabilities as well as a superlative level of railway business
management knowhow our ability to comprehensively coordinate all of these assets in a manner capable of
providing safe and stable transport is the most powerful weapon in our corporate arsenal
in the past admittedly jr east has concentrated mainly on its transport lifestyle and suica businesses in
japan but i strongly believe that today our technologies and knowhow can be utilized globally and contribute
significantly to the solving of environmental problems
there can be little doubt that for jr east a group that has little experience of doing business overseas the
future will hold many challenges we realize that we must overcome various hurdles but nevertheless we are
committed to the task of globally propagating the use of our japangenerated railway technology and know
how and thereby contributing to the development of railways throughout the world

missions and challenges of global environmental issues
in its 2020 vision the jr east group committed itself to a positive and continuing approach to global
environmental problems by setting a unilateral target of reducing by fiscal 2031 its total co 2 emissions from
railway operations by 50 compared with fiscal 1991 we strongly believe that as a group whose main
business is railways a form of transport that is highly public but which has a relatively low environmental
impact it is a natural part of our mission to work for the abatement of global environmental problems as such
and as a truly international corporate citizen we feel beholden to set such a high standard
although as i have mentioned before railways are a form of transportation with a relatively low level of
environmental impact in terms of co2 emissions our actual emissions are still significant after all we run an
approximately 7500 km rail network throughout eastern japan which actually makes us the world         s largest
railway company in terms of the number of passengers so we need to remain constantly aware that we are still
emitting considerable amounts of co2 
since the promulgation of jr east 2020 vision despite the fact that we have worked continuously toward the
solving of environmental issues it is now even more important to make progress in many areas including the
domestic countermeasures to global warming and the solving of biodiversity problems with these hurdles in
mind in july this year we established the environmental management office within the management planning
department with the aim of further promoting the enhancement of our environmental management in other
words we are not merely resting on our laurels as a relatively low co 2 emitting form of transportation but are
setting our own high environmental targets and taking a positive and long term approach to global problems

tohoku shinkansen completion and regional revitalization
this year on december 4 the tohoku shinkansen line will be completed with the start of operations on
the hachinoheshinaomori segment this event will mark a milestone not only for aomori prefecture but
also for the entire tohoku region the tohoku shinkansen has been developed in stages starting with the
section between omiya and morioka in 1982 followed by the uenoomiya and tokyoueno segments
and was further extended to hachinohe in 2002 with the completion of the final section to shinaomori
travel times between tokyo and aomori will be significantly reduced and convenience greatly enhanced
we believe that the completed line will not only make aomori much more easily accessible from the
tokyo metropolitan area but also will lead to a significant increase in interregional exchanges
through its rediscover local areas project the jr east group is committing considerable resources to
the unearthing and publicizing of previously ignored or little known tourist resources and local products
with the aim of promoting a significant increase in tourist activities in the newlyconnected areas thereby
supporting a regional revitalization

in conclusion as i said before railways are public transportation that support the movement and lives of
many people it is jr east s mission to strive for further improvements in safety and convenience and to
continue to serve its passengers carefully in the future

                         thoughts on the opening of the shinaomori service

                         what is required
                         for regional revitalization
  today when regional sovereignty is often mentioned and when we are deemed to be in the age of the local region
  the revitalization of local communities has become an important element in improving the affluence of society with
  the impending opening of the shinaomori shinkansen extension on december 4th this year on may 19th in the
  aomori prefectural building we held an opinion exchange session regarding the roles to be taken by both jr east and
  local communities those attending the meeting included governor shingo mimura of aomori prefecture and ms
  yasuko shima of an aomori area development group who both regard the service extension as a great opportunity
  and professor shigeru hori of the university of tokyo whose specialties include landscape design and engineering
  and community planning

an age of selfsustainable local communities
     ichinose          since its establish ment j r ea st ha s had t he mission of
                       advancing its business activities while contributing to local
                       societies based on its railway network when we look at
                       eastern japan today however we can see that there are
                       unfortunately certain areas that appear to be losing their
                       vitality
                       in our 2020 vision we committed ourselves to the active
                       advancement of local revitalization so during our discussions
                       today we would like all of you to voice your opinions based as
                                                                                                      mr toshiro ichinose

       ogawa           today we will discuss the themethoughts on the opening of
                       the shinaomori service what is required for regional revitalizationfirst however i
                       would like to hear your thoughts on the issue of the necessity of regional revitalization

      mimura           i believe the commencement of the shinkansen service to shinaomori is a onceina
                       century chance for aomori prefecture all four routes air road sea and rail will be
                       established thereby turning aomori into mainland japan  s greatest transportation node
                       travel times between aomori and the tokyo metropolitan area will be dramatically
                       reduced bringing i hope a significant increase in the exchange of people goods and
                       information between the two areas
                       initially economic revitalization through tourism and the attraction of new companies
                       will be our primary aim but we also hope to increase the potential for cultural and
                       civilizationbased exchanges what will be vital is how each citizen of the prefecture
                       personally uses this opportunity and how each citizen makes the most of this new age



                                                                ー7

jr east group sustainability report 2010                                         stakeholder dialogs



                  aomori prefecture is striving to further increase the benefits
                  that will be brought by the opening of the service through
                  the efforts of 67 organizations and seven councils led by the
                  council for strategic utilization of the completed shinkansen
                  line furthermore next year a destination campaign 1 will
                  be implemented in aomori prefecture so at the moment we
                  are busily identifying attractions some of which have not
                  previously had very high visibility i feel that the opening of the
                  shinkansen service has already had an impact in many fields
                  having for example brought about a forwardlooking air that
                  is recognizable throughout the entire prefecture                              mr shingo mimura
                                                                                                 governor of aomori prefecture

         hori     the reason why regional revitalization is being talked about
                  so much these days is because we are now in an age when local regions have to become
                  selfsustaining some local areas however are not yet prepared to be so and the
                  majority of the people simply expect the government to take care of things or only expect
                                                           to participate in something if it sounds interesting to them
                                                           on a personal basis it is my hope that the people of aomori
                                                           take the opening of the shinaomori shinkansen service as an
                                                           opportunity to think for themselves
                                                           the question remains however about what should be done
                                                           to enable regions to be selfsustaining in my opinion the first
                                                           need is for local areas to have their own unique products
                                                           products however do not sell themselves so it is necessary
                                                           to make them appealing to potential customers and publicize
                                                           them widely these three points of ① having products ②
                    mr shigeru hori                       adding appeal to them and ③ publicizing them widely are all

        shima     governor mimura mentioned that the opening of the shinkansen service is aonceina
                  century chanceso isn t it vital for us to increase the number
                  of people who have a desire to do things and a knowledge of
                  when to do them  now what we need is action
                  furthermore although the start of shinkansen service will
                  bring the region closer to other regions we must not allow
                  this fact to dilute our appeal rather we should make it an
                  opportunity to strengthen that appeal the main questions are
                  however how far can we pursue aomori       s uniqueness and its
                  differences from neighboring regions and urban areas and how
                  can we make that enhanced aomori uniqueness into a form
                                                                                    ms yasuko shima

      mimura      last year the centennial of the author osamu dazai a former resident of kanegimura
                  kitatsugarugun now goshogawara city was celebrated to honor the writer we
                  organized various tourist activities and instigated what local citizens came up witha
                  field museumby which instead of simply constructing something we turned the entire
                  city into a dazai museum by taking people to for example the place where dazai often
                  ate his boxed lunch and another where he liked to drink sake this approach proved
                  extremely popular with tourists and is a clear example of a success in turning an area
                  into a product with added appeal which again has made people aware of the fact that
                  they can achieve things if they use their ingenuity at this time it is important that we
                  create our own content and add some value to it to make something fresh and interesting
                  i feel sure that aomori people are willing so the question is how to actually turn ideas
                  into results

        shima     i am currently working on the preparation of 1000 overnightstaytype tourist attractions
                  within aomori prefecture but i am constantly aware that forced unnatural programs
                  almost always fail although i myself started my activities simply because i found them
                  interesting i am now in a stage of evaluating whether or not my work can become firmly
                  rooted in the tourism industry with the coming opening of the shinaomori shinkansen
                  service an awareness has been building up that we must nolonger compete on a small
                  and individual basis but must cooperate as a single aomori prefecture in fact by having

                  everyone contribute something good from their individual communities and pooling our
                  resources we can ultimately make something with an even greater appeal

         hori     in the past when commercializing local products there have been many cases where
                  most of the work has been shouldered by volunteers when this happens it is obvious
                  that production cannot last for a long time instead of relying purely on volunteers
                  therefore when we produce something it is extremely important to approach the project
                  from a viewpoint of cost consciousness we need to logically determine whether each
                  product can become firmly rooted in society and turn into a source of bread and butter
                  for local residents this is the role of local governments and residents and at the same
                  time something that should be considered by third parties such as jr east

perspective of hospitality development
      ogawa       you mean that the motivation to refine things that already exist is increasing i think
                  this is also connected with the hospitality development that professor hori has been
                  advocating

         hori     what actually is attraction people within communities are often the least aware of this
                  and often carry out regional and product development with feelings such aswe want
                  people to comeandwe want people to buybut i think it is vital that we instill in the
                  public in general a sense ofi want to goinstead in this area i think jr east      s know
                  how can be put to valuable use jr east     s campaigns are planned to make peoplewant
                  to gorather than inviting people to comewe want people to come to aomoriandwe
                  want to go to aomorii think it is very important to understand the difference between
                  these apparently similar but actually divergent approaches
                  the hospitality development i advocate is a key phrase if we are to create a hospitable
                  society in the latter part of the 1960s visits to farmhouse inns became popular but the
                  fashion didn   t last why it was simply because local communities didn        t understand
                  what people wanted from such trips guests were willing to pay for what they wanted
                  but local people often offered them something different because the two sides saw things
                  differently it was inevitable that the boom petered out in other words it is important
                  to remember that those who pay for services are in a stronger position than those who
                  provide them local communities need to bear this in mind
                  it is often the case that things that are common and seem mundane to locals may be
                  considered exotic and attractive to others who would be willing to pay to experience
                  them as a result i think it is vital that we identify just what things that we readily accept
                  as normal are actually different

      mimura      the ordinary local dishes we eat daily for example might be considered exotic by people
                  visiting aomori for the first time in the past we havent always understood this and have
                  definedhospitalityas a demand for extravagant cuisine we should probably change
                  our mindset regarding this and simply provide visitors with the things that we experience
                  in our daily lives this is the true meaning ofhospitality

     akasaka      as a station we are also promoting the attractions of the region
                  and regional goods in cooperation with community residents
                  ms shima mentioned the creation of a single goal and jr east
                  as a transport operator will need to consider how to connect
                  railway networks i believe the role of local government is
                  significant so i would like to proceed in cooperation with local
                  public bodies

     ichinose     in reality many local secondar y transport systems have
                  not been able to become part of the network there will

                  this enthusiasm into a business model we are transport
                  professionals but i believe it is extremely important not just for us but also for
                  professionals in all fields to cooperate

         hori     attractiveness becomes important when we form businesses and it is therefore vital to
                  consider how to sustain that attractiveness we must be aware that the attention span of
                  the public is short for example if we simply make the same product over and over again

                                                  t think so we have to understand that if things never
                  will it remain attractive i don
                  change their appeal decreases day by day in other words unless jr east and other third
                  parties provide input and advice i dont think it will be easy for local regions to make
                  sustainable products

time for cooperation between local regions and jr east
         hori     jr east has a travel product called tabiichi 2 that
                  treats local communities as products in a detailed and
                  careful way i think this is a very good approach i
                  strongly believe that jr east should continue this kind
                  of effort and thus support the commercialization of
                  local areas with for example the introduction of an
                  aomori tabiichi
                                                                             the tabiichi travel package brand
     ichinose     this kind of detailed and finetuned commercialization     is based on proposals from local
                                                                             communities
                  may not be very common

         hori     i believe tabiichi is a unique concept that attempts to commercialize local daily life
                  rather than merely relying on traditional tourist resources such as objects of interest all
                  regions have the potential to turn themselves into products this way and i evaluate this
                  approach highly

     akasaka      jr east organizeshiking from stationpackages for example there is a doll    s festival
                  called kukuribina in a town called mizusawa and visitors from all over the country flock
                  there to see the kukuribina which for many years the local people had packed away out
                  of sight we organized a hiking course starting from the station that allows visitors and
                  local residents to communicate with each other this is just one example of many where
                  jr east in cooperation with local communities is shining fresh lights on artifacts that
                  may have been hidden from the public for generations but which are of intrinsic interest

        shima     i take pride in having been able to maintain the momentum from our initial period even
                  though our area development guerrilla activities have now continued for a decade
                  this is i believe because we have been doing new things one after the other the next
                  challenge and the energy needed to face it must of course come from the people who are
                  taking on the challenges but i think they need jr east and local public bodies to support
                  them
                  in terms of information provision the shinkansen service will bring us to a turning point
                  where aomori prefecture will open up to the outside i believe we have at last reached a
                  stage where we can connect with the outside world and create something new

      mimura      i agree our spirits are being raised and our economy is picking up in various senses and
                  i recognize this as an opportunity by researching the many successful cases we have
                  collected we are exploring the possibilities of turning this opportunity into something
                  concrete

expected roles as a transport and tourism professional
         hori     what i sometimes wonder is whether or not there are forms and devices within the city
                  that could be made sufficiently attractive to visitors even if the local people involved are
                  only capable of exerting 70 of their energy there are many regions that rely on events
                  and other projects that depend on the efforts and hard work of local residents for their
                  success but i think this is dangerous it is impossible for local residents to constantly
                  give 100 one way we can allow local people to relax a little is to build up a stock
                  of attractions throughout a community which make visitors can feel good the moment
                  they see them if we can create an overall attractiveness people won     t have to work at
                  full force all the time these attractions dont necessarily have to be constructions they
                  could for example be flowers in other words combining tangible and intangible appeal
                  is a good way for regions to become selfsustainable and allow us to create a framework
                  that will attract tourists without residents having to dedicate all their strength to its
                  maintenance

      mimura     on the opening day of hachinohe station what struck me most was the first impressions
                 of travelers as they arrived at the station they said they were most impressed by the
                 hospitality at the entrance where local people welcomed them with smiles what

                          do you think is needed to give visitors the first impressions that they are being treated
                          hospitably

              hori        i think that what the governor just said is perfectly correct we all know that when our
                          first impression is one of welcome and hospitality we feel that the place we are visiting is
                          a good place and we want to return there again and again obviously places you have
                          never visited seem attractive but it is often the case that once you have been there the
                          attraction weakens sometimes furthermore once we get used to the spirit of hospitality
                          that so struck us when we first arrived a place may seem to become less hospitable that
                          is why for example forms and features in front of stations are very important

           shima          indeed the uniqueness of aomori that feeling ofah it   s aomorii think is quite
                          significant whether or not we can produce that feeling the moment visitors get off the
                          train at a station could be critical

        mimura            so as a professional body in the transport industry i would like jr east to share its
                          knowledge with us and demonstrate how we can take on the role of researching local
                          attractions and turning them into tourist draws

              hori        i also would like jr east to work on the commercialization of
                          unearthed regional attractions and provide their knowhow

1 regional revitalization
against a backdrop of a decreasing population a low birth rate and an aging society combined with an
overconcentration of people and functions in cities japan         s social environment is facing very difficult
conditions not only in terms of the economy but also in terms of the cultures traditions and techniques of
individual regions
with this in mind we are aware that if the jr east group is to continue to expand its railway networkbased
business it will be necessary for us to create fluidity between local communities through the enhancement of
each community    s individual and specific appeals
the jr east group has actively implemented the unearthing of previously little known tourist resources the
development of secondary transport systems and the provision of regional information in cooperation with
local communities we have done this through such initiatives as the destination campaigns the setting up of
priority sales areas the sale of local specialties in stations and various other events furthermore in jr east
2020 vision we committed ourselves to a companywide effort to further enhance the revitalization of local
communities

transportation and lifestyle services businesses with the aim of accelerating cooperation with regional
communities and thereby achieving steady results
the basic concept of the rediscover local areas project is to support a form of continuous cooperation
between the jr east group and local communities regarding regional revitalization matters the project
stipulates a clear division of roles based on thecreate togetherstrategy under which the group strengthens
its cooperation with regional communities and strives to develop new ideas and solutions
in line with this concept we have already started the provision of support for autonomous tourism development
efforts in local communities this support includes the creation of a new market of destinationbased tourism
using the travel package tabiichi tabiichi includes the following concepts climate and culture rooted in the
region local production and local consumption and getting in touch with people and features the involvement
and ideas of local residents events such as the iwatehanamaki rediscovery symposium have been held with
the aim of providing residents with opportunities to look again at the tourist resources of their regions
the jr east group has railway networks that connect different regions stations that serve as local centers
business knowhow regarding ekinaka inside station buildings and hotels sales channels and advertising
media radiating out from the tokyo metropolitan area and human resources that make contributions as
members of local communities the rediscover local areas project utilizes these strengths and exploits the
traditional cultures festivals techniques local produce and other tangible and intangible tourist resources
expands sales channels and promotes the exchange of interactive information between the tokyo metropolitan
area and regional communities
a main objective of the rediscover local areas project is to bring about an increased flow of people and goods
and create new markets through a tightening of ties between the tokyo metropolitan area and local regions
this in turn will no doubt lead to the reinvigoration of regional communities within the jr east service area
and a concomitant strengthening of our management foundation leading to improved prospects for the group

3 specific initiatives
the rediscover local areas project started by deepening our specific undertakings from the following
perspectives social responsibility and contribution cooperation with local communities and the synergy of
our railway network and lifestyle services business
one specific case is our folkloro and familio longstay hotels we have promoted regional revitalization
measures centered on the renewal of such facilities in the iwate area for example folkloro iwate towa has
undergone renewal and has been relaunched as an auberge with its own vegetable gardens furthermore
through a newly opened restaurant specializing in locally produced ingredients visitors can try new local
dishes using seasonal ingredients as well as taking part in a variety of activities organized in cooperation with
local producers such as actually harvesting produce the facility has proved popular not only with tourists but
also with local residents
in the tateyama area familio tateyama has been renewed with sports as its core concept including newly
constructed sand and artificial grass courts furthermore with the goal of meeting the expanding needs of
visitors familio tateyama has developed a wide variety of sporting activities including yoga sea kayaking
and nordic walking and invited sports competitions to take advantage of the natural beauty of minami boso
as a part of our regional revitalization program in the echigoyuzawa area the station has been positioned
to serve as a gateway for regional tourism echigoyuzawa station renaissance 2 nd phase has already been
implemented and gangidori a commercial sales area for local foods and goods has been opened inside the
station furthermore a destinationbased visitor center outlet that integrates multiple functions including
tourist information covering a wide area operated in cooperation with local tourist associations and a car
rental service has been opened and has contributed to a significant increase in the number of foreign visitors
both developments have been well received by customers
in addition to strategically developing the tabiichi brand in these areas we create and broadcast contents for
jr east s digital signage in cooperation with local communities and otherwise utilize the transport media and
travel products owned by jr east to provide interactive information for city center and regional areas thereby
creating increased tourism flows
in regard to the utilization of local products and the expansion of sales channels our initiatives are continuing
apace with tieups with group companies our collaboration with local governments organizations and
producers has been strengthened and efforts are constantly being made to contribute to the revitalization of
local resources and industries through the exploitation of local products and traditional crafts the development
of processed agricultural products and the holding of farmfresh markets

4 future developments
the rediscover local areas project will continue to promote the local revitalization measures deemed
appropriate for individual areas we are for example planning the construction of a craft center and market
specializing in the apples produced in aomori prefecture japan   s largest producer on the aomori waterfront
which will be easily accessible by the tohoku shinkansen service various other collaborative projects and tie
ups with aomori city s urban planning organizations are also in the pipeline
in order to continue these initiatives with further strength under the create together strategy jr east will
promote local revitalization as a new role to be taken on by all our employees in cooperation with local powers
including regional governments organizations producers schools and companies as part of the rediscover
local areas project we will create the systems and frameworks necessary for the promotion of these
approaches by the end of the fiscal year ending march 2011 and thereby accelerate jr east group   s ability to
meet new challenges

  progressively passing on experiences from one generation to the next
the experience which taught me the most about the importance of safety was a manvehicle accident
which occurred at the omiya yard in 1969 in which i lost my best friend he and i had joined the
company the same year i still clearly remember his parentssorrow when i visited them to deliver his
remains and the grieving of his supervisor and colleagues

opportunity to formulate such a manual however the complicated part of creating a manual is that
a manual will sometimes prevent field site employees from thinking beyond its contents and accidents
usually do not occur as they are written therefore it is necessary that we take it upon ourselves to
think act and challenge for ourselves

experiences at field sites will be necessary the time sensations of dispatchers who are just waiting
for information at the control room and that of field site workers who are physically moving fast at
the site are totally different it is important to give consideration to the situation of field sites when
providing directions for safety it is vital that we obtain as much information as possible from as
many field sites as possible
accidents may be ra re but t hey should never happen to begin w it h this conv iction leads me to
believe that i am obliged to pass on the experience of losing my best friend in an accident to the next
generation i strongly hope that jr east will find a way to safety from experiences of chroniclers
of safety like myself from the days of jnr and hope that jr east employees who shoulder the next
generation will have a faith inpursuing extreme safety levels

 double checking from another perspective
railway signaling facilities have two major roles to provide safety for preventing accidents and reliability for
operating according to the schedule safety is of top priority and by securing safety first signaling facilities can
contribute to reliable transport for this reason as a general rule when signaling equipment fails it is designed
to stop trains however if we stop trains even with minor troubles transport reliability will deteriorate and the
important balance will be lost
from my experience the major risk with signaling facilities is fire in the equipment room in stations there
are equipment rooms which are the keystones of signaling though infrequent a rapid increase in voltage
sometimes causes an equipment room fire and this stops all electric trains when this happens emergency
recovery is needed the recovery work involves the rewiring of more than 5000 wires a job which cannot be
completed in just one or two hours as facilities maintenance workers we need to secure safety of operations
while being able to restore signaling functions as quickly as possible
as a chronicler of safety i would like to pass on two things be wary of hardware and always confirm by
double checking from an alternative perspective when it comes to signaling equipment a single mistake
in wiring could lead to an accident ideally equipment at field sites should be in the same condition as
planned on paper but we should never ignore the possibility that the equipment may have undergone some
modifications or may be scheduled for repair at a later date for these reasons it is important to remain wary
and to not assume anything from the start but to reconfirm that everything is as it is designed to be for this
check everything twice and if possible ask someone to check it all again in doing so i believe that we can
help reduce the risk of events which we might never expect to occur

                           s experiences
 learning from other people
on january 17th 1995 at the time of the great hanshinawaji earthquake shinkansen elevated bridge
columns in the jr west service area were destroyed as if being bent at their knees i have never in my
experience seen these columns damaged to that extent at the time i was a manager in charge of civil
engineering at our track  structures maintenance and electric engineering dept three days after the
earthquake occurred as a member of a technical support team from jr east i joined an investigation team
to study damage conditions utilizing the combined experience of the investigation team we reinforced
shinkansen elevated bridges within a 3 km radius of all active faults in the jr east service area sometime
later in october 2004 the niigata chuetsu earthquake occurred at the time of the earthquake toki no 325
derailed but fortunately the location of the shinkansen derailment was exactly at a place we had reinforced
after the great hanshinawaji earthquake so our elevated bridges stayed intact and there were no fatalities
as in an old saying rock on another mountain meaning learning from othersmistakes this event made me
realize again that it is vital that we thoroughly investigate events which occur in other places predict whether
there is a possibility of the same risk in our own service areas and take appropriate countermeasures
as a chronicler of safety i am in charge of civil engineering and disaster prevention and in many cases we face
                                                                                                    s responsibility as
forces in nature of which we will never be able to control accordingly i believe that it is jr east
a railway operator to minimize the effects of such natural disasters as much as humanly possible so that even
when there is a natural disaster fatality can be avoided in order to do so we must carefully learn lessons
from the past and keep learning as it is extremely difficult to make assumptions on areas in which we do not
have experience it is important to carefully and humbly analyze each and every event and to consider each
time that we have learned again from nature comprehensively and accurately search out the possible causes
contemplate what we can do to eliminate them in the future and take action a purposeful compilation of past
and present experiences is indispensable in securing the safety of trains from natural disasters i would like to
pass this mindset on to the next generation

 prompt decision making is critical for safety
when jr was established upon the division and privatization of jnr we made a major change in our safety
consciousness our speed has increased in both decision making and response presently at the time of an
accident we resolve the prevention of recurrence of the same accident to this end as an organization jr east
promptly determines countermeasures and takes action
in 1988 shortly after the division and privatization of jnr and the establishment of jr east an incident
occurred in which a train at ueno station did not stop at the 3rd yard signal which was showing a stop
indication at the time another train was proceeding in the direction of that train and if the train had not
been stopped a collision would have been unavoidable fortunately in this case the collision was avoided
however the response of our newly born railway safety promotion committee at the time was striking from
the sense of crisis that this kind of event could happen again unless there were systematic prevention in spite
of the cost jr east promptly decided to accelerate the introduction of the latest automatic train stop system
atsp which is superior to regular ats in safety i think this speed in decision making as an organization has
been a major characteristic since the establishment of jr east
from my experience major accidents and troubles tend to happen when there is something abnormal for
example accidents or troubles tend to occur when a train stops because of a signal failure or a brake failure
and resumes operation after recovery at the time of such abnormality we need to do unaccustomed things
without a backup system because the system is designed to employ backup systems in ordinary situations
as a result many of the accidents that occur are happening in these situations as a chronicler of safety for
operational rules to prevent these accidents i would like to have field site employees to understand the reasons
and grounds for each procedure for times of abnormality as there are reasons why we need to handle each
one of the procedures in a certain way i would like to pass this understanding on based on my experiences

     biological diversity and environmental technical development




shinanogawa river hometown forestation program
in 2004 in order to protect biological diversity and to contribute to a sustainable society jr east began the
hometown forestation programs to revitalize existing forest the programs plant various kinds of trees native
to each region close together in a state similar to what would exist naturally
on june 26th 2010 with the cooperation of niigata prefecture and tsunan town we held the shinanogawa
river hometown forestation program to plant 16 different kinds and a total of 17000 saplings in the region
additionally jr east is implementing tree planting programs based in each area and is committed to continuing
the activity in the future

development of railway trees
along the jr east railway lines we have railway trees planted to shield the tracks from blowing snow and
wind the first railway forest was created in 1893 for disaster prevention as living disaster prevention facilities
railway forests are playing their roles
jr east now owns approximately six million railway trees on a total of about 4200 hectares along our lines at
1208 locations the trees absorb 17 thousand tons of co2  equivalent to 07 of the co2 that jr east emits in
this way they also contribute to preserving the environment
in 2008 after fundamentally reviewing the role of railway trees from the viewpoints both of disaster
prevention and environmental preservation we launched a new project to plant trees to replace those that will
require replacement over the coming 20 years

railway trees  from single to multivariety trees
conventional railway trees were of a single variety primarily cedar trees because another function in
addition to protecting against natural disasters was to generate profits through the production of timber this
has recently been less successful however in the face of declining demand for domestic timber in future
tree replacement we will plant several varieties suitable for the local climate and develop them to be more
sustainable and ecologically resilient

the ou main line between okitama and takahata on july 26 2009 and in the jinguji no2 railway forest on
the ou main line between jinguji and kariwano on may 22nd 2010 with kind advice and guidance from
ecologist and professor emeritus akira miyawaki of yokohama national university several varieties of native
trees potential natural vegetation were selected and planted many local residents and participants from
organized tours participated in the ceremonies and discovered how the trees they planted would grow to
become useful as living railway disaster prevention facilities

   progress in technological development



    research and development aimed at a reduction in environmental impact
    upholding our contributions to the global environment as one of the four pillars of our research
    and development jr east is working on research and development to reduce its environmental
    impact by establishing new energy management our efforts include the development of hybrid
    railcars with storage batteries endeavors to realize environmentally harmonized stations and
    a consideration for the utilization of energy saving technology and natural energy

    development of a storage battery train system
    ne train new energy train smart denchikun
    to reduce our environmental impact jr east is considering the application of new motive
    energy to our railways through the testing of our test railcar ne train new energy train
    currently as a measure to reduce environmental impact in nonelectrified railway sections
    we are developing a storage battery train system a hybrid system to utilize both electricity
    from overhead wires and that from storage batteries the train operates in electrified railway
    sections while receiving its electrical supply from overhead wires and charging its storage
    batteries in nonelectrified railway sections it operates on the electricity of the storage
    batter ies the system cont r ibutes to reductions in bot h co 2 emissions a nd noise when
    compared with traditional diesel cars in september 2009 jr east completed construction
    of the ne train smart denchikun  with this system and has begun running tests for further
    verification

basic concept on environmental protection and targets




the jr east group formalized its basic philosophy and basic policies in 1992 and established activity
guidelines in 1996 and our specific environmental protection measures are based on these

basic philosophy and basic policies for promoting ecological activities established may 1992
basic philosophy
 the entire jr east group working together will diligently strive to balance environmental protection with
  our business activities
basic policies
 to contribute to customers lives and local communities by providing a comfortable environment
 to develop and provide the technology needed to protect the global environment
 to maintain an awareness of environmental protection and raise the environmental awareness of our
  employees

activity guidelines for the promotion of ecological activities
established march 1996 and partially revised in february 1998
1 we work to prevent the waste of precious energy resources and to reduce co 2 emissions  a known source
   of global warming  by enhancing our energy efficiency and introducing cleaner forms of energy
2 we ensure the proper management and processing of environmental pollutants and ozonedepleting
   substances in compliance with laws and regulations moreover we do our best to reduce generation of such
   substances and adopt environmentally responsible substitutes when they are available
3 we ensure the appropriate processing of various types of waste generated at our offices establishments
   stations trains etc we strive to recycle waste and reduce the amount generated and to use more recycled
   and resourcesaving products to minimize our burden placed upon the environment
4 we respect the natural environment which nurtures diversified life and endeavor to reduce noise and
   vibrations caused by train operations thus achieving harmony with the environment along railway lines
5 we work to make railways a more attractive and environmentally friendly form of transportation

measures to prevent global warming

co2 emissions and reduction measures
our co2 emissions in the fiscal year ending march 2010 totaled 254 million tons an increase of 028 million
tons over the previous fiscal year the reasons for the increase include the operating rates of our own thermal
plants which were designed to compensate for the suspension of operations at our hydroelectric power plants
we are determined to continue to reduce energy used for train operation which accounts for 70 of the total
energy we consume
we will also undertake a range of measures to reduce co2 emissions including energy conservation actions
for which new targets are being set for stations and offices

energy conservation and co2 reduction
the electricity consumed by jr east for train operations as well as for lighting and air conditioning at stations
and in offices is supplied by jr easts own power plants and by electric power companies besides electricity
we also use diesel fuel and kerosene for diesel train operation and air conditioning at stations and in offices
we will strive to save energy in various ways and reduce co2 emissions

reducing energy consumed for train operations
as of the end of march 2010 jr east had 10883 energyefficient railcars in operation this accounts for 88
of our railcar fleet
we are putting into service more newgeneration energy efficient railcars with features such as regenerative
brakes which can convert kinetic energy during deceleration into electric energy and variable voltage variable
frequency vvvf inverters which control motors without wasting electricity

dieselpowered electricmotordriven hybrid railcars and new resort trains
the kiha e200 type cars which entered service on the koumi line in july 2007 are the world      s first diesel
powered electricmotordriven hybrid railcars a similar hybrid system will be employed on new resort trains
that will enter service in the fall of 2010 this is expected to reduce fuel consumption rate by about 10 and
nitrogen oxide nox exhaust emissions by about 60 in comparison with current trains also the level of
noise when idling at stations and when accelerating on departure is expected to be lower by 2030db

  s own power plants
jr
jr east operates a thermal power plant in kawasaki city kanagawa prefecture with a total output of 655
thousand kwh at the plant we replaced three of its four generating units with combinedcycle power
generation units with improved generating efficiency in june 2006 we replaced kerosene with natural gas as
fuel for the no3 generation unit in an effort to further reduce co 2 emissions we will replace the last steam
powered generation unit using heavy oil with a combinedcycle generation system using natural gas in 2013

 a combinedcycle power generation unit is a power generation unit that combines gas turbines propelled by combustion of gas with
steam turbines driven by steam from the exhaust heat

utilization of natural energy
we also promote use of natural energies including solar and wind power solar panels are installed at tokyo
station takasaki station general education center and rd center takasaki station doubled its solar
panels in march 2004
in addition solar panels will be installed at tokyo station above the platform serving tokaido line tracks no
9 and 10 and are scheduled to be operational during the fiscal year beginning april 2010 also in preparation
for employing windpower generation we will carry out research to determine whether there are effects when
electricity generated by wind power which fluctuates according to wind velocity is routed to a transformer
substation

greening rooftops
we have been promoting the planting of greenery on jr eastowned station and office building rooftops with
the aim of reducing the heat island effect and decreasing the need for airconditioning as of the end of march
2010 we hadgreeneda combined rooftop area of approximately 14900 m2 in 45 projects

ebisu green garden the birth of a rooftop garden in jr ebisu
we provided an oasis for local residents and office workers with the april 29 2009 opening of ebisu green
garden a spacious rooftop garden rich in greenery with many herbs and other plants we also have supported
the local community through the launch of soradofarm a rental vegetable garden opened in september
2009 that allows local residents to experience agricultural and environmental education through the delights
of vegetable planting and care both areas a total of 2100 m2 of which 500 m2 is occupied by the vegetable
garden have been highly appreciated by visitors

environmental management at large underground stations
when we began our equipment renewal work at ueno station and the underground keiyo line area in tokyo
station to eliminate the use of cfcs we reviewed the capacity of cooling equipment for air conditioning
and employed inverter controls we also endeavor to reduce energy by monitoring operations and exercising
optimum operating control based on diagnosis using our building energy management system bems as
a result in the fiscal year ending march 2010 energy consumption by air conditioning units was down by
50 from the level of the fiscal year ending march 2005 and march 2008 for ueno and tokyo stations
respectively

saving energy in office buildings
in response to revisions to laws and regulations saving energy in office buildings has become increasingly
important we work hard on reducing energy consumption both in hardware including the introduction
of highly efficient equipment and facilities and in software including temperature management of air
conditioning and diligently turning off lights

  the adoption of highly efficient equipment and measures for building longevity consideration for street
  scenes and landscapes reuse of rainwater and drainage and separated collection and reduction of
  garbage and interior amenities

  casbeecomprehensive assessment system for built environment efficiency
  the casbee evaluation system is based on levels of environmental efficiency advocated by the ministry of land infrastructure
  transport and tourism including the quality of the environment and performance improvements such as interior amenities
  and consideration for landscapes in addition to environmental impact reductions including energyresources conservation
  and recycling capabilities based on a comprehensive assessment of environmental efficiency




  environmental measures at ecute nippori
  ecute nippori is an example of how jr east is actively working toward the reduction of global
  environmental burdens through the following measures
  1 the greening of the station rooftop which is within view of yanaka reien cemetery an area rich in
     greenery was aimed at allowing the station to blend in with its surrounding neighborhood as well as
     reducing heat emissions from the roof during hot summer days and bringing about a reduction in air
     conditioning demand while at the same time providing a comfortable station space
  2 by equipping the building totally with led lighting the annual electricity consumption was lowered
     dramatically the number of lights actually necessary was reduced and due to lower heat emissions
     produced by the lights the air conditioning burden was considerably lessened
  3 thorough separation of waste food was implemented resulting in a food recycling ratio of 100 with
     biomass energy

saving energy used by information systems
energy consumption by information systems has increased dramatically over the past several years and has
become a genuine social problem in order to respond to this issue jr east succeeded in reducing electricity
usage by 6400kwh by switching off the power consumption of certain information system equipment when not
in necessary use in the fiscal year ending in march 2011 we intend to make further reductions by expanding
the scope of target equipment

intermodal transportation  reduction of co2 emissions by the entire transportation system
promoting parkandride
we are adding parking spaces in front of stations in order to promote parkandride schemes so that our
customers with tickets for the shinkansen or limited express trains can drive their cars from home to nearby
stations and use the train network from there by the end of march 2010 91 jr east stations had parking
spaces for ten thousand cars not only can people get to their destinations safely and surely without getting
bogged down in traffic congestion but they can travel with less impact on the environment

parking spaces for ten thousand cars parking spaces include those developed by jr east and those managed by jr east group
 companies or in cooperation with local municipalities

chemical substance management

compliance with laws and setting goals for reduction of chemical substances
when using chemical substances the effects on human health and ecological systems must be fully considered
the jr east group not only rigidly adheres to established base values but sets its own ambitious targets
as well as much as possible we restrict the use of such substances and adopt environmentally responsible
substitutes

reducing and replacing ozone depleting substances
we endeavor to reduce the use of substances specified as controlled substances under the ozone layer
protection law and adopt environmentally friendly substitutes
 large heat exchangers large refrigerators  having steadily replaced air conditioning units using specified
  chlorofluorocarbons cfcs with systems that do not use them we completed the removal of such units from
  buildings by the end of march 2008
 rolling stock  except for some diesel railcars all of our cars use cfc substitutes as of march 2010 we were
  using 88 tons of cfc substitutes and only 05 ton of cfcs we routinely check for gas leaks and collect the
  refrigerants when scrapping retired railcars in accordance with applicable laws and regulations
 fireextinguishing agent  although 65 tons of halon gas was still in use as a fireextinguishing agent as of
  march 2010 we have it under proper control and are replacing it with nonhalon agents such as powder
  agents and co2 when building new facilities or renovating existing ones

chemical substance management
as jr east uses chemical substances primarily for painting and repairing our railcars we take rigorous steps
for their use and management in order to prevent their leakage we are a company that handles a considerable
amount of specified chemical substances and 14 jr east facilities submitted the data regarding the release and
transfer of these substances to relevant authorities in the fiscal year ended march 2010 pursuant to the prtr
law
we are also promoting the introduction of stainless steel railcars that do not require painting at the end of
march 2010 as many as 79 of the 10770 cars operated on our conventional lines were stainless steel railcars
beside their use for railcars we used 457 tons of organic solvents for painting railway facilities and stabilizing
track beds in the fiscal year ended march 2010

prtr stands forpollutant release and transfer registers the formal name of this law is act on confirmation etc of release amounts
 of specific chemical substances in the environment and promotion of improvements to the management thereof the law encourages

reducing emissions from jr east
we use natural gas kerosene and bunker c lowsulfur heavy oil at jr east     s thermal power plants when
these fuels burn however nitrogen oxides nox sulfur oxides sox and particulate matter pm are emitted
in the fiscal year ending in march 2010 increases to the operating rates at our thermal power plants resulted
in increased nox emissions
we endeavor both to control the generation of these substances and to reduce the total amount of emissions
by installing denitrification equipment lownox burners and dust collectors at the plants

basic thoughts on noise reduction

improvement of the environment along railways basic thoughts on noise reduction
in the operation of trains noise is created by the train cars moving through the air by the wheels travelling
on the rails by the motors and by other sources in order to reduce noise we are working in various ways to
improve both the trains and our ground equipment
jr east also endeavors to reduce noise during maintenance work on track and structures to further improve the
environment along the lines

measures for the shinkansen
in accordance with the japanese government     s environmental quality standards for shinkansen railway
noise jr east has taken many steps to reduce this noise such as the installation of soundproof walls and
soundabsorbent materials rail grinding1 and the modification of our railcars to operate more quietly we
have already completed the implementation of measures to reduce noise levels to 75 db or lower in densely
populated residential areas along our railway lines and we plan to take further steps by expanding the
scope of areas where noise levels need to be reduced to 75 db or lower also with the introduction of e5
series railcars which were developed based on the results of running tests using the shinkansenfastech
test train jr east is working to improve the environment even as we increase train speed including further
reduction of noise and micropressure waves in tunnels2 

1 rail grinding a measure to smooth out uneven places in rails caused by wheels traveling over them this reduces noise by controlling car
   vibration
2 micropressure waves in tunnels an explosive sound caused by compressed air being forced out of a tunnel when a shinkansen train
   enters it at a high speed the sound is produced at the end of the tunnel




                                         the e5 series employs lownoise pantographs


measures for conventional lines
we have implemented voluntary measures for conventional lines to minimize noise installing long rails1 and
performing railgrinding and wheeltruing2  we also comply with the japanese governments policy on noise
measures for construction of new conventional railways or largescale remodeling when we engage in this
kind of construction or modification of our conventional lines

1 installing long rails rail joints are welded such that the length of a single rail becomes more than 200 meters with fewer rail joints these
   rails reduce noise produced at joints when trains pass
2 wheel truing a measure to grind the unevenness of wheels caused by wear to restore their circular shape




measures for maintenance work
as the maintenance work is usually done during night we give advance notice about the schedule and details
of the work to residents in surrounding areas we also make utmost efforts to minimize noise by using modified
equipment producing lower noise
furthermore by using track that is designed to resist deformation jr east is reducing the volume of required
maintenance work




                                                                   ー 38

improvement of environment along railway lines

restricting use of herbicides
safe train operations require regular removal of weeds along railway lines while we generally remove them
manually we also use a certain amount of herbicide we keep the usage of herbicides to a minimum in both
volume and range of use when selecting herbicides for use we select those from the safest of the three
levels of toxicity for those toxic to humans and animals and from category a the safest of the five levels for
those toxic to fish we continue to observe the rules in place in order to keep our impact on the surrounding
environment to a minimum as with our initiative to postpone the spraying of herbicides when conditions on
the scheduled day are not satisfactory for spraying

harmony with the landscape
constructing a largescale railway facility or remodeling one can affect the immediate area and surrounding
environment and their design is increasingly important from the stage of planning and designing we consider
harmony with the landscape along with function and economy endeavoring to build facilities friendly to the
regional environment in the fiscal year ended march 2009 the tenmagawa bridge between kamikitamachi
and ottomo on the tohoku main line received the civil engineering design prize of the japan society of civil
engineers  a recognition of our efforts by a distinguished outside party




                                                           using continuous concrete arches the tenmagawa
                                                           bridge between kamikitamachi and ottomo on the
                                                           tohoku main line sits in harmony with the mountains
                                                           and pastoral landscape of aomori prefecture and
                                                           received the 2008 civil engineering design prize of the
                                                           japan society of civil engineers


use of groundwater in tunnels to purify rivers
groundwater in underground tunnels is typically pumped out and drained away jr east in coordination with
local municipalities promotes draining clean spring groundwater in tunnels into surrounding rivers to purify
water and improve the environment in tokyo we started draining clean groundwater to the nogawa river
via sugatami pond in the fiscal year ending march 2002 to the tachiai river in the fiscal year ending march
2003 and to shinobazu pond in the fiscal year ending march 2004 and in kanagawa prefecture to the
yahagi river in the fiscal year ending march 2008




                                 routing tunnel groundwater to the tachiai river


forest development along railway lines
since 1992 we have implemented tree plantings along railway lines to create railway forests by march 2010
we had planted some 290 thousand trees with the involvement of about 42 thousand people we are now
working together with people in local communities on planting trees in other places as well as along railway
lines

environmental accounting and management indicators

using environmental management indicators in business activities
in the fiscal year ended march 2010 our environmental conservation costs amounted to approximately
769 billion yen in investments and 314 billion yen in expenses of these investments costs for global
environmental conservation which accounted for a large portion were at the same level as the previous
year because we continued acquiring new railcars
by introducing these new cars we estimate we will reduce co 2 emissions by 018 million tons during
their service lives
jr east has its own environmental management indicator to assess the relation between our business
activities and environmental impacts these are calculated by dividing co 2 emissions which are a major
factor in environmental impacts by operating profits which represent our economic value added eva
this means that the smaller the number calculated by this formula is the more economic value added
we have created by giving smaller impacts on the environment for the fiscal year ended march 2010 the
value of the indicator was 899 tco 2 billion yen compared with 945 tco 2 billion yen for the fiscal
year ending march 1991

  major transport disruptions occurring in the fiscal year ending march 2010

  general descriptions and measures against transport disruptions similar
  to a railcar failure on the yokosuka line
  at around 648 am on may 7th 2009 an electric train on the yokosuka line going from kurihama to
  tsudanuma came to a stop between yokohama and shinkawasaki stations and was unable to start
  again for a long time the cause was a broken wire behind a switch that conductors use to stop trains
  in case of an emergency the wire had been pinched between the board and the carbody resulting in
  the activation of the emergency brake and the resulting shortcircuit prevented the emergency brake
  from being released in response to this event we further committed ourselves to ensuring proper
  wiring in railcar production and remodeling additionally we reviewed our trouble shooting procedures
  for cases in which an emergency brake fails to be released after being accidentally applied as a result
  of reviewing our quickresponse capability for incidents of this kind in the tokyo metropolitan area jr
  east decided to install a new satellite inspection office in yokohama

  general descriptions and measures against transport disruptions similar
  to the smoke and fumes at the etchūjima substation of the keiyo line
  at around 1351 on july 30th 2009 electrical transmissions from the etchūjima substation failed and
  resulted in transport disruptions the failure resulted from ground faulting which occurred inside a
  high voltage power distribution line box on an electric train running between tokyo and kasai rinkai
  koen stations at this time a breaker was activated at the etchūjima substation and this created an
  arc to the metal screw of a handle inside the breaker box burning part of the wiring and stopping
  electrical transmissions from the etchūjima substation the electrical transmission system of the
  etchūjima substation was subsequently disconnected and at 1822 electrical transmissions resumed
  from a neighboring substation this made it possible to locate the railcar failure and operations
  resumed at 2057
  as a countermeasure we thoroughly checked for any erosion in the wiring inside high voltage power
  distribution line boxes for our electric trains conducted emergency inspections of breakers of the kind
  that failed and improved the breaker design so that an arc cannot jump to metallic parts

creation of a culture of safety

our 5 cultures of safety
to heighten levels of railway safety it is necessary to establish and support an unwavering culture of safety
the culture of safety we seek is based upon accident information from the past and we learn and act upon it in
mutual trust



    ① a culture of proper reporting
      preventing the occurrence and recurrence of accidents through prompt and proper reporting of all
      accidents and incidents
    ② a culture of noticing
      the prevention of accidents through an awareness of the origins of accidents and the sharing of
      information that would prevent these origins from leading to actual accidents
    ③ a culture of direct meeting and discussion
      allowing for the open and honest exchange of opinions and public debate enables us to identify the
      causes of accidents and to take appropriate countermeasures against recurrence
    ④ a culture of learning
      continuously learning about accidents and learning from accidents and incidents which occur in all
                                     s own workplace
      places of work not just in one
    ⑤ a culture of action
      safety can only be secured by taking safe actions think and act for yourself this is at the core
      of our safety




sangen principle three actualities principleas a standard for action
accidents and incidents always occur at the genba this means that the sources of accident prevention can
also be found at the genba in order to suitably understand and rectify each accident or incident jr east
approaches safety issues with thethree actualities principleas its standard for action actual locations
actual objects and actual people

genba genbameans a field or workplace where employees actually do their physical work in construction production maintenance
 operation etc as distinguished from management or office work in industrial sectors such as construction and manufacturing

nurturing personnel to carry safety forward
with rapid shifts between generations the nurturing of employees who can assume major roles in ensuring
safety is becoming a pressing need jr east has assignedkey safety leadersfor its field organizations and
other such institutions andsafety professionalsfor branch offices and other such establishments to increase
levels of safety in addition through the organization of 7 ob an organization of employees possessing a
wealth of knowledge about safety and the ability to apply it aschroniclers of safety narrators of oral
history we are holding seminars to help pass on their knowledge and experience on safety to the next
generation

the challenge safety campaign
in 1988 we started the challenge safety campaign with the aim of encouraging our employees to actively
take on the challenge of further improving safety levels rather than just passively maintaining safety the
challenge safety campaign aims to increase our employee awareness and sense of safety we intend to guide
all employees to more safetyoriented behavior by having them think about and discuss safety act upon it and
feel a sense of achievement through doing so

railway safety symposium
since 1990 we have held the railway safety symposium for the purpose of improving each employee       s
awareness of safety in the fiscal year ending march 2010 jr east held its 18th symposiumwhy accidents
and incidences keep occurring conquering the deceptive belief thatit won

safety education and training
to improve the skills of train crews accident prevention simulator training is conducted regularly in the
general training centers in each of our branches at the jr east general education center in shirakawa city
fukushima prefecture we train both drivers and conductors and provide human resource development in the
form of knowledge and technical proficiency
the accident history exhibition hall was established in the center to emphasize the importance of learning
from past accidents

improvement of safety equipment

investment in safety equipment forextreme safety levels
to achieve a more assured level of safety in railway operations weak points in the current systems must be
identified and reviewed from a safety standpoint furthermore safety equipment must undergo intensive
and effective assessments in order to prevent the occurrence of accidents in the future to date our
countermeasures have been primarily focused on preventing any reoccurrence of accidents that have happened
in the past however additional risks also exist such as the very realistic threat of a major earthquake in the
tokyo metropolitan area which would result in major damage to our railways as such in addition to measures
we have taken so far jr east will implement concrete countermeasures through the analysis and evaluation of
all potential risks before they actually evolve into accidents
for improvements to safety equipment based on our four previous 5year safety plans jr east has invested
more than 24 trillion yen since its establishment in our 2013 safety vision jr east  s 5th 5year safety plan

to prevent collisions between trains jr east has installed ats automatic train stop and atc automatic train
control systems on all of its railway lines to heighten the current safety level of train operations even further
we are installing atsp and atsps systems which employ continuous speed monitoring functions the
number of installations is steadily increasing most new installations are in the tokyo metropolitan area by

is currently installed on 2277 km of line in the sendai and niigata regions and at 20 stations in addition in
response to revisions to the ministry ordinance for technological standards for railways in july 2006 we are

systemization of maintenance work
safety during maintenance work has been improved with the use of tctype wireless alarm systems the
systems warn employees working on railway tracks when a train is approaching jr east has also introduced
a safety system that enables workers performing maintenance to turn signals red from a handheld device
ensuring that trains are stopped whenever necessary the system is already in use on all major lines in the
tokyo metropolitan area and is being introduced to other railway divisions

practical application of the advanced train administration and communications system atacs
train control system with radio transmission
atacs is a train control system utilizing radio transmissions by using radio communications for the
transmission of information between ground and onboard facilities the system enables the trains to be mainly
controlled by onboard equipment this permits reductions in traditionally required ground facilities such
as signals track circuits and connecting cables eliminating some of these facilities is expected to cause a
reduction in the number of transport disruptions
jr east is aiming to introduce this atacs to the senseki line for practical operation in 2011

introduction of effective rainfall as a new index
when there is heavy rainfall we ensure train safety through operational restrictions such as limits to train
speed and when necessary by suspension of operations for operational restrictions on conventional lines we
have been using hourly rainfall1 and continuous precipitation2 as our indices since june 2008 we have been
usingeffective rainfallas a new index that is effective in prevention of landslide disasters due to rainfall
effective rainfall is the amount of underground water remaining after changes over time in ground penetration
and outflow using this index we can more precisely predict the occurrence of landslide disasters improving
the safety and reliability of our train operations

completion of reinforcement work for disaster prevention against heavy rainfall in the tokyo
metropolitan area
jr east has completed its planned reinforcement work to railway lines to protect against heavy rainfall the
measures are intended to reduce operational restrictions due to heavy rain and minimize any effect on train
operations jr east began reinforcement work for disaster prevention against rainfall in april 2004 on 12
routes mainly in the tokyo metropolitan area and with high levels of traffic and this work was completed in
june 2008




                                      concrete lattice frame protection work




seismic reinforcement of elevated bridges
in response to the 1995 great hanshinawaji earthquake jr east has been taking a number of seismic
reinforcement measures on rigidframe elevated bridge columns which were susceptible to shear failures
by the end of march 2008 we had reinforced all of our elevated shinkansen viaduct support columns and
shinkansen bridge columns on our conventional lines by the end of march 2009 we had reinforced all other
columns except in places that required additional construction work in the southern kanto and sendai areas
currently we are reinforcing elevated bridge columns susceptible to failure due to bending due to strong
earthquake motion aiming to further improve our safety levels against earthquakes

early earthquake alert system for conventional lines
jr east has installed seismographs along coastal and shinkansen railway lines for the detection of primary
tremors pwaves our present system allows us to stop trains as soon as primary tremors are detected for
conventional lines our early earthquake alert system was introduced for the tokyo metropolitan area in
december 2007 and in all other areas in april 2009
the system enables trains in any section of track to be stopped in the case of a major earthquake utilizing
information obtained from our shinkansen seismographs and from any advance announcements given by the
japan meteorological agency

prevention of secondary accidents after derailment
during the niigata chuetsu earthquake in 2004 one of our joetsu shinkansen trains was derailed while
running fortunately this derailment did not lead to any injury to either our passengers or our train crews
learning from the events surrounding this earthquake jr east has taken numerous measures aimed to improve
our shinkansen trains and tracks
for our railcars we have installed an lshaped car guide on the bogies to restrict lateral movement of the
car body for ground facilities we are improving the shape of joint bars to lessen the impact of wheels on rail
joints in the case of a derailment and implementing countermeasures to prevent the overturning of railcars and
the lateral movement of rails in the case that metallic rail fasteners are damaged in derailment furthermore
early detection of earthquake occurrence by seismographs and of interruptions of electric transmission have
enabled us to more promptly detect earthquakes and start emergency braking about one second earlier

measures to prevent railway crossing accidents
when the company was established in 1987 there were 247 accidents during the year at level crossings in the
fiscal year ending march 2010 the number had been drastically reduced to 43
approximately 80 of all levelcrossing accidents involve automobiles we have installed devices such as obstacle
detectors which are capable of detecting an obstacle such as an automobile stalled on a crossing and stopping
trains and we have put crossing warning devices in a higher position for better visibility more large red and white
crossing gates have been installed the barrier arms are thicker than usual and have red and white reflective plates
that cover the whole bar these are expected to provide better visibility day and night studies are currently being
carried out on the effectiveness of these bars in addition we are presently promoting a wide range of public
relations activities for the prevention of level crossing accidents appealing to drivers for their cooperation and
understanding
furthermore we are trying to increase the number of overhead crossings to eliminate level crossings with
roads and are doing this with the cooperation of local governments neighboring residents and the police in
addition for countermeasures against secondary accidents caused by derailments at level crossings we are
installing derailment prevention guards at level crossings

station platform safety
in the fiscal year ending march 2010 there were 62 accidents in which customers fell from platforms onto
tracks or came into contact with trains jr east is installing protectionrelated devices including emergency
trainstopping systems on our platforms to ensure the safety of its customers in addition since customer
awareness and cooperation are also vital to safety on our platforms we are implementing ourplatform safety
campaign  through posters as a measure to heighten the safety awareness of our customers
furthermore as an additional accident prevention measure for customers on platforms jr east is introducing
automatic platform gates on the yamanote line the gates will initially be installed at ebisu and meguro
stations we will install gates at the remaining stations applying the knowledge earned by analyzing any
technical issues and impacts found at the first two stations we are hoping to introduce the gates to the
majority of stations on the line with the exception of stations requiring largescale improvement work by
march 2018

measures taken since the accident on the uetsu line
on december 25 2005 the limited express train inaho no14 derailed between sagoshi and kitaamarume
stations near the no2 mogamigawa bridge we would like to report on the measures we have taken since this
accident

increased number of anemometers wind meters
to date jr east has increased the number of anemometers at the accident site between sagoshi and kita
amarume stations in addition for sections with operational restrictions due to strong winds we established
multiple anemometers as our new standard and increased the number of anemometers in locations where
windbreak fences were installed
additionally by reconfirming the requirements for wind restrictions on sections of railway line using
information from frontline employees topography and wind conditions of the areas and adding new
operation restriction sections we are working to improve our safety observation network to counter the effects
of these strong winds furthermore by the end of march 2010 we had completed our planned increase and
installation of anemometers on the lines

we have been adding to our gale warning system to raise the level of safety by restricting operations not only
when the actual wind speed measured by anemometers exceeds restriction thresholds but also when the
projected maximum wind speed exceeds these limits


                                               as of dec 25th    as of mar 31st         increase

                     gale warning systems


utilizing meteorological information to test methods for operational restrictions
local gusts are meteorological phenomena and are difficult to observe with conventional observation
equipment such as anemometers through meteorological information obtained from the japan meteorological
agency radar and by detecting the passing of cold weather fronts and the accompanying development of
cumulonimbus clouds we have been investigating how to forecast the occurrence of local gusts and to apply
that information to our operational restrictions
from fiscal 2008 the system was tested during the winter on the uetsu main line between niitsu and sakata
and on the hakushin line between niigata and shibata on february 17th 2009 we added the system to
sections of the uetsu main line shinetsu main line echigo line yahiko line and rikuu west line for
additional testing
during this three year period of testing though we initiated train operational restrictions a total of three times
we did not observe any actual occurrence of local gusts



research of a doppler radar observation method
we are currently investigating the possible utilization of a doppler radar observation method to help
identify local gusts as information to be used for operational restrictions doppler radars can determine
wind conditions by detecting the movements of raindrops and rain clouds and are used at some airports for
detecting local gusts
from july 2007 in cooperation with a special research institution we have been furthering our procedures
of meteorological observation and analysis on coastlines along the sea of japan during the winter season
together with information gathered on the characteristics of local gusts we have been testing the radars
detection capabilities against local gusts

safety research and development
disaster risk evaluation system eadas to prepare for natural disasters
we are currently developing a disaster risk evaluation system eadas environment agent disaster and
structure which will quantitatively evaluate the vulnerability to natural disasters of random locations across
japan by assessing relationships between natural environment features such as topography geology and
climate and natural disasters due to topography based on our experiences and experiments we are now
working on the systemization of the eadas method aiming for a system which will enable our staff on the
front line of our field organizations to easily evaluate the vulnerability of locations to natural disasters

an automatic train protection signal transmission system for enhanced safety levels
at jr east we continue to improve our levels of safety through our research and development in the case
of an accident such as a derailment we have introduced a train protection radio for the transmission of
emergency signals to stop other trains we have also developed a system to automatically transmit emergency
stop signals with our train protection radio to further ensure prevention of the occurrence of a secondary
accident even when train crews are unable to transmit signals manually or promptly as can happen if there
is a major accident such as a train collision derailment or overturned train the system is able to transmit the
emergency signals automatically since december 2008 the system has been in use on e233 series keihin
tohoku line trains and we plan to introduce it sequentially to conventional lines in the tokyo metropolitan
area

safety web portal site
to allow our employees to deepen their understanding of the human factors involved in accidents and share
information and knowhow on human error prevention jr east developed and runs a web portal site on
safety which employees have had access to since april 2007 on this site useful safety information is regularly
provided and available to our employees the information is stored on the site in a database so that employees
can search for necessary information whenever needed major content areas of the site include human factor
news the 4m4e analysis room a calendar of past accidents with lessons to be learned and the challenge

customer satisfaction surveys
we conduct annual customer satisfaction surveys in order to garner a comprehensive understanding of user
evaluation of our services that could not be adequately determined from customer feedback alone and we
quantitatively measure levels of customer satisfaction we make full use of the results of these surveys in the
measures we take

teamwork
in order to guarantee customer satisfaction we have designated service promoters operating at many front
line workplaces furthermore with a clear awareness that all efforts eventually lead to improved customer
satisfaction we hold regular customer service training sessions and symposiums that involve all group
employees from top management to front line employees we are continually working to create a corporate
culture where each employee aims to enhance customer satisfaction by targeting not only front line employees
but also those in sections that do not have direct contact with customers

turning customer comments into improvements
in order to best increase customer satisfaction with our services jr east discusses customer comments at
workshops and at head office and branch office committee meetings and directly links them to improvements
to enable us to make such improvements all parts of the group work as a single team that transcends the
organizational borders of transport facilities and marketing and thus work toward an overall improvement of
customer satisfaction



responding to customer comments
based on customer comments gathered and social conditions we take measures to improve customer
satisfaction




                                                                                             ー 67

transport services improvements
we are continuously striving to reduce rushhour congestion on major tokyo metropolitan area lines by such
measures as the addition of more cars to trains and the introduction of widerbodied cars under the march
2009 timetable revision the number of trains in operation during morning rush hours on the yokohama line
was increased and the number of trains on the nambu and shonan shinjuku lines was increased during the
nighttime in an effort to improve service during the fiscal year ended march 2010 for example the average
level of intrain congestion during morning commuting hours declined by 58 percentage points to 180 compared
to the fiscal year ended march 1988
we will continue our efforts to secure reliable transport through a reduction of transport disruptions and other
means to meet perceived needs of customers

more comfortable onboard air conditioning
jr east is working on improvements to railcar air conditioning cooling and heating to make railway travel
more comfortable on new railcars e231 and e233 series fullyautomatic airconditioners are installed on
other cars continuous efforts are being made to provide the most comfortable environments possible by having
conductors carry out frequent temperature checks thermostat changes and other detailed responses as well as
by taking other actions appropriate for the different conditions on individual railway lines

total smoking ban in tokyo metropolitan area stations and trains
for several years in line with customer requests and an increasing general public aversion to smoking jr east
has worked to eliminate passive smoke in april 2009 as well as removing all smoking areas from platforms
at major tokyo metropolitan area stations we went one step further and initiated a limited smokefree station
interior policy which was widened again in line with customer requests in october 2009 all smoking was
banned on jr east   s shinkansen and limited express trains from march 2007 and on some trains providing
through services with other companies from june 2009




                          total smoking ban covering most of the tokyo metropolitan area



general information counters
we are shifting the focus of staffed ticket gates from the verification and settlement of tickets and fares to the
provision of information and are continuing to install general information counters where customers can get
comprehensive guidance and information as of april 1 2010 these counters have been established at seven
stations

service managers
jr east is increasing the number of service managers who make rounds of stations and are in position to
assist elderly customers and those not used to traveling these service managers provide relevant and timely

relationship with society




with communities
jr east is continuing its commitment to regional communities through its station renaissance program which
revitalizes stations that serve as the cores of their communities and thereby contribute to the increased
attraction of entire areas one such initiative was the transformation of tachikawa station into a more user
friendly environment by increasing its barrierfree facilities creating the ecute tachikawa commercial space
and opening hotel mets tachikawa
on the yaesu side of tokyo station grantokyo north tower and south tower and granroof are continuing
to develop north tower ii will be completed in 2012 and granroof in 2013 on the marunouchi side of
the station work is now under way to totally restore the station building to its original form an instation
commercial zone gransta is also being developed in combination the developments will be called tokyo
station city under the concept of developing tokyo station into a complete city our goal is to create a station
that will serve as a transmission base for new cultures while also forming a spectacular gateway to the
metropolis of tokyo
we are also cooperating with local governments in the creation of new stations in line with their urban
planning and continuing with the improvement of existing station buildings in order to create free passages
based on requests from local authorities in the fiscal year ended march 2010 in coordination with
redevelopment projects in surrounding areas we opened musashikosugi station on the yokosuka line
bringing to 40 the total of stations we have established based on requests from local authorities since our
establishment in 1987 station building renewal was also continued with the construction of free passages in

dropped off and picked up by their fathers which demonstrates that our efforts in this field are leading to an
increased level of male participation in childcare we plan to continue to expand our childcare services that
meet a broad variety of needs and thus actively contribute to local communities thereby enhancing the values
of communities located along our railway lines

furthermore since the opening of a new shinaomori station for the tohoku
shinkansen is set for december 2010 we have asked people who are linked to
aomori including the governor of aomori prefecture to hold discussions on
the theme ofwhat is required for regional revitalizationwith the contents
of the discussions included in this report in the discussion we were able to
hear opinions directly and from various perspectives renewing our awareness
through both a rediscovery of the expectations of the local people for us and
our responsibility to respond to those expectations
with the concerted efforts of the entire jr east group we are committed to
our continued contributions toward the regional development of each region
