the orlen group and its
environment
letter from the president of the management
board
ladies and gentlemen dear shareholders




for the orlen group and other companies in the
petrochemical and refining industry a key success factor
is the ability to seize the opportunities arising from shifts
in the economic and market landscape to maximise profit
and further strengthen the companys financial and
competitive position looking back at this past year
we can safely say that we successfully delivered on all
these objectives our robust financial performance was
also appreciated by the market  on november 21st
2016 pkn orlen for the first time topped the list of the
most valuable companies on the warsaw stock exchange
in the years ahead we aim to further grow our business in
line with the ambitious goals we set ourselves in the
orlen group 20172021 strategy that was unveiled in
december last year

                                           wojciech jasiński
             ceo and president of the management board




the global macroeconomic and market developments had a major influence on our operations
and financial performance in 2016 the price of brent crude averaged just under usd 44 per
barrel in 2016 representing a 17 drop on 2015 and a 12year low the overall downstream


                                                  4

margin also retreated on tighter gasoline and petrochemical margins continued low oil prices
supported our financial results and created attractive upside opportunities for pkn orlen and
other oil companies that had managed to diversify their revenue sources sufficiently in advance
and could fully exploit the market conditions the last quarter of 2016 marked a watershed on
the domestic fuel market as new legislation helped to significantly curtail grey market in fuels
driving up consumption of diesel oil and enabling businesses engaged in the official trade in fuels
to fully leverage their competitive advantage

2016 lifobased ebitda adjusted for the effect of impairment losses on noncurrent assets
reached a record level of pln 94bntotal sales volumes grew 2 with a record 10 billion litres of
fuels sold last year the fullyear results were adversely impacted by maintenance shutdowns
including the downtime of the steam cracker in litvínov the czech republic

in downstream we moved forward on the major expansion projects aimed at improving efficiency
of the groups production assets in the czech republic a project to build the new pe3
polyethylene unit was launched in 2016 as one of the orlen groups mostawaited investments
which will help to solidify pkn orlens position on central europes chemical and petrochemical
markets another of our key petrochemical projects to build a metathesis unit in płock entered
the construction phase launched in early 2017 the visbreaker project is another major
downstream efficiency improvement initiative expected to increase crude distillate yields and
operational availability of the refinery last year progress was made on the construction of
polands largest ccgt plants in włocławek 463 mwe and płock 596 mwe in parallel we took
steps to make our service stations more energy selfsufficient pilot photovoltaic solar energy
projects implemented at pkn orlen facilities delivered promising results which are now being
analysed the project to deploy wind turbines at petrol stations which is expected to take our
green technology solutions to the next level was at a preliminary stage

in 2016 the orlen group maintained its position of the retail market leader in the regionour
retail chain reported 14 million transactions daily contributing to a record ebitda of pln 18bn
we also broadened our range of nonfuel products and services with around 1691 stop cafe and
stop cafe bistro outlets operating on our home markets including 1500 in poland 168 in the
czech republic and 23 in lithuania we made strategic efforts to roll out our food  beverage
and onsite convenience store formats but not only that  we now also strategically target
a strong customer orientation and unique purchasing experience planning to open 130 new
format stopcafe and oshop outlets this year

our macro environment and the persistently low oil prices in particular had a strong bearing on
the direction of our activities in upstream in 2016 total 2p reserves of our production projects
increased from 97 mmboe to around 114 mmboe at the end of 2016 last year we also carried
out further work in our licence areas in poland under a letter of intent signed with pgnig drilling
of an exploration wells began in the wielkopolska region and orlen upstream independently
launched a drilling programme in the małopolska region province our new corporate strategy
announced late last year provides for cautious continuation of upstream projects with the
purpose of increasing the output and 2p reserves

we managed to deliver our expansion plans while maintaining a stable financial position in 2016
we reduced our debt and the net debt ratio and managed to further expand the portfolio of
available funding sources during the year pkn orlen through its subsidiary orlen capital ab



                                                  5

successfully placed a eur 750m eurobond issue the largest issue of investment grade corporate
eurobonds made its debut on the catalyst markets of the warsaw stock exchange

last year we made efforts to secure reliable feedstock supply sources enhancing the security of
fuel supplies in poland we also significantly strengthened our crude oil supplier base by
extending the contract with saudi aramco for another year a new contract setting oil
transmission rates was signed with mero and we entered into a contract with jadranski naftovod
of croatia whereby crude oil will be transported to our czech refineries via the janaf pipeline
amendments were signed to contracts with rosneft and tatneft for the supply of crude oil to our
czech refineries also natural gas supplies were secured for another five years under a longterm
contract with pgnig

in the czech republic we brought pe3 our largest petrochemical unit to the construction phase
the project will increase the utilisation of the ethylene unit and facilitate stronger integration of
petrochemical and refining production at the unipetrol group as part of the process to optimise
the orlen groups asset base in the czech republic benzina and ceska rafinerska were merged
with unipetrol rpa with the latter transaction closed in early 2017 to better respond to the very
demanding and competitive market and to open up to new business challenges spolana
previously a part of anwil was incorporated into the unipetrol group through an intragroup
acquisition

the orlen lietuva group delivered very good results last year capitalising on the favourable
macroeconomic situation it worked at nearly full capacity and substantially improved efficiency
in recent years aware of how sensitive the mažeikiai refinery is to changes in the
macroeconomic landscape we focused on preparing it for leaner times

the orlen group proceeded with consolidation processes to more flexibly respond to market
challenges in 2016 we completed the sale of orlen transport the aim of the process to
dispose of noncore assets is to build pkn orlens value in the long run

throughout 2016 we worked on strengthening our innovationoriented corporate culture
initiatives in this area included the launch of innovations startups an online cooperation and
knowledge sharing platform dedicated to new technology solutions also the crowdsourcing
contest closed in 2016 to find solutions for recovery and utilisation of lowtemperature heat
attracted keen interest from innovators the world over currently we are working on projects
combining power generation and retail to improve energy selfsufficiency of our petrol stations
we are also running pilot tests of solutions based on such natural elements as bacteria absorbing
industrial odours or algea used to produce fuel biocomponents

pkn orlens strategy adopted in december 2016 is our response to the major shifts taking
place in the economic social and technological landscape we identified the strategic directions
to follow throughout the next five years and formulated detailed financial objectives for 2017 and
2018 our plans for profit and capex figures are ambitious but feasible in 2017 and 2018 pkn
orlen expects to spend an average of pln 54bn a year on investment projects of which pln
37bn in downstream pln 06bn in retail and up to pln 08bnin upstream annual lifobased
ebitda in the period is expected to average pln 88bn the orlen group enjoys a sound market
and financial standing so its strategy until 2021 does not herald any revolutionary changes but
guarantees stable growth



                                                 6

a key factor contributing to our further steady development is the dedication of our people one
of the pillars of pkn orlens strategy our staffs commitment to all their daytoday duties
determines the orlen groups market success i would like to thank them for their work my
special thanks go to members of the supervisory board for their support in everything we do to
meet our strategic objectives and build up pkn orlens strength

corporate social responsibility csr is an integral part of the orlen groups strategic
development plan in pursuing business objectives we are always guided by the principle that
value growth should be aligned with the interests of external stakeholders and rely on
sustainable and responsible use of resources the overriding objective of the orlen groups csr
efforts is to create value both for the group companies and for its stakeholders the highest
ethical social and environmental standards are not merely procedures but are part and parcel of
the groups daytoday operationswith a view to building lasting and positive relations with all of
our stakeholders this year again we have prepared an integrated report which is our third
annual report based on the integrated reporting standards combining financial data with
a description of nonfinancial aspects of our business the report has been prepared in

dialogue to ensure the highest quality of relations with the stakeholders the methods and
frequency of communication are tailored to the characteristics and current expectations of each
stakeholder group

as part of our work on this integrated report we again reviewed the orlen groups stakeholder
map our analysis showed that the stakeholder base has been rather stable for many years
internal consultations and the survey allowed us to identify those orlen group stakeholders who
at the next stage of the map review were classified as key or important stakeholders
representatives of various areas of the orlen groups business were involved in the review as
a result of the review a new stakeholder group was added  innovators and startups the
following have been identified as key stakeholders employees shareholders customers and the

macroeconomic factors
oil companies operate in the sector of commodities 
homogeneous products such as crude oil fuels and
petrochemical products manufactured and sold by
numerous producers worldwide
a company supplying commodities is easily replaceable by another supplier offering the same
commodity for a lower price this fact significantly constrains the suppliers ability to control
prices consequently both suppliers and buyers of commodities make transactions at prices
driven by the supply and demand interaction of the market

the key external decision drivers for oil companies with a bearing on their production growth
and financial performance are

      quoted crude oil prices usd
      quoted prices of fuels usd and petrochemical products usd and eur
      usd and eur exchange rates

price path projections take into account factors that reflect changes in both supply and demand

      the economic growth rate in oecd countries where oil demand has been declining since
      2005 and in nonoecd countries where peak demand is yet to be seen the changes in
      demand for crude oil and petroleum products are driven to a large extent by china and
      india
      growth of global crude output in opec and nonopec countries
      oecd oil inventories and oil reserves in countries opec 
      geopolitical risks
      changes in regulations on greenhouse gas emissions by energy producers and transport
      operators

the frequency and status of information about these factors vary prices and the usd exchange
rate ie hard data change continuously and are available in real time the economic growth
rate as measured by the gdp is an estimate published quarterly and subject to frequent
corrections in contrast information about actual and potential supply disruptions caused by
geopolitical developments emerges unexpectedly and leads to instant price changes the effect
of price changes on supply and demand is significantly delayed if lower or higher prices continue
for several quarters

since the time when the oil market was affected by an oversupply which had gone unnoticed for
a time attention has been paid to the production structure among nonopec countries the
united states and canada are characterised by a very short cycle of unconventional onshore oil
production a large number of oil producers and quick adjustments to production volumes in
response to oil price changes the strong interaction between the level of output from
unconventional fields and oil price changes is attributable to the extremely short production
cycle the average time necessary to launch unconventional oil production is only 90 days vs 35
years needed for the development of a shallow water oil deposit or 8 years for deepwater
offshore oil production this factor has also contributed to the fastgrowing oil supply in nonopec


                                                 44

countries

among the opec countries saudi arabia stands out due to its immediately available production
reserves and the control it has over the oil production policy of the cartel and the group of five
countries saudi arabia kuwait iraq iran and united arab emirates given its strong potential to
produce oil at low cost

another important factor now in focus are exploration and production costs these costs play
a major role in longterm oil price projections supply and demand balance the price of a barrel
of oil may not be lower than the cost to produce one barrel of oil from the most expensive
reserve required to meet effective demand as oil reserves are depleting it will become
necessary to drill down to more challenging resources and the resulting higher costs of
production will lead to rising oil prices

we have decided not to include financial institutions in the list of factors affecting the
macroeconomic environment of oil companies even though the value of futures contracts they
execute is many times higher than the value of physical market transactions in our view
supported by numerous studies transactions made by financial institutions increase oil price
susceptibility to changes but do not affect price change trends in both speculative and
investment transactions financial institutions act on the basis of the same fundamental factors
as those taken into account by the participants in the physical markets including oil companies

source data according to international energy agency iea

in 2016 oil demand in the world increased by 12 million bbld and it is predicted that this
average rate of growth will be maintained until 2021 the supply increased by only 03 million
bbld teh disproportion between the growth of supply and demand will contribute to the
depletion of the global oil supply beginning in 2018

              b potential directions of changes in crude oil prices

in the mediumterm perspective until 2020 the majority of publicly available analyses and
forecasts assume an increase in crude oil prices here are the main aspects which will be
influencing prices in the next two years

       opecs production policy  the opec agreement of november 2016 should lead to a cut in
       crude oil production in q1 and q2 2017 and mitigate the risk of prices declining in the next
       two or three quarters the effects of the agreement have already been reflected in oil
       prices although the market is turning this to its advantage with lowerthanplanned cuts in
       crude oil production
       the reaction of producers in the usa to higher crude oil prices  the predicted higher oil
       prices may stimulate production in the usa and a higher supply of oil will reach the market
       after two or three quarters following the price increase potentially contributing to
       a decrease in prices producers who find it profitable to produce oil when the price is higher
       will enter the market if the price of crude oil decreases more strongly the rate of increase
       of production in the usa will slow down accordingly the potential reaction will be delayed
       by several quarters due to fact that producers wil secure themselves against the risk of oil
       prices going down
       production in libya and nigeria  one of the risk factors for crude oil prices in 2017 is the
       production in libya and nigeria two of the opec countries excluded from the agreed


                                                          47

       production cuts both countries have a production potential that may be increased or
       further decreased by several hundred thousand barrels a day as a result of prevention or
       escalation of domestic armed conflict
       fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar  the exchange rate of the us currency is
       not without influence on the prospects for oil prices the us dollar appreciated strongly
       after the election of donald trump as the us president against the euro and against the
       currencies of emerging economies the dollars appreciation influences the increases of oil
       and fuel prices in those countries markets
       geopolitics  potential escalation of armed conflict in the middle east and africa which may
       have an impact on supply limitations and consequently an increase in the crude oil price

the above mentioned factors imply a slow rise in oil prices from quarter to quarter from about
usd 49bbl in q4 2016 to around usd 60bbl in the fourth quarter of 2018 ihs markit

downstream  sale and production

a significant increase in margins in 2015 and their stabilisation in 2016 were supported by lower
oil prices in the preceding years and by growing demand for products of crude oil throughput

despite the predicted decline of the concerns downstream margin in comparison to high

refining margins in europe usdbbl




source ihs markit

in the short and mediumterm perspective refinery margins in europe will be shaped by
competitive pressure the main factors influencing margins are the following the advantage of
us and middle eastern refineries due to low energy cost vs relatively high energy costs in
europe modernisation of european refineries contributing to the extension of processing as well
as the growing competitiveness of exports from the middle east supplying fuel not only to asia
but now also to europe

in the longerterm perspective the refinery margins will depend on the demand for products
made from processed crude oil the reasons for the changes in those margins should be sought
in the more extensive structural changes in the market for fuel diesel oil and petrochemical
products while stagnation or a slight decrease in demand for petroleum products in the
transport sector are expected major analytical institutions predict an increase in the significance
of petrochemicals

the increase in the demand for gasoline in europe in the years 20152016 was driven mainly by


                                                 49

decreasing crude oil prices  lower fuel prices translate into an increase in their consumption in
the mediumterm the forecasts related to the demand for refinery products assume stabilisation
due to the unchanging demand for gasoline the flat and uncertain demand for diesel oil and the
growing demand for jet fuel and petrochemical products

the stabilisation of demand for gasoline results mainly from efforts to reduce the emission
intensity of the european economies and the increased use of biofuels

in the context of demand for diesel oil a series of new factors emerged in the fuel market in
2016 making it less likely to grow in the coming years these factors include

      the scandal related to the measurements of harmful substances in diesel engines of
      german manufacturers
      research currently in progress carried out by eu countries concerning emissions of
      harmful substances emitted by diesel engines which may have a significant impact on the
      sales of dieselfuelled cars potentially leading to a decrease in diesel oil consumption
      legislative work currently in progress in the netherlands and in norway related to a ban on
      the sale of petrol and dieselfuelled cars by 2025
      the growing popularity of alternative fuels the withdrawal of japanese manufacturers from
      the production of economical diesel engines to develop engines using alternative fuels
      electricity natural gas

one needs to bear in mind however that the fuel market in europe has one of the lowest growth
prospects in the world the total global consumption of diesel and petrol is going to grow at
a relatively low rate of 03 annually however the international increase in consumption is to
a large extent polarised  the european and north american markets remain stable while real
growth takes place in emerging markets

in the short and mediumterm perspective electric cars will not have a significant impact on the
fuel market  in europe electric cars will have accounted for only 4 of the car fleet by 2030
while traditional internal combustion engines will account for over 60 the number of electric
cars is going to grow from 09 million in 2015 to 125 million in 2030 hybrid cars may have

downstream  power industry

according to the main scenario new policies of the world energy outlook 2016 report created
by the international energy agency global demand for electricity will grow at a rate of 2 per
year and will increase by twothirds by 2040 the world economy will keep growing during this
period at a rate of 34 per year these trends represent a substantive change compared with
the period of 19902014 in which both parameters grew at an almost identical pace in todays


                                               52

conditions the cheapest and also the most common source of electricity generation in the world
is coal however in the long run it will be replaced by natural gas hydropower and renewable
energy sources this change will be dictated by the necessity of decarbonisation of industry and
fuel prices in the coming decades significant changes will occur to the sources of power
generation between 2008 and 2014 the share of wind energy increased by 4 percentage points
and solar energy by 3 percentage points by 2040 the share of these sources in electricity
generation is expected to triple coal power will continue its structural decline whereas gas
power will grow gradually until 2030 after which it will begin to slightly reduce its share in the
global energy mix

in the power engineering area of the downstream segment of the orlen group the key market
is poland  it provides a favourable growth outlook due to lower energy consumption compared to
most european countries energy consumption per capita in poland is much lower than the eu
average and amounted to approx 43 mwhperson in 2016 vs the eu average of 55
mwhperson in the years 20102016 energy demand grew at an average rate of around 15
annually until 2020 the rate of growth is expected to be at a level of around 18 cagr by
cera and this increase will be above all correlated with the countrys economic development

a significant part of the existing generation capacities in poland require modernization or
replacement due to their age and high emission intensity it is estimated that in the absence of
appropriate economic signals around 10 gw of generation capacities will have been
decommissioned by 2025 which is the main reason why the power engineering segment is being
developed within the orlen group and why two power units are being erected with a total
capacity of over 1 gw

ii market trends in the retail sector
almost the whole of 2016 was a period of continuously low fuel prices at the stations which
limited the attractiveness of the economic networks premium stations began to acquire more
recognitionfrom customers customers were more eager to buy premium fuel and paid more
attention to available nonfuel products and the gastronomic menu in 2016 work related to new
concepts of shops in the stations was implemented the operators of fuel stations established
a cooperation with large gastronomic networks and began to work on their own formats and
brands large oil companies focused on the launch of new solutions and functionalities based on
new technologies tools and it systems mainly in the area of new forms of payment ordering
communicating with customers and improving the operational management of the network

on the polish market the effects of the legislative amendments aimed at limiting the socalled
shadow economy were evident to a great extent they had an influence on the level of
wholesale however in the retail segment they resulted in an increase in the number of
independent fuel stations operating in the market

in the first half of 2016 lukoil which has a network of 230 stations in poland lithuania and
latvia decided to withdraw from the market and sell its retail assets to an austrian company
amic energy management in recent years lukoil has sold its stations in ukraine hungary
slovakia the czech republic and estonia austrian investor plan to develop their retail business
in the markets of central and eastern europe in the upcoming years

in 2016 there was another year of growth in the number of fuel stations operating in the polish
market  nearly 200 new facilities were launched more than 75 of these are independently
operated stations
the number of petrol stations in the networks of foreign concerns remained at a level similar to
2015 in 2017 the rebranding process of statoil stations acquired several years ago by the
canadian company alimentation couchetard will begin all of the stations are to operate under
the circlek brand

on the czech market the number of fuel stations in 2016 remained at the same level as the
previous year however the structure of the market has changed a portion of the small non
public stations transformed into generally available facilities thereby increasing competition in
the marketplace an important change in the retail fuel market in the czech republic was that
most networks introduced refined fuels which replaced standard fuels

on the german market there were no major structural changes the foregoing leaders aral and
shell maintained their leading position despite a decrease in the number of stations over the last
few years in their networks the biggest premium station networks in the german market also
started to operate in the economy segment this increased market competition the main
competitors of the star network managed by orlen deutschland invested significant resources
to modernize their stations thus significantly improving their visualization and technical standard
and expanding their range of nonfuel products today more and more economy segment
stations exceed the standard of premium stations

on the lithuanian market the leading position was maintained by lukoil which was acquired in
the first quarter of 2016 by amic energy management from austria however over the next few
years these stations will operate under the current brand


                                                 54

in lithuania the company couchetard began to introduce its own brand circlek in statoil
stations acquired in 2012 all networks operating in the lithuanian market focused on the
development of gastronomy in 2016 the level of retail prices on the lithuanian market was
strongly influenced by an increase in activity on the wholesale market of the finnish concern

iii market trends in the upstream sector
according to the world energy outlook 2016 by the international energy agency iea the
energy intensity of the polish economy in 2015 decreased by 18 as a result of a further
improvement in energy efficiency and from the increased use of cleaner energy sources
including mainly renewable sources which are going to record their fastest increase yet until
2040

the increase in global demand for primary energy by about 30 by 2040 in the international
energy agencys iea main scenario new policies scenario means that the use of all fuels will
grow

among fossil fuels natural gas will have recorded the biggest increase in consumption by 2040
by nearly 50 while the consumption of crude oil will increase by around 12 by 2040

as the downward trend with regard to energy demand in oecd countries continues to be
observed energy consumption is going to move towards regions where earnings are growing
where access to energy sources is more extensive and where urban development is booming
india southeast asia china as well as parts of africa latin america and the middle east
according to the ieas main scenario energy demand in oecd countries in the years 20142040
is going to decrease by 01 on average each year while the economies of nonoecd countries
will generate an increase in energy consumption by 16 annually

in the period 20152016 due to the decreasing prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as to
limited access to financing the vast majority of exploration and production companies worldwide
decided to limit the scope of the work carried out and to focus their activity on projects at an
advanced stage of development of deposits as well as on the exploration projects with the
brightest prospects

in the crude oil supply area a return to active market management by opec is predicted the
first symptom of which was the formal meeting of opec countries in november 2016 adecision
was made to reduce crude oil production in the first half of 2017 and that producers from outside
opec would join the agreement including russia in total 24 leading international crude oil
producers undertook to reduce the oil supply by 18 mmboed which was necessary according to
opec estimates to balance out the oil market which has been struggling with oversupply

the improvement in the financial standing of companies from the upstream industry was also
accompanied by more intense activity on the ma market which was particularly noticeable in
the usa where the consolidation of license areas took place with particular rapidity

according to the basic scenario of the international energy agency natural gas consumption is
going to grow until 2040 virtually in each of the leading consumer countries apart from japan
and russia china will account for the biggest increase in demand for natural gas in the ieas
basic scenario until 2040 with cagr at the level of 46 but india is going to be the country
with the highest growth rate at an average annual level of 52 the usa will continue to be the
largest consumer of natural gas in the world with natural gas consumption at a level of
840 billion m3 in 2040 at the same time natural gas consumption in china will amount to
605 billion m3 and in india it will have reached 189 billion m3 in the middle east which is the
second largest area for natural gas consumption growth the figure will be around 804 billion m3

where the new processing capacities amounted to nearly 130 billion m3 annually has lead to
uncertainty as to when demand and supply on the gas market will reach an equilibrium
according to the ieas forecasts the usa and australia will account for 23 of the total gas
production increase until 2020 but between the start of the 20202030 decade and 2040
significant increases in the gas supply will be generated by a larger group of producers with east
africa and argentina becoming more important players in the market

            1 biofuels

directive 200928ec of the european parliament and of the council of april 23rd 2009 on the
promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently
repealing directives 200177ec and 200330ec requires the member states to ensure a 10
share of renewable energy in the overall energy consumption of the transport sector by 2020
the directive was implemented into polish law by the act on biocomponents and liquid biofuels
of august 25th 2006 subsequently amended the act imposes the requirement for domestic
refineries and fuel importers to achieve the national indicative target ie ensure the required
minimum share of renewable fuels biocomponents in the total volume of liquid fuels

in 2016 pkn orlen took part in consultations of the draft biofuel regulations the company
proposed

1 reduction of the nit

2 introduction of a mandatory requirement to blend biocomponents into liquid fuels

3 adoption of measures preventing fraud related to the nit requirement in poland

based on the act amending the energy law and certain other acts of november 30th 2016 the
nit was reduced relative to the levels defined in the 2013 regulation of the polish council of
ministers from 78 to 71 in 2017 and from 85 to 75 in 2018 the fact that the nit


                                                59

reduction factor in 2017 will be 082 if the share of biocomponents sourced from domestic
producction is 70 means that the actual nit for pkn orlen in 2017 5822 will be the lowest
since 2012 in addition the act amending the energy law and certain other acts of july 22nd
2016 introduced a requirement that as of 2017 at least 50 of the nit was to be achieved by
blending biocomponents into liquid petroleum fuels mandatory blending at the same time the
act expanded the definition of an entity obligated to achieve the nit so that it covers all entities
importing liquid fuels to poland regardless of whether they operate on the basis of a relevant
licence or not

            2 retail sales tax

the act on retail sales tax of july 6th 2016 which came into force on september 1st 2016
introduced a tax on retail sales to consumers the tax base is the amount of net revenue from
retail sales in excess of the taxexempt amount pln 17m per month the tax rates are 08 of
the tax base up to pln 170m and 14 of the excess over pln 170m the costs for pkn orlen
were estimated at pln 185m per month or approximately pln 222m annually the estimate did
not account for the exclusion of retail sales to businesses due to an inability to extract such
data

in connection with the european commissions decision of september 19th 2016 which includes
the requirement to suspend any illegal state aid until the commission decides on the
compatibility of the aid with the internal market on october 18th 2016 the minister of finance
and development issued a regulation on refraining from the collection of the retail sales tax the
regulation entered into force on october 19th 2016 the retail sales tax will not be collected on
revenue earned from september 1st 2016 to december 31st 2016 then the act amending the
act on retail sales tax of november 15th 2016 introduced a provision whereby the act on retail
sales tax would apply to revenue from retail sales generated as of january 1st 2018

            3 combating the grey market

in 2016 pkn orlen took part in public consultations of draft amendments to tax and
administrative regulations aimed at combating the grey market in liquid fuels in particular vat
fraud and avoidance of administrative obligations related to the supply of liquid fuels on the
market

the act amending the value added tax act and certain other acts the fuel package of july 7th
2016 and the act amending the energy law and certain other acts the energy package of july
22nd 2016 introduced a number of fundamental changes to the regulation of the liquid fuel
market in poland including new rules for accounting for vat on imports of liquid fuels to poland
and a close link between tax requirements and licence requirements in poland its provisions
which will be fully implemented in 2017 should lead to a determination of the actual number of
entities operating in the market thereby creating an inventory of liquid fuels infrastructure and
sustainably minimising the illegal supply of liquid fuels on the market

            4 gas market liberalisation

throughout 2016 pkn orlen continued public dialogue as part of the process of gas market
liberalisation in poland concerning waiver of the requirement to obtain president of the energy
regulatory offices approval of tariffs for gas sold to business customers and households the act


                                                 60

amending the energy law and certain other acts of november 30th 2016 provides for
a timetable for the deregulation of gas prices in poland according to which the liberalisation of
gas prices for industrial consumers is to take effect on october 1st 2017 and for households  on
january 1st 2024

            5 energy efficiency

to effectively fulfil its strategic objectives pkn orlen strives to improve energy efficiency which
is essential for an energyefficient economic model with this approach the company actively
participated in the legislative work for a new law on energy efficiency which entered into force
on october 1st 2016 the energy audit mechanism put in place at pkn orlen will improve the
companys financial performance by optimising energy consumption while contributing to
a reduction in the environmental impact of its activities the company is optimistic about the
possibility of reducing the costs of its electricity and natural gas purchases based on completed
efficiency improvement projects on assets covered by the co2 emissions trading system and of
having heat and natural gas classified as a form of final energy with savings of this energy
achieved through efficiency improvement projects to be applied towards the fulfilment of an
efficiencyrelated obligation this would enable the company to fulfil the obligation to achieve
annual savings of final energy equal to 15 of the annual energy sales to end users and to
reduce the cost of purchasing natural gas

            6 energy certificates

after a threeyear investigation process the european commission issued a decision approving
the certificatebased support system for highefficiency cogeneration the european commission
found the national support system to be in line with eu regulations on state aid declaring that it
complies with the goals of the eu climate and energy policy and contributes to more efficient
energy production the scheme is planned to be implemented until 2018 the decision confirms
that the support obtained by pkn orlen in previous years in connection with electricity
generation by its chp plant in płock was compatible with eu state aid rules and provides grounds
for obtaining further support for cogeneration installations

            7 energyintensive companies

in 2016 the european commission decided that no objections would be raised against the
measure reducing resrelated burdens for energyintensive undertakings recognising its
compatibility with the internal market under article 107 paragraph 3 letter c of the treaty on
the functioning of the european union the reduction of the costs of the support system for
renewable energy sources and excise duty on electricity will contribute to the higher
competitiveness of the companys products

social environment
from its inception pkn orlen has engaged in external
initiatives promoting sustainable development




in december 2003 pkn orlen joined global compact an initiative proposed by united nations
secretary general kofi annan we declared that we would work to advance the organisations
principles in the areas of human rights labour standards environment and anticorruption
efforts

in 2016 the orlen group took steps to implement the united nationssustainable development
goals at its companies and in the broader energy sector the sustainable development goals
launched by the un in 2015 build on the millennium development goals the 17 goals and
169 targets cover a spectrum of problems to be solved with significant support from socially
responsible businesses

another project that we participate in is responsible care this global initiative brings together
chemical manufacturing companies to improve their health safety and environment performance
the so called hse triad as well as to share information about their activities pkn orlen has
participated in responsible care since 1997 when the programme was adopted by the
companys legal predecessor later anwil inowrocławskie kopalnie soli solino and basell orlen
polyolefins of the orlen group joined in committing themselves to reducing their
environmental footprint and improving safety and health conditions for their employees and local


                                               72

communities in 2007 pkn orlen signed the declaration of support for the responsible care
global charter this initiative of the international council of chemical associations icca is
a form of voluntary selfregulation of the chemical industry aiming to foster environmental
protection and the health and safety of people all over the world it also defines ways of
responding to challenges related to sustainable development and proper management of
chemicals while calling for increased transparency in the chemical industry the responsible
care global charter was revised in 2015 the new version focuses on the role and responsibility
of global chemical manufacturers and their part in the development of responsible care

given the global and consumer trends csr strategies must not only respond to the current
challenges but also anticipate them one such proactive initiative was the signing of the
declaration on sustainable development in the energy sector by energy companies pkn orlen
adopted the declaration in 2010 the signatories acknowledge that the joint efforts should
focus on following and promoting the concept of sustainable development such initiatives by
energy companies help to create shared value and contribute to solving important social
problems

another milestone event was pkn orlens signing of the declaration of polish business for
sustainable development in 2014 by doing so the company joined the group of
companies which support the vision of sustainable development of polish business until 2050
the document draws on the international initiative of the world business council for sustainable
development the project brings together polish businesses to deliver sustainable development
and defines the key challenges and priorities in which enterprises are expected to support social
and economic changes since 2015 pkn orlen and orlen eco have been active members of
the sustainable development committee at the polish chamber of the chemical industry during
the 2015 polish chemical industry congress pkn orlen signed the declaration of support for
the sustainable development concept in chemical industry in the document the signatories
wrote awareness of the role the chemical industry plays in modern economies and the effect it
has on the development of other industries we want to ensure that our actions and initiatives
actively support the delivery of sustainable development

our report
our approach to reporting
we present the orlen groups annual report prepared as an integrated report this document
is our third integrated report showing interactions and interrelations between the financial and
nonfinancial aspects of the orlen groups operations as such this report provides
a comprehensive and coherent overview of the groups activities business model strategy
value creation process and financial performance from the point of view of our key stakeholders
to successfully achieve this objective we have structured the layout and content of the
document based on the international integrated reporting council iirc and global reporting
initiative gri guidelines the report also reflects the latest directions in the eu legislation on
disclosure of nonfinancial and diversity information

experience in reporting
reporting is a fixed and important part in the process of communicating information on the
orlen groups activities communication and dialogue with the environment play a vital role in
the orlen groups csr strategy for 20152017 reports are issued on an annual basis and are
continuously evolving to reflect changes within the orlen group and in its environment

until 2014 we published annual reports and csr reports separately since its inception pkn
orlen has published 14 annual reports and 10 corporate social responsibility csr reports
since 2008 we have produced our csr reports in line with the global reporting initiative
standards until 2013 ecology and environmental reports were issued as separate publications

in august 2015 pkn orlen published its first integrated report covering 2014




why integrate
integration is a tenet of our approach to reporting but it also underlies certain efforts made by
the orlen group to understand and meet the expectations of our stakeholders

      integration through our business segments
      integration means caring about the environment in the course of daytoday production
      logistics and distribution processes
      integration means developing all initiatives which help our employees maintain a healthy
      worklife balance
      integration means getting employees customers suppliers and local communities involved
      in building a strong market position and finding innovative solutions

the integrated report which has superseded the annual and crs reports published every year


                                                 77

presents interactions and interrelations between the financial and nonfinancial aspects of the
orlen groups activities it reflects global standards and trends in corporate reporting promoted
by organisations such as the international integrated reporting council iirc its guidelines
published in 2011 encourage firms to abandon performance reporting based strictly on their
organisational structure in favour of a more dynamic and multidimensional approach to
communication with stakeholders integrated reporting is a way of communicating and an
organisations communication tool which demonstrates how the organisations strategy
corporate governance and performance in the context of its environment allow it to create value
in various time horizons

integrated thinking leads to integrated decisionmaking and actions that consider the creation of
value over the short medium and long term iirc framework

our reports new formula followed as a natural next step in adapting our reporting to market
tendencies and stakeholders expectations permitting the stakeholders to better understand the
business model strategies and risks and to better identify business opportunities

how we prepared the report
one of the cornerstones of our csr strategy is the objective of being perceived as a csr leader
by our stakeholders to that end we have committed to implementing a number of initiatives
and measures including the adoption of integrated reporting this report is the third such
publication but the second one to cover the entire orlen group and it is another step towards
improving the quality of our reporting

integrated reporting is a new method for communicating our business model preparation of an
integrated report includes performing analyses and collecting information which is of key
relevance to the orlen group and its stakeholders as a result a comprehensive integrated
report is compiled which among other things provides information on how the business
strategy pursued by the group and its risk management system translate into the companys
value creation over time taking into account the companys environmental impact this
integrated report presents the activities of the orlen group in 2016 shows results and effects
of its operations and the key aspects of the groups financial and nonfinancial performance vital
to value creation

previous reports has been corrected furthermore this integrated report has been externally
assured by bureau veritas a reputable audit firm

significant changes in the organisations size structure
ownership and supply chain during the reporting
period
the changes made in the orlen groups structure were in pursuance of the strategy to focus on
core business and allocate the released capital to development of the business areas that offer
the greatest growth potential

in the reporting period a number of material changes were made affecting the size structure



                                                78

and ownership of the orlen group including




the organisational efforts undertaken in 2016 involved further work on the consolidation of
unipetrol group companies starting from 2017 polymer institute brno benzina unipetrol

in 2016 unipetrol rpa a member of the unipetrol group executed an agreement to acquire all
shares in spolana a former subsidiary of anwil the acquisition will enable the unipetrol group to

reconstruction of the ethylene production plant in litvinov after an accident which occurred in
august 2015 and the emergency shutdown of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at the kralupy
refinery operated by the unipetrol group made it necessary to optimise production processes
coordinate product flows within the orlen group and purchase finished and semifinished
products to mitigate the effect of the shutdown

russian oil with some volumes supplied from saudi arabia and kazakhstan



definition of reporting aspects
we comply with the international financial reporting standards ifrs in our financial reporting
and follow the global reporting initiative g4 guidelines for nonfinancial reporting in our work
on the integrated report we applied the guidelines of the international integrated reporting
council both the gri and iirc guidelines focus on the selection of the key reporting aspects that
are most relevant to a companys operations its impacts and stakeholder expectations at
a given moment

the global reporting initiative offers an international csr and sustainability reporting standard
for enterprises it provides a consistent framework for reporting on sustainability aspects which
is applied worldwide the guidelines set the standards and define indicators which may be used
by corporations to measure and report their economic environmental and social performance in
2013 the gri published its most recent and comprehensive csr reporting guidelines  the g4
which extended the scope of csr reporting in the area of stakeholders engagement in the
reporting process and placed a greater emphasis on the role of the value chain and selection of
the most relevant information to be included in the report in 2014 pkn orlen published its
corporate social responsibility report 2013 ten years of csr reporting the companys first

                                                 80

set forth in the directive were implemented into polish law under the accountancy act of
december 15th 2016 as of january 1st 2017 large public interest entities in poland are obliged
to prepare statements on environmental matters social and employeerelated aspects respect
for human rights anticorruption and bribery issues the new eu law is designed to enhance the
transparency relevance and comparability of nonfinancial disclosures the matters addressed in
the directive are also covered in the pkn orlen sas core values and standards of conduct

the process of defining relevant reporting aspects at the orlen group included the following
activities

     analysis of perception studies media coverage of the orlen group and internal analyses

     orlen groups operations

     employees of pkn orlen and of the orlen group companies representing various
     business areas counterparties trading partners and representatives of the firms

opinions through surveys internal stakeholders that is orlen group employees viewed all
economic social and environmental aspects as highly relevant external stakeholders considered
the following three aspects macroeconomic impacts professional development and employee
relations and diversity and equal opportunities as being of moderate relevance and the other
aspects as important

importantly orlen groups excellent performance went hand in hand with key investments

shareholder communication in accordance with the adopted strategy shareholders were paid
a higher dividend than a year before all stakeholder groups received access to exhaustive
information about both the financial and nonfinancial aspects of the companys operations in the

a year ago when i attempted to identify the challenges for the coming 12 months i focused
mainly on the need to revise the strategic assumptions of the company against the backdrop of
a dynamically changing business environment today we know that the new strategy was well
received by both the market and the shareholders i am certain that combined with the
companys excellent organisation and strong financial footing it forms a solid foundation for

the methodology adopted by the audit control and corporate risk management office allows us
to identify risk on the basis of one common model and link them with business processes and
strategic objectives

the enterprise risk management erm system is one of the tools facilitating the effectiveness of
the realization of strategic and operational goals it ensures comprehensive identification of risk
and control mechanisms and its assessment in a project process and at whole organisation
levels pkn orlen is the first polish corporation with the exception of the financial industry
which has implemented a complex corporate risk management system and the applied solutions
are in line with the best practices in this area

assessment of risk in a breakdown by business area is carried out at least once every year as
part of the process of selfevaluation and its purpose is to provide an update of the risks which
are most significant for the organisation the process risk and control owners are responsible for
its performance the most significant element of the corporate risk management methodology


                                                120

applied involves the comparison of two risk assessments gross risk assessment and net risk
assessment gross assessment looks at the value of risk in the absence of control mechanisms
and preventive measures while net assessment is the value of estimated risk taking into account
the efficacy of the control mechanisms and preventive measures for the specific risks that are in
place this approach makes it possible to manage identified threats better as well as to confirm
whether the strategies adopted to minimize them are accurate as a result of periodic
assessment plans of corrective actions are defined for the individual risks and controls which
mainly aim to achieve an acceptable risk level each risk assessment and control mechanism
testing process is completed with a report on the most significant risks and planned method of
their limitation which is submitted to the management board members and the supervisory
board audit committee

in 2016 the process of risk selfassessment and control mechanism testing was carried out in
pln orlen sa with the presence of the managerial staff which allowed for updating the
assessment of 527 risks by testing 1251 control mechanisms in 83 business processes

in 2016 two more key companies of the orlen group were covered by the erm system anwil
orlen deutschland orlen lietuva and unipetrol as

as part of the implemented corporate risk model all of the identified risks are classified on the
basis of the following categories

      i strategic risks  risks directly connected with the strategic goals referring to specific
      actions and to the degree of their performance aka kpis for the purposes of detailed
      identification of strategic risks partial strategies are created for the individual fields
      attributed to the appropriate owners who perform quarterly risk assessments

      ii project risks  understood as uncertain events or circumstances which may have
      a negative impact on at least one project goal if they occur they are assessed on
      a systematic basis as implementation of the projects progresses and in any case at least
      once a year as part of the selfassessment process

      iii processoperational risks  risks identified within the existing business processes
      related directly to their key goals making it possible to manage processes efficiently
      these risks are assessed annually as part of the selfassessment process by the business
      areas the main intention of which is to confirm the effectiveness of the control
      mechanisms used to keep the risk at the defined level

opportunities
the vision for the growth of the orlen group fits well
with global trends in the use of energy sources eg
use of crude oil alternative fuels energy storage
technological progress eg smart everything internet
of everything advanced robotics 3d printing and
social shifts eg changing social behaviours
urbanisation demographics which are bound to
create new consumer behaviours and expectations




global changes have been gathering pace in recent years and will have a growing yet
unpredictable impact on the world around us to respond to those processes the orlen group
will consistently adapt its business model across all of its sectors

1 integrated assets and strong market position of the
downstream sector
with integrated assets in three central european countries 30 million tonnes of various crude oil
types processed every year and a portfolio of over 50 refined and petrochemical products sold to


                                               124

more than 80 countries across the globe the orlen group is perfectly placed to further expand
its downstream business

key activities to be undertaken in the downstream sector over the period covered by the
20172021 strategy will be aimed at ensuring the security of feedstock supplies further
improvements in operational excellence and a strengthening of the groups market position

in the area of feedstock supply security the orlen group will seek to diversify its oil supply
sources and secure natural gas supplies it will at the same time strive for greater integration
more flexibility in how it responds to market and regulatory challenges and increased yield of
highmargin products at its refineries in poland the czech republic and lithuania the growth of
its share in the home markets eg through an attractive product portfolio and the expansion of
the infrastructure which facilitates contact with customers have been identified as the two pillars
that will support the reinforcement of the group in its market position

2 development of the product and service range and
high customer satisfaction in the retail sector
the retail sector comprises more than 2700 service stations making up the largest retail chain
in central europe they handle 14 million transactions daily in poland alone they sell 66 billion
litres of fuel every year with substantial volumes bought by customers actively participating in
the vitay loyalty scheme and fleet customers

the key growth drivers in the retail sector are the modern service station network unique
procurement experience and further operational excellence improvement

pkn orlen will develop its network of codo and dofo stations nearly 200 new sites by 2021
plans to introduce quality fuels and preparations are underway to sell alternative fuels the
orlen group is a regional pioneer in the installation of electric car quick charging points in
cooperation with tesla a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles by undertaking a number of
initiatives the retail sector will transform to provide customers with a unique purchasing
experience it plans to launch new products and services leveraging its competitive advantages
and business experience a large and dense network of service stations and a sizeable customer
base in the coming years pkn orlen intends to open upgraded stop cafe 20 catering outlets
the concept was well received by customers and the extended product range promises a higher
nonfuel margin tailored offers based on big data and the development of a loyalty scheme
will help to increase customer satisfaction as part of its optimisation efforts the orlen group
will implement a number of initiatives to cut costs and boost revenue eg customer satisfaction
surveys optimisation of land assets optimisation of the network cost more service stations with
premium fuels another element of key importance to the sector is the implementation of
projects to support sales as they are necessary to start many significant initiatives

3 cautious continuation strategy in the upstream
sector
growth in the upstream sector over the last four years helped to build a solid asset portfolio in
20142016 pkn orlen took a number of steps to increase its production potential in poland
acquisition of two licences from deutsche erdoel ag entering into a joint operating agreement



                                                 125

with pgnig securing new licences from the ministry of the environment and the acquisition of fx
energy and canada acquisition of the first canadian subsidiary trioil resources followed by
two other transactions the purchase of birchill exploration and kicking horse energy the
orlen group has a strong asset base for value creation production of 5 million boe in 2016 2p
reserves of 114 million boe and assets to effectively increase production and steadily improve
cost efficiency

under the current 20172021 strategy the orlen group will build its value in the upstream
sector based on cautious continuation of the current efforts ie increasing production in poland
and canada and further improvements in operational excellence the plans include growing
production volumes and 2p reserves and a focus on the most profitable projects challenges
posed by the prevailing low hydrocarbon prices are believed to be temporary and in the medium
term the prices are expected to show an upward trend again the orlen group will closely watch
and flexibly respond to developments in the oil and gas markets the consistent improvement in
key performance indicators eg better well economics optimised scope of work and synergies
within the sector in poland and canada eg transfer of knowhow from canada one of the most
technologically advanced oil and gas markets are key elements for the operational excellence
improvement in the upstream sector

4 innovations that create value
the orlen groups innovation management model brings together all aspects of the groups
strategy and the innovations themselves are understood to mean much more than just the
development and implementation of new products special attention is paid to product process
and marketing innovations projects related to the current value chain are given key priority the
orlen group offers its employees and innovators certain forms of support which are not readily
available elsewhere and can tip the scales for the commercial success of innovative projects 
from specialist laboratories up to a vast retail network because of the role of intellectual capital
in the modern economy strong focus is placed on the development of staff competencies the
orlen group consistently builds a team of experts especially in the area of rd and develops
a system to support leaders

the innovation strategy relies on external and internal innovations supported by an advanced
management model to stimulate external innovation the orlen group carries out projects
facilitating cooperation as part of an external ecosystem of innovations successful
implementation of stateoftheart commercial solutions and the use of special tools for project
implementation accelerator crowdsourcing innovation lab internal innovations are efforts to
streamline technological and organisational processes develop the portfolio of rd projects and

the group has performed an initial analysis of the impact of the expected credit loss model
for credit risk assessment for undue receivables on 31 december 2016 and for historical data
based on the results of the analysis group does not expect that the new standard will have
a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements


ifrs 15  revenue from contracts with customers


group started the assessment process of the impact of the application of major assumptions
of ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers on the consolidated financial statements
and has performed the initial analysis of a fivestep model to determine when to recognize
revenue the model specifies that revenue should be recognized when or as an entity
transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which the entity expects
to be entitled depending on whether certain criteria are met revenue is recognized over
time in a manner that depicts the entitys performance or at a point in time when control of
the goods or services is transferred to the customer
initial analysis aim to identify significant contracts concluded in the framework of wholesale

sales revenues
sales revenues of goods and services are recognized when the significant risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred to the buyer and when the group is no longer permanently involved in
managing sold goods to the extent that such function is usually carried out in relation to goods
to which there is right of ownership and it does not exercise effective control over them
revenues include received and due payments for delivered finished goods merchandise raw
materials and services decreased by the amount of any trade discounts and value added tax
vat excise tax and fuel charges revenues are measured at the fair value of the payment
received or due
revenues from the sale of finished goods merchandise raw materials and services are adjusted
for profits or losses from settlement of cash flows hedging instruments related to the above
mentioned revenues
revenues and costs from services which beginning and end fall within different reporting
periods are recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the service when the
outcome of a contract can be valuated reliably in other cases revenues are recognized only to
the extent of costs incurred to the date but not higher than the costs that the group expects to
recover

72 explanatory notes to the statement of
financial position
721 721 property plant and equipment
selected accounting principles



721 property plant and equipment
property plant and equipment are initially measured at cost including grants related to assets
property plant and equipment are stated in the statement of financial position prepared at the
end of the reporting period at the net book value which is the amount at which an asset is initially
recognized cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses as well
as received grants for assets
the costs of significant repairs and regular maintenance programs are recognized as property
plant and equipment
fixed assets are depreciated with straightline method and in justified cases units of production
method of depreciation catalysts assets arising from development and extraction of mineral
resources


                                                174

each part of an item of property plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to
the total cost of the item is depreciated separately over the period reflecting its useful lives
the following standard useful lives are used for property plant and equipment

      buildings and constructions 1040 years
      machinery and equipment 435 years
      vehicles and other 220 years

the method of depreciation residual value and useful life of an asset are reviewed at least at the
end of each year when it is necessary adjustments of depreciation are carried out in subsequent
periods prospectively

grants
grants are recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and the
entity will comply with the conditions attaching to them
grants related to assets are recognized as a decrease of a carrying amount of an asset and as
a result a decrease of depreciation and amortisation charges over the useful life of the asset

exploration and extraction of mineral resources
within the framework of exploration and extraction of mineral resources the following
classification of stage was made

stage of exploration and assessment of mineral resources include

      acquisition of rights to explore and extract exploration and recognition of resources are
      recognized according to the successful efforts method
      expenditures for exploratory
      other expenditures which are directly attributable to the phase of exploration and
      recognition and are subject for capitalization

the group shall review annually expenditures incurred in the stage of exploration and recognition
of mineral resources in order to confirm the intention of further work if the work is unsuccessful
the cost previously recognized as an asset are recognized as cost of a current period
expenditure incurred in the exploration and recognition of resources are recognized as assets
related to development and extraction of mineral resources within property plant and equipment
at the moment of the conclusion of their technical feasibility and economic viability of mining

stage of site planning and of extraction of mineral resources
expenditures incurred for mineral resource sites planning and extraction of resources are
capitalized and amortised by unit of production method calculated proportionally to the amount
of extraction of hydrocarbons based on unit of installation the group calculates the depreciation
of all assets related to sites planning and extraction of mineral resources including their
significant components based on proved plus probable reserves
in case of significant change in estimated mineral resources at the reporting date potential
impairment allowances are recognized or reversed
in case of performance of exploratory drillings on already extracted resource the group
analyses if costs incurred enable rising new boreholes if not the expenditures are recognized in
costs of the current period




                                                175

professional judgements



expenditures for exploration and evaluation of mineral resources
application of the groups accounting policy for expenditures for exploration and evaluation of
mineral resources requires an assessment whether future economic benefits resulting from
extraction or sale are possible or if indications allowing to estimate the resources does not yet
exist when estimating the resources the group assesses future events and circumstances
including the assessment whether the extraction will be economically feasible



estimates



estimated useful lives of property plant and equipment
the group verifies useful lives of property plant and equipment once at year end with effect
from the beginning of next year should the economic useful lives of properties plant and
equipment from 2015 be applied in 2016 the depreciation expense would be higher by pln
40 million

exploration and evaluation of mineral resources
the group estimates resources based on interpretation of available geological data and verifies
then on a the current basis based on effects of further drills trial exploitation actual extraction
and economic factors such as hydrocarbons prices contractual terms or investment plans
at the end of each reporting period the group analyses cost of removal of wells and supporting
infrastructure

remediation of land  water environment
the group estimates the level of capitalized provisions related to noncurrent assets which to
a significant probability are needed for land  water environment remediation of the territory of
petrol stations fuel depots and areas of production plants

as at 31 december 2016 an impairment indicators were identified in the orlen group in
accordance with ias 36 impairment allowances of assets related to the approval on
15 december 2016 strategy of the orlen group for the years 20172021 strategy by the
management board and the supervisory board of pkn orlen
assumptions of the orlen group strategy include among others economic growth in key
markets activity of the orlen group the increase of crude oil prices resulting from the need to
replace natural decreases in extractions by productions from more expensive sources and
restrictions on investment in recent years the stabilization of downstream margin at a lower
level than that observed in the last 2 years and a further increase in regulatory pressure
especially in the field of low carbon economy and environmental protection macroeconomic
assumptions were developed on the basis of commercially available sources of knowledge of
industry analitical agencies forecasts of bank analysts expert knowledge of the orlen group

due to the lack of a basis for a reliable estimate of the price at which would have taken place
potential transaction to sale the assets of the group as the recoverable value of its individual
assets is its value in use according to ias 3620


                                                185

the tests were performed on the basis of assets of the orlen group as at 31 december
2016 and net cash flows projected in the approved within the strategy the midterm plan
discounted to their present value using the discount rates which reflect the current market value
of money and the specific risks to the valued assets

period costs of production also include a systematic allocation of fixed and variable production
overheads estimated for normal production level
finished goods semifinished products and work in progress shall be measured at the end of the
reporting period at the lower of cost or net realizable value
outgoings of finished goods semifinished products and work in progress are determined based
on the weighted average cost of production
merchandise and materials are measured initially at acquisition cost while as at the end of the
reporting period merchandise and raw materials are measured at the lower of cost or net
realizable value outgoings of merchandise and raw materials are determined based on the
weighted average acquisition cost
the initial value of inventories is adjusted for profits or losses from settlement of cash flow
hedging instruments related to the above mentioned
impairment tests for specific items of inventories are carried out on a current basis during
a reporting period writedown to net realizable value concerns inventories that are damaged or
obsolete and the selling price have fallen raw materials held for use in the production are not
written down below acquisition or production cost if the products in which they will be
incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost
however when a decline in the price of materials indicates that the cost of the products exceeds
net realizable value the materials are written down to net realizable value
recognition and reversal of impairment allowances of inventories is recognized in cost of sales

financial instruments

measurement of financial assets and liabilities
at initial recognition the group measures financial assets and liabilities at their fair value plus in
the case of a financial asset or a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss ie held
for trading transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the
financial asset or financial liability the group does not classify instruments as measured at fair
value through profit or loss upon initial recognition ie does not apply the fair value options
at the end of the reporting period the group measures item of financial assets and liabilities at
amortised cost using effective interest rate method except for derivatives which are measured
at fair value


                                                   223

gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives for which hedge accounting
is not applicable are recognized in the current year profit or loss

hedge accounting
derivatives designated as hedging instruments whose cash flows are expected to offset changes
in the cash flows of a hedged item are accounted for in accordance with the cash flow hedge
accounting
the group assess effectiveness of cash flow hedge at the inception of the hedge and later at
minimum at reporting date in case of cash flow hedge accounting the group recognizes in other
comprehensive income part of profits and losses connected with the effective part of the hedge
whereas profits or losses connected with the ineffective part  under profit or loss
the group uses statistical methods in particular regression analysis to assess effectiveness of
the hedge
if a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or
a financial liability the associated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to profit or loss of the reporting period in the same period or periods
during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss
however if the group expects that all or a portion of a loss recognized in other comprehensive
income will not be recovered in one or more future periods it reclassifies the amount that is not
expected to be recovered to profit or loss
if a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a nonfinancial
asset or a nonfinancial liability or a forecast transaction for a nonfinancial asset or nonfinancial
liability becomes a firm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied the group
removes the associated gains and losses that were recognized in the other comprehensive
income and includes them in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability
if a hedge of a forecast transaction results in the recognition of revenue from sales of products
merchandise materials or services the group removes the associated gains or losses that were
recognized in the other comprehensive income and adjusts these revenues

fair value measurement
the group maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs to meet the objective of fair value measurement which is to estimate the
price at which an orderly transaction to transfer the liability or equity instrument would take
place between market participants as at the measurement date under current market conditions
the group measures derivatives at fair value using valuation models for financial instruments
based on generally available exchange rates interest rates forward and volatility curves for
currencies and commodities quoted on active marketsthe fair value of derivatives is based on
discounted future flows related to contracted transactions as the difference between term price
and transaction price
forward exchange rates are not modelled as a separate risk factor but derives from the spot rate
and the respective forward interest rate for foreign currency in relation to pln
derivative instruments are presented as assets when their valuation is positive and as liabilities
when their valuation is negative

7331 methods applied in determining fair value fair
value hierarchy
financial liabilities due to loans bonds finance lease and liabilities and receivables for
borrowings are measured at fair value using discounted cash flows method discount rates are
calculated based on market interest rates according to quotations of 1 month 3months and 6
months interest rates increased by proper margins for particular financial instruments
as at 31 december 2016 and as at 31 december 2015 the group held unquoted shares in
entities for which fair value cannot be reliably measured due to the fact that there are no active
markets for these entities and no comparable transactions in the same type of instruments were
noted the value of shares of these entities was recognized in the consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 december 2016 and as at 31 december 2015 of pln 40 million at
acquisition cost less impairment allowances as at 31 december 2016 and as at 31 december
2015 the group did not intend to sell financial instruments classified as available for sale for
which it is not possible to determine fair value
during the reporting period and comparative period there were no reclassifications of financial
instruments in group between level 1 and 2 of fair value hierarchy

downstream  production




in 2016 we maintained excellent production rates and we successfully dealt with
the consequences of unscheduled shutdowns in the czech republic while
pursuing key growth projects in order to strengthen pkn orlens position on the
petrochemical market we commenced construction of a polyethylene unit in
litvínov czech republic and of a metathesis unit in płock which will significantly
increase our output of propylene the maintenance shutdowns and
reconstruction of the czech petrochemical assets did not affect production
continuity and we were able to fully meet the demand for our products in all
markets we are particularly satisfied with the achievements of orlen lietuva
which delivered excellent operating and financial performance

the polish fuel market saw a significant structural change in 2016 the fuel
package introduced by the polish government brought order to the fuel market
and restored equal opportunities for all participants the grey market not only
affected budget revenue from taxes but also significantly upset competition on
the polish fuel market thanks to flexibility and quick response pkn orlen
managed to effectively grasp the new market opportunity to achieve a strong
increase in wholesale and recordhigh volumes of fuels transported by the
logistics segment a modern structure of the refining and petrochemical sales
team and the logistics team coupled with continued improvement of fuel trading
capabilities are critical to building value both for pkn orlen and the groups key

       point yy up to a level of 664
       decrease of the share in sales of diesel oil by 36 pp is of a statistical nature as a result
       of the implementation of new legal regulations the socalled shadow economy on the fuel
       market was reduced and consequently the legal consumption presented by the energy
       market agency increased  in relation to the above the market share figures in the years

logistics assets of the orlen group
efficient logistics infrastructure is the key element of the competitive advantage of the orlen
group in the marketplace

the orlen group uses a network of mutually complementary infrastructure elements fuel
terminals onshore and offshore handling facilities networks of raw material pipelines in 2016
product logistics in the orlen group was based on pipeline use on railway transport as well as
on tank truck carriage




                                               283

in 2016 pipeline transport was the primary form of transport of raw materials and products the
total length of used product and raw material pipeline networks belonging to external entities
and own facilities in poland the czech republic and in lithuania was nearly 38 thousand km 21
thousand km are product pipelines and 17 thousand km are raw material pipelines

on the polish market pkn orlen uses 620 kilometers of pipelines owned by przedsiębiorstwo
eksploatacji rurociągów naftowych przyjaźń and its own transportation infrastructure with
a length of 338 km consisting of two sections płock  ostrów wielkopolski  wrocław with a length
of 319 km and wielowieś  góra iks solino with a length of 19 km crude oil transport is
performed primarily with the use of a network of pipelines belonging to pern przyjaźń of
a total length of 887 km as well as using own pipeline of 43 km linking góra iks solino to
żółwiniec connection to the pern przyjaźń pipeline

for operational purposes of receipt dispatch and loading of fuel in 2016 the orlen group used

power industry
the orlen group is a significant producer of electricity and heat energy which is used in large
part for their own production needs it is also one of the largest consumers of gas in poland and
an active participant in the process of the liberalisation of the gas market

according to the assumptions of the orlen group strategy current production sources are
undergoing upgrading projects and new investments in the form of gassteam blocks are being
implemented
the orlen group currently owns energy blocks in three countries in poland they are located in
płock włocławek jedlicze and trzebinia in the czech republic in litvinov spolana kolin
and pardubice and in lithuania in mazeikiai

energy assets and their technical parameters in the orlen group




     pkn orlen power plant in płock pp is the largest in terms of installed capacity industrial
     power plant in poland and one of the largest in europe producing heat and electricity in
     the highefficiency cogeneration the pp provides as the basic supplier heat in steam and
     heating water and electricity  the media used for the production installations and for
     external customers in 2016 the investment projects related to adjustment to the new
     environmental requirements were formally completed implementation of the program of
     efficiency improvement in production of heat and power was successfully realised
     heat and power plant orlen południe group located in trzebinia ensures full heating
     needs in steam and water and partly the need of electricity the basic fuel is coal dust
     heat and power plant in jedlicze is the primary source of heat production in technological
     steam the basic fuel is fine coal dust
     heat and power plant anwil is an industrial power plant generating technological heat and
     electricity in a cogeneration process and it is powered by natural gas and heating oil
     heat and power plant in litvinov in the unipetrol group is based on brown coal and its
     energy assets are currently under modernization
     heat and power plant in spolana is mainly based on brown coal
     the paramo heat and power plant includes two production plants kolin and pardubice in
     which the source of producing steam is based on the combustion of natural gas
     the orlen lietuva heat and power plant is a source of technological steam for production
     processes and operates on a mix of heavy heating oil and refining gases

in 2016 the orlen group led a construction of industrial heat and power plants in włocławek and
płock



                                               286

the gassteam power plant constructed in włocławek of 463 mwe in total power will be strictly
technologically linked to the anwil group production plant the launch of power plants is
scheduled for the second quarter of 2017 after the contractor completes diagnosed repairs
guarantee measurements and a test run after commissioning the newly built power plant will
serve as the main source of technological heat and electricity for the anwil group and the
surplus of electricity manufactured will be allocated by pse polskie sieci elektroenergetyczne
sa on the domestic market

in 2015 implementation of an investment started consisting in the erection of a gtcc unit in
płock with a capacity of 596 mwe in april 2015 the construction site was handed over to the
general contractor a consortium of siemens ag and siemens polska sp z oo by the end of
2015 all the earthworks related to the technological structures as well as to the auxiliary
structures had been carried out in 2016 key elements of the ccgt unit arrived at the
construction site including the gas turbine the steam turbine and the generator and intense
mechanical installation of the unit started in 2016 all the administrative planning and
easementrelated aspects had also been handled concerning the 400 kv line for the unit the
investment is planned to be completed by the end of 2017

the activity on wholesale electrical energy market has been expanded from the polish market to
the lithuanian and the czech markets additionally in pkn orlen the sale of the electrical
energy to final users has started

volume sales of downstream sector
in 2016 orlen group achieved a record sales volume in the downstream sector total sales
volume amounted to 30 708 thousand tonnes and was higher by 11 yy mainly as a result of
higher refinery volumes by 49 yy and lower by 175 yy petrochemical volumes on the
czech and polish markets

light and medium distillates had the biggest impact on the level of sales

a reduction in sales in the petrochemical industry in the field of monomers polymers and pvc
was the result of supply constraints related to the unavailability until november 2016 of
installations for production of ethylene in the unipetrol group after a breakdown of august
2015 and a periodic maintenance overhaul of the olefin installation in pkn orlen

higher pta sales was a result of the intensification of production in the first half of 2016 and
consistent sales policy on european markets namely polish and german

the decrease in fertiliser sales was due to maintenance overhauls of production installations in
june and july of 2016 in anwil

            a polish market

high growth of the polish economy in comparison to other european economies and a good
situation on the labour market had
a significant impact on fuel consumption in the polish market

low fuel prices and the introduction of the socalled fuel package ie solutions which significantly
reduce the impact of the shadow economy had an additional effect on domestic demand
particularly noticeable in the fourth quarter of 2016

according to the energy market agency domestic consumption of gasoline and diesel oil in
2016 increased respectively by 61 and 125 yy

structure of sales volumes of the orlen group in the downstream sector of the polish market




sales of the orlen group in the entire downstream sector
of the polish market in 2016 reached a level similar to last years and amounted to 15 173
thousand tonnes realised refining volumes were higher by 22 yy and petrochemical
volumes dropped by 81 yy due to maintenance overhauls
of the olefin installation in pkn orlen

in the area of refinery products the sales of light and middle distillates increased the
intensification of activities related to services provided to the final users brought positive results
in sales both to international groups and to the sme sector

in 2016 an increase in the sale of jet fuel was observed making it possible to consolidate
a leading position among its suppliers the jet fuel market continues to be a significant
component of the groups selling strategy in relation to the dynamic increase in air transport in
poland

            b operating markets of orlen lietuva

according to imf estimates the gdp growth rate of lithuania amounted to 26 yy in estonia
15 yy and in latvia 25 yy positive macroeconomic indicators had a positive impact on
the increased demand for fuels which in total for the three baltic markets increased in the
gasoline sector by 32 yy and diesel fuel by 49 yy the largest increases in consumption
took place in lithuania where the demand for gasoline increased by 90 yy and for diesel by
128 yy

a negative factor influencing consumption in the estonian market was the increase in excise
duty which is to be continued in subsequent years low entry barriers for baltic markets meant
that orlen lietuva operated in an environment of growing competition mainly from importers
from finland and belarus

despite the market pressure the total volume of sales increased in 2016 by 77 yy

the economic situation in ukraine which has been very tough in the last several years has now
improved in 2016 estimates point to an increase in gdp by around 15 yy in comparison to
a fall by 99 the year before despite the improved economic ratios the situation of households
remains difficult and the lack of stability in the financial market and the high inflation rate


                                                294

translate into a state of uncertainty and high market risk an aggressive pricing policy was also
seen to be pursued in the ukrainian market by belarusian refineries as well as an intensified
supply of fuels from russia in spite of the above restrictions the orlen lietuva group increased
sales in the ukrainian market by 11 yy

            c the czech republic market

in 2016 the czech economy grew at a rate of 25 yy favourable market conditions led to an
increase in the consumption of gasolines by 17 yy and diesel oil by 40 yy

in april 2015 unipetrol acquired the remaining shares in ceska rafinerska as from eni the
unipetrol group became the sole owner of the litvinov and kralupy refineries and has become
the sole producer of fuels in the czech republic

total sales of light and middle distillates increased by 70 yy despite the production
restrictions caused by the emergency shutdown starting in midmay 2016 of the fluid catalytic
crac installation at the refinery in kralupy

lower petrochemical volumes by 45 yy were mainly caused by the failure of the ethylene
production plant in august 2015 which was relaunched in november 2016 the restricted selling
possibilities were balanced by the coordination of product flows within the orlen group and also
thanks to the purchases of semifinished and finished products from third parties

the upstream has a significant position in pkn orlens value creation map and
is consistently increasing its contribution to the groups performance we are
expanding our reserves and acquiring the knowhow that is particularly valuable
in the upstream industry by optimising work and focusing on the most promising
projects we expect to leverage the strong potential for production growth both
in poland and canada

the new strategy of the orlen group assumes the further development of exploration and
production activities in order to expand production and own reserves of crude oil and natural gas

the development of competences in the area of production required the completion of an
international team of experts capable of building and managing a diversified portfolio of assets
and employing the latest available methods of exploration and production technologies by the
end of 2016 orlen upstream with its subsidiary fx energy was working either independently or
with a partner pgnig in 31 licenses in poland with a total area of about 19 thousand km2
located in 9 voivodships of poland and in the area of three oil basins the share of the orlen
group is 100 in 17 licenses 51 in one license and 49 in 13 licenses the group had 2p
reserves of 113 mmboe at the end of 2016 with an average annual extraction of 12 mboed in
canada the orlen group operates mainly in the province of alberta and has production assets
of over a total area of nearly 16 thousand km2 net 377 thousand acres with an annual average
production of hydrocarbons in 2016 reaching 122 mboed and a total of 2p reserves of 1025
mmboe at the end of the year

activities in poland

in 2016 the orlen group continued optimization of its asset portfolio in 2016 the orlen group
continued its asset portfolio optimisation this was related both to the acquisition of new areas
for exploration and to the abandonment of other less promising parts of the licenses in
a tendering process the porębatarnawa prospecting and exploration license was obtained from


                                                315

the ministry of environment in the małopolskie voivodship and another prospecting and
exploration license skołyszyn located on the border of the małopolskie and podkarpackie
voivodships as part of the edge area a new license was obtained for the prospecting and
exploration of hydrocarbons named tuchola n

an assessment was also performed of the appropriateness of continuing prospecting work in the
licenses located in the mazowieckie and lubelskie voivodships the lublin shale and karbon
project the łódzkie voivodship the mid poland unconventionals project and the małopolskie
voivodship the karpaty project and a decision was made to concentrate further exploration
work only in selected areas within the said projects

currently hydrocarbon production in the polish market takes place in collaboration with pgnig
sa and reaches a level of 12 mboed proportional to orlen groups share of 49 production
is carrying out on the płotki project located in the wielkopolska its characterized by high
potential in accumulation of hydrocarbons

as part of the work carried out in the podlasielublin basin the acquisition of 3d seismic data
was completed in 2016 in the wierzbica license the data were subsequently interpreted further
as part of a scientific research project within the blue gas program work related to the
decommissioning of wells and well sites in the wierzbica and wodyniełuków license areas was
also carried out
in 2016 an analysis of 2d seismic data ended in the wodyniełuków license area 3d seismic
data were also acquired in the lublin and garwolin license areas and in block 255

in the perm basin an analysis of 2d seismic data was performed in the sieradz block
documentation was completed and preparatory work was also carried out for the development of
a part of the sieraków area

in 2016 in the płotki area an exploratory well was drilled in the pyzdry license and the drilling of
an exploratory well was commenced under the kórnikśroda license at the same time planning
design activities for the development of two deposits within the same license area were carried
out and planning activities for the construction of pyzdry gas station were initiated in 2016 the
development of the karmin deposit ended in the jarocingrabina license and production started
moreover two exploratory wells were drilled in the edge project in the unisławgronowo and
brdarzeczenica license

as part of the work carried out in the carpathian basin in the area of the bieszczady project the
acquisition of 2d and 3d seismic data was carried out in 2016 a production test was performed
for a well in block 437 and drilling of two exploratory wells commenced at blocks 437 and 457

as part of the karpaty project an exploratory well was drilled at block 435 as part of the miocen
project the acquisition of 3d seismic data was carried out in the siennówrokietnica license area

activities in canada

the production activity in canada is carried out mainly in the alberta province through
a subsidiary  orlen upstream canada in 2016 yearly production amounted to 45 mmboe

operating activities in the stable canadian market fit within the risk profile defined in the overall
strategy of the group the favourable parameters of the assets held in terms of reservoir as well
as the development of business in the region which has already been well explored reduce the
operational risk related to the investment the canadian market is characterized by excellent
access to developed drilling and maintenance services as well as by access to qualified staff with
experience with regard to the extraction of unconventional deposits the stable tax system and
friendly regulatory environment are also important

in 2016 a gas plant owned by orlen upstream canada was put into operation in the
ferrierstrachan area it has a production capacity of 11 million m3 of reservoir fluid per day
allowing a total processing capacity of 65 mboed the orlen group also has some production
assets in the province of new brunswick as well as a share of 107 in goldboro lng a project
involving the construction of an lng export terminal on the east coast of canada

sustainable development
outlook csr 2017
since 2015 pkn orlen has been rolling out its csr
strategywhich is based on the following philosophy in
pursuing its business strategy the company is always
guided by the principle that value growth should be
aligned with the interests of external stakeholders and
rely on the sustainable and responsible use of
resources




pkn orlens csr strategy is closely connected with it corporate business strategy based on the
core values and standards of conduct of pkn orlen it seeks to motivate employees to look for
new ideas and innovative solutions while supporting business it builds a sense of shared
responsibility for implementing csr objectives within the organisation and promotes the idea of
responsibility and stakeholder engagement therefore the companys future csr initiatives will


                                             321

be based on the assumptions of the new orlen group strategy for 20172021 announced in
december 2016 with value creation people and financial strength as its keystones

2017 is the last year of the implementation of the csr strategy for 20152017 this means that
the work on the new csr strategy is well underway the new strategy will draw on the
companys business strategy and csr trends and most importantly it will respond to the needs
of the orlen group and expectations of its stakeholders the united nations sustainable
development goals announced in 2015 will also be given priority in addition the company will
need to satisfy the requirement to report nonfinancial data

business strategies are expected to address the challenges posed by civilisational changes
progress and advancement and evolving stakeholder expectations responsible leadership and
consequently the sustainable growth of a business is a way to mitigate risks build trust in the
brand and enhance its reputation responsible management across the orlen group is driven by
our awareness of the companys impact on its immediate and more distant environment and
predictions of its shortterm effects and the burden to be borne by future generations profit is no
longer the measure of success the key is to build longterm value that is to ensure effective
value management

trends
in the near future corporate social responsibility will be shaped by a number of trends sdgs or
sustainabilty development goalsannounced by the united nations in september 2015 will
definitely be one of them the agenda contains 17 general sustainable development goals and
169 specific targets focusing on the elimination of poverty combating inequalities and
preventing climate change over the horizon of the next 15 years the united nations calls on
local parliaments and governments civic societies as well as companies and entrepreneurs to
work towards the achievement of these goals and targets pkn orlen is actively involved in the
implementation of sdgs in poland as a partner of workshops organised for fuel sector operators
the company has already identified a number of such projects and takes into account sdgs
when planning future actions




                                                322

the orlen group also takes into consideration the un guiding principles on business and human
rights implementing the un protect respect and remedy framework adopted in june 2011 by
the united nations and the related reporting framework those guiding principles define the
existing obligations of states to protect human rights and point out the responsibility of business
enterprises to respect human rights and improve the access of those affected to effective
remedies which is of particular importance to business the guiding principles should apply to
all states and to all business enterprises

development of social capital is another major trend here success will depend mainly on social
dialogue based on trust and sustainable relations built on that foundation will bring benefits to
all stakeholders involved in the process the protection of human rights invariably remains one of
key trends in that area

in poland individualism still prevails over sociallyoriented attitudes however this can change
through educational campaigns and transparency of business activities one element of which is
open and reliable communication here expectations are running high but also obligations are
rising as a result effective reporting of nonfinancial data is another big trend up until now non
financial reporting was a voluntary initiative on the part of business enterprises however on
entry into force of the eu directive 201495ue on disclosure of nonfinancial and diversity
information as of 2017 it will be mandatory for all public companies banks and investment funds
which have more than 500 employees a balance sheet total of at least eur 20 million or a net
turnover of at least eur 40 million tthe provisions of the directive are reflected in the amended
accounting act published on december 15th 2016 it may be expected that the importance of
nonfinancial disclosures for analysts and investors will increase accordingly as companies will
be required to disclose nonfinancial information such as environmental impacts diversity
policies respect for human rights risk assessment and information about many other areas
importantly the disclosure of such information is based on the comply or explain rule


                                                 323

there is no doubt that integrated reporting which covers both financial and nonfinancial
information will allow for a better evaluation of the entitys situation in comparison with financial
disclosures alone as reports based on the new standards will include information on social
personnel and environmental policies anticorruption measures and the protection of human
rights

pkn orlen has published its csr reports since 2003 and since 2008 they have been drawn up
according to the global reporting initiative standard in 2015 the company published its first
integrated report and all fullyear reports have been based on this formula ever since

the sustainable supply chain is another trend gaining in importance in recent years obviously
the adoption of high standards across the entire supply chain is becoming a prerequisite
a responsible employer must always consider the expectations of its employees as to having
respect for their rights health and safety and adherence to core values

foundations of responsible business
the overriding objective of the orlen groups csr efforts is to create value both for the group
companies and for its stakeholders ethical social and environmental considerations are not only
ingrained in our csr strategy but are first of all part and parcel of the groups daytoday
operations

the orlen groups social initiatives are driven not only by the companys internal needs and the
stakeholders expectations first and foremost they reinforce our business position and send
a signal of the companys awareness of its largescale impacts therefore the strategy considers
the challenges faced by polish businesses according to the vision of sustainable development of
polish businesses until 2050 which assumes active involvement of the business community to
support polands social and economic development the document draws on the international
initiative of the world business council for sustainable development and highlights key
challenges and actions to be taken to achieve sustainability targets six priority areas identified
by the world business council for sustainable development are social capital human capital
infrastructure natural resources energy as well as the quality of the state and public
institutions

future operations of companies will be also driven by the csr standards that socially responsible
businesses are expected to apply those standards certainly include the global compact
principles which are reflected in documents such as the core values and standards of conduct
of pkn orlen s a and the groups current csr strategy however they also include reporting
standards such as the global reporting initiative industry guidelines such as ipieca
the international petroleum industry environmental conservation association or oecd
guidance for international businesses both our activities and reporting practice also take account
of the seven priority areas set out in the iso 26000 standard which contains guidelines on social
responsibility

csr activities translate into the business dimension and socially responsible companies are
included in dedicated stock exchange indices such as the dow jones sustainability group
indexes or ftse4good and polands respect index since 2009 when the respect index was
launched pkn orlens shares have been its constituent every single year following a difficult
qualification procedure in december 2016 a new ftse4good emerging index was created
featuring pkn orlen stock the company was therefore qualified as an entity driven by high


                                                 324

standards of environmental protection social responsibility and good business practices

considering the growing number of investors who find it important that a company is managed in
a socially responsible and sustainable manner takes care to ensure a high quality of investor
relations and reports its financial data on a regular basis inclusion in the respect index serves
as a reference for potential investors looking for attractive and safe investments

selected areas of our activities
the orlen group has been consistently building its image as a socially responsible company
focusing on stakeholder engagement and social commitment

the company is engaged in a number of social sponsorship projects which will be continued in
future years of all the csr initiatives across the orlen group environmental protection sports
sponsorship health and safety social commitment charity and patronage of culture are the
areas where the groups involvement is the strongest

the companys longterm support for the third sector also deserves a mention the corporate
orlen  gift from the heart foundation is developing the number of crosssectoral
partnership programmes carried out by the grant fund for płock foundation and the good
neighbourhood grant fund for ostrów wielkopolski association is also growing and the new
museum of oil and gas industry in bóbrka foundation brings together the many years of tradition
and new directions of growth under one roof

new initiatives focusing on the promotion of poland and our national identity have been
launched on the one hand they are related to the sponsorship of polish sports on the other
they open up the company to the positive influence of high culture an important initiative is pkn
orlens participation in the polish national foundation whose goal is to promote and protect the
image of the republic of poland and the polish economy abroad to support the development of
new technologies inventions and innovation and to disseminate and implement new
technologies in practice to support polish culture art protection of national heritage and the
promotion of knowledge concerning polish history economy and culture as well as patriotic
attitudes the protection of polands natural environment is also one of the key objectives of the
foundation as is the support for the promotion and implementation of corporate social
responsibility principles

safety of employees and contractors




occupational health and safety and process safety are
priority areas in our strategy in 2016 thanks to the high
motivation and commitment of the entire team
we achieved a very good total recordable rate proving
that pkn orlen is a safe place for both employees and
contractors we also seek to develop the orlen groups
production assets in a sustainable manner with due
regard to the natural environment and local communities

safety is one of the orlen groups priorities on a par
with those of value creation and building of solid
financial foundations our safety policy is put in action
by integrating all aspects standards best practices
and new knowledge and technology advances in the
field of workplace safety into the operations of the
orlen group
this priority follows from our business philosophy where people are our most valuable asset and
must be provided with safe working conditions this is an ethical approach to the protection of
human life and health which makes it imperative that whatever needs to be done in given
circumstances to prevent hazards industrial accidents fire and other disasters is actually done

safety and the management system


                                                361

the safety management system operated by the orlen group encompasses not only the group
employees but also the staff of our contractors the system focuses on two main directions the
first is to ensure the highest standards of work safety including to implement best practice and
integrate the latest knowledge and technology advances into the groups operations the second
is to put a strong focus on building the awareness of safe work procedures and on creating
proactive attitudes among our employees and contractors measures to further develop and
improve the orlen groups safety management system are provided for in the ohs strategy
implementation of the strategy objectives helps to build a common safety standard across the
orlen group and fulfil each companys individual safety needs in the context of their business
and its specific needs

the safety management system of the orlen group is monitored on an ongoing basis to identify
any potential areas for improvement the group companies operate ohs management systems
supervised by certification bodies accredited by the polish centre for accreditation polish
companies only certification audits include reviews of the companies compliance with legal
requirements and other applicable regulations the group also holds at its subsidiaries regular
internal audits as well as coordination and consultancy visits devoted to safety matters findings
and observations serve as basis for formulating and implementing correction and refinement
plans workplace health and safety improvement plans and individual ohs strategy targets

to meet the needs of the orlen groups constantly evolving occupational safety area a new
ohs management concept is planned for implementation in 20172021 it will be based on
building and developing the orlen groups uniform safety standards while enhancing the
excellence in operations and in preventive measures related to personal and process safety
according to the new concept an important element of the orlen groups safety management
system is building a safety culture in which employees identify with the groups work safety
standards and take responsibility for their own and their colleagues safety




                                               362

the orlen groups safety management structure as of 2017




we also continued our best practices in 2016 including the report a safety hazard initiative
the ohs incentive programme and the safety first project which are designed to enhance ohs
awareness among our and our contractors employees safety culture was also promoted by
organising competitions for the orlen group employees such as the fourth edition of good ohs
practice or the second edition of the millions of accidentfree manhours competition

the measures taken to reinforce accidentfree safety culture are based on education and
motivation of employees and subcontractors as well as on promoting safe behaviours and their
goal is to instil a sense of shared responsibility for their own safety and the safety of others both
at work and elsewhere those measures include dissemination of knowledge on occupational
safety promoting a healthy lifestyle and worklife balance one of the initiatives carried out at
the orlen group in the past five years is the occupational health and safety week it features
activities promoting a healthy lifestyle and balanced diet such as first aid demonstrations
meetings with dietitians medical information and relax areas educational activities as well as
games and competitions the event brings together not only orlen group employees but also
their families and the groups contractors furthermore the safe driver safe passenger
campaign was also organised last year for the customers at pkn orlen service stations

the orlen groups ambition is to drive down the number of accidents at work involving its
employees and contractors fires and industrial emergencies to zero this poses a challenge for
pkn orlen in the area of occupational safety with the need to develop and implement a uniform
safety standard across the group to that end the orlen group must ensure ongoing
identification and dissemination of best practices as well as experience sharing across the
orlen group and build on the lessons learned by other oil and gas companies with global
footprint


                                                 363

because we adhere to the principle that contractor safety is as important to us as the safety of
our own employees sharing best practices also with contractors is one of the cornerstones of
pkn orlens ohs management model

communication of near misses accidents and emergencies across the group is based on safety
alerts in the case of emergencies lesson learned actions are organised based on checklists
designed to identify preventive measures in different orlen group locations

objectives and challenges expected in the years to
come
the orlen groups ohs strategy for 20172021 assumes the delivery of strategic objectives in
four key areas

      management and leadership

      personal safety

      process safety

      commitment and responsibility


the overriding objective of the pkn orlens ohs strategy for 20172021 is the implementation
of safety standards at orlen group companies their aim is to achieve uniform requirements in
the area of corporate security the requirements were established upon the identification
analysis and selection of best initiatives and good practices implemented by the orlen group
production companies and by global oil and gas leaders

invariably the orlen groups ambition is to reduce the number of accidents at work involving its
employees and contractors fires and emergencies the main challenge faced by pkn orlen is to
achieve the target work safety culture in which employees and contractors are fully aware of
their responsibility for occupational safety always bearing in mind their own safety and the
safety of others to that end pkn orlen will need to attain the highest occupational safety
management standard  i protect others not just myself

the measures to be taken under the orlen groups ohs strategy for 20172021 are meant to
achieve synergies which will raise safety awareness across the group and allow pkn orlen to
remain one of the occupational safety leaders in the industry

process safety and process safety management system
process safety is a state where the organisational operating and technical conditions in place
ensure the safety of industrial processes and effectively prevent any substance andor energy
release into the environment



                                                            372

rising to strategic challenges of modern energy conglomerates and domestic requirements for
the prevention of serious industrial accidents continuous improvement of the efficiency and
effectiveness of the applied prevention measures and mitigation of potential impacts of
industrial accidents requires that effective and systematic management of process safety be put
in place in keeping with the highest standards set out in the osha 1910 regulations some of the
tasks the system is expected to deliver is to raise safety awareness analyse and manage risks
and use internal experiences and lessons learned from past events occurring around the world
presented below are the key elements of pkn orlens process safety management system that
is subject to continuous improvement

  1 safety leadership  invariably the key aspect of building a safety management system
     and a safety culture  strong forwardlooking leadership and the prominent role of
     qualified teams and management personnel influencing attitudes and everyday operating
     activities

  2 roles and responsibilities  defining emergency roles and responsibilities at all levels
     of the organisation and measures taken to get across the need for continuous improvement
     and prevention

  3 training  developing training programmes and providing training to employees
     responsible for proactive and preventive measures as well as emergency response training
     at all levels of the organisation and to other employees on site including subcontractors

  4 mechanisms  deployment of mechanisms enabling systematic analysis of the risk of
     a serious industrial accident and probability of its occurrence and therefore enabling its
     avoidance

  5 instructions and procedures  defining instructions for safe operation of process
     units using hazardous substances during normal operation as well as instructions on
     maintenance shutdowns and industrial process adjustments

  6 monitoring and oversight  recognising the need to apply the best available practices
     to monitor the operation of process units containing hazardous substances so that
     corrective measures can be implemented should any deviation from normal operation
     occur including due to normal wear and tear or corrosion

  7 analysis  regular assessment of validity and effectiveness of the process safety
     management system in place and the accident prevention programme as a principal
     document and the key intermediate task helping to achieve the overriding goal of proactive
     accident prevention with the method of documentation and approval defined and regular
     assessment of internal operating emergency response plans that are mandatory for upper
     tier and lowertier establishments

  8 experience  lessons learned from past emergencies occurring at the orlen group and
     globally including mechanisms supporting the need and requirement to learn from past
     events


uppertier and lowertier plants of the orlen group



                                              373

the infographic above illustrates the broad scope of the process safety function at the orlen
group as many as 27 establishments facilities are classified as uppertier and a number almost
half of that are lowertier establishments as per the classification framework under the seveso iii
directive applicable across europe and implemented into national law by all eu member states in
2015 it should be noted that both types of establishments face the challenge of implementing an
uptodate and effective process safety management system as an organised method for
managing safety encompassing all vital safety components presented above

to illustrate the current state of process safety in production companies of the orlen group
we use various process safety leading and lagging metrics in accordance with the api754
standards which are monitored and measured to help achieve the overarching goal of process
safety management which is to prevent or minimise the risk of major accident hazards these
metrics also serve as a benchmark we use to compare our performance against the best in our
industry in pursuit of process excellence

monitoring integrity of production assets and maintenance programme

asset integrity relies on timely internal equipment and pipeline inspections and pressure tests as
well as on keeping process parameters within operating windows monitoring of compliance with
inspection and oversight deadlines is supported by the szeor system in most cases internal
equipment inspections and pressure tests are carried out during planned maintenance under
longterm schedules inspections of safety valve settings are subject to a separate procedure to
ensure integrity automatic control and security systems are also subject to a dedicated
programme setting the dates for tests and functionality checks in parallel the risk based
inspection rbi programme is being implemented in partnership with and under the supervision
of the polish office of technical inspection the programme offers the added value of continuous
improvement of availability and safety of process units with the integrity of production assets
maintained

the production plant in płock operates the reliability management system which analyses all
unplanned unit shutdowns significant volume losses and other major reliabilityrelated incidents
the system is a key building block of the continuous organisational and technical improvement
and excellence process selected data illustrating the operation of the reliability management
system is presented in the charts below

environmental responsibility
our strategy is based on the principles of corporate
social responsibility including those relating to
environmental protection we aim to balance the goals
of our stakeholders reporting the results of our
environmental protection efforts aware of its
environmental impacts the orlen group takes
measures to prevent any environmental damage in the
course of its business in keeping with the precautionary
principle our environmental objectives are set out in
the integrated environmental policy adopted by pkn
orlen
these objectives are pursued based on the integrated management system in place which
comprises the iso 9001compliant quality management system aqap 2120compliant quality
management system iso 14001compliant environmental management system pnn18001
compliant occupational health and safety management system pnisoiec 27001compliant
information security management system haccp food safety management system
international sustainability  carbon certification iscc system and factory production control
system zkp

these systems meet the highest international management standards and support the
companys daytoday efforts to ensure professional customer service and maintain top quality
safety health protection and environmental standards

the recertification audit of the integrated management system carried out in april 2016 by
bureau veritas polska confirmed that our procedures were appropriate and met the reference
standards which resulted in the award of the integrated management system certificate to pkn
orlen




                                               381

in 2016 we continued to implement our environmental strategy for 20132017 the key elements
of which include




the key projects and initiatives announced and carried out in 2016 within the framework of the
orlen groups environmental strategy included installation of photovoltaic modules at selected
service stations in poland environmental projects pursued in 2016 at the production plant in
płock involved primarily adaptation of process units to the new environmental requirements and
standards imposed by the best available techniques bat conclusions these included both
administrative activities such as preparation and submission of applications to amend the
relevant integrated permits and investment projects to bring the process units in line with the
applicable legal provisions

the most important environmental project completed in 2016 at the płock production plant was
the construction of flue gas denitrification and dust removal units for the onsite chp plant
boilers as well as construction of a shared flue gas desulfurisation unit the last boiler k3 was


                                                382

connected to the flue gas desulfurisation unit operation of the unit in 2016 reduced so 2
emissions from the chp plant by more than 95 year on year

major projects carried out at the other companies of the orlen group in 2016 included
construction of denox and desox units and installation of a new system for continuous
monitoring of emissions at the t700 power plant of unipetrol rpa construction of a desox unit
at the fluid catalytic cracker in the kralupy refinery and extension of the systems for continuous
monitoring of emissions at the refineries in litvínov and kralupy owned by česká rafinérská
adaptation of a power node at orlen południe to applicable laws on flue gas emissions including
reduction of dust emissions

in q4 2016 in accordance with its internal regulations pkn orlen remeasured and optimised
the financial resources necessary to ensure performance of remediation work on land occupied
by fuel facilities a report was prepared by a team of external experts with extensive knowledge
in this field and experience gained in projects completed both at home and abroad a detailed
analysis was carried out to determine the environmental risk of the facilities subject to the audit
and the probable costs of removing the effects of environmental pollution the assessment
covered service stations fuel terminals storage depots petroleum production sites and the
płock production plant

reduction of environmental footprint has been the orlen groups longstanding priority as
confirmed by its numerous green initiatives and good practices frequently awarded in
environmental competitions

in 2016 pkn orlen was distinguished in the ecoresponsibility in business competition

anwil received the white csr leaf for the second time it is awarded to companies which
declare implementation of all key categories of management recommended by the iso
26000 standard and make an effort to constantly improve effective management of their
environmental impact




                                               383

water
the orlen group pays particular attention to the protection of natural resources across all areas
of its operations this includes water resources which are always used in a prudent manner

the orlen groups activities related to water consumption include several elements




surface waters were the main water source for group companies they are abstracted by the
orlen groups largest companies namely anwil iks solino pkn orlen orlen południe
česká rafinérská paramo orlen lietuva unipetrol rpa and spolana and then distributed
through water mains to their own production facilities and to other companies installations

in 2016 the orlen group abstracted 82610301 m3 of surface water groundwater and mains
water

the following table presents the amount and type of water abstracted by the orlen groups
largest production unit  the płock production plant

at the płock plant the company has in place a system for recycling wastewater as industrial
water which consists in looping the water and wastewater systems converting wastewater into
industrial water tertiary treatment  coagulation and flocculation accelerators and quaternary
treatment  algae and reed ponds and using an inhibitor node in which treated wastewater is
inhibited and sanitised by chlorine water treated wastewater is used as utility water for washing
cleaning and firefighting applications to make the water fit for feeding into utility and fire
fighting systems the plants are controlled for cleanliness during leakproof testing water carried
to the utility and firefighting systems is sourced from blowdown of circuits condensate from
steam circuits is treated and used as highquality water

as we use substantial quantities of water we recycle as much of it as possible for further use

the amount and quality of abstracted water is monitored the yearonyear decline in the amount
of water withdrawn from the wisła river down 38 was attributable to numerous maintenance
shutdowns of production units which reduced demand for water used to generate energy and
compensate losses in the cooling systems however preparation of the production units for
overhauls drove up demand for utility and firefighting water which translated into a 301
increase in the amount of recycled water used for that purpose in 2016 recycled water
represented 1342 of total amount of water withdrawn from the wisła

there were no maintenance shutdowns in 2016 so consumption of industrial water fell relative to
2015 as the consumption of industrial water goes hand in hand with the scope of repair works
including hydrodynamic cleaning of installations pressure tests

in 2016 pkn orlen sas distribution facilities service stations fuel terminals abstracted 1912
m3 of surface water and 69898 m3of groundwater

the amount of water abstracted from the environment by the other orlen group companies
depends primarily on their production demand in 2016 it exceeded 55m cubic meters

emissions

emissions and ambient concentrations
air emissions of pollutants are monitored through periodic or continuous measurements so that
actual emissions can be compared against emission limits defined in the relevant integrated
ippc permits on an ongoing basis

the orlen groups activities related to emissions include several elements




substances accounting for the largest percentage of total air emissions from the orlen groups
installations include sulfur dioxides nitrogen oxides carbon monoxides and dioxides as well as
particulate matter they are generated mainly from the combustion of fuels to produce electricity
and heat as well as in the refining and chemical processes there are also processspecific
emissions

total air emissions including of carbon dioxide reached 1300940227 mg in 2016

in 2016 periodic measurements of air emissions from the petrochemical refining and chp units
in płock and the pta plant in włocławek revealed no exceedance of the permitted emission levels
from the integrated permits similarly data from the continuous monitoring system installed at
the emission sources of the onsite chp plant were in line with the minister of environments
regulation on emission standards for installations

the information and data presented below relate to selected emissions excluding carbon
dioxide which is reported on in the section management of greenhouse gas emissions

in 2016 total emissions excluding carbon dioxide fell by approximately 50 year on year
mainly on the back of lower so2 and nox emissions resulting from highly efficient operation of
the wet flue gas desulfurisation denitrification and dust removal units at the chp plant an
increase in the emissions of other substances was due to the firsttime reporting of the emissions
of inorganic acids their salts and anhydrides following measurements performed in flue gas duct
after the fgd unit

in 2016 the terephthalic acid production plant pta plant in włocławek reported a slight
increase in main air emissions compared with 2015

the reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide nitric oxides and dust was achieved on reduced
consumption of oil in favour of gas fuel installation of enhanced control of combustion processes
and energy efficiency improvements

ambient concentrations
in 2016 air quality monitoring in the vicinity of the płock production plant covered the same
substances as in the previous year o3 co so2 no2 and btx and was carried out from an
automatic monitoring station located outside the plants premises  at junior high school no 5
the station has been included in the state environmental monitoring programme and
atmospheric measurements are automatically sent to the inspector of environmental protection
for the warsaw province in warsaw

analysis of the 2016 measurement readings indicates that the company complied with the
environmental standards for all measured pollutants as laid down in the minister of
environments regulation of august 24th 2012 there were no instances of the maximum annual
average concentrations being exceeded for any substance

at the junior high school no 5 station the average annual so2 concentration in 2016 was almost
30 lower relative to the year before this was due mainly to the reduction of so2 emissions from


                                               392

the chp plant after the flue gas desulfurisation unit was placed in service

in the case of the other key substances no2 and benzene the concentrations reported in
2015 and 2016 were comparable

besides pkn orlen ambient air quality monitoring is carried out by three companies anwil
orlen lietuva and česká rafinérská

at anwil offsite periodic measurements are taken at two locations to measure the
concentrations of vinyl chloride c2h3cl and 12dichloroethane c2h4cl2 while onsite
measurements additionally cover ammonia nh3 and nitrogen dioxide no2

orlen lietuva monitors ambient concentrations at four offsite locations within the socalled
sanitary zones measurements are taken once a day to monitor the levels of vocs benzene
c6h6 toluene c7h8 ethylbenzene c8h10 carbon monoxide co hydrogen sulfide h2s and
nitrogen dioxide no2

monitoring at česká rafinérská covers ambient concentrations of sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen
oxides no2 and benzene c6h6 ambient concentrations are monitored on a continuous basis
from an automatic station

a comparison of monitoring data with permissible levels has shown compliance with legal
requirements

management of greenhouse gas emissions

direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions scope 1 at the orlen group include emissions
reported under the eu emissions trading scheme eu ets there are also co2 emissions not
covered by the eu ets which totalled 2035 mg in 2016 the calculations factor in co2 and
n2o emissions gwp  298 there are no biogenic co2 emissions

in 2016 greenhouse gas emissions were balanced on a monthly basis for pkn orlens refinery
chp plant olefins ii ethylene oxide and glycol and pta units as well as other units owned by
the orlen group all of which participate in the emissions trading scheme ets the extent to
which the allocated co2 emission allowances were utilised was monitored on an ongoing basis for
each unit in addition forecasts were made as to the level of co2 emission allowances in relation
to annual production targetsin line with the act on trading in greenhouse gas emission
allowances free emission allowances were to be transferred to companies in europe by february
28th 2016 in amounts calculated by adjusting the initial allocation quotas for a crosssectoral
correction factor the allocated allowances were transferred to installation accounts on february
25th 2016

in 2016 the amount of waste generated by the płock production plant went up 1830 year on
year the increase being driven mainly by the amount of gypsum from the newly launched flue
gas desulfurisation unit the waste transferred for recycling and disposal in 2016 included waste
generated and stored in previous years additionally pkn orlens distribution facilities
generated 3753 mg of hazardous waste and 216063 mg of nonhazardous waste

in 2016 5910888 mg of hazardous waste and 919679 mg of nonhazardous waste was sent for

compared with 2015 in 2016 there was a decrease in the amount of waste generated mainly
nonhazardous waste this was due to the recognition of gypsum as a byproduct of the flue gas
desulphurisation process carried out in the flue gas desulphurisation unit at pkn orlen power
plant launched at the end of 2015 until the end of this unit startup and before achieving the
required quality parameters the gypsum generated was waste from the calcium flue gas
desulphurisation methods and was classified as such in 2015 in 2016 the gypsum was already
a byproduct of standard value

anwil spolana and orlen lietuva generated much less oilcontaining sludge from wastewater
separation and demolition waste than in 2015

in 2016 the orlen group recycled more than 51000 mg and disposed of more than 48000 mg
of waste the most frequently used recovery methods are regeneration or rerefining of waste
oils waste disposal takes place chiefly in incineration plants or wastewater treatment plants

waste management methods at other orlen group




the orlen group operates three landfill sites

     orlen eko  landfill site for hazardous waste where residue from the hazardous waste
     incineration plant is disposed of
     anwil  landfill site for nonhazardous and inert waste with special cells for hazardous
     waste
     spolana  landfill site for hazardous waste where ashes are landfilled

pkn orlen submits the prtr report to the voivodship inspector for environmental protection
which contains information on the release and transfer of pollutants into the air water and land
and waste disposed to disposal plants or landfills

in 2016 11 companies were obliged to meet the reporting requirements concerning waste under
the european pollutant release and transfer register eprtr total weight of transferred waste
was more than 156000 mg of which nearly 95000 mg was transferred by pkn orlen

effluents
the orlen groups activities related to effluents include several elements




effluents from all orlen group companies are directed to industrial and rain water sewage
systems and then undergo treatment

the amount of effluent discharged to the environment is metered in 2016 it totalled 46045031

pkn orlen operates a highlyefficient central wastewater treatment plant cwtp which treats
wastewater from offices and social facilities industrial wastewater and rainfall runoff from the
premises of the płock production plant including that coming from thirdparty companies
operating on the plants premises all wastewater funnelled to the cwtp is subject to a multistep
treatment process which includes mechanical physical chemical and biological treatments
treated wastewater meeting the criteria specified in the companys water permit is discharged
to the wisła river the quality of effluents that may be discharged from any specific unit is
precisely defined in a qualityquantity standard which is updated annually at pkn orlen some
treated wastewater is reused to produce water suitable for various uses on the plants premises
other than for human consumption or for firefighting purposes which considerably reduces the
quantity of water abstracted from the wisła river and pollutant loads discharged into the river
with effluents

amounts of water abstracted from and effluents discharged to the wisła river in relation to crude
oil processed by the płock production plant in 20152016




the cod load in wastewater discharged to the wisła river remained practically unchanged year
on year slight drop of 03 preparation for production unit overhauls caused a larger inflow of
pollution loads to the central wastewater treatment plant cwtp in 2016 the phenol and
suspension loads discharged to the wisła river increased by 25 and 86 respectively relative
to 2015 although the reduction rates for those pollutant loads at the wastewater treatment plant
remained very high 999 and 91 respectively

the amount of wastewater discharged to the wisła river went down by 10 year on year as more
wastewater was used to produce utility water and water for firefighting purposes the płock
plants increased demand for utility and firefighting water was related to numerous maintenance
shutdowns of production units

at the pta plant in włocławek all wastewater generated in the production of terephthalic acid is
discharged into the individual sewage systems of anwil sa in accordance with the relevant
decision of the marshal of the province of bydgoszcz the decision contains a waterlaw permit to
discharge industrial wastewater containing substances particularly harmful to the water
environment from the purified terephthalic acid pta plant into the sewage system owned by

the lower cod load in effluents was achieved by replacement of the s2522ab filter cartridges
during the overhaul in october 2015
the decrease in cobalt content was attributable to the replacement of ion exchange resins in the
cobalt recovery unit during the overhaul in october 2015

environmental regulations
measures taken to ensure compliance with environmental regulations were as follows




all orlen group companies hold the legally required permits based on which they operated in
2016 integrated permits and sectoral permits need to be updated on an ongoing basis in
keeping with the evolving legal environment and business needs in 2016 new administrative
decisions were obtained and certain existing decisions were amended at pkn orlen sa the
formal and legal changes concerned the płock production plant the włocławek pta plant and the
two new ccgt units in płock and włocławek

at the regional structures of pkn orlen comprising

      codo stations  service stations selling orlen goods and services service stations
      excluded from sales but not transferred to separate assets and service stations transferred
      to separate assets
      fuel terminals and headquarters of regional structures
      separate assets

obligations resulting from the environmental law are performed by orlen eko under an
agreement supervised by the environmental protection office in 2016 seven decisions were
obtained for fuel terminals waterlaw permit for groundwater abstraction waterlaw permit for
discharge of rainwater and meltwater into the environment waterlaw permit for discharge of
treated industrial wastewater mix of rainwater and meltwater sanitary and process wastewater
and groundwater

in 2016 132 required waterlaw permits for service stations were obtained with respect to five
service stations applications and waterlaw surveys were filed with relevant environmental
protection bodies and proceedings are pending to issue appropriate decisions


                                               411

in 2016 compliance of our operations with the environmental laws was verified by
representatives of the płock and włocławek units of the relevant provincial inspectorates of
environmental protection wioś during nine environmental inspections

two followup instructions were issued and subsequently accepted for implementation

in 2016 59 inspections were conducted at the regional structures of pkn orlen service
stations fuel terminals separate assets by the provincial inspectorates of environmental
protection county councils and municipal offices

provincial inspectorates of environmental protection performed 43 inspections at service stations
and issued 9 followup instructions with respect to the following areas

      water and wastewater management and wastewater discharge according to standards
      performance of average daily wastewater tests
      performance of operational inspections of rainwater treatment equipment

at fuel terminals provincial inspectorates of environmental protection carried out 10 inspections
one followup instruction was issued for the operation of a unit discharging wastewater to surface
waters in 2016 provincial inspectorates of environmental protection also performed inspections
of the bm 23 olecko and pałac srebrna separate assets

other companies of the orlen group were also inspected by external bodies for environmental
protection mainly the environmental protection inspection authority the inspections focused on
whether the environmental requirements imposed by regulations and administrative decisions
were complied with in 2016 34 inspections were carried out at subsidiaries including
9 inspections at distribution facilities of benzina 2 inspections orlen paliwa 6 inspections and
petrolot 1 inspection in 2016 52 inspections were carried out at subsidiaries including
10 inspections at distribution facilities of benzina 2 inspections orlen paliwa 6 inspections
ventus nafta 1 inspection and petrolot 1 inspection
they focused on

      water and wastewater management
      waste management
      air emissions and reporting
      soil and water environment

investment reviews were also performed at various projects at the final stage of their
commissioning

in 2016 three orlen group companies paramo unipetrol rpa and orlen lietuva were fined
for breaching the terms of their respective permits for economic use of the environment the
fines were a consequence of industrial accidents such as unsealing of the sewage system
substance leakage into the environment and increased air pollutant emissions the fines
amounted to eur 36276

                                                 412

capital expenditure

the aggregate amount of capital expenditure on environment protection projects incurred by the
entire orlen group in 2016 was in excess of eur 22m

in 2016 environmental protection spending at the płock production plant was pln 5572m down
by more than 764 year on year expenditure on environmental protection represented 281
of pkn orlens total capex budget in 2016

capital expenditure at the płock production plant in 20152016




in 2016 the company completed a very important proenvironmental investment namely
construction of flue gas denitrification and dust removal units at the chp plant as well as
construction of a shared flue gas desulfurisation unit for all boilers in effect the emissions of so2
nox and dust have been reduced while the heat and power source used by the company
reached compliance with the requirements of the directive on industrial emissions ied effective
from january 1st 2016



                                                  413

spending on environmental protection at service stations came close to pln 37m in 2016 down
by more than 44 year on year it covered both capex and noncapex projects primarily proper
water and wastewater management and upgrade work on linear drains separators at service
stations and car washes

in 2016 other companies of the orlen group also implemented a range of initiatives aimed at
reducing energy intensity of the processes and greenhouse gas emissions and at preventing
environmental pollution major projects included adaptation of a power node to the applicable
legal regulations on flue gas emissions at orlen południe preparation of the denox and desox
units and installation of a system for continuous monitoring of emissions at the t700 power plant
of unipetrol rpa and expansion of hydrogeological monitoring at iks solino

total spending on environmental protection projects by the orlen group subsidiaries in
2016 amounted to nearly eur 834m

environmental fees

business entities using the environment are required to pay environmental charges as provided
for in the environmental protection law of april 27th 2001 the płock production plant pays
environmental charges for air emissions abstraction of water and discharge of effluents to water
and soil the włocławek pta plant pays only for air emissions since its abstraction of water and
discharge of effluents are performed under a civil law agreement

in 2016 pkn orlen recorded an overall drop in the total amount of fees for the economic use of
the environment down over 35 compared with 2015 this was chiefly due to the reduction of
charges for air emissions at the płock production plant with the flue gas treatment unit at the
chp plant being the largest contributor

the other companies of the orlen group also pay fees for the economic use of the environment
as required by law in 2016 their aggregate amount exceeded eur 13m the largest portion of
which was water abstraction charges paid by eight companies other than pkn orlen
a significant drop was seen in charges for waste landfilling attributable to lower amounts of
waste disposed of at the landfill owned by anwil

best practices in the area of education
environmental compensation

a large production company like pkn orlen uses the natural environment intensively one
example of which is the preparation of sites for new projects this process often involves the


                                               418

necessity to remove trees and shrubs in industrial areas to compensate for those environmental
impacts we embark on numerous proenvironmental projects including the planting of trees and
shrubs on the companys own premises and in the town of płock

in 2016 134 trees and 22 shrubs were planted as part of our environmental compensation
efforts

peregrine falcon restoration project
since 1999 pkn orlen has been actively involved in efforts to restore the peregrine falcon
population in poland in cooperation with the sokół falcon wildlife protection association
the peregrine falcon is listed on the polish red list of animals as a cr critically endangered
species the programme is a showcase of pkn orlens longterm environmental initiatives our
partnership with the sokół association is regularly recognised and awarded in environmental
competitions




under the agreement with the association the nest and the falcons are continuously monitored
chicks are ringed and the box is inspected and maintained outside the breeding season

today we encourage everyone to watch the lives of these wild birds through the nest webcam

program responsible care odpowiedzialność i troska

                             since 1997 pkn orlen has been a member of the responsible
                             care programme a voluntary global proenvironmental initiative of
                             the chemical industry steady improvement of the condition of the
                             natural environment is a measure of the programmes success and
                             continuous dialogue with clients suppliers trading partners and
                             local communities is one of the key areas of a companys
                             contribution to the initiative its participants make a public
                             declaration of their intention to improve their performance and are
expected to demonstrate their achievements

other orlen group companies participating in the responsible care programme include iks
solino basell orlen polyolefins anwil and orlen południe

in 2016 pkn orlen continued its activities under the programme and met all the related
reporting obligations reports indicators surveys the information is used to assess the condition
of the environment and the progress of the responsible care implementation by chemical
industry companies that have subscribed to the initiative and are members of the polish chamber

pkn orlen also performed its obligations under the responsible care framework management
system under the programme pkn orlen carried out the projects declared for 2016 in the area
of health safety and environment hse it completed 48 out of the 64 declared projects while
14 are under way and will be continued in 2017

environmental grievance mechanisms
activities related to environmental grievance mechanisms included the following




                                              420

in 2016 the environmental inspection system registered complaints on potential nuisance risks
arising from planned and unforeseen events related to maintenance works as well as internal and
external interventions

in 2016 there were 117 external interventions and 36 internal interventions related to nuisance
odours 38 cases of nuisance odours reported in external interventions were confirmed by
competent services each complaint was investigated individually with utmost care in the areas
where nuisances were possible substance concentrations were measured in automatic air
monitoring stations and ongoing monitoring of weather conditions was undertaken the technical
services took steps to check whether the production repair and maintenance processes were run
correctly and to minimise the nuisance

interventions in 2016 took place mainly during maintenance work carried out at the oil
processing complex c4 derivatives complex iv reforming complex cracking and alkylation unit


                                              421

bitumen and oil processing unit gas management complex and the fuel unit the maintenance
work and preparations for process startups involved bleeding and purging of apparatuses and
steam cleaning of individual systems containing mixtures of hydrocarbons which were then
routed to the flare stack to be burnt there using methods mitigating the risk of releasing nuisance
odours to the environment around the plant

in order to minimise the risk of such nuisance decontamination technology was applied during
the preparatory maintenance works to inactivate harmful substances in internal circulation
nevertheless those activities could be a source of temporary emissions with winds from the
north and adverse weather conditions they could produce nuisance odours able to spread to the
city

some external interventions were caused by disruptions in the operation of the claus sulfur
recovery unit and increased hydrogen sulfide content in the fuel gases a few interventions were
related to noise nuisance caused by the flare stack

the higher number of interventions in płock is a consequence of the increasing environmental
awareness of the local community it has been especially raised by intense public debate on the
natural environment in płock and on factors shaping it which the group took an active part in
through its representatives this approach focused on dialogue between the entities affecting
the environment and the local community stimulates initiatives to identify more effective routes
towards sustainable development and thus more effective ways to care for the environment

a total of nine grievances concerning environmental impacts were filed with two orlen group
companies namely paramo and spolana they were resolved in accordance with systematic
internal procedures and the filing persons received relevant feedback

all the grievances filed with the companies were resolved in the reporting year




                                               422

environmental safety  example of the płock production plant
the płock production plant is the largest plant of the orlen group pkn orlen operates under
a strictly regulated legal framework designed to ensure environmental protection




all the plant emissions are subject to specific limits imposed by the restrictive eu and national
legislation

integrated permit

pkn orlen was one of the first companies in the chemical industry to obtain the integrated
permit the permit covers emissions from over 70 emission points that is all emission points on
the premises of the płock production plant not only those directly associated with refining and
petrochemical production but also those relating to the onsite wastewater treatment plant




                                                423

the integrated permit defines the best available impact monitoring techniques that the plant is
required to apply more than 30 substances considered critical for human and environmental
safety under the eu and polish laws are monitored on an ongoing basis

regular activities of the płock production plant are supervised by a number of independent
institutions including

      provincial inspectorate for environmental protection
      chief inspector for environmental protection
      polish centre for accreditation
      bureau veritas certification
      national sanitary inspectorate reach
      national labour inspectorate
      trade inspection
      customs administration
      supreme audit office
      independent verifiers  auditors of management systems
      certification bodies
      public administration bodies
      chief building inspection office

in 2016 a total of 25 inspections were carried out by independent institutions

proenvironmental investment projects

environmental investment projects are a key component of pkn orlens longterm development
strategy since 1990 total emissions from the płock production plant have been reduced by at
least five times with crude processing up nearly 60 since that time the group has spent more
than pln 65bn on environmental projects

how we protect the air in płock

pkn orlen has completed the green energy investment programme worth pln 14bn the key
project under the programme was the flue gas treatment unit constructed for the sole purpose of
reducing pkn orlens environmental footprint the unit helped to reduce dust emissions by 88
nitrogen oxides emissions by 48 and sulfur dioxide emissions by 95 in 2016 relative to 2015

pkn orlen is testing an innovative technology for removing volatile organic compounds from
polluted air streams gases generated in the plants sewage system are neutralised by selected
naturally occurring bacteria the process takes place in a specially designed bioreactor which


                                                424

ensures optimum conditions for the development and operation of the microorganisms as
a result they can work faster more efficiently and in a much more volatile environment than
they do in nature application of this method results in complete decomposition of pollutants into
carbon dioxide and water if the technology meets the expectations regarding reduction of
malodorous compounds pkn orlen plans to invest in complete tightening of the sewage system
and construction of a reactor to neutralise all the gases it produces if the project is implemented
its key advantages will be completely neutral environmental impact the technology generates no
byproducts safety of the bioprocesses taking place at a temperature of 25c30c under
normal atmospheric pressure as well as low energy consumption

in order to enhance the dialogue with the residents of płock and to raise their awareness of
important aspects of the plants operation in 2016 pkn orlen started to hold regular meetings
devoted to environmental protection

responsibility towards customers
one of the principal aspects of the orlen groups
operations is a steady improvement in the quality of its
products services and customer service standards
customers are a key stakeholder for the orlen group




the orlen group has taken steps to monitor and analyse the impact of its operations on human
health and safety in all spheres of its activity an area of particular importance to image building
and developing relations with customers and the general public is our service stations and the
way they are managed the stations staff confirm with their appropriate conduct and attitude in
their daily work that customers are the pillar of pkn orlens success a necessary condition for
achieving a steady improvement in quality standards and relations with each stakeholder group
knowledge of what changes are required and where they should be made our clients feedback
comments and opinions as well as the results of customer satisfaction surveys are an invaluable
source of information in this respect they are complemented by the reports issued after
inspections and visits of public authorities aimed at assessing the solutions we employ to ensure
health protection adequate level of security and the compliance of our business with applicable


                                                427

laws and regulations

however the element of key importance is our commitment to maintaining the highest quality
standards this applies to our services goods and fuels offered at the service stations the orlen
groups refining and petrochemical products as well as to the standards of customer service at
our service stations terminals and sales offices which we seek to continually enhance at each
level and phase of cooperation we take care to protect customers health and security

has been achieved with an indirect contribution from other trade names verva and stop cafe
our customers attachment to the brand has been effectively strengthened by the vitay and
flota loyalty schemes

service stations
an element of fundamental importance to the pkn orlen group image with customers is our
service stations operating in four european markets in poland germany the czech republic
and lithuania

managing more than 2700 sites we constantly focus on developing the retail segment
a modern service station network and customeroriented approach are key to achieving this
objective in 2016 about 80 service stations were upgraded to ensure that they meet the
exacting requirements of our customers in all of our markets 70 new service stations were
added to the chain in 2016 including one msa station in poland

we continued to develop our food services the stop cafe and stop cafe bistro chains were
expanded in 2016 with another 131 catering outlets to meet the needs and expectations of
customers orlen has embarked on implementing the new format stop cafe 20 combining
a convenience store with a wider range of food products and a new catering concept at the end
of the previous year our service station network included 41 stations with the new store and
catering format

our market success is founded on customer trust and their loyalty towards our retail chain which
we seek to build by constantly enhancing the quality of service having employed special
coaches at our service stations who are responsible for training the employees and ensuring top
quality service from all team members and with the development of the vitay and flota loyalty
schemes we can boast a growing base of loyal customers year after year to meet the
expectations of customers and constantly improve our service level in 2016 we made a pilot
launch of mflota an innovative system for mobile payments for fleet transactions this mobile
application developed by the company is an innovative and convenient tool for fleet customers
enabling them to pay for fuel directly at the pump it is the first such solution on the fuel market
of poland the application makes fuel purchases much faster and simpler  the customers refuel
their cars pay at the pump and are free to depart as the pump quickly becomes available for
the next customer other customers have time to do more shopping and buy beverages and food
at the station in the future this functionality will be made available to all retail customers
another step towards better service for fleet customers was the start of the implementation of


                                                428

a crm system to support customer management and sale processes

as a result of work on new options for our trade partners orlens fleet customers are now also
offered electricity supplies the main benefits to the customer is better terms of sale and the
possibility of simplifying and reducing the number of settlements with external suppliers

products and services
the main components of our offer for customers are fuels fuel products and services

fuel supply and fuel distribution to customers are subject to detailed rules which guarantee that
our fuels are of the highest quality and meet all of the requirements specified in the applicable
standards and laws these rules significantly limit the risk of fuel mixing or tank overfill during
fuel loading at service stations the fuel supplied to service stations and the condition of the
tanks are constantly monitored thanks to the procedures and solutions in place the risk of soil
contamination due to tank leakage has been practically eliminated

we quickly respond to any comments made or issues raised by customers regarding our fuels

service stations are not just a place where you can get your fuel they also feature wellstocked
convenience stores whose offer is constantly adjusted to changing customer expectations and
market trends when supplies are received the expiry dates of all food and other nonfuel
products are checked we also examine the condition of the packaging this task is also
performed on an ongoing basis at the stores during the restocking of products on display and
checking the condition of products on the shelves we always follow the mandatory rules of
separate storage and display of food products  they are stored in different rooms where
possible lubricants engine fluids and other accessories and car care products are stored in
separate storage units as a result customers are confident that they buy quality products that
meet all relevant requirements

at our service stations customers may also use various services the key services offered include
convenience foods and a car wash we do our best to prepare the snacks and hot beverages
offered at our service stations using proven recipes that meet customers expectations
concerning ingredients and nutritional value the coffee that we sell is supplied by producers
supported by the fair trade coffee organisation we have several dozen inhouse recipes for hot
and cold snacks and coffee we are striving to eliminate preservatives glutamate phosphate
artificial colour additives and flavours in new procurement processes we will voice our
expectations as to the desired composition of purchased products and semiproducts in business
decisionmaking and in dealings with suppliers we already communicate these expectations
requesting suppliers to prepare new product formulas without the specified ingredients which
has worked well for selected sweet snacks and hotdogs

the popularity of car washes is growing the vast majority of automatic car washes operating at
retail chains owned by the orlen group have a water recirculation system this technology
significantly reduces water consumption and the amount of wastewater produced

customers are informed of the impact on health and safety of all fuels and other products food
beverages sweet and savoury snacks and services offered at service stations food carwash
for fuels lubricants car care products and engine fluids safety data sheets are available at all
service stations held by the staff and handed to customers at their request containing

                                                429

a description and a list of components of those products information concerning the risks and
hazards as well as procedures to follow in case these risks materialise disclosure requirements
concerning the threats and hazards posed by the chemicals manufactured and used by the
company are regulated under polish and eu laws msds documents are the key tool used under
the reach regulation to ensure information flow along the supply chain pursuant to art 31 of
reach the supplier of a substance or mixture is required to deliver to the customer an msds
document in the official language of the member state in whose territory a given substance or
mixture is marketed the provisions of the polish labour code are equally important art 2212
of the code stipulates that any user of hazardous substances or hazardous chemical
preparations shall have an uptodate listing of such substances and preparations as well as the
relevant msds documents the substances and preparations shall be handled in packaging that
protects against any noxious action of such substances and preparations fires and explosions

health and safety
 a vital element in the management of the service station network is our commitment to ensuring
the safety of all of those who visit the stations customers travellers business partners and
suppliers we also aim to improve the comfort level of our own personnel at work

the stations with lpg pumps are adapted to enable the safe refuelling of gaspowered vehicles
service station attendants are always ready to assist customers and help them to refuel their
cars

our service stations are a safe place for both customers and employees all sites are equipped
with anti burglary and robbery alarm systems contracts with professional security providers
guarantee the quick arrival of a patrol if needed most of our service stations have cctv systems
that record all events inside and outside the facilities the fact that the station personnel have no
access to cash takings is another security feature

each service station has its own rules for vehicle and human traffic on its premises which
combined with luminescent markings increase the overall safety level at the stations

all pkn orlen service stations apply the haccp food safety management system implemented
in 2005 based on the requirements of codex alimentarius the service stations have access to
the technical documentation of haccp which is available via the station portal its purpose is to
guarantee that food products sold at the stations meet all the sanitary requirements are safe
and that their quality meets the relevant standards both in the case of individually packaged
products and hot meals served in the restaurants

haccp have a significant impact on the quality of marketed products  recordkeeping
monitoring and handling receipt storage preparation for sale and sale of products in line with
the haccp principles helps to enhance product safety and quality

haccp standing for hazard analysis and critical control points is a system used to identify
health threats and the risk of their occurrence at various stages of food production and
distribution it helps control and mitigate any hazards to consumer safety and health basically
a preventive system haccp aims to minimise hazards related to food sale protecting consumers
by guaranteeing safety and high quality of purchased foodstuffs it also protects food
manufacturers who are able to prove that their products are safe if their production processes


                                                430

are run correctly and are properly documented haccp has also been implemented by pkn
orlen at its czech lithuanian and german stations the system is regularly audited

the percentage of significant product and service categories for which health and safety impacts
are assessed for improvement is 100 in 2016 there were no incidents of noncompliance with
regulations and voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of products and
services during their life cycle by type of outcomes
the station personnel are instructed to strictly obey the ban on selling alcoholic beverages and
tobacco products to minors appropriate notices are put up at every site and awareness training
is organised for staff another practice is to make service station personnel sign declarations in
which they undertake to observe the upbringing in sobriety and alcoholism prevention act verify
the age of potential customers and refuse a sale if they suspect that it may be in breach of the
act

for many years pkn orlen has supported and promoted a healthy lifestyle and various forms of
active leisure some of these initiatives were addressed to our employees a case in point being
the sales team conference during which almost 260 members of our retail personnel cycled on
selected routes along the bug river most of the events however were held with customers in
mind we organised the largest running event in poland orlen marathon supported two
cycling events in germany velothon in berlin and cyclassic in hamburg and were one of the
organisers of sports camps for children and youth playing handball in germany through orlen
deutschland at more than 500 service stations in poland special bike racks are available as
part of the cooperation effort with the green velo eastern cycle trail a nearly 2000 kilometre
route crossing five provinces the provinces of olsztyn białystok lublin rzeszów and kielce
almost 30 stations were named cyclistfriendly places
in the czech republic in 2016 we organised another blood donation campaign for hospitals as
a result of the event the customers of our stations donated a total of 60 litres of blood

facilities for the disabled and children
we make an effort to allow access to our locations to people with disabilities the comfort of the
youngest travellers is also our priority

at most service stations there is at least one dedicated and clearly marked parking space for the
disabled and most restrooms have been upgraded to suit their needs also the disabled can
always count on the assistance and kindness of our service station personnel if necessary

as far as our youngest travellers are concerned their comfort is our priority many service
stations in poland and in the czech republic offer changing tables for babies childrens needs
are also addressed in our food service mini menu and store offer toys books and fairy tales
many service stations mainly located along the main transit routes have playgrounds for kids
whose parents are taking a rest while travelling

in 2016 pkn orlen was awarded in the title of accessibility leader 2016 in an architecture and
urban design competition organised by the polish urbanists association and the integracja
foundation under the honorary patronage of the president of the republic of poland andrzej
duda the award in the public service facility category went to pkn orlen sas station no 682
operating at al solidarności 100 warsaw the station has a full range of facilities for the
disabled combining the highest standards of direct service for disabled customers with dedicated


                                                431

design solutions all members of the station crew had received specialised training in serving the
disabled the station has numerous facilities that make it a friendly place for the disabled
including special equipment for people with mobility and hearing impairment appropriate
communication and arrangement of the buildings interior a cash desk suitable for people in
wheelchairs appropriate toilet facilities and parking spaces for the disabled there is also
a training course on how to interact with the disabled available on the elearning platform

this award confirms that we are successful in implementing our csr policy and proves that
we care about customers with special requirements  those with disabilities

pkn orlen is also successfully continuing the large family card programme which offers
discounts for the purchase of goods and services as well as fasttrack institutional services for
families with many children as a result the programme beneficiaries can now avail of a wide
range of discounts when buying fuels stop cafe products or car wash services

customer service standards
in 2016 largescale customer satisfaction surveys were conducted at the polish and czech
stations of the pkn orlen retail chain

under this formula customers can present their feedback concerning a service station they have
recently visited by filling in a questionnaire published on the research agencys website which
will then be made immediately available to individual service stations and managers in charge of
the retail network customers individual assessment of operational standards image service
level and product quality as well as their expectations as to the company and the service
station chain are a valuable source of additional information and guidance on the best directions
for change solutions preferred by customers as well as their priorities the survey enables us to
identify customers needs better and will lead to a further improvement in customer service
levels at the service stations the results of the survey were the basis for preparing a new
training project on how to create a positive customer experience at the stations

pkn orlen monitors customer satisfaction and loyalty levels on a regular basis the polish fuel
market is rather unstable due to volatile fuel prices the development of the service stations
network and the introduction of new products to the food service fuel and store portfolios
customers are offered a variety of promotions and attractive products building their loyalty
towards the service station that they use most frequently it is vital to monitor their satisfaction
with various aspects of service station activities taking a closer look at the key areas of activity
of a service station allows us to specify customers relations with the service station and
determine if the course taken by the service station has improved the image of pkn orlen and
boosted customer satisfaction levels customer surveys also help to determine the evolution of
customer loyalty and satisfaction on a yearonyear basis and verify which aspects of the service
stations operations have a major bearing on the quality of customer relations they also collect
information on the role of image product and service portfolio prices offered locations and
customer service processes in addition they address the question of which kind of experience is
most valuable which activities should be monitored and which elements of the customer service
standard should be finetuned

one of the elements enhancing customer relations is the companys approach to customers
feedback and reaction to complaints


                                                432

any person may contact us over the internet by phone or personally at service stations and give
their opinion about the station and service in each case the contact is registered in the
complaints management system which also records positive opinions and thanks from
customers

in 2016 customers at pkn orlen service stations completed more than 300m transactions over
that period more than 3000 complaints were received and the average time for reply was five
days the main issues reported by our customers in 2016 were as follows

every customer complaint is analysed individually in accordance with adopted procedures and in
the spirit of the human2human approach
on the czech market social media proved very useful in increasing the amount and quality of
customer feedback and improving communication between customers and the benzina station
chain the use of this communication channel translated into better awareness and acceptance
of our brand and the creation of an image of customer friendly stations

care for the natural environment
pkn orlen sa is particularly committed to environmental protection and this commitment also
extends to its service stations



                                              433

we put the consumer and the environment first at each stage of a nonfuel products lifecycle
this is particularly important in the case of oils operating fluids and automotive chemicals all
packaging is checked on delivery and if any damage is discovered the product is returned
appropriate storage and display policies help to mitigate the risk of damage to the product or its
packaging and quality deterioration our service stations provide containers for used oil and
other liquids packaging that may be harmful to the environment they also provide primary
waste collection containers enabling customers to dispose of food and beverage packaging and
other waste

all automotive products oils fluids car cosmetics come with safety data sheets specifying how
a product should be stored and what to do in case of contamination or poisoning

with regard to fuels we take various measures to protect the environment for instance we

      use doublewalled tanks to mitigate the risk of petrol leaking into the ground
      install tanks on fuelresistant concrete trays
      install fuel leak detection systems
      surface the station forecourts so as to prevent petrol from seeping into the ground
      use hydrocarbon separators in forecourt rainwater drainage systems to prevent petrol
      penetration into the ground or groundwater
      ensure containment integrity during petrol unloading to significantly reduce vapour
      emissions
      fit nozzles with the vrs system enabling recirculation of vapour from the car tank directly
      to a service station tank
      equip service stations with neutralizing agents to remove spills or leaks that occur during
      refuelling or unloading or result from leaking car fuel systems

as part of our responsible care for the environment we ensure proper water and wastewater
management at our service stations involving hydrocarbon separators used to treat stormwater
runoff at the service stations this limits the risk of environment and groundwater pollution to
a minimum

the fuel systems are fully sealed and ensure 100 protection from petroleum leakage to the
ground or vapour emissions into the air our waste management is efficient and effective in
2015 we introduced selective collection of domestic and packaging waste food waste and
hazardous waste are stored separately and collected by specialised companies selected service
stations mainly in germany collect waste oil the stations only use cleaning products from
recognised manufacturers with appropriate certificates

service stations in the czech republic and germany are prepared to collect returnable glass
containers against a deposit fee in germany the system covers all returnable packaging
including cans and pet bottles

as part of our environmental policy and commitment to environmental protection we strive to
minimise electricity consumption we are implementing numerous optimisation and
developmentoriented initiatives with this goal in mind we use high efficiency equipment led
lighting is installed at the stations undergoing upgrades with reactive power compensation at
more than 300 service stations we were able to obtain white energy certificates a very



                                               434

promising initiative is the pilot project to equip our stations with photovoltaic cells which convert
solar light into electricity in various geographic locations with different insolation our plans
envisage its rollout at 200 stations in the near future all of our stations in poland have faucet
aerators which significantly help reduce water consumption

one green project is being implemented in partnership with tesla with tesla car quick charge
ports having been installed at two german and two polish service stations another move towards
alternative fuels is the start of work on installing charge ports for charging electric cars of all
types and cnglng filling stands in the orlen chain in poland in the czech republic the
number of stations offering such fuels increased to 84 on the german market pkn orlen
commenced the preparations to launch two hydrogen stations in 2017 one station is planned to
be opened on the czech market


protection of consumer privacy
pursuant to the provisions of the personal data protection act of august 29th 1997 pkn orlen
sa adopted a decision on personal data protection no 92016dg of march 10th 2016
moreover by resolution no 53942015 of june 24th 2015 the management board of pkn orlen
sa appointed a data security administrator and his deputies responsible for ensuring
compliance with all applicable personal data protection regulations including protection of
customers data and their processing in accordance with generally applicable laws

in 2016 pkn orlen sa and orlen group companies reported no substantiated complaints
regarding any infringements on customers personal data protection or any cases of loss theft or
unauthorised use of such data


    relates to all key subsidiaries in which pkn orlen sa holds interest of 50 or more




                                                              435

responsibility towards suppliers
suppliers are one of the key groups of stakeholders under the csr strategy for 20152017 the
companys suppliers are required to meet specific criteria relating to orlen values and social
responsibility the procurement area cooperates closely with the stakeholders analyses their
needs puts forward common priorities plans kpis and improvements




in 20152016 the rules of cooperation with suppliers were changed with the administrative and
support function gaining a proactive and businessminded role to achieve our strategic
objectives we are chiefly focused on implementing a method of comprehensive management of
procurement categories a supplier management model its elements include segmentation
classification management rules and global procurement standards also rules of cooperation
within the group were defined and have been consistently implemented this process is
supported by the procurement policy implemented as an umbrella document binding across the
group it establishes common standards covering procedures processes tools systems and
procurement structures the key initiative is the successive implementation of the connect
procurement platform at the group companies which promotes uniform and consistent
procurement processes across the group transparency of procurement processes knowledge
sharing and better communication with suppliers

in a significant step towards ensuring sustainable development and responsible supply chain
pkn orlen incorporated the responsible business and sustainable growth criteria in its
procurement management standard the company promotes social responsibility among its


                                              436

suppliers and seeks to cooperate with trading partners that respect human rights and operate in
compliance with the law ensure safe and fair working conditions follow the best standards of
ethical conduct and care for the environment csr criteria have been defined and compiled into
a single document entitled supplier code of conduct as of april 2016 compliance with the
code is mandatory in the process of trading partner qualification the release of the code is one
of the initiatives aimed at promoting a responsible supply chain such as the publication of best
practices in the responsible business forums report entitled responsible business in poland
2015 best practice moreover at the 6th csr fair we made a presentation of the procurement
areas experience in preparing and implementing the supplier code of conduct promoting
responsibility among stakeholders and encouraging responsible practices among suppliers in
november 2016 a package of procurement management guidelines comprising the
procurement policy and the supplier code of conduct was released for implementation at the
orlen group companies as a common standard binding across the group




in 2016 the connect procurement platform saw the launch of a new supplier zone which will
facilitate the use of the system by our trading partners this new feature was added in response
to the latest trends in application development most of all it addresses the requests made by
suppliers in satisfaction surveys the respondents expected the platform to be more intuitive and
easier to use the coming years will see the further integration of procurement tools including
the launch of new functionalities in the supplier website the existing set of procurement
documents requests for proposals bids will be expanded to include transaction documents
orders contracts supply notices

one of the key it systems supporting the procurement function across the orlen group will be
the integrated procurement tool ipt whose purchase was initiated in 2016 the goal of the ipt



                                               437

purchase and implementation is to provide a tool to support the p2p procure to pay process
the ipt implementation at the orlen group will increase the efficiency of the procurement
function shorten the procurement completion time reduce risk improve spending transparency
and increase savings

2016 saw fundamental changes related to the development of the procurement category
strategy and the establishment of a supplier classification and assessment system

various initiatives and best practices are being implemented across the entire orlen group the
key element contributing to a more efficient procurement process is procurement category
strategy developed and implemented together with our trading partners strategic management
of procurement categories facilitates the incorporation of development directions specified in the
companys strategy in operating activities which are adjusted to the specific nature of each
procurement category this approach is aimed at developing new solutions process streamlining
and cutting costs

the orlen group cooperates with a group of carefully selected suppliers as part of an effort to
continuously improve procurement processes the group enhances and seeks to ensure greater
consistency of supplier selection processes a supplier classification and assessment model was
worked out the criteria established based on the best market practices among other things it is
now possible to mitigate reputation financial and process risks and ensure a high quality of
cooperation with trading partners

we attach particular importance to engaging with local businesses based in the county of płock
and the province of warsaw by using the services of local suppliers the orlen group reinforces
the market and conducts business in its close neighbourhood such suppliers know the local
market and are often well aware of the needs and expectations of the orlen group companies
their close proximity also reduces costs eg of transport and accommodation in 2016 pkn
orlen spent roughly 4 of its total expenditure on products and services offered by płockbased
companies by cooperating with suppliers from the close neighbourhood the company supports
the growth of the local market and implements the objectives of its csr strategy within the
supply chain

at key foreign orlen group companies  unipetrol litvínov and orlen lietuva mažeikiai
spending on the services provided by local suppliers in 2016 was 11 and 1 respectively of
their total expenditure

                                          we put a strong emphasis on the achieving our strategic
                                          objectives and meeting global standards bearing in mind
                                          that our most important asset is our people this is why
                                          in 2014 we launched a development programme called
                                          the procurement academy as part of the procurement
                                          academy programme we worked to improve
                                          professional qualifications and soft skills which included
the areas of leadership communication and bulding of positive relations between employees
contributing to a higher quality of cooperation and professionalism of the procurement process
the programme which continued throughout 2016 translated into a clear and consistent
improvement in our trading partners satisfaction with the general quality of cooperation and



                                                438

buyer competence we are proud to announce that 90 of the
current personnel of the procurement area at pkn orlen have
completed the procurement academy our programme also won
the recognition of polish procurement and logistics managers
the project was awarded the third position in the procurement
leader competition held as part of the proconpolzak
procurement sector conference held on october 18th and 19th in
2016 in warsaw




in 2015 pkn orlen received the cips certificate cips  chartered institute of purchasing and
supply awarded by the worlds largest organisation in the procurement sector the certificate
which is valid for three years attests to the international standards applied by the company in
procurement processes

a form of dialogue with the stakeholders was the third satisfaction survey concerning the level of
cooperation with the procurement area carried out in 2016 the respondents included trading
partners and suppliersthe survey covered many aspects of cooperation including the
competences of employees their communication skills and commitment respondents could also
express their opinion concerning the tools used by pkn orlen including the connect
procurement platform the survey showed that the cooperation is still viewed in a favourable
light despite a slight decline in the overall satisfaction index relative to 2015




                                               439

crude oil a nonrenewable resource is purchased for all orlen group refineries as part of an
integrated procurement process handled by pkn orlen which purchases oil from external
suppliers

other materials used in our plants include natural gas biocomponents and semifinished
products exchanged mainly between the refinery and the petrochemical plants they are not
primary feedstock

      2 recycled materials used as input materials

the orlen group recycles effluents and reuses water recycling involves recovering and
reprocessing of waste materials to obtain raw materials for the same or other applications by
reusing waste materials group companies reduce consumption of new raw materials which
enhances process efficiency and helps protect natural resources

recovery and reuse of waste materials also reduce the overall amount of generated waste
reusing energy materials and energy carriers is part of efficient energy management the
principal goal of the recycling activities is to maximise the amount of reused materials with
a minimum energy spending on their processing

in 2016 pkn orlens płock production plant recovered 003 of slops in the wastewater
treatment process and reprocessed them in the distillation unit moreover 21 of treated
wastewater was used to produce industrial water and water for firefighting purposes

waste raw materials and heat were also reused at other orlen group companies

      basell orlen polyolefins reused 207 of heat recovered from production from steam for
      water heating purposes
      anwil reused 725 of pvc sx from effluents 214 of river water and 074 of brine in
      its production processes
      orlen eko reused 205 of heat recovered from flue gas to produce steam
      orlen południe trzebinia production plant recovered in its chp plant  64 of
      condensate from paraffin production relative to steam carrier production and in its

      in the fractional distillation unit and 058 of slops in the waste oil regeneration unit it also
      used 14 of steam condensate in the chp plant
      orlen lietuva reused 98 of water eg in circulation cooling systems 88 of effluents
      to produce process water 013 of slops and 6976 tonnes of waste in rerefining process
      and recovered 797 of heat from steam
      spolana reprocessed 77 of condensate from heat production reused 589 of effluents
      in production transferred for reuse 08 of waste paper and 03 of plastics and
      recovered 339 of heat and 976 of hydrogen moreover 99 of cooling water
      representing 385 of all the water abstracted by the company is recirculated

      3 product and service labelling

obligations of the orlen group companies to provide information on the potential hazards
associated with specific products by using special signs and labels originate from international
and eu laws the scope and division of responsibilities of the orlen group companies are
defined in internal regulations

the key tool used to determine the required type of labelling is safety data sheets prepared in
accordance with the eu reach regulation safety data sheets contain information on product
labelling based on the clp classification and warning stickers related to hazards involved in
transport if required

safety data sheets are mainly a source of information on products used for industrial and
professional applications in the case of products marketed directly for use by general
consumers such information is provided by orlen group companies by appropriate labelling of
product packaging

labels on product packaging compliant with clp regulation contain in addition to pictograms
standard hazard statements and precautionary statements

given the wide range of applications for orlen group products labels on product packaging also
meet detailed requirements provided for in specific legal provisions applicable to detergents
fertilizers etc

as the requirement to communicate hazards and safe use instructions are imposed by law the
signs included in safety data sheets and on product packaging are checked for regulatory
compliance by competent state authorities such as the state sanitary inspection sanepid or
the national labour inspectorate

society
business strategies are expected to address the
challenges posed by civilisational changes progress
and advancement and evolving stakeholder
expectations responsible leadership and
consequently the sustainable growth of a business is
the right way to mitigate risks build trust in the brand
and enhance company reputation responsible

awareness of the companys impact on its immediate
and more distant environment and predictions
concerning the consequences of these effects and the
burden to be borne by future generations




corporate social responsibility csr

the orlen groups corporate social responsibility csr strategy states that value growth
should be aligned with the interests of external stakeholders and rely on sustainable and
responsible use of resources

the csr strategy identifies three principal areas of activity  organisation close environment
and distant environment in the first area organisation the key goal is to build lasting
relationships with employees based on diversity a sense of security development opportunities
as well as combining social and professional roles in the close environment priority is given to
developing the social conscience and a sense of responsibility in our trading partners and
customers through sharing best practices and knowledge and implementing the most exacting



                                               453

csr standards in the distant environment pkn orlen promotes innovation and fosters the
highest industry standards in business ethics and environmental protection

as part of the first area the orlen group strives to create a culture based on trust equal
opportunities and fair treatment of all employees regardless of sex age job position length of
service trade union membership religion nationality belief system physical appearance or
sexual orientation the group follows transparent human rights and nondiscrimination policies
and is committed to ensuring a mutually beneficial worklife balance

key activities in the strategys second area namely activities related to promoting the
development of a social conscience and a sense of responsibility include employee volunteering
projects the assumptions underlying the employee volunteering programme have been revised
and now it is also open to initiatives put forward by the employees by expanding the catalogue
of activities the group has been able to steadily increase both the number of charity campaigns
and of participating employees

innovative projects seeking to reduce the orlen groups environmental footprint represent the
third pillar of the csr strategy corporate environmental responsibility is much more than just
compliance with environmental laws and regulations or undertaking educational projects
addressed to employees customers suppliers and local communities it also encompasses
implementation of environmental management systems and investing in innovative
environmentfriendly technologies which bring benefits and are a source of competitive

and is committed to responding where help is needed

charity projects are pursued directly by orlen group companies as well as through the orlen 
gift from the heart foundation and the anwil for włocławek foundation they form an
important part of the companys csr strategy in our charity activities we focus on two priorities
to improve the quality of life and health and promote education and youth development

pkn orlen has pioneered support for local communities within the framework of crosssectoral
cooperation with a view to improving the quality of life in the areas where the company

communities but a few years ago it was also opened up to individuals this helped to foster
productive relationships with ngos as well as local residents and authorities the projects

outlook 2017
prepared in april 2017

from an empirical point of view related to oil market
scenarios our outlook 2017 remains broadly
unchanged what we presented last year in response to
the latest news and developments that surprised the
market like opecs intervention or the effective date of
a cap on marine fuel sulfur content accelerated by five
years we have slightly adjusted our projections of oil
pricing trends over the next five years
we expect oil prices to average about usd 55 per barrel in 2017 and 2018 in the following years
we believe that prices may accelerate upward in the wake of cuts in spending increases in
conventional upstream projects seen in 20152017 as the size of the cuts remains unknown
we will not speculate on how fast oil prices are likely to rise in 20192021

no new factors have emerged that we would have missed a year ago and that could impact on oil
supply and demand over the next 20 years today we better understand the factors that we were
only aware of before and to some of them  specifically the advances in electric mobility and
digitisation  we now attach a greater weight digitisation means electrification therefore
we expect this factor to spur demand for electricity as consumers take on new habits and voice
new needs the digitisation and electrification of public and private transport will add up to
a weakening demand for oil demand for reliable electricity at stable prices will boost the appeal
of solar and nuclear energy sources while the digital revolution and progress achieved in the
energy storage sector will pave the way for further developments in these primary energy
sources

what has changed the most over the past year is how we view the oil market attention has
shifted to the future of oil demand which may shrink pushing price issues to the sidelines since
the effects of oil being phased out from the global energy mix are not clear to see 20 years from
now the time horizon of scenario analyses has been extended by 15 years to 2050 but the
horizon of strategic thinking extends even further strategic decisions are increasingly dictated
by change scenarios with the business as usual approach generally viewed as outdated
businesses still use it to communicate to the market their estimates of future returns on existing
assets over a 20year horizon

our outlook 2017 differs from prior editions in that it contains no inhouse scenarios this is for
two principal reasons no major revisions have been made to the possible scenarios until 2020
which we discussed last year or to the underlying price path assumptions we refrain from
disclosing the numbers assumed in the change scenarios used to develop our strategy which is
a common practice further on in outlook 2017 instead of numbers we will discuss qualitative
changes in our approach to planning strategies and allocation decisions for the oil sector




                                                466

oil market change of perspective
from price paths to demand paths
the oil market can be viewed from various angles until recently oil price paths were the focus of
attention with movements in supply and demand seen through the lens of their impact on prices
with chinas accession to the wto in late 2001 the sharp growth in demand became the most
powerful force driving the oil market and the lagging supply put upward pressure on prices
china needed more and more oil to power its booming industry to fuel ships carrying growing
cargo volumes etc it was a time of prosperity for refiners with profit margins rising when the
financial crisis struck the deep recession that followed compounded by high oil prices stifled
demand temporarily refining margins shrank and many refiners went bankrupt but
skyrocketing oil prices that had continued in an uptrend for years provided an incentive to
increase production potential something that the world failed to notice on time the potential of
groundbreaking innovations was once again underestimated at this point in history new
technologies opened up oil deposits that no one had expected could ever be accessed including
shale and deepwater reserves as recently as 2010 it was widely believed that the oil supply
would soon run out again much more recently in mid2014 it turned out that there were still
ample oil reserves since then the market has been driven by the supply side the prices went
down the shortcycle production sources have quickly adapted to the low price environment and
crude stocks have been built these adjustments have brought the market back to a state of
balance and raised the question of what will happen next to oil prices

there was no doubt that the price of usd 3040 per barrel of oil was unsustainable and prices
would rebound but predicting future price paths proved more controversial for two reasons the
ample global supply and the prospects of shrinking demand global oil reserves have been
growing faster than output in 1980 global oil production totalled 23 billion barrels oil reserves
of 683 billion barrels would have lasted the world for 30 years in those circumstances but in the
32 years between 1980 and 2012 global reserves reached 852 billion barrels 2012 alone
witnessed an output of 315 billion barrels under these conditions oil deposits holding 1668
billion barrels of oil would last for 53 years the total output in 19802015 reached 1300 billion
barrels of oil in 2016 production totalled 30 billion barrels with reserves estimated at 2092
billion barrels enough to supply the world for the next 70 years zaki yamani saudi arabias oil
minister from 19621986 noted the stone age came to an end but not from a lack of stones
and the oil age will end but not from a lack of oil indeed demand for oil and liquid fuels from
oecd member countries has been in decline since 2005 when will oil demand start to shrink
globally there are two opposing views on that according to one of them prevalent until
recently the rumours of global demand peaking soon are exaggerated the abundance of oil and
the progress in extraction technologies support low prices but in the long term prices cannot be
lower than the marginal cost of extraction or the breakeven cost of producing three to four
million barrels of the most expensive crude per day required to cover demand oil prices
remaining low for some time would raise demand slightly more expensive oil reserves would
have to be tapped and the industry would be back to business as usual in those scenarios oil
prices would be set by the marginal cost of production of approximately usd 7080 per barrel in
constant us dollars in the long term generally assumed to be 20 years three years ago it was
believed that the price of oil would reach usd 100 per barrel in the long term but the price
expectations were revised downward year by year reflecting improved production efficiency

the other view which has received much attention of late predicts the end of the dominant role


                                                467

of oil in transport and the end of oil as a power generation fuel outside the oecd as oecd
countries already went through this process after the oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s
although more oil will be consumed as feedstock by the petrochemical and chemical industries
by 2050 overall global demand for crude oil and liquid fuels could shrink by as much as onethird
relative to current levels shrinking demand means no need to extract more expensive oil and
the balance price would drop far below the level assumed in the scenarios of rising demand

a central feature of publications and scenarios envisaging shrinking oil demand is not the prices
but demand and negative demand drivers electric mobility is coming to the fore but looming in
the background is a much more powerful force  the progressing and allpervasive digital
revolution which has been hailed as the fourth industrial revolution although its impact will reach
far beyond traditional industry in those scenarios oil prices have a big question mark hovering
over them as the only available metric is the marginal cost of production which itself depends on
the geology of deposits and the extraction technology available considering geological factors
and ep costs declining oil demand could bring down the price per barrel of oil to a level as low
as usd 40 in the long term the problem is that other factors also come into play  some oil
reserves that would be the cheapest to produce cannot be accessed for geopolitical reasons
more importantly the shrinkingdemand and lowprice scenarios have price cycles embedded in
them the mechanics are described below the life cycle of production and refining assets runs
into decades typically multiplied by digits above five the mere prospect of oil demand falling in
the wake of a technological revolution means that some of the existing assets will become
stranded weighing on the market value and spending capabilities of oil companies and affecting
their propensity to invest in production and refining assets this trend is further compounded by
production lost as a result of some upstream projects being postponed in the last two years due
to depressed prices with the scale of output reduction as yet unknown when we confront
reduced supply with projected demand expected to rise sharply over the next five years by an
average of 13 mmbd a year before it starts to fall this can be read as a signal that oil prices
could rebound in two to three years if prices increase production will become profitable so
upstream project spending assumptions in business as usual scenarios should be raised but
upstream firms know that demand will slow down over the next 20 to 30 years where will the oil
price go then will companies in the upstream industry still be ready to invest despite the
prospects of shrinking demand or will they make do with profits from high oil prices for as long
as there is demand no wonder scenarios predicting a shift away from oil in the transport
industry are silent about future oil price paths the scenarios envisaging a decline of the oil
industry have departed from prices as the key driver of capital allocation decisions anyway

extending the horizon
economists define a horizon based on the time required for the production potential to change in
services this takes months but in heavy industry the shift could take over a decade in the case
of the fuel and energy sectors the shortterm horizon is up to five years defining the long term
is much more complex if we focus on changes in production potential resulting from the
investment in available technologies the longterm horizon would range from between 15 to
20 years this is long enough for additional fuel and energy output from new projects eg power
stations to reach the market and for consumers to replace old systems and equipment heating
systems vehicles etc however twenty years is much too short a period to apply nascent
innovations on a mass scale and change the rules of the game in the industry efficient energy
storage systems electric cars etc it is precisely this overly short time perspective which is
insufficient to capture the effects of revolutionary shifts in the fuel and energy sectors that

                                                468

explains

scenarios for the oil business
the purpose of scenarios developed by oil companies is twofold to provide a basis for estimating
future earnings in terms of spending capacity these are shared with the market and to set the
direction of capital allocation these remain a business secret until a project is sanctioned the
latter requires a much longer time horizon that the former given the life cycle of production
refining petrochemical and power assets for reasons including the uncertainty of the future
accelerating technology advancement and the emergence of various game changers allocation
scenarios are intended as a safeguard against grave mistakes such as investing in assets which
will have to be written off after two to four decades rather than as a tool to optimise decision
making allocation scenarios materially differ in the assessment of future price and demand
paths some scenarios are viewed as more viable than others companies indirectly use the
knowledge of allocation scenarios when communicating with the market by disclosing demand
and price projections determined on the basis of the paths assumed in the considered scenarios
weighted by the probability of their being met within the next 20 years averaging out the
demand and price paths mitigates the projection error

market communication underpinned by business as usual scenarios
typically a time horizon of 15 to 20 years is long enough for fuel and energy companies to
estimate future returns on assets in operation today and on new investment in existing
technologies particularly after accounting for the time value of money knowing that companies
are reluctant to share details of their investment strategies before any goahead decisions are
made no wonder that longterm outlook reports of global fuel and energy majors do not go
beyond the 15 to 20year horizon and show smooth continuation of price and demand paths for
energy commodities for instance the latest bp energy outlook which presents the most likely
path for energy demand and the evolution of the fuel mix over the next 20 years and shines
a light on the key trends and forces that are likely to shape global energy markets over the next
20 years does not mention an oil demand peak what it does say is that a simple extrapolation
of these trends beyond 2035 would suggest that oil demand may start to decline during the
mid2040s exxonmobil takes a similar stance in its outlook for energy journey to 2040 even
though its time horizon is five years longer the outlook predicts that oil will continue to play
a leading role in the energy mix driven by demand in transportation and feedstock for the
chemical industry

the quoted outlook reports are multifaceted and discuss the risks and uncertainties surrounding
the basecase trend paths they examine megatrends and touch upon structural shifts which are
taking place across the global energy sector but are too gradual and too moderate to change the
rules of the game but it would be a mistake to think that the picture of the future of the fuel and
energy sectors painted in bp and exxonmobils outlook reports is used by the companies to guide
their capital allocation decisions

strategic decisions underpinned by change scenarios
the situation looks very different when it comes to capital allocation given the long life cycle of
oil assets the time horizon adopted in setting the directions of longterm growth must extend far
beyond the next two or three decades only then is it possible to discern the risks associated with
the continued use of the existing business models and gain the time required to make the
necessary adjustments


                                                469

the tightening of the climate change regime like the recent decision of the international marine
organisation to shorten the time allowed to implement the cap reduction on the content of sulfur
in marine fuel from 35 to 05 is by no means the most powerful driver of the structural
transformation of the global energy sector  the progress in digitisation is further reinforced by
technological improvements and new business models that go with the process the combination
of technological social and economic changes brought on by digitisation has been dubbed the
fourth industrial revolution although it is reaching far beyond the industrial sector since
anything digital is also electric the fourth industrial revolution is an electric revolution as well
with farreaching implications for the energy and transport sectors the pace of transition may
suddenly accelerate as the revolution is also having an impact on the demand side of the market
determining which primary energy sources we choose and how we use energy to illustrate this
point google consumes five terawatt hours of electricity annually to power its data centres an
equivalent of the electricity used by all of san francisco in a year over 80 of the electricity
consumed by google comes from renewable sources the use of renewables is driven by
business rationale  the cost per unit of energy is easy to predict and consisting mainly of
depreciation charges it is insensitive to cyclical fluctuations and since electricity is the largest
cost item this helps to keep overall operating costs down therefore a critical factor considered
by google before choosing a site for a new data centre facility is the accessibility of renewable
energy sources

nonbusiness scenarios bring change to the fore
research organisations from outside the business community take an entirely different approach
to energy transition and scenario analysis the worlds most respected energy thinkthank is the
international energy agency iea bringing together oecd member countries its annual world
energy outlook is an extensive report containing alternative scenarios for the global energy
sector one of them is the rigid 450 scenario setting out a pathway to limit global warming to
2c above preindustrial levels by 2040 in the 450 scenario global oil demand peaks in 2020
and then moves into a decline out to 2040 when it reaches 70 of the current consumption
levels few assumptions made in the scenario have actually been met and the iae itself treats it
as a point of departure for developing other scenarios which assume a very slow decline in oil
demand

the role of passenger cars in shaping oil demand
the running theme of the international and domestic debate on the future of oil and liquid fuels
last year was electric mobility and with good reason the future of oil largely depends on how
long it will retain its dominant position as the primary fuel source for transport the world today
consumes 96 mmbd of crude oil and liquid fuels with the transport sector accounting for
56 percent of that equivalent to 54 mmbd demand from the industrial sector as the second
largest consumer is three times lower at just above 18 mmbd 19 percent of global demand
secondly transport relies heavily on oil with 90 percent of the energy that fuels the sector
derived from petroleum central to electric mobility are lightduty vehicles ldv which consume
63 percent of the total crude oil and liquid fuels used in transport 34 mmbd heavy vehicles
account for slightly less than 10 mmbd 18 percent with the other 10 mmbd is consumed
outside the road transport sector 10 percent by air transport 6 percent by maritime transport
15 percent by rail transport and 35 percent by other modes of transport the largest proportion
of light vehicles are passenger cars consuming 19 mmbd of fuels 35 percent of total
consumption in the transport sector this category of vehicles is most heavily influenced by
consumers and their transport choices thus being the most likely electrification and digitisation

                                                 470

target electrification is the replacement of cars with traditional combustion engines by vehicles
powered by an electric power train digitisation may reinforce the process for instance through
car sharing electric cars will be less expensive for users transport demand will rise vehicle
numbers will remain unchanged or rise and the driving range will double in the period of
transition hybrid vehicles are gaining prominence fitting well into the world of combustion
engine vehicles some use an electric motor in addition to a traditional engine others use
a combustion engine as a backup range extender in vehicles with electric drive systems but the
true breakthrough comes with battery electric vehicles bevs popular particularly with
technology enthusiasts and devoted environmentalists norway is an example that electric cars
can be deployed on a mass scale if appropriately dense charging and maintenance infrastructure
is available and incentives both financial and nonfinancial are put in place to encourage electric
car adoption unfortunately the norwegian system is extremely costly and therefore cannot be
easily replicated in other countries so when can we expect a revolution in car transport that will
dethrone crude oil as the main fuel as it turns out a lot depends on the car makers who like
american tesla have taken matters into their own hands and are planning to build a network of
fastcharging stations along europes motorways the global car fleet totalled 09 billion vehicles
in 2015 including 12 million hybrids and evs and 680000 pure electric cars bevs due to the
long service life of a passenger vehicle averaging 20 years roughly 5 percent of the fleet is
replaced every year considering the pace of growth in global fleet numbers and ev penetration
the share of electric cars in the global fleet by 2035 is all but impressive bps outlook puts the
number at 6 percent with the related reduction in oil demand not exceeding 12 mmbd nothing
to worry about but the latest scenarios of academic centres researching changes in the energy
and transport sectors predict that by 2050 electric vehicles will account for 70 percent of the
global passenger car fleet with the worlds demand for oil expected to shrink by over 24 mmbd
it is interesting to note that according to the same scenarios by 2030 electric cars will account
for 5 to 9 percent of the global fleet if we do not look far enough ahead we may fail to notice
a potential threat a growing share of solar and nuclear sources in the global power mix 30
percent and 25 percent respectively will significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions
dieter helm a british economist and specialist on changes in the global energy sector in his
latest book under a telling title burn out  the endgame for fossil fuels argues that the key
drivers of change will be technological innovations and business rather than governments or
regulations aimed at combating climate change economic policies may keep these processes
under control but innovation support tools will play a greater role than instruments for
environmental and climate protection

orlen groups scenarios
projections for crude prices and product and refining margins are just one of a number of
deliverables of scenario analyses and not even the most important one the scenarios are not
meant to foresee the actual course of events but rather to prepare the company for building
sustainable growth strategies which will stay uptodate regardless of the actual developments
a wellorganised scenario analysis will help avoid the four deadly sins of strategic planning
namely i a tendency to hold on to earlier assumptions no matter what ii optimism dominating
over realism iii illusion of control over the course of events and iv attaching too much weight
to recent information therefore it is very important to identify the differentiating factors
between the scenarios each scenario tells a logical story about the crude oil market which may
come true in the future taking a purely mathematical approach we may come to a conclusion
that those stories are countless however building alternative scenarios only makes sense when

                                                471

we can tell several very different stories which may potentially come to life in the future and
change the course of events in the oil market and their number is much smaller the key to
building such scenarios are the most relevant problems which will determine the future of the
global oil market and generate alternative solutions depending on how they are addressed

during the last strategic review we examined threats and opportunities that may come with the
fourth industrial revolution strategic analyses of this sort focus on identifying black swans
understood as a confluence of factors that may precipitate technological and social change
affecting our current areas of activity to the extent that this may derail our business black swans
are events with a low probability and high impact new technologies to produce and use energy
are black swans or the shale revolution which caused oil price falls sidelined opecs control
over prices and is now effectively keeping prices down once the relevant areas have been
identified a change strategy is analysed to clarify the direction we should adopt to exploit the
shifts to our advantage and to verify our ability to do so at the right scale and time strategic
analysis investigating more and less probable scenarios results in a road map for growth
identifying the areas we should exit and the directions we should follow no company will divulge
the findings of its strategic analyses what the official strategy brings to light are the expected
returns under analysed scenarios of change occurring in the external environment or in other
words the probabilityweighted average of returns this approach makes outlook reports
published by companies similar to business as usual scenarios and is safe as a method of
estimating expected returns on assets as weighting eliminates extreme scenarios and mitigates
the risk of error in price path projections

the next five years waiting for oil prices to rise
since we worked on our first outlook in march 2015 the oil market has rebalanced opec is also
back with interventions intended to prevent prices from falling again recovering prices
prompted growth in unconventional production in the us which is characterised by price
elasticity curbing the potential for further increases over the next year or two accordingly
we expect oil prices to hover around usd 55 per barrel in 2017 and 2018 current market
developments are being closely watched by opec considering the viability of further
interventions the cartel wants to see the price of crude at above usd 50 per barrel but below
usd 60 a level which would trigger a rise in new conventional upstream projects leading to price
drops in the longer run as global economic growth is accelerating and oil demand is expected to
rise at a fast pace of around 1617 mmbd in 20172018 and 1314 mmbd in 20172021 on
average the international energy agency predicts oil prices are likely to grow more in three to
four years this view is supported by the large scale of conventional upstream projects planned
for launch in 2015 and 2016 but cancelled or postponed as a result of low oil prices the
mismatch between supply and growing demand was mentioned in our previous outlook reports
as a risk factor potentially speeding up growth in oil prices even today it is difficult to predict the
pace of that growth so we decided not to publish any price assumptions for 20192021 in our
strategy

over the past two years oil market movements have been in line with expectations although
market adjustments have been slower than we had expected no new factors have emerged
outside the realm of policy which is always relevant as a risk factor that would have come as
a surprise and prompted major revisions to expectations for the next five years due to a high
degree of uncertainty we will not even try to guess what oil prices are going to be in the future
because in the commodities sector like ours what matters more is the position on the refining


                                                  472

and petrochemical cost curve in the region and globally and an adequate financial buffer as
these factors determine our resilience to unexpected movements in prices and margins

in this context the regulatory change to marine fuel specification requirements will significantly
impact oil prices and product margins over the next five years the international maritime
organisation resolved to accelerate the implementation of new bunker fuel quality rules by five
years as of january 1st 2020 the sulfur content of marine fuels used worldwide will be capped at
05 instead of the current 35 the change itself is no surprise but it was originally planned
for 2025 the unexpected decision to implement the new rules five years earlier is bound to have
major implications for shipowners and refiners with strong volatility of oil and petroleum product
prices margins expected around the implementation date it is difficult to predict how shippers
and refiners will adapt to the new regime

the long term look far ahead and expect the unexpected
moving on to the longterm horizon worthy of note are major revisions to growth prospects for
the energy and oil sectors that were made during the year  the outlook horizon has been
extended to provide sufficient time for the outcomes of global economic and social megatrends
and new energy technologies to materialise as the energy sector stands out from other
industries for the long service life of its supplyside assets power stations refineries and
energyconsuming systems and equipment vehicles home heating systems as well as for high
equipment replacement costs the global consequences of even farsweeping changes are
impossible to see within a 20year time horizon at least 30 or 40 years are needed for that
extending the time horizon is nothing new as this is the time horizon commonly adopted by
energy companies when calculating returns on key investment projects anyone who has ever
had to deal with largescale capital projects knows that energy price paths are an input to
a projects economic analysis but where to look for energy price projections when we are dealing
with scenarios involving technological breakthroughs

intuition has proven a much better decisionmaking tool than rational calculation models for
many business processes for instance in setting the direction of capital investment allocation
which should factor in the farreaching effects of todays innovations that are bound to drive
change in the long term moving your business on new tracks of innovation is a big task that
cannot be accomplished if you do not trust expert intuition as data on innovation projects is
incomplete it is impossible to perform economic analysis and estimate project costs or future
revenue streams new business projects are so unique that they cannot be subject to rational
evaluation as the basis for the selection process the project owner can only rely on its gut
feeling in the world of conventional projects basing your decision on intuition alone would be
considered a manifestation of economic irrationality and mismanagement but innovation
projects belong to a world where relying on your intuition is the norm simply because there is no
other choice
