    the price of butadiene the raw material for synthetic rubber is declining   smartphones with screens of 350ppi pixels per inch or greater demand is
in line with the prices of crude oil and naphtha and the long slump in the       increasing for zeonorfilm which boasts the performance able to meet that
price of natural rubber continues as a result market conditions for synthetic   shift to high resolution
rubber remain stagnant in domestic sales prices are set in line with the            overall the impact from elastomer materialsrelated business which
price of raw materials in overseas sales however spot prices prevail and       makes up 60 of sales is quite significant
are affected by prices including that of natural rubber which declined over          amid this economic environment the zeon group is tackling issues
a short period with competition from other manufacturers also severe i          focused on the achievement of the sz20 phaseⅱmidterm management

 q what are the current state and future strategies of the elastomer materials business

 a we will focus on creating differentiation in product performance especially in special synthetic rubber and will closely watch the business
      with regard to products for which we have created differentiation we will consider the raw material procurement environment and the
      position of customers as we continue to optimize production sites globally


   in japan procuring the raw materials for synthetic rubber is becoming         overseas yet importing raw materials from overseas increases costs as an
increasingly difficult due to the global consolidation of ethylene production    example we need to make stricter judgments than ever on whether the price
this makes it necessary for us to consider means of procurement from              of synthetic rubber and the price of its primary raw material butadiene are

    in acrylic rubber through our merger with tohpe corporation we are             while we perform comparisons of cost differences among our domestic
engaged in locallyoptimized production at three locations kurashiki           plants we hope to determine on production sites with overall global
kawasaki and kentucky and are increasing profits and creating synergies        optimization in mind our policy is to construct plants near sources of raw
leveraging the heat resistance of acrylic rubber we will specialize in high    materials or near customers including those overseas in order to produce
value products with greater differentiation in performance                      differentiated products as in the case of ssbr in singapore



 q what are the current state and future strategies of the specialty materials business

 a we are currently seeing significant growth in optical films
      our aim is to expand business by accelerating research and development in our three main business areas
      the expansion of energy components for lithiumion batteries and expansion of medical devices are particularly promising areas


   the three main business areas within the specialty materials business         for lithiumion batteries and will expand our product line up to include
are the it components energy components and medical devices within it         products such as aqueous cathode binders while lithiumion batteries
components we have further determined three areas optics electronics and     have always presented safety issues data shows that our new products
implementation optical film and zeonex makes up the bulk of the optics         have greatly enhanced safety through effects such as reducing the swelling
area in response to growing demand for optical film we have expanded           of electrodes while also improving the performance of batteries based on
our manufacturing facilities in takaoka himi and tsuruga we are also          such data we are working to expand our business to meet market demands
continuing research and development aimed at even highervalue optical              with regard to medical devices our cardiovascular catheters and
films together with this we are pursuing research to further enhance the       digestive system endoscopic instruments are now seeing use recently
functionality of raw material resins and are achieving results                 we have also brought to market new instruments for destroying gall stones
    we will require more time in the electronics and implementation areas       through endoscopic surgery for removal from the body in cardiovascular
but we hope to continue pursuing research and development here too to          devices too we plan to bring new products to market this year and are now
bring new products to the world                                                 at the stage where we can anticipate expansion
   in energy components we hold a majority share in anode binders



 q zeon will launch a massproduction plant for singlewalled carbon nanotubes swcnts what is the outlook in this area

 a by mixing swcnts into existing materials we will develop products that display performance not seen before

   this fall we will complete facilities for mass production of swcnts at       also as the material for devices we can enable the effective use of heat and
our tokuyama plant through mass production material that had cost tens         other energy that until now has not been effectively used
or hundreds of thousands of yen per gram will become usable industrially at          the specific form of our materials business using swcnts is not yet
prices quoted per kilogram                                                      apparent we are now at the stage of mixing swcnts with various materials
   when swcnts are mixed with materials their currently known properties        to investigate possibilities while we test performance however we have
imbue the materials with three qualities 1 enhanced strength 2 enhanced    come to understand that mixing swcnts in a variety of areas enables the
thermal conductivity and 3 enhanced electrical conductivity by leveraging    development of brand new materials our hope is to create products making
these qualities and using swcnts not only as a strengthening material but        use of this ability and to expand our business

we must expand sales of existing products while successively bringing             by ramping up communication across fields of research and in particular by
new products and original technologies to market in a form matched to our         creating opportunities for communication with other areas and industries

presentations our top management team including myself always                  and development for new product lines that will greatly contribute to the

laboratories every month or even every two or three weeks and try to convey      launch management and researchers will share information on progress
in easily understood terms what it is that company management is seeking         toward events set within the new product development process and will

 q what are your ideas concerning training and welfare for employees

 a we will educate midcareer employees using a new curriculum i also want to prioritize employees health

  im of the belief that the capabilities of a company are greatly determined       we will also make efforts on behalf of employees health no matter how
by the degree to which persons around age 40 are making efforts the              much we standardize our work our business cannot operate without people
question is one of how much they can change themselves to change the              versed in fields of research and technology apart from sales and profits
company and how much they can break out of their shells i believe we have       i believe it is important that we value the mental and physical health of
to increase opportunities for educating these core persons                       employees so they can exert their capabilities
    we have prepared a new educational curriculum which includes me                 our efforts here have only begun but in the internal status reports we
spending a day to talk about various topics with all staff targeted for           hold every three months i try to not only report on business performance
promotion i recall how such lectures by chairman furukawa who was               but also talk about health and about the taimatsu torchlight  that value

           corporate report 2015

messages from outside directors
zeons outside directors who advise the company on the basis of extensive experience and deep knowledge in their respective fields have provided the following
messages on zeon and its corporate governance




   i come from a background in the assembly industry known as electrical machinery with experience and a culture very different
from that of zeon a chemical company which require huge plants i believe that my role as an outside director is to provide
corporate officers with opportunities to think about matters from broader perspectives through discussions of ideas drawing
on experiences in differing fields
   the things i place importance on in governance are compliance and open management there was a period when cartel
issues were widespread among japanese companies i will watch closely to ensure that the company continues to strive for
compliance zeon must also see to it that the risks in every item for deliberation and other unfavorable items of information are
properly disclosed to outside directors so that judgments can be made i believe that the ability to respond in this way is open
management
   fiscal 2015 is my fifth year in the position over the past four years outside directors have steadily increased in number and     haruo itoh
                                                                                                                                       fuji electric co ltd
discussions have become more active with the number of outside directors reaching three this year i anticipate even higher
                                                                                                                                       advisor
quality debates




    starting in the previous fiscal year i have served for one year as an outside director during that time it has been my
impression that zeon is a sound company that boasts a very high rate of profit within japans chemical industry actively engages
in investment and research and development for the future and conducts governance properly with no impropriety
i sense a seriousness in the companys will to create good products and contribute to society
   while automobiles and machinery are the mainstay industries driving japans economy it is the materials industry that
will support growth from here on out with chemicals occupying an important position within that materials industry the
competitiveness of each material supports the automobile industry as a whole i hope to intensively question and advise zeon
a top player in the materials industry on its role in the future of japans economy and on whether the company is performing
technology development and the rd from a longterm perspective for future growth even at the expense of shortterm profit
   moreover as zeons performance is affected for better and worse by factors such as exchange rates i intend to closely watch       takao kitabata
                                                                                                                                       sanda gakuen junior high school
for any missteps in companys responses to signs of change in europe china or elsewhere in the global economy
                                                                                                                                        high school
                                                                                                                                       chairman of board




   although i began serving as an outside director for zeon this year i have served as an outside corporate auditor for four years
during which time i formed the impression that zeon is a company that properly does what it should in terms of governance
visiting the companys plants and laboratories i felt that there was little distance between top management and employees and
that the atmosphere was conducive to communication moreover in my capacity as the chief executive officer and chairman of
yokohama rubber i have been able to learn from the operational methods of zeons board of directors such as its methods for
reporting on deliberation items in the executive committee
   as an outside director i hope to not only play a role in the oversight of management but also to offer counsel that will make
a positive difference in management as i come from a background in chemistry i have some knowledge of the field moreover
in addition to the relationship that exists between the tire manufacturer yokohama rubber and the materials manufacturer zeon
my company also has dealings with other materials manufacturers while i cannot relate specifics i believe i can offer ideas to       tadanobu nagumo
                                                                                                                                       the yokohama rubber co ltd

  2 applications development

   since 2010 zeon has also participated in the technology research
association for single wall carbon nanotubes and through nedo projects has
conducted development of new materials using swcnts3 when produced using
the supergrowth method swcnts possess properties including long length                                                  swcnts manufactured on substrate
high purity and high surface area compared with other carbon nanotubes and
have been proven to enable the creation of extremely compelling new materials
when blended with other materials
   looking at specific examples swcnts compounded with elastomer materials
have resulted in highdurability conductive materials compound materials
enabling microprocessing and compound materials exhibiting heat conductivity
on par with iron in addition by compounding swcnts with metal materials
an aluminum compound exhibiting heat conductivity of over 800wmk and
a copper compound offering capacity 100 times that of copper have been
developed

the effect of the 3ss on reducing load                                           at the daily operational level but are something deeper as an example an object placed in front of a

environmental initiatives

   environmental philosophy established august 2001
   1 environmental protection is a mission of a socially responsible organization
   2 our basic belief is that environmental protection can be achieved with innovative technology
   3 environmental protection will be achieved when all employees work together with a sense of
       mission to overcome challenges


   zeon established its responsible care policy which embodies the principles of responsible care in
1998 and established its environment philosophy in 2001 within our environmental initiatives we have
set goals for the group that are broadly based on the two pillars of eradicating environmental irregularities
and reducing environmental impacts with each workplace planning and executing specific initiatives



eradication of environmental irregularities and reduction of
environmental impacts
   zeon has set zero environment irregularitiesas a goal to be achieved every year with the exception       environmental irregularities failure to meet environment
                                                                                                                 related statutes or voluntary standards this can also refer

have maintained this goal of zero irregularities                                                                have been met if normal measures had been taken it can
    with regard to the reduction of environmental impacts we have set environmental impact reduction            also refer to a situation in which standards are not set but
targets and are engaging in initiatives in three areas 1 promotion of a voluntary management plan              a complaint was received or in which failure to act might
                                                                                                                 have resulted in a complaint defined in company rules
for airpolluting toxic substances 2 promotion of a zeroemissions plan for industrial wastes and
3 strengthening of our companywide project for energy conservation

1 promotion of a voluntary management plan for airpolluting toxic substances
   acrylonitrile is the substance subject to prtr that is the highest volume raw material processed by
zeon and is also specified as a substance requiring priority action in measures under the air pollution
control law as such we are undertaking planned reductions of our emissions of the substance in fiscal
2014 our emissions volume totaled 115 tons a 098 reduction from the previous fiscal years target
                                                                                                                                                     acrylonitrile recovery
level by strengthening our implementation of acrylonitrile recovery equipment we continue working to
                                                                                                                                                     equipment
reduce emissions

2 promotion of a zeroemissions plan for industrial wastes
    zeons workplaces continue to achieve zero emissions of industrial wastes defined as less than 01
of the volume of emissions in fiscal 2007 a goal we first reached in fiscal 2011 for group companies
in japan the rate stands at 014 of the volume of emissions in fiscal 2007 we will continue striving to
bring the volume down to less than 01


3 strengthening of our companywide project for energy conservation                                            waste sorting yard
   zeon has set a longterm goal of reducing our volume of co2 from fuels as defined by japans law
concerning the rational use of energy the energy conservation law to 80 of our fiscal 1990 level
by fiscal 2020 to achieve this we have set a target of improving unit co2 emissions by 1 per year
in fiscal 2014 we achieved our goal with emissions of about 510000 tons or about 79 of emissions
in fiscal 1990

zeons basic policies on social contributions
   we believe that traditionally social contributions are essentially carried                               core business operations and provide employees with an opportunity to turn
out through core businesses as long as a company is a member of society                                    their attention toward social issues
