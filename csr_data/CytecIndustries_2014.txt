sustainability reporting
one of the elements of cytecs sustainability strategy is
communication which involves reporting progress to key
stakeholders including employees shareholders customers
and the communities surrounding cytec facilities a team
has enhanced the former sustainability reporting and
communication processes

sustainability training
our core sustainability training curriculum remains a key
part of training for cytec employees the heart of the
program is a general awareness component designed for all
cytec employees that includes a short animated video on
sustainability two online training modules introduction to
sustainability at cytec and advanced sustainability training
for the technical community are also available to employees

precautionary productrelated activities
bans restrictions and phaseouts of chemical products are an
emerging issue cytecs product deselection team continues
to refine their strategy and mechanics for identifying chemical
substances that may come under banrestrictionphaseout in
order to avoid impacts to our customers the team developed
a tool that accounts for humanenvironmental hazards
potential exposure and possible business impacts the product
stewardship team supports the individual businesses in their
effort to determine priorities and a course of action for these
chemicals eg reformulate design replacement product etc
taking into account potential business impacts

cytecs practical sustainability model
we continue to review ways that sustainability can be
applied across our enterprise the sustainability model can
zero in on which aspects apply to raw material supply all
the way through to the customer while focusing on value
creation because were committed to adding value for our
customers our efforts focus not only on improving the
sustainability of our own products and processes but also on
extending technology to our customers that will improve the
sustainability of their operations

max ht bayer sodalite scale inhibitor                                   of traditional xanthate collectors which produce toxic carbon
the us environmental protection agency epa honored cytec               disulfide byproducts from decomposition flotation matrix
industries with the 2012 green chemistry award for the max ht            100 reagent is used to redesign flotation collection blends for
bayer sodalite scale inhibitor in the bayer process sodalite scale     improved worker safety lowers the reagent dosage versus the
deposits form within heat exchanger tubes and interstage piping        incumbent and further reduces the overall process footprint
thus reducing throughput while increasing energy use and waste          eliminates the worker inhalation exposure to carbon disulfide
removing the scale requires cleaning mechanically andor with acid
cytec provides an alternative solution to this arduous and difficult
problem through use of the max ht bayer sodalite scale inhibitor
twenty plants worldwide are using max ht which has realized
annual energy savings of up to 47 trillion btu  the equivalent of
up to 8 billion pounds of carbon dioxide co2 not released to the
atmosphere in addition fewer cleaning cycles and less acid per cycle
result in hazardous waste reductions of up to 200 million pounds
and water savings of millions of gallons each plant using max ht
realizes savings of up to several million dollars per annum
reduces energy consumption and waste generation at our
customers sites

phosflow reagents inhibiting scale formation
phosflow reagent reduces scale buildup in phosphoric acid
plants to maintain high heat transfer in heat exchangers and
sustain elevated production phosphoric acid is a key raw material
for phosphatebased fertilizers that enhances crop yields of arable
land helping to address the increasing global demand for food
phosflow reagent can help enable longer cycle times increase
production and reduce waste and exposure to hazardous conditions
for plant personnel
reduces energy consumption hazards and waste associated with
scale removal while allowing acid plants to maximize production
