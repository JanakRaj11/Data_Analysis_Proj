business strategy
we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our
shareholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to



                                                                  5

acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across
multiple business segments and geographic locations including europe ii to align ourselves with
leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in
higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to
concentrate on longerterm escalating triplenet leases with highquality tenants while using ridea
structures for properties that have higher growth potential iv to maintain adequate liquidity with
longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our
investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the
interest rate or credit cycles and v to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial
leverage of 40 relative to our assets

internal growth strategies
we believe that our longerterm escalating triplenet leases with financially strong tenants and operators
enhance the quality stability and growth of our rental income further we believe many of our existing
properties hold the potential for increased future cash flows as they are of high quality and in desirable
locations within markets where the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the
difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for
maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators
to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in
order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties
we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to
   build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and
    operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus our attention on their physical
    environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers
    proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors
   replace tenants and operators quickly at the best available market terms and lowest possible
    transaction costs we believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and
    achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and
    maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and
    responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolios
   extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early
    renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment
    risk resulting from the exercise of tenants purchase options while securing the tenancy andor
    relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis

investment strategies
the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on
real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate
market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling demographics driving the demand for
healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing
consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector
while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing
to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare
real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits
operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment
strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or
limited liability companies




                                                      6

we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be
invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that
may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating
capital to our multiple segments we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for
our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our
investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring
tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of
guarantees letters of credit or security deposits
we believe we are well positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and
development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include
   our reputation gained through nearly 30 years of successful operations and the stability and strength
    of our existing portfolio of properties
   our relationships with leading healthcare operators private equity firms corporations nonprofits and
    public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities
   our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality healthcare real estate assets
   our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing due to the strength of our experienced
    management team and balance sheet liquidity
   our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently which provides
    confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real
    estate in our market areas
   our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare
    and real estate industries and
   our control of sites including assets under contract with radius restrictions

financing strategies
because our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income
excluding net capital gains we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds
necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance
maturing debt
we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles
   issuance of common or preferred stock
   issuance or origination of debt including unsecured notes and mortgage debt
   borrowings under our credit facility or
   sale of ownership interests in properties or other investments
we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining
multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and
secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and
our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered
maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations
we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm
purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings
from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering equity and debt securities
placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders

competition
investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from
other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign



                                                     7

funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have
greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased
competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that
meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic
trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation
costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends
income from our investments is dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with
other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation
success of product or drug development the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services
offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral
sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial
condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs and government
reimbursement as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the
profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive
conditions affecting our business see item 1a risk factors in this report

healthcare segments
senior housing at december 31 2014 we had interests in 479 senior housing facilities including 14
properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures our senior housing facilities are primarily
triplenet leased and include independent living facilities ilfs assisted living facilities alfs
memory care facilities mcfs care homes and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs
which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services
provided by our tenants or operators in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or
through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare
and medicaid our senior housing property types are further described below
   independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an
    environment surrounded socially by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and
    activities these residents generally do not need assistance with activities of daily living adl
    however in some of our facilities residents have the option to contract for these services at
    december 31 2014 we had interests in 64 ilfs
   assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support
    and housing for those who need help with adl such as bathing eating dressing and medication
    management yet require limited medical care the programs and services may include transportation
    social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities
    community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these
    facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to
    large apartments certain alfs may dedicate a portion of a facility that offer higher levels of personal
    assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of alzheimers disease or other forms of
    dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations at december 31 2014
    we had interests in 345 alfs
   memory care facilities mcfs address the unique challenges of our residents with alzheimers disease
    or other forms of dementia residents may live in semiprivate apartments or private rooms and have
    structured activities delivered by staff members trained specifically on how to care for residents with
    memory impairment these facilities offer programs that provide comfort and care in a secure
    environment for residents with memory loss issues in comfortable settings at december 31 2014 we

      care some homes can be further registered for a specific care need such as dementia or terminal
      illness at december 31 2014 we had interests in 23 care homes
     continuing care retirement communities ccrcs offer several levels of assistance including
      independent living assisted living and nursing home care ccrcs are different from other housing
      and care options for seniors because they usually provide written agreements or longterm contracts
      between residents and the communities frequently lasting the term of the residents lifetime which
      offer a continuum of housing services and healthcare on one campus or site ccrcs are appealing as
      they allow residents to age in place ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good
      health and independent upon entry at december 31 2014 we had interests in 26 ccrcs

we have entered into longterm agreements with brookdale to manage properties that are operated under
a structure permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 commonly referred to as
ridea under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease a qualified healthcare property on an
arms length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary trs if the property is operated on behalf of such
subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor ridea structures allow us to
own the risks and rewards of the operations of healthcare facilities as compared to leasing the property
for contractual triplenet rents in a tax efficient manner we view ridea as a structure primarily to be
used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points andor growth profiles by i transitioning
the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or
ii investing capital to reposition the asset brookdale provides comprehensive facility management and
accounting services with respect to our senior housing ridea properties for which we pay annual
management fees pursuant to the aforementioned agreements most of the management agreements have
terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with 5year renewals the base management fees are 45 to 50 of
gross revenues as defined generated by the ridea facilities in addition there are incentive
management fees payable to brookdale if operating results of the ridea properties exceed
preestablished ebitdar as defined thresholds as of january 1 2015 83 properties are under ridea
structures 14 of which are owned by our ccrc unconsolidated joint venture discussed below in item 7

insurance
we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability
flood windstorm earthquake environmental and terrorism related losses we attempt to obtain
appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of



                                                             11

such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such
as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in
addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm
occurrences for which the related insurances carry higher deductibles
we maintain property insurance for all of our properties and this insurance is primary for our medical
office life science and ridea facilities tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our senior housing
postacuteskilled nursing and hospital segments are required to provide primary property business
interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for
our ridea facilities additionally our corporate general and professional liability insurance program also
extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned under our management agreements
with brookdale we may elect on an annual basis whether we or brookdale will bear responsibility for
maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable properties but the costs of such insurance
are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance

employees of hcp
at december 31 2014 we had 170 fulltime employees none of whom are subject to a collective

government regulation licensing and enforcement
overview
our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare
laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government
reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities
and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and
pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of
services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to
civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult
to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in
many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government
agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations
reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all
have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us
as detailed below and set forth under item 1a risk factors in this report
based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office
segment at december 31 2014 we estimate that approximately 15 and 14 of the annualized base
rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid
reimbursement respectively
the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in
certain cases to us

fraud and abuse enforcement
there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare
providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such
providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit
providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid
or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes
including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of



                                                      12

remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and
state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit
referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial
relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the
knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state
privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and
accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as hipaa which provide for the privacy and security
of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and
administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of
medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal
or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and
can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts
which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our tenants and
operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if
they fail to comply with applicable laws

reimbursement
sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare
programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental
thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on
healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant current and
future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in
reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and
operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs including but not limited to
medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations aco and bundled payments
could adversely impact our tenants and operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations

healthcare licensure and certificate of need
certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure
certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to
dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states
require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the
construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state
certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their
businesses

life science facilities
while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less
established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug
administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical
product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the
extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating
that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance

senior housing entrance fee communities
certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance
fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange
for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state
regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment
and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel
their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change
of ownership and similar matters


                                                      13

americans with disabilities act the ada
our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such
properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of
barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal
is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have
caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by
persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible
for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada
could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make
readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our
properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect

environmental matters
a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and
regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their
enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the
potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal
state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured
lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances
at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to
hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and
adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages
and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in
addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such
substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated
with environmental matters see item 1a risk factors in this report

item 1a risk factors
the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our
business results of operations and financial condition
as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories
   risks related to our business and operations
   risks related to our capital structure and market conditions



                                                      14

   risks related to other events and
   risks related to tax including reitrelated risks

risks related to our business
we depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our
revenues
during the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 40 of our revenues were generated by our
leasing or financial arrangements with the following two companies hcrmc 26 and brookdale
14 the inability or other failure of these tenants or operators to meet their obligations to us could
materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount
of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other materially adverse effects on our
business results of operations and financial condition
in addition any failure by these tenants or operators to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain
and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and
retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a materially adverse effect on our
business results of operations and financial condition these tenants and operators generally have also
agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities
arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot provide any assurance that they will
have sufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their
indemnification obligations

our ownership interest in and lease with our largest tenant hcrmc accounts for a significant portion of
our assets and revenues adverse regulatory or operational developments in hcrmcs business or
financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us
hcrmc is a provider of a range of healthcare services primarily in postacute care skilled nursing care
and assisted living and our largest tenant representing 31 and 26 of our gross assets and revenues
respectively as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 we also own a 94 equity interest in
hcrmc which we acquired together with our april 2011 6 billion acquisition of substantially all the real
estate assets of hcrmc in december 2014 we recorded an impairment charge of 36 million for our
equity ownership interest in hcrmc primarily resulting from our review of their 2015 preliminary base
financial forecast and other financial information provided by hcrmc that reflected a continued shift in
patient payor sources from medicare to medicare advantage which negatively impacts reimbursement
rates and length of stay for hcrmcs skilled nursing segment
additionally hcrmc has responded to a civil investigative demand subpoenas and other requests for
information regarding their skilled nursing facilities in connection with an inquiry coordinated by the us
department of justice the department of health and human services office of inspector general and
certain state attorneys general offices hcrmc believes it is in material compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations however since the review is ongoing the ultimate outcome is uncertain and could
among other things 1 require substantial time and costs to continue to respond to and defend hcrmcs
actions 2 require hcrmc to refund or adjust amounts previously paid for services under governmental
programs 3 require payment of substantial fines penalties or other sanctions 4 result in the loss of
hcrmcs right to participate in the medicare or medicaid programs or 5 cause damage to hcrmcs
reputation
continued deterioration in hcrmcs operating performance or other adverse developments in its
business operating and regulatory affairs or financial condition could reduce the revenues we earn under
our master lease with hcrmc andor impair the value of our master lease with hcrmc either of which
could have a material adverse effect on us




                                                     15

see additional information regarding the aforementioned impairment charge 94 equity interest in
hcrmc and master lease with hcrmc in i item 7 results of operations postacuteskilled nursing
segment 20142013 comparison and ii note 6 dfls note 8 unconsolidated joint ventures and
note 17 impairments to the consolidated financial statements

the properties managed by brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating
income adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could have a
materially adverse effect on us
as of january 1 2015 brookdale managed 69 senior housing facilities that we own and 14 ccrcs owned
by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm management agreements these properties
represent a substantial portion of our portfolio based on their gross book value and account for a
significant portion of our revenues and noi although we have various rights as the property owner under
our management agreements we rely on brookdales personnel expertise technical resources and
information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our senior living
operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees to provide
accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our
senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all
applicable laws and regulations
in its capacity as a manager brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore we are not directly
exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triplenet tenant however any
adverse developments in brookdales business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to
manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us
brookdale is also one of our triplenet tenants if brookdale experiences any significant financial legal
accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise such difficulties could result in
among other adverse events acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital
the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings
by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a
materially adverse effect on us

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants or operators may
materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition
we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third
party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties
although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators
generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator
or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford
certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these
remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot
evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to
assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a
debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be
limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the
remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding
that our lease should be recharacterized as a financing agreement in which case our rights and remedies
as a lender compared to a landlord generally would be more limited
also if a debtormanager seeks bankruptcy protection the automatic stay provisions of the us
bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first
obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case in any of these events we also may
be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance



                                                     16

expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or
transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager furthermore many of our facilities are
leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators
for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural requirements and may
not be successful
additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or
comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in
our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants
and operators or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations under certain conditions defaults
under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we
believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those
circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable tenant or operator may potentially result in less favorable
borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse
consequences

increased competition has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants
and operators and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us
the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our
facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other
tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation
the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for
healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the
size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area
our tenants and operators also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare
services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service
programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which is due in part to
historical over development in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly
constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities
were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the tenants and operators of
all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of
their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are
superior to those of our tenants and operators thus our tenants and operators may encounter increased
competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their
businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual
obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing our
collection and dispute costs

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow
our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and
operators
we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund
investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some
of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it
more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals
and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our
investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants
and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain
tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our
development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices



                                                      17

finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and
operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our
revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial
condition
for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 35 of our revenue was derived from properties
located in california 23 and texas 12 as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse
conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real
estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and
local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could
adversely affect our business and results of operations

we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties
suitable for other tenants and operators
healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcare
related uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as
upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or
replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenants or
operators particular business if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a
property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another
tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations
may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or
not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once
undertaken
largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including
risks that
   a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the
    loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred
   the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased
    interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the
    completion of the development project less profitable
   construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all
   the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our
    control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil
    unrest and acts of war which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or
    provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate preconstruction leases and
   occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be
    insufficient to make the property profitable




                                                    18

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments
we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other
persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint
ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including
   we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking
    authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or
    potential disputes including litigation or arbitration
   our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment
    objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments
   our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market
    for our interest may be limited
   our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create
    conflicts of interest and risk to our reit status
   our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital
    contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to
    infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such
    capital and
   our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of
    interest issues

from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these
operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected
acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful
integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate
operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we
may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include
the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible
inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected
liabilities including
   liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions
   unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller
   liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to
    periods prior to our acquisition
   claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller
    and
   liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition
in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in
respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could
result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating
expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we
have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience
unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we
expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations
and financial condition




                                                     19

from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions
which may involve the expenditure of significant funds
we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value future acquisitions may
require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence
of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial
condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be
available on commercially favorable terms or at all

our tenants and operators may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses
our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and
property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators certain losses may not be
adequately insured by our tenants and operators for example many healthcare companies utilize different
organizational and corporate structures coupled with selfinsurance trusts or captive programs that may
provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy companies that insure any part of their
general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities may
underestimate the future cost of claims and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the
actual cost of those claims should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could
incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated
future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any
mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance
maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly
situated companies in our industry however we cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to
require the same level of insurance coverage of our tenants and operators or that such insurance will be
available at a reasonable cost in the future also we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or
losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future

our tenants and operators face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs
in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities
and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities also in
several instances private litigation by patients has resulted in large damage awards for alleged abuses the
effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our
tenants and operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of
liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a
reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could
cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the
appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our
collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be
named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our tenants or operators for which
claims such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and
against but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid
may adversely affect our operators ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us
certain of our tenants and operators are affected by an extremely complex set of federal state and local
laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs such laws and regulations are
subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see item 1
businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that




                                                       20

any of our tenants or operators receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors
primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to
   statutory and regulatory changes
   retroactive rate adjustments
   recovery of program overpayments or setoffs
   court decisions
   administrative rulings
   policy interpretations
   payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers
   government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and
   interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such
    properties
if our tenants and operators fail to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements
applicable to their business and the operation of our properties they could become ineligible to receive
reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs face bans on admissions of new patients or
residents suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations
our tenants also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other
enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations in such event the results of operations and
financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities
could be adversely affected which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us we are unable to
predict future federal state and local regulations and legislation including the medicare and medicaid
statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and
legislation and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our
tenants which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us
in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to
budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to
federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that
any future legislative reforms may have on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the
amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants or
operators to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services
reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet
their financial and contractual obligations to us

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers
for medicare and medicaid services could have a materially adverse effect on our operators liquidity
financial condition or results of operations
enactment of the consolidated appropriations act of 2014 and congressional consideration of legislation
pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act as defined below tax reform and
entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a materially adverse effect
on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular changes in funding
for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid may result in increased costs and fees for
programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers
additionally amendments to the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care
and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act implementation of the
affordable care act and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the
delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect
our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs such changes
could have a materially adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of




                                                     21

operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a
materially adverse effect on us
furthermore the supreme courts decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual healthcare
mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state medicaid programs with a
federally mandated expansion of those programs has contributed to the uncertainty regarding the impact
that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade we can expect that federal
authorities will continue to implement the law but because of the supreme courts mixed ruling the
implementation will take longer than originally expected with a commensurate increase in the period of
uncertainty regarding the longterm financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare

tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations
including licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet
their financial and other contractual obligations to us
our tenants and managers are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state local
and international laws and regulations these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting
consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants
and operators conduct their operations such as fire health and safety laws and privacy laws federal and
state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other healthcare communities that participate in both medicare
and medicaid that mandate allowable costs pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of
services and care food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the healthcare
industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and
physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by
the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies certain of our properties
may also require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate
our tenants or operators failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could
result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification
from government healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility andor the incurrence of
considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action which may have an adverse effect on
facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see item 1
businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcementhealthcare licensure and certificate of
need above

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty
life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are
subject to certain unique risks including the following
   some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research development and clinical
    testing of their products and technologies if private investors the government or other sources of
    funding are unavailable to support such activities a tenants business may be adversely affected or fail
   the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants
    products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to
    obtain
   even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still
    present significant regulatory and liability risks including among others the possible later discovery
    of safety concerns competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection
    for the product
   our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the
    reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors and




                                                     22

   our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or
    trade secret laws
if our tenants businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which
could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even
if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition
the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments
if a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose
on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial
improvements or repairs in order to maximize the propertys investment potential in some cases the
collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real
property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that
entity tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek
bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for
lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high
loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal
to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation
allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real
estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or
operators if at all or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to
limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our
investment

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities
transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals
or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws
and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of
commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be
delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for
the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are
unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take
possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability require us to indemnify subsequent
operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses or spend substantial time and funds
to adapt the facility to other uses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of
operations and financial condition

risks related to our capital structure and market conditions
volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain
new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities
the global financial markets have experienced pervasive and fundamental disruptions while these
conditions have stabilized since the first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets continue to show signs of
improvement the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain additional levels of
market disruption volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital
obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and
development activities
market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of
our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of
our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and
the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings


                                                      23

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and limitations on our access to such
capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or
make future investments necessary to grow our business
we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations if we are unable to
obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and
equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of
factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to
   general availability of credit and market conditions including rising interest rates and increased
    borrowing cost
   the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred
    securities
   the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and
    cash distributions
   our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility
   the financial integrity of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us
    or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing
    commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all
   the stability of the market value of our properties
   the financial performance and general market perception of our tenants and operators
   changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the
    united states of its obligations
   issues facing the healthcare industry including but not limited to healthcare reform and changes in
    government reimbursement policies and
   the performance of the national and global economies generally
if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could have a materially adverse impact
on our ability to fund operations repay or refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire
properties and make the investments needed to grow our business

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity
financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including
our common stock
our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any
financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit
ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing
costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing
obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or
other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt
instruments the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on among other things our
operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position level of indebtedness and
pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations
our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2014 was approximately 98 billion we may incur
additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of
assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit
ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and
principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds
available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and



                                                      24

acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also make us
more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive
disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt
service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our
properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed

covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could
materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition
the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments and other indebtedness that we may
incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other
covenants such as maintaining leverage ratios minimum tangible net worth requirements reit status
and certain levels of debt service coverage our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct
business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our
operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as
those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the
applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may
result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other
indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee covenants that limit our
operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could
materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition

an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact
our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and conduct acquisition investment and development
activities
if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the
financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our
ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing
and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could
decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition
our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions
we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and
through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of
hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap
agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these
arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate
changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax
provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our
debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk if
we choose to engage in such activities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition

we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates
we continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the
denominated currency the ownership of investments located outside of the united states subjects us to
risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant
change in the value of the british pound or other currencies in countries where we have a significant
investment may have a materially adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of
operations and cash flow




                                                      25

we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of
derivative contracts or other methods for example as of january 30 2015 we have 492 million in debt
investments and maintain an equal amount of unsecured gbp denominated debt as a natural hedge
additionally we executed currency swap contracts to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted
interest receipts on these investments however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from
the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the failure to hedge effectively
against foreign currency exchange rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could materially
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any international currency
gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test
or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a
reit

risks related to other events
we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations
which may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders
the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not
engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances
specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an
interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent
date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified
criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or
indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation
unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions
from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business
combinations between us and other persons
in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination
act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in
certain circumstances business combinations including a merger or consolidation and certain asset
transfers and issuances of securities with a related person including a beneficial owner of 10 or more
of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our
outstanding voting stock
the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may
delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a
premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their
best interests

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition
from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named
as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and
operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless an
unfavorable resolution of any such litigation may have a materially adverse effect on our business results
of operations and financial condition regardless of the outcome litigation or other legal proceedings may
result in substantial costs disruption of our normal business operations and the diversion of management
attention there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of
any pending or future legal action against us




                                                     26

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us
we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense
although our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief investment officer and general counsel
have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us the
loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and
retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a materially adverse effect on our
business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital
invested in a property lower than expected future revenues or unanticipated expense
we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and
deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage
and we regularly review our insurance coverage however a large number of our properties are located in
areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other
losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake
activity while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural
disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside
consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can result in
decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have
invested in a property following these events we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other
financial obligations related to the property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile
and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the
future in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not
believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estaterelated investments may be
substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments
federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations may require us as a current or previous owner of
real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a
property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for
investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the
costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien
on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with
the contamination
although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is
commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for
environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial
ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner
of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental
contamination emanating from the site including the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air
we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us the cost of
defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting
remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be
substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial
condition
in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially
adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or
security failure of that technology could harm our business
we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and
store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial
transactions and records and maintaining personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we
purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on
commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing
transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data including individually identifiable
information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of our
information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security
measures will not prevent the systems improper functioning or damage or the improper access or
disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches
including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can
create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information the risk of
security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attacks have
increased in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the
damage they cause any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information
systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory
penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of
operations

risk related to tax including reitrelated risks
loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially
adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock
qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of
the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial
and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and
circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables
us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to
meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock
ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at
least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make
distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding
net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions
could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the
federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our
stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a
manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit
if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds
available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make
distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit
   we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income
   we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on
    our taxable income at regular corporate rates
   we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes and
   unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from
    taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a
    reit



                                                      28

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our
business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock
the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by
legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax
treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under
review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the irs and
the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to
regulations and interpretations revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or
cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in
us

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit
delay or impede future sales of our properties
if during the tenyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on
the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of
such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that
date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular
corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these
requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties
in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to
the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and
penalties if any

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits ep in certain
acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep
in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the
accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable
year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our
disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is
a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we
undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently
believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however
substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could
successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would
increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could
result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable
distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or
could result in our disqualification as a reit
thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of
the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to
cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take
advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so

our international expansion may result in additional taxrelated risks
we have recently expanded our operations to include the united kingdom and may continue to expand
internationally international expansion presents taxrelated risks that are different from those we face
with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to
   international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not always
    qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in
    order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit
   challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash and
   challenges of complying with foreign tax rules including the possible revisions in tax treaties or other
    laws and regulations including those governing the taxation of our international income

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock
our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock
that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to
certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by
number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any
class or series of our preferred stock
additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting
shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its
sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may
delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our
common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders

results of operations
we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments i senior housing
ii postacuteskilled nursing iii life science iv medical office and v hospital under the medical
office segment we invest through the acquisition and development of mobs which generally require a
greater level of property management otherwise we primarily invest through the acquisition and
development of real estate in single tenants and operators occupied properties and debt issued by tenants
and operators in these sectors the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

nongaap financial measures
same property portfolio
our evaluation of results of operations by each business segment includes an analysis of noi and adjusted
noi of our same property portfolio spp and our total property portfolio we believe noi provides
relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are
incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis we use noi and adjusted noi
to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance spp
noi and adjusted noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under
a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties we
identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as
leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the yearoveryear comparison periods
presented accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a
consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally
considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at
least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and
redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the
property is placed in service spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are
allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis a property is removed from our spp when it
is sold or placed into redevelopment noi and adjusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial
measures for a reconciliation of net income to noi and adjusted noi and other relevant disclosure refer
to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements
operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and senior housing
ridea properties we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science
property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and
administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of
expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the
expenses

funds from operations
we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted
ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a
reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline
depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets
diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with
market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for
depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this
issue
ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit is net income
applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales
of property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and dfl depreciation
and amortization and after adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to
reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in
accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be
considered an alternative to net income we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit
definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the
current nareit definition from ours




                                                     42

in addition we present ffo before the impact of severancerelated charges litigation settlement charges
preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets and transaction
related items defined below ffo as adjusted transactionrelated items include acquisition and
pursuit costs eg due diligence and closing and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and
acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities management believes that ffo as adjusted
provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo runrate this measure is a modification of
the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income determined in
accordance with gaap or nareit ffo

funds available for distribution
fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following i amortization of acquired
market lease intangibles net ii amortization of deferred compensation expense iii amortization of
deferred financing costs net iv straightline rents v accretion and depreciation related to dfls and
vi deferred revenues effective 2014 excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated
with tenant funded improvements ownedrecognized by us and upfront cash payments made by tenants to
reduce their contractual rents also fad is i computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures
including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and ii includes lease
restructure payments and adjustments to compute our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint
ventures and those related to ccrc nonrefundable entrance fees other reits or real estate companies
may use different methodologies for calculating fad and accordingly our fad may not be comparable to
those reported by other reits although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other
reits management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our ability to fund our
ongoing dividend payments in addition management believes that in order to further understand and
analyze our liquidity fad should not be compared with net cash flows from operating activities as
determined in accordance with gaap and presented in our consolidated financial statements fad does
not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and fad
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an
indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities determined in
accordance with gaap or as a measure of our liquidity

net operating income noi
noi and adjusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating
performance of real estate noi is defined as rental and related revenues including tenant recoveries
resident fees and services and income from dfls less property level operating expense noi excludes all
other financial statement amounts included in net income as presented in note14 to the consolidated
financial statements management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it
reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them
on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline
rents dfl accretion amortization of market lease intangibles and lease termination fees adjusted noi is
oftentimes referred to as cash noi we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource
allocations and to assess and compare property level performance we believe that net income is the most
directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of
operating performance to net income as defined by gaap because it does not reflect various excluded
items further our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real
estate companies as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating noi

ffo increased 005 per share primarily as a result of i net gains from the brookdale transaction
ii increased noi from our spp and our 2013 and 2014 acquisitions and iii a general and administrative
charge in 2013 resulting from the termination of our former chief executive officer the aforementioned
were partially offset by i an impairment charge in 2014 for our equity ownership investment in hcrmc
and ii favorable onetime items including interest income in 2013 from the par payoff of our barchester
debt investments and sale of marketable equity securities
ffo as adjusted and fad increased 002 and 003 per share respectively primarily as a result of
increased noi from our spp and 2013 and 2014 acquisitions which were partially offset by favorable
onetime items including interest income in 2013 from the par payoff of our barchester debt investments
and sale of marketable equity securities
earnings per share eps decreased 013 per share primarily as a result of i decreased gain on sales
of real estate and ii increased depreciation expense partially offset by the net result of the
aforementioned events impacting ffo

segment noi and adjusted noi
the tables below provide selected operating information for our spp and total property portfolio for each
of our five business segments our consolidated spp consists of 1011 properties representing properties
acquired or placed in service and stabilized on or prior to january 1 2013 and that remained in operations
under a consistent reporting structure through december 31 2014 our consolidated total property
portfolio represents 1108 and 1079 properties at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively and excludes
properties classified as discontinued operations

senior housing
as part of the previously described brookdale transaction we contributed 49 properties one property was
contributed on january 1 2015 that were triplenet leased into a ridea structure with brookdale
managing the communities and acquiring a 20 equity interest in the ridea partnerships for the 49
properties in the ridea partnerships we report the residentlevel revenues and corresponding operating
expenses in our consolidated financial statements rather than the pretransaction triplenet rents in future
periods we expect increases in resident fee and service revenue and operating expenses and a decrease in
rental and related revenues
additionally we created the ccrc jv which is managed by brookdale in future periods we expect to
record our share of income from unconsolidated joint ventures also as a result of deconsolidating three
senior housing properties that were contributed to the ccrc jv we expect a decrease in rental and
related revenues and depreciation expense

increased as a result of recognizing net fees of 38 million from the brookdale transaction see note 3 to

3   represents average capacity as reported by the respective tenants or operators for a twelvemonth period that is a quarter in

noi and adjusted noi spp and total portfolio noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of
annual rent escalations from our hcrmc dfl investments
hcrmc equity method and dfl investments on december 19 2014 we concluded that our 94 equity
ownership interest in hcrmc was otherthantemporarily impaired and we recorded an impairment
charge of 36 million or 008 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014 the impairment charge
reduced the carrying amount of our equity investment in hcrmc to 39 million we made this conclusion
principally based on the receipt and review of hcrmcs preliminary base financial forecast for 2015
together with hcrmcs yeartodate operating results through november 2014 hcrmcs preliminary
base financial forecast and operating results primarily reflected a continued shift in patient payor sources
from medicare to medicare advantage which negatively impacts reimbursement rates and length of stay
for hcrmcs skilled nursing segment hcrmc has indicated that its 2015 preliminary base financial
forecast does not include the effect of any dispositions acquisitions or other initiatives hcrmc may
undertake to improve financial performance in 2015
we believe that hcrmcs trailing twelvemonth fixed charge coverage tfcc ratio may continue to
deteriorate over the next several quarters hcrmcs 2015 preliminary base financial forecast implies that
the tfcc ratio is projected to decline to 107x at the end of 2015 compared to the tfcc ratio of 108x at
the end of 2014 before the impact of 24 million of certain general and professional liability charges that
hcrmc incurred in the second quarter of 2014 as noted above the tfcc ratio is calculated using
hcrmcs 2015 preliminary base financial forecast that does not include the effects of any dispositions
acquisitions or other initiatives hcrmc may undertake to improve financial performance in 2015
notwithstanding these developments hcrmcs 2015 preliminary base financial forecast also indicates
that hcrmc will continue to meet its contractual obligations to us under a master lease the master
lease therefore we continue to believe that the collection and timing of all amounts owed by hcrmc
under our master lease are reasonably assured hcrmc believes that it is favorably positioned to grow as
part of the ongoing changes in the healthcare environment


                                                                   46

based on discussions with the management of hcrmc and our evaluation of other industry data we note
the following factors that influenced our evaluation of hcrmc i medicare rate increases of 17 and
14 took effect on october 1 2014 for the skilled nursing and hospice businesses respectively
ii additional cost cutting measures were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014 iii new facility
developments and expansions will be operational in 2015 iv assisted living and hospice operations
demonstrated continued growth v hcp and hcr manorcare have jointly agreed to market for sale
certain nonstrategic assets that are under the master lease the purpose of the dispositions is to increase
ebitdar reduce rent and improve hcrmcs tfcc however no assurances can be given that the
facilities will be sold or as to the timing of the sales and vi hospital admissions are forecasted to improve
in 2015
while we remain confident in hcrmcs ongoing adjustments to their business model hcrmc has not
been able to reverse the decline in their financial performance failure of hcrmc to reverse the decline
in its financial performance may lead us to conclude that the collection and timing of contractual
obligations or a portion thereof under the master lease may not be reasonably assured in which case we
would place the hcrmc dfl or a portion thereof on nonaccrual status if we further determine that it
is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due under the terms of the master lease we may
incur an impairment on our hcrmc dfl or a portion thereof

3   represents average capacity as reported by the respective tenants or operators for a twelvemonth period that is a quarter in
      arrears from the periods presented certain operators in our hospital portfolio are not required under their respective leases to
      provide operational data

spp and total portfolio noi and adjusted noi spp and total portfolio noi primarily decreased due to a
net 12 million correction in 2013 that reduced previously recognized noncash revenues including
straightline rents and to increasing amortization of below market lease intangibles related to our medical
city dallas hospital spp and total portfolio adjusted noi increased due to annual rent increases a new
lease on our plano hospital and rents on our fresno hospital that was placed in service in january 2013

other income and expense items
interest income interest income increased 62 million to 86 million for the year ended december 31
2013 the increase was primarily the result of interest income from the repayment of our barchester loan
in september 2013 acquired earlier in 2013 at a discount additional interest income earned from the
second tranche of our mezzanine loan facility to tandem health care in june 2013 and interest earned
from our four seasons senior unsecured notes purchased in 2012 see notes 7 and 10 to the consolidated
financial statements
interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 interest expense increased 19 million to
435 million the increase was primarily the result of increases in the average outstanding indebtedness
during 2013 compared to 2012 and a decrease of capitalized interest in 2013 related to assets that were
under development in our life science and medical office segments and were placed in service during 2013
and 2012 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest rates
our exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by our interest

december 31 2012 included 7 million related to an insurance recovery for previously incurred legal
expenses

acquisition and pursuit costs acquisition and pursuit costs decreased 5 million to 6 million for the year
ended december 31 2013 the decrease was primarily the result of acquiring 133 senior housing
communities from the blackstone jv during the fourth quarter of 2012

impairments during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized impairments of 1 million
included in discontinued operations as a result of the reclassification of two mobs to held for sale see

recognized an impairment of 8 million as a result of the disposition of a life science land parcel see
note 17 to the consolidated financial statements

18 million the increase was primarily the result of gains from the sale of marketable equity securities
during 2013 of 11 million

income taxes for the year ended december 31 2013 income taxes increased by 7 million to 6 million
the increase in income taxes was primarily due to the increase in taxable income of our trs entities
during the year ended december 31 2013

equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31 2013 equity income
from unconsolidated joint ventures increased 10 million to 64 million the increase was primarily the
result of i a onetime distribution received from a senior housing development joint venture that
exceeded our investment balance and ii the improved operating performance from our hcrmc equity
investment

discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2013
was 74 million compared to 46 million for the comparable period in 2012 the increase is primarily due
to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of 38 million partially offset by a decline in operating
income from discontinued operations of 8 million and impairment charges in discontinued operations of
1 million

preferred stock dividends on march 22 2012 we announced the redemption of all outstanding shares of
preferred stock on april 23 2012 we redeemed all outstanding shares of our preferred stock and paid all
accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date during the year ended december 31 2012 we
incurred a redemption charge of 10 million related to the original issuance costs of the preferred stock
this charge is presented as an additional preferred stock dividend in our consolidated income statements

liquidity and capital resources
we anticipate satisfying our distributions to our shareholders and noncontrolling interest members for the
next 12 months by primarily using cash flow from operations and available cash balances additionally we
expect to meet our scheduled financing maturities for 2015 excluding future acquisitions with the
proceeds from our january 2015 600 million senior unsecured note offering
our principal investing liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to
   fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs and
   fund future acquisition transactional and development activities
we anticipate satisfying these future investing needs using one or more of the following
   issuance of common or preferred stock
   issuance of additional debt including unsecured notes and mortgage debt
   draws on our credit facilities andor
   sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties
access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well
as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or
secured debt credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as
well for example as noted below our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum
equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings we also pay a facility fee on the entire
revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings as of january 30 2015 we had a credit rating
of bbb from fitch baa1 from moodys and bbb from sp on our senior unsecured debt securities

maintenance of the assets in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes
conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt
is also crosscollateralized by multiple assets and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance

financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the
joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as
collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 12

inflation
our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the
consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants
operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs
such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science
postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property
operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be
offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described
above


                                                                    65

critical accounting policies
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles
gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including
making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time
our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various
transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been
applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time
we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different
from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and
assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant
accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of
accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application
or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain

principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries
and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in
variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest
holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a
variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the
obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
significant to the vie
we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity
investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk
is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support we make
judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the
primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to
direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of
ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our
investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace
the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or
control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these
entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary
at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may
result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would
include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable
interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review
the internal control of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information they provide if
the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely
financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and
our internal control over financial reporting




                                                       66

revenue recognition
at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess
the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as
an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee
ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal
to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present value of future minimum
lease payments excluding executory costs are equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value
over retained tax credits of the leased building if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease
payments are determined to be reasonably predicable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally
accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments
were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing
and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our
consolidated financial statements
we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when
collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or
controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine
whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant
improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the
physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the
owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease
incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of
the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant
improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted
certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue
in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results
reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the
recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are
dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual
results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline
rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make
contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our
tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions
property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our
assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing
allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these
estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements
we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as
dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable for leases accounted for as dfls the
net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and
the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unearned income unearned income is
deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the
lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned
income the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant
judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be
impacted
loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the
loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the


                                                      67

amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when
collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are
recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain
loans should no longer be classified as held for maturity the timing and amount of our interest income
recognized would be impacted
loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that
collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans and
dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or
on a costrecovery basis were cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on
managements judgment of collectibility
allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon an estimate of probable losses on an individual
basis if they are determined to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that
we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of
the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment
by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment
of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for
support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any
collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the performance of
our tenants operators or borrowers the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the
loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends
historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part
upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our
consolidated financial statements

real estate
we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various
components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant
components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land
and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other
intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and
amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term
in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the
specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during
hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our
assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for
the acquired inplace leases
a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made
to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of
when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of
judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the
capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development
costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of
development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and available for occupancy
and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill
we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be



                                                      68

recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real
estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for
recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of
the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an
undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying
value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential
impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations
restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a
significant decline in the value of our market capitalization if we determine that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the required twostep
quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach i compare the fair value of
a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary ii compare the implied fair
value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a
business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over
the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount
of impairment if any we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through
various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income
quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also
include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay
for the company
the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this
judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units
future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not
be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate
and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our
assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial
results

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures
the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to
purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the
interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based
upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine
there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying
value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value and
as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary of investments in unconsolidated joint
ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as
appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general
economic conditions and trends severity and duration of the fair value deficiency and other relevant
factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based
upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective
investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a
material impact on our financial results




                                                      69

income taxes
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management
judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based
on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense
recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by
federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin
gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included
within the income tax provision

recent accounting pronouncements
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards there
were no accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us that we believe will
materially impact our consolidated financial statements

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value see note 24 to the
consolidated financial statements
to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a
market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the
underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to
determine the instruments change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying
interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the
underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 4 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional analysis details

interest rate risk
at december 31 2014 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on
variable rate investments which have been predominately hedged through interest rate swap contracts
interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt
and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will
affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate
debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair
value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the
variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no other changes in the outstanding
balance as of december 31 2014 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 9 million
or 002 per common share on a diluted basis

foreign currency exchange rate risk
at december 31 2014 our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased
real estate loan investments senior unsecured notes and the related gbp denominated cash flows from
such investments our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbp
denominated borrowings and foreign currency swap contracts




                                                       70

market risk
we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the
positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at
amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we
consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of
time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the
issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that
issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated
nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2014 the fair value and carrying value of
marketable debt securities were 252 million and 231 million respectively
the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by
maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is
based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable
are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and

note 2     summary of significant accounting policies
use of estimates
management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from managements estimates

principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp its whollyowned subsidiaries and joint
ventures or variable interest entities that it controls through voting rights or other means intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation
the company is required to continually evaluate its vie relationships and consolidate these entities when
it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of their operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity
where either i the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without
additional subordinated financial support ii substantially all of an entitys activities either involve or are
conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights or iii the equity investors
as a group lack if any a the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that
most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b the obligation to absorb the expected
losses of an entity or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity
a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct
the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance
and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could
potentially be significant to the vie the company qualitatively assesses whether it is or is not the
primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to its form of
ownership interest its representation on the vies governing body the size and seniority of its investment
its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and its ability to replace
the manager of andor liquidate the entity
for its investments in joint ventures that are not considered to be vies the company evaluates the type of
ownership rights held by the limited partners that may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which
the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited
partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole
general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be
reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners
ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests or
iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests the
company similarly evaluates the rights of managing members of limited liability companies

revenue recognition
at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments the
company assesses its terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease
arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of
ownership to the lessee ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term
iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the present
value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs are equal to 90 or more of the
excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased property if one of the four criteria is
met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the
lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease dfl
the company utilizes the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases
accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of minimum
lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unearned
income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant
yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured
the company recognizes rental revenue for operating lease arrangements when the tenant has taken
possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset the tenant is not considered to have taken physical
possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the company owned tenant improvements are
substantially completed if a lease arrangement provides for tenant improvements the company
determines whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or the company when the
company is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are
treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into income over the lease term when the
tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance that is funded by the
company is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term
ownership of tenant improvements is determined based on various factors including but not limited to
the following criteria
   lease stipulations of how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent
   which party to the arrangement retains legal title to the tenant improvements upon lease expiration
   whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general purpose in nature and
   if the tenant improvements are expected to have significant residual value at the end of the lease term
certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue
in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results
reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds and
only after any contingency has been removed when the related thresholds are achieved this may result
in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received
tenant recoveries subject to operating leases related to the reimbursement of real estate taxes insurance
repairs and maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the
expenses are incurred the reimbursements are recognized and presented gross as the company is
generally the primary obligor and with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers
has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk
for operating leases with minimum scheduled rent increases the company recognizes income on a
straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured recognizing rental income
on a straightline basis results in a difference in the timing of revenue amounts from what is contractually
due from tenants if the company determines that collectibility of straightline rents is not reasonably

assured future revenue recognition is limited to amounts contractually owed and paid and when
appropriate an allowance for estimated losses is established
resident fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges
community fees and other resident charges residency agreements are generally for a term of 30 days to
one year with resident fees billed monthly revenue for certain care related services is recognized as
services are provided and is billed monthly in arrears
loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the
loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity loans heldforinvestment are carried at amortized cost
and are reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses as necessary the company
recognizes interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the
interest method the interest method is applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future
payments is reasonably assured premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the term
of the related loans loans are transferred from heldforinvestment to held for sale when managements
intent is to no longer hold the loans for the foreseeable future loans heldforsale are recorded at the
lower of cost or fair value
the company recognizes gain on sales of real estate upon the closing of a transaction with the purchaser
gains on properties sold are recognized using the full accrual method when the collectibility of the sales
price is reasonably assured the company is not obligated to perform additional activities that may be
considered significant the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and other profit recognition
criteria have been satisfied gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the
requirements for gain recognition have been met
the company receives management fees from its investments in certain joint venture entities for various
services it provides as the managing member management fees are recorded as revenue when
management services have been performed intercompany profit for management fees is eliminated

allowance for doubtful accounts
the company evaluates the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants operators and borrowers on a
monthly and quarterly basis the companys evaluation considers industry and economic conditions
individual and portfolio property performance credit enhancements liquidity and other factors the
companys tenants borrowers and operators furnish property portfolio and guarantoroperatorlevel

financial information to calculate the lease or debt service coverages that it uses as a primary credit quality
indicator lease and debt service coverage information is evaluated together with other property portfolio
and operator performance information including revenue expense net operating income occupancy
rental rate reimbursement trends capital expenditures and ebitda defined as earnings before interest
tax and depreciation and amortization along with other liquidity measures the company evaluates on a
monthly basis or immediately upon a significant change in circumstances its tenants operators and
borrowers ability to service their obligations with the company
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for straightline rent receivables resulting
from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments for
straightline rent amounts the companys assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable
over the term of the lease
upon the occurence of a significant event and in connection with the companys quarterly loans receivable

assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed
performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is
reasonably assured watch list finance receivables meet all present contractual obligations however the
timing andor collection of all amounts owed may not be reasonably assured workout finance receivables
are defined as finance receivables where the company has determined based on current information and
events that it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the agreement
finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility
of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured if the ultimate collectibility of any recorded principal
finance receivable balance is in doubt the cost recovery method is used and cash collected is applied to
first reduce the carrying value of the finance receivable otherwise the cash basis method is used
generally the company returns a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments
become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of remaining loan or
lease payments is no longer in doubt
allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis based upon an estimate of
probable losses if they are determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is
deemed probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the
contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon the companys assessment of the
borrowers or lessees overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for
support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any
collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows

real estate
the companys real estate assets consisting of land buildings and improvements are recorded at their fair
value at the time of acquisition andor consolidation any assumed liabilities other acquired tangible
assets or identifiable intangibles are also recorded at their fair value the company assesses fair value
based on available market information such as capitalization and discount rates sale transaction
comparables and relevant per square foot or unit cost information a real estate assets fair value may be
determined utilizing cash flow projections that incorporate appropriate discount andor capitalization rates
or other available market information estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors
including historical operating results known and anticipated trends as well as market and economic
conditions the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property is based on the value of the property as
if it is vacant transaction costs related to acquisitions of businesses including properties are expensed as
incurred
the company records acquired above and below market leases at their fair value using discount rates
which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired the amount recorded is based on the present
value of the difference between i the contractual amounts paid pursuant to each inplace lease and
ii managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each inplace lease measured over a period equal
to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for
any leases with bargain renewal options other intangible assets acquired include amounts for inplace
lease values that are based on the companys evaluation of the specific characteristics of each property and
the respective tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical

costs the company includes estimates of lost rents at estimated market rates during the hypothetical
expected leaseup periods which are dependent on local market conditions and expected trends in
estimating costs to execute similar leases the company considers leasing commissions legal and other
related costs
the company capitalizes direct construction and development costs including predevelopment costs
interest property taxes insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the development or
construction of a real estate asset the company capitalizes construction and development costs while
substantive activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use the company considers a
construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of
company owned tenant improvements but no later than one year from cessation of significant
construction activity costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use
or after development activities have ceased are expensed as incurred for redevelopment of existing
operating properties the company capitalizes certain costs based on the net carrying value of the existing
property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvement incurred in connection
with the redevelopment costs previously capitalized related to abandoned developmentsredevelopments
are charged to earnings expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred the
company considers costs incurred in conjunction with releasing properties including tenant
improvements and lease commissions to represent the acquisition of productive assets and accordingly
such costs are reflected as investing activities in the companys consolidated statement of cash flows
the company computes depreciation on properties using the straightline method over the assets
estimated useful life depreciation is discontinued when a property is identified as held for sale buildings
and improvements are depreciated over useful lives ranging up to 60 years market lease intangibles are
amortized primarily to revenue over the remaining noncancellable lease terms and bargain renewal
periods if any inplace lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining noncancellable lease
term and bargain renewal periods if any

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill
the company assesses the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the
company tests its real estate assets for impairment by comparing the sum of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the real estate assets the estimated future undiscounted
cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of
the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying value exceeds the expected future undiscounted
cash flows an impairment loss will be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the real estate
assets is greater than its fair value
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential
impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate values
restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a
significant decline in the value of the companys market capitalization if the company determines that it
is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company
applies the required twostep quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach
i compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary
ii compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as
if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value

operations as a result of the disposal transaction and ii the entity was not to have any significant
continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction accordingly

purchase the joint venture interest or the fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint
venture to the extent that the companys cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the joint
venture level the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities
and such amortization is included in the companys share of equity in earnings of the joint venture the
company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair
value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when the company determines a decline in
the fair value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value is
otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the company recognizes gains on the sale of interests
in joint ventures to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale
the companys fair values for its equity method investments are based on discounted cash flow models
that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable
any estimated debt premiums or discounts capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized
in these models are based upon assumptions that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of
current market rates for the respective investments

includes designating all derivatives that are part of a hedging relationship to specific forecasted
transactions as well as recognized obligations or assets in the consolidated balance sheets the company
also assesses and documents both at inception of the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis
thereafter whether the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting the designated risks associated with the
respective hedged items if it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective as a hedge or that
it is probable the underlying forecasted transaction will not occur the company discontinues hedge
accounting prospectively and records the appropriate adjustment to earnings based on the current fair
value of the derivative

fair value measurement
the company measures and discloses the fair value of nonfinancial and financial assets and liabilities
utilizing a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to a fair value measurement are
considered to be observable or unobservable in a marketplace observable inputs reflect market data
obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect the companys market assumptions
this hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available these inputs have created the
following fair value hierarchy
   level 1quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets
   level 2quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which significant inputs
    and significant value drivers are observable in active markets and
   level 3fair value measurements derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant
    inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable
the company measures fair value using a set of standardized procedures that are outlined herein for all
assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value when available the company utilizes
quoted market prices from an independent third party source to determine fair value and classifies such
items in level 1 in some instances where a market price is available but the instrument is in an inactive or
overthecounter market the company consistently applies the dealer market maker pricing estimate
and classifies the asset or liability in level 2
if quoted market prices or inputs are not available fair value measurements are based upon valuation
models that utilize current market or independently sourced market inputs such as interest rates option
volatilities credit spreads andor market capitalization rates items valued using such internallygenerated
valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a result the asset or liability could be classified in either level 2 or level 3 even though
there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable internal fair value models and techniques
used by the company include discounted cash flow and blackscholes valuation models the company

and continues to be no longer reasonably assured therefore rental revenue for the dfl portfolio has
been recognized on a cash basis the company reassessed the dfl portfolio for impairment on

was not probable that it will not collect all of the rental payments under the terms of the lease and ii the
fair value of the underlying collateral exceeded the dfl portfolios 370 million carrying amount the fair
value of the dfl portfolio was estimated based on a discounted cash flow model the inputs to which are
considered to be a level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy inputs to this valuation model
include real estate capitalization rates industry growth rates and operating margins some of which
influence the companys expectation of future cash flows from the dfl portfolio and accordingly the fair
value of its investment during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 the company
recognized dfl income of 19 million 24 million and 28 million respectively and received cash
payments each year of 24 million from the dfl portfolio the carrying value of the dfl portfolio was
370 million and 374 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively

2   the net loss in 2014 includes impairments net of the related tax benefit of 396 million related to hcrmcs deferred tax
      assets and trademark intangible assets the impairments at hcrmc were the result of a continued shift in patient payor
      sources from medicare to medicare advantage which negatively impact reimbursement rates and length of stay for hcrmcs
      skilled nursing segment and a shift in hcrmcs marketing and branding strategy the net loss in 2013 includes a charge of
      400 million related to recording of a valuation allowance that reduced the carrying value of hcrmcs deferred tax assets to
      an amount that is more likely than not to be realized as determined by hcrmcs management hcrmcs goodwill intangible
      assets and deferred tax assets were not previously considered in the companys initial investments in the operations of
      hcrmc therefore the related impairments and valuation allowance against the carrying value of the deferred tax assets do
      not impact the companys recorded investment or impact on the companys share of earnings from or its investment in
      hcrmc however the circumstances that led to hcrmcs management to reach the determination that it was necessary to
      reduce the carrying value of their deferred tax and trademark intangible assets in 2014 are consistent with the companys
      determination that its investment in hcrmc was impaired in december 2014 see note 17 the companys joint venture
      interest in hcrmc is accounted for using the equity method and results in an ongoing reduction of dfl income proportional
      to hcps ownership in hcrmc the elimination of the respective proportional lease expense at the hcrmc level in
      substance results in 62 million 62 million and 59 million of dfl income that is recharacterized to the companys share of

      income from dfls less property level operating expense noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net
      income as presented below the company believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only
      income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis
      adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl accretion amortization of market
      lease intangibles and lease termination fees adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as cash noi the company uses noi
      and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance the
      company believes that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an
      alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap because it does not reflect various excluded
      items further the companys definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate
      companies as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating noi

estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions
described below the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date the
expected life estimated period of time outstanding of the stock options granted was estimated using the
historical exercise behavior of employees and turnover rates for stock options granted in 2014 2013 and
2012 the expected volatility was based on the average of the companys i historical volatility of the
adjusted closing prices of its common stock for a period equal to the stock options expected life ending on
the grant date calculated on a weekly basis and ii the implied volatility of traded options on its common
stock for a period equal to 30 days ending on the grant date the following table summarizes the

            hcps standard position regarding waste is to only            in addition to recycling at our property sites we have
            manage nonhazardous waste removal however there are        worked to reduce landfill waste linked to our own
            a few exceptions where hcp manages hazardous waste           administrative activities by utilizing electronic reports
            generally hazardous waste removal is the responsibility      where feasible to reduce paper consumption
            of our tenants and is therefore outside of our boundary      additionally we provide each employee with a bin
                                                                          designated specifically for paper recycling
            the percentage of hazardous waste removal is
            estimated to be less than 03 and therefore is not          waste and recycling improvements
            included in our reporting nonhazardous waste removal
            is managed through recycling and landfill disposal           hcp consistently works to improve operational
            for most properties waste is not actually weighed            efficiencies and to reduce waste at every property
            on site rather it is estimated based on the assumed          under our control accordingly we focused on
            mix of waste and a corresponding density factor to            increasing recycling activity within our mob
            convert the waste into weight for reporting purposes         portfolio in 2014 to achieve the following goals
            third party vendors and waste consultants are our
                                                                           recycle more and dispose of less
            sources for estimated weight of waste vendors and
            consultants use the standard measurement equivalent            reduce our impact and
            provided by the transporter to determine the weight
                                                                           improve building operations
            landfill waste can leak into soil and water supplies and
            can also generate methane gas which is explosive             to achieve these goals we met with a waste hauling
            and contributes to greenhouse gases therefore hcp           negotiation partner waste and recycling vendors and
            encourages office recycling as well as the recycling          our property management companies to set a clear
            of demolition waste from construction on                      objective improving the percentage of our mobs
            redevelopment and tenant improvement projects over           that recycle
            the past year we have included recycling as a point of
            discussion during our staff training sessions and we          these efforts resulted in the increase of boundary mob
            increased the number of large outside recycling               property recycling rates seventythree percent 73
            containers as well as interior containers for single stream   of boundary mob properties were recycling by the end
            recycling on our building sites we had a significant         of 2014 as compared to sixty percent 60 in 2013
            increase in total recycled waste of 349 in 2014            in 2015 and beyond we will continue to diversify and
                                                                          expand our recycling efforts  not only to improve the
            while property waste disposal is typically the                operations of our properties but just as importantly to
            responsibility of third party contractors we actively        do our part to reduce the waste we generate and the

                we believe that our compensation practices are applied to each employee based on their position experience and roles and responsibilities in
                the company regardless of race gender sex andor sexual orientation we believe that by providing such compensation in this type of simplified
                group fails to correctly compare the data because it does not consider position experience and roles and responsibilities which vary greatly among
                employees of similar titles

                significant majority of compensation for our evps

               we have reviewed managements assertion included in the accompanying appendix a management assertion and
               measurement techniques that the selected sustainability metrics identified below and denoted by an asterisk  within
               hcp incs sustainability section of the 2014 combined report as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 are
               presented in conformity with the assessment criteria set forth in managements assertion the assessment criteria

                       direct energy consumption
                       indirect energy consumption
                       direct and indirect greenhouse gas ghg emissions

                       new hire by age category and gender
                       terms by age category and gender

                       percentage of ethnicity group by gender
                       ratio of salary and remuneration by category and gender


               hcp inc management is responsible for managements assertion and for the assessment criteria which it has identified as
               an objective basis against which it assesses and reports on the selected sustainability metrics this responsibility includes
               the design implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of selected data that is free from
               material misstatement whether due to fraud or error

               our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the american institute of certified public
               accountants a review is designed to provide limited assurance and as such is substantially less in scope than an
               examination the objective of which is the expression of an opinion on managements assertion accordingly we do not
               express such an opinion

               greenhouse gas ghg quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of such things as emission factors that are
               used in mathematical models to calculate emissions and the inability of those models due to incomplete scientific
               knowledge and other factors to precisely characterize under all circumstances the relationship between various inputs and
               the resultant emissions environmental and energy use data used in ghg emissions calculations are subject to inherent
               limitations given the nature and the methods used for determining such data the selection of different but acceptable
               measurement techniques may result in materially different measurements

               data related to waste metrics is subject to inherent limitations given the nature and the methods used for determining such
               data the selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements

               based on our review nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the selected sustainability metrics referred
               to above are not fairly stated in all material respects based on the corresponding assessment criteria set forth in appendix
