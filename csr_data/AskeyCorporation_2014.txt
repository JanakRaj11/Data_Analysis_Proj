    the volume of wastewater increased in 2013 because of      compared to 2012 electricity consumption in 2013
    the increase of water consumption by the ac cooling       increased by 129498mwh this is mainly because of
    system when temperature rises in summer the chilling     capability increase from 383357k sets in 2012 to 44584k
    system needs water to cool down to prevent system          sets in 2013 or by 163 then the electricity consumption
    from overheating also as the number of workers during   of airconditioning also increased when airconditioner usage
    summer and winter breaks was excessively high we          at employee dormitories increased because the summer
    needed to open additional dormitories to accommodate       temperature in 2013 was persistently high
    them water consumption thus increased
