 longterm global demand and supply continues to move into balance as shown in figure 3 below global wine
 production in 2015 was supported by strong vintages in three of the worlds largest wine producing nations italy
 france and spain this was partially offset by lower yielding vintages in argentina south africa and china

7 the companys f15 annual report reported a volunteering participation rate of 586 based on the proportion of salaried employees
   who accessed volunteering leave during that financial year reporting of the volunteering participation rate has changed in f16 to include
   salaried and nonsalaried employees this has resulted in a change to the rate previously reported for f15

as outlined in the companys f15 annual report twe has seen energy and emissions improvements as it
optimises the companys supply chain moving production to more efficient sites and improving facility utilisation
these improvements occurred in the companys primary production regions of the us and australia
the company expects that energy water and emissions will improve as a result of further optimisation to the
supply chain footprint due to be embedded in f17
total solid waste generated has also reduced over time due to a number of reasons including an ongoing
continuous improvement program sustainability projects and supply chain optimisation this has occurred
alongside increases to the companys solid waste to recycling ratios
while twe has seen waste and energy efficiency improvements in f16 a number of environmental metrics
are difficult for the company to control given the nature of grape growing and influence of climatic conditions
changes in production volumes and highly variable growing conditions year to year impact the companys
overall efficiency
during f16 twe acquired diageos wine business taking effect from 1 january 2016 as the us vintage took
place prior to twe taking control of these sites the environmental metrics attributable to the acquired assets
have not been included in twes f16 data and have instead been reported separately efficiency data for these
assets is not available for f16 as production occurred prior to 1 january 2016 from f17 onwards these sites
will be reported in the same form as all other twe sites
in f16 twe undertook its second global volunteering week due to the acquisition of the diageo wine business
twes employee base increased in the months leading up to the week as a result while on a likeforlike
basis total participant numbers for global volunteering week 2016 was very similar to 2015 the proportion
of employees who participated reduced slightly

performance           the performance period for the f16 ltip is three years  from 1 july 2015 to 30 june 2018
period                the board considers three years an appropriate performance period as it is aligned to market
                      practice and is sufficiently longterm to influence the desired performance outcomes whilst providing
                      a foreseeable and genuine incentive to participants
performance           the f16 ltip is subject to two performance measures which are weighted equally and assessed at
measures              the end of the performance period the board chose performance measures that align managements
                      longterm interests with those of shareholders these measures are considered consistent with
                      market practice and are easily understood by both participants and shareholders
                       relative tsr provides shareholder alignment by taking into consideration the increase in share
                        price as well as dividends paid the relative measure supports competitive returns against other

                        determine the start and ending share price to determine the relative tsr measure
                       the peer group for relative tsr comprises companies within the spasx 200 index excluding

                        capitalisation stock volatility and business operations and provide a sufficiently large population
                        to minimise the risk of attrition the relative tsr peer group remains relatively broad as there are
                        too few industry peers ie within the consumer goodsdistillers and vintners subgroup to make
                        additional sector exclusions viable

                        efficiency roce is widely regarded as a metric well suited to a capital intensive business

1 table 45 reports only executives who were kmp at 30 june 2016 as mr meehan joined the group during f16 there was no f15 stip
   award made including restricted equity
2 the value at allocation date is calculated based on the allocation price 6125 the fiveday vwap up to and including the allocation date
3 due to regulatory filings which were required to be made in china prior to the allocation of restricted shares mr foyes allocation
   under the f15 stip rep was delayed this resulted in mr foye not being registered as a shareholder on the record date and accordingly
   not receiving the retail premium for the restricted shares mr foye received in cash the renounceable value of the restricted shares that
   he was entitled to at the record date being 19 october 2015 which was paid in december 2015 this cash amount is included in table 61
4 as mr foye is remunerated in us his local currency stip award was converted to a at the payment date 15 september 2015 in order
   to determine the number of restricted shares to be allocated therefore the final a amount varies to that disclosed in the f15
   remuneration report

of 2200000 per annum inclusive of superannuation guarantee contributions and any fees that a nonexecutive
director elects to sacrifice on a pretax basis this fee pool has not been increased since 2012 when it was last
approved by shareholders at the 2012 annual general meeting agm
it is proposed that the nonexecutive director fee pool be increased to 2500000 in f17 subject to shareholder approval
at the companys 2016 agm the board believes it appropriate to increase the nonexecutive director fee pool to provide
the company with flexibility for future adjustments to annual fees competitive with comparable companies thereby
enabling the company to maintain and attract high calibre nonexecutive directors with the appropriate experience
expertise skills and diversity to oversee the companys business and strategic direction also as previously announced

2016 further details will be included in the companys 2016 notice of agm
b nonexecutive director fee policy
in setting the level of nonexecutive directors fees the following factors are taken into account
 risks and responsibilities of the role
 global reach and complexity of the business
 director skills and experience and
 market benchmark data provided by independent external consultants
nonexecutive directors are remunerated by way of base board fees for their service as a director of the board
and additional committee fees for membership of or chairing a committee the chairman of the board taking
into account the greater time commitment required receives a higher base fee but does not receive any additional
payment for service on committees
in order to maintain independence nonexecutive directors do not participate in the companys incentive plans
and they do not receive retirement benefits other than the superannuation contributions disclosed in this report

domestic distributors independent retailers and on premise outlets are usually recognised when goods are delivered

under but typically when goods are despatched this is also the case for some national retail chains that manage their
own distribution networks

and provide for the discounts based on anticipated annual purchases

in accordance with aasb 133 earnings per share the comparative earnings per share calculations have been restated
for the bonus element of the twoforfifteen share rights issue undertaken in october 2015 the previously reported
june 2015 weighted average number of shares has been adjusted by a factor of 102 being the market price of one
ordinary share at the close of the last day at which the shares traded together with the rights 657 divided by the

calculation of earnings per share
earnings per share eps is the amount of posttax profit attributable to each share
basic eps is calculated by dividing the net profit after income tax attributable to ordinary shareholders
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year
diluted eps is determined by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders after tax by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the effects of dilutive potential

accounting policies
cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand deposits held at call with banks cash in transit shortterm
deposits and investments with maturities of three months or less
cash assets and cash liabilities are offset and presented as a net amount in the statement of financial position
when the group has a legally enforceable right to offset or intent to settle on a net basis
for the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows cash and cash equivalents are disclosed net
of outstanding bank overdrafts
receivables
trade receivables are initially recognised at invoice value fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
less allowance for doubtful debts
credit terms are generally between 30120 days depending on the nature of the transaction an allowance for
doubtful debts is raised to reduce the carrying amount of trade receivables based on a review of outstanding amounts
at reporting date where there is potential credit risk
inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of their cost using average or fifo basis or estimated net realisable value
the cost of raw materials is their purchase price or in the case of grapes sourced from group owned vineyards
fair value see note 11 for further details the cost of manufactured goods is determined on a consistent basis
and is made up of the raw materials and direct labour used in manufacture it also includes other direct costs
and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity
net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs
of completion and estimated costs to be incurred in marketing selling and distribution
trade and other payables
trade and other payables including accruals are recorded when the group is required to make future payments
as a result of purchases of goods or services trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost

key estimate and judgement

volume discounts and rebates
key estimates relate to the amount accrued for discounts and rebates products are often sold with volume discounts
and other rebates sales are recorded based on the price specified in the sales contracts net of the estimated discount
or rebate at the time of sale accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and rebates
based on anticipated annual purchases and depletions

net realisable value of inventory
the period over which some wine inventories are converted from raw materials to finished goods can be a significant
length of time failure to forecast demand effectively may result in excess inventories or missed revenue opportunities
forecast demand and market prices can vary significantly over the holding period up to the likely date of sale
estimating the most likely conditions at the expected point of sale is therefore more challenging over the longer term
noncurrent inventory is 6784 million f15 5338 million and its estimated selling price is therefore a key estimate

included within plant and equipment are projects in progress of 1105 million f15 514 million which are assets
under construction and therefore not yet depreciated the cost of construction includes the cost of materials used
in construction direct labour on the project and an allocation of overheads

accounting policies
property plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost and then reduced by accumulated depreciation and any
impairment losses
plant and equipment is depreciated so that the assets are written down to their residual value over their useful lives
using a reducing balance or straightline method depending on the nature of the asset assets that relate to leases
are writtenoff over the period of the lease or useful life whichever is the shorter residual values useful lives and
amortisation methods are reviewed annually and adjusted when required no changes to depreciation rates were
made this year
depreciation expense is included in costs of sales selling expenses and administration expenses in the statement
of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
the depreciation rates used for each class of asset are as follows

freehold buildings and improvements                    15100
leasehold buildings and improvements                  100200
plant and equipment                                    33400

derecognition and disposal
when an asset is sold scrapped or is no longer of use to the business it is derecognised any gain or loss arising on
derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset
is recorded in the period the asset is derecognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income

grape growing and sourcing
the group has a variety of sources of fruit including owned and leased vineyards contracted growers and the bulk
wine market
this approach provides flexibility through the economic cycle and assists with managing the risks arising from
agricultural factors beyond the groups control such as pests disease and extreme weather conditions
the group owned vineyards ensure access to super premium fruit from key viticultural regions including the barossa
valley and coonawarra in australia marlborough in new zealand and the napa and sonoma valleys in california
these vineyards contribute to some of the groups most prestigious wines

accounting policies
the agricultural assets of the group principally vines are measured at their fair value less estimated point
of sale costs
the net change in their fair value over the year is recognised within other expenses in the statement of profit
or loss and other comprehensive income
prior to harvest grapes are considered as part of the agricultural asset and included in its fair value
harvested grapes are transferred to inventory initially at fair value and are then subsequently accounted
for in the cost of inventory see note 9
costs incurred in maintaining agricultural assets are recognised as an expense as incurred
fair value determination
the valuations of agricultural assets are level 2 fair value measurements under the groups accounting policy
see note 1 with the principal inputs being

vines
determined with reference to both independent valuations of the relevant vineyards and the market price
of purchased vines rootlings

grapes prior to harvest
estimated based on the expected yields per hectare forecasted harvest costs and the anticipated market price
of grapes

harvested grapes
determined by reference to the weighted district average of grape prices for each region for the current vintage
prices vary with the grade quality of grapes produced in each particular region

key estimate and judgement

fair value of vines
key to estimating the value of vines is the identification of factors that could have a longterm impact on the
viability of the vines and the measurement of the impact a change in these factors have on the valuation of vines
these are typically site dependent
in addition the estimated fair value of both vines and unharvested grapes could change if
 yield estimates were higherlower
 the estimated harvest costs were lowerhigher
 market prices for grapes were higherlower or
 the quality of grapes was higherlower

indefinite life brands
brand names with a carrying value of 9340 million f15 7317 million are assessed as having an indefinite useful life
the indefinite useful life reflects the groups intention to continue to manufacture or distribute these brands to generate
net cash inflows into the foreseeable future

key estimate and judgement

useful life of brand names
in assessing whether a brand has a finite or indefinite useful life the group makes use of information on the longterm
strategy for the brand the level of growth or decline of the markets that the brand operates in the history of the market
and the brands position within that market
if a brand is assessed to have a finite life the group will use judgement in determining the useful life of the brand
and will consider the period over which expected cash flows will continue to be derived in making that decision

accounting policies
brand names and licences
brand names are recognised as assets when purchased individually and primarily as part of the allocation
of the purchase price when the group acquires other businesses internally generated brand names are not
capitalised and expenditure incurred in developing maintaining or enhancing brand names is charged to profit
or loss in the year incurred
brand names are initially recognised at cost when purchased individually and at fair value when acquired with
a business this fair value is determined by reference to independent valuations
following initial recognition intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any
accumulated impairment losses
the useful lives of brand names have been assessed to be indefinite and therefore are not amortised

goodwill
goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses and represents the difference between the purchase price and share
of the net assets of the acquired business recorded at fair value
following initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses goodwill is not
amortised but is tested for impairment see note 14

it development and software
costs incurred in developing information technology it products or systems and costs incurred in acquiring
software and multiyear licenses are capitalised as intangible it assets they include the cost of purchased software
and internal labour and contractors used in the development of software
it assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and are amortised over their expected useful life
210 years on a straight line basis amortisation is included in other expenses in the statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income

the anz assets held for sale relate to ryecroft winery matua auckland winery as well as select vineyard assets which

242 million and vineyards 11 million

accounting policies
noncurrent assets are classified as held for sale if their value will be recovered principally through their sale
rather than through ongoing use within the business
assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale they are valued at the lower of
their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with an impairment loss recognised for any difference a gain
is recognised for any subsequent increase in value but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously
recognised any gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the noncurrent asset is recognised
at that point the fair values of the assets based on independent market appraisals exceed the assets carrying values

note 14  impairment of nonfinancial assets
in f16 the recoverable amounts of cash generating units cgus exceed their carrying values and as a result no
impairment has been recognised f15 nil there were no indications that previously recognised impairment losses
should be reversed f15 nil the recoverable amount was determined through a value in use calculation
the groups cgus are consistent with the prior period and are
 americas
 europe and
 australia and new zealand anz

accounting policies
timing of impairment testing
the group tests property plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment
 at least annually for goodwill and indefinite life brands and
 where there are indications that an asset may be impaired or
 where there is an indication that previously recognised impairments may have changed
impairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
approach to impairment testing
if the asset does not generate independent cash inflows and its value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair
value the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cgu to which it belongs
when an assets or cgus carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount it is impaired recoverable amount
is the higher of the assets or cgus fair value less costs of disposal or value in use
fair value is determined in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 1
in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu
reversals of impairment
if there is an indicator that a previously recognised impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased recoverable
amount is estimated if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine an assets recoverable amount
since an impairment loss was recognised the carrying value of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount
limited to the amount that would have been determined net of depreciation had no impairment loss been recognised
for the asset in prior years
any reversal is recognised in profit or loss with an adjustment to depreciation in future periods to allocate the assets
revised carrying value less any residual value on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life the group does
not reverse impairments recognised for goodwill

key estimate and judgement

impairment testing key assumptions
cash flow forecasts
cash flow forecasts are based on the groups most recent fiveyear financial plans approved by the board
key assumptions in the cash flow forecasts include sales volume growth cost of sales and cost of doing business
the groups assumptions regarding sales volume growth and costs of doing business are based on expectations
of the market demand and past experience the assumption on cost of sales is based on expectation about future
vintage costs
this approach is consistent with the prior period
longterm growth rates
cash flow forecasts beyond a fiveyear period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 25 f15 27
discount rate
the group applies a posttax discount rate to posttax cash flows as the valuation calculated using this method
closely approximates applying pretax discount rates to pretax cash flows the posttax discount rates incorporate
a riskadjustment relative to the risks associated with the net posttax cash flows being achieved the group used
the following pretax discount rates
                                                                                                    2016             2015

exchange rates
cash flow forecasts in foreign currency are forecast in that currency and discounted using the applicable regional
discount rates predominantly usd and gbp
sensitivity analysis
increases in discount rates or changes in other key assumptions such as operating conditions or financial performance
may cause the recoverable amount to fall below carrying values
based on current economic conditions and cgu performances there are no reasonably possible changes to key
assumptions used in the determination of cgu recoverable amounts that would result in a material impairment
to the group

costs in relation to the groups supply chain optimisation program and group rationalisation and restructure program

accounting policies
provisions are recognised for present obligations legal equitable or constructive to make future payments
or other transfer of value to other entities due to past transactions or events they are recognised only when
it is probable the liability will arise and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount
if the effect of time value of money is material provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash
flows at a pretax risk free rate plus where appropriate the risks specific to the liability where discounting is used
the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost
employee entitlements
liabilities for employees entitlements to wages and salaries annual leave and other current employee entitlements
that are expected to be paid within 12 months are measured at amounts expected to be paid as at the reporting date
liabilities for other employee entitlements which are not expected to be paid or settled within 12 months of reporting
date are accrued in respect of all employees at the present value of future amounts expected to be paid
restructuring
restructuring provisions are recognised at the point when a detailed plan for the restructure has been developed
and implementation has commenced the cost of restructuring provided is the estimated future cash flows discounted
at the appropriate rate which reflects the risks of the cash flow
termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits the group recognises termination benefits
when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of a current employee according to a detailed
formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or upon the provision of an offer to encourage voluntary redundancy
onerous contracts
onerous contracts are measured at the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost
of continuing with the contract discounted to present value if material

of diageo chateau  estates

accounting policies
leases
the determination of which of the groups arrangements are leases can be complex for example determining whether
long term contracts are for the supply of grapes or a lease of the vineyard the assessment is made based on the substance
of the arrangement whether it is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and if it conveys a right of use
when an arrangement is a lease it is accounted for in one of two ways where the lessor retains substantially
all the risks and benefits of ownership of an asset it is classified as operating leases operating lease payments
are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term in the statement of profit or loss and
other comprehensive income
where the group takes on substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased item it is classified
as a finance lease an asset is recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or if lower
at the present value of the minimum lease payments lease payments are split between a finance expense and
a reduction of the lease liability so as to record a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability
the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term

note 21  employee equity plans continued

accounting policies
employee equity plans are accounted for as sharebased payments whereby employees render services in exchange for
the awards the fair value of the shares and performance rights that are expected to vest is progressively recognised
as an employee benefits expense over the relevant vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity
the fair value of shares granted is determined by reference to observed market values the fair value of the tsr
component of performance rights is independently determined at grant date by an external valuer using a montecarlo
simulation for the nonmarket components eps cagr the fair value is independently determined based on the share
price less the present value of dividends
nonmarket performance conditions do not impact the value of shares and performance rights but rather the estimate
of the number of shares to vest
at each reporting date the company revises the estimate of the number of shares and the nonmarket component
of performance rights that are expected to vest and the employee benefits expense recognised each period incorporates
this change in estimate
an expense is recognised for the tsr component of performance rights whether or not the tsr hurdle is met
no expense is recognised if these rights do not vest due to cessation of employment no expense is recognised for
shares and nonmarket components of performance rights that do not ultimately vest

d credit risk
nature of the risk
counterparty credit risk arises primarily from the following assets
 cash and cash equivalents
 trade and other receivables and
 derivative instruments
risk management
the groups counterparty credit risk management philosophy is to limit the groups loss from default by any one
counterparty by dealing only with financial institution counterparties of good credit standing setting maximum exposure
limits for each counterparty and taking a conservative approach to the calculation of counterparty credit limit usage
where available credit opinions on counterparties from two credit rating agencies are used to determine credit limits
the group assesses the credit quality of individual customers prior to offering credit terms and continue to monitor
on a regular basis each customer is assigned a risk profile based upon the measurable risk indicators for dishonoured
payments adverse information and average days late along with the securities and guarantees held all prospective
accounts are required to complete a credit application and generally a directors guarantee is required with minimal
exceptions failure to provide a directors guarantee results in either no credit or a limited level of credit offered
credit terms may be reduced or extended for individual customers on the basis of risk
past due accounts are subject to a number of collection activities which range from telephone contact suspension
of orders through to legal action past due accounts are reviewed monthly with specific focus on accounts that are
greater than 90 days overdue where debt cannot be recovered it is escalated from the credit representative to the
credit manager to initiate recovery action
for derivatives the group transacts under an international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting
agreement if a credit event such as a default occurs all outstanding transactions under an isda agreement are
terminated the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions
level of exposure at balance date
the maximum counterparty credit risk exposure at 30 june 2016 in respect of derivative financial instruments was
51 million f15 27 million and in respect of cash and cash equivalents was 537 million f15 210 million
the groups authorised counterparties are restricted to banks and financial institutions whose long term credit rating
is at or above a standard and poors rating of bbb or moodys equivalent rating of baa1 the magnitude of credit
risk in relation to receivables is generally the carrying amount net of any provisions for doubtful debts the ageing
of the consolidated group trade receivables net of provisions is outlined below

note 24  derivative financial instruments
at reporting date there were 1920 million australian dollar equivalent net face value of outstanding foreign exchange
contracts at contract rates f15 6303 million and interest rate swaps of 4028 million f15 1303 million
these instruments are regarded as being level 2 under aasbs fair value measurement hierarchy


note 25  fair values
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents financial assets and most financial liabilities approximate their carrying
value the fair value of the us private placement notes is 4016 million f15 3338 million there have been no
reclassifications of financial assets from fair value to cost or from cost or amortised cost to fair value during the year
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are based upon market prices or models using inputs observed from
the market where markets exist or have been determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by the current
interest rate for financial assets and financial liabilities with similar risk profiles a level 2 valuation
the valuation of derivative financial assets and liabilities reflects the estimated amounts which the group would be
required to pay or receive to terminate the contracts net of transaction costs or replace the contracts at their current
market rates at reporting date this is based on internal valuations using standard valuation techniques
as the purpose of these derivative financial instruments is to hedge the groups underlying assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge against risk of interest rate fluctuations it is unlikely in the absence
of abnormal circumstances that these contracts would be terminated prior to maturity
for all other recognised financial assets and financial liabilities based on the facts and circumstances existing
at reporting date and the nature of the groups financial assets and financial liabilities including hedge positions
the group has no reason to believe that the financial assets could not be exchanged or the financial liabilities could
not be settled in an arms length transaction at an amount approximating its carrying amount

of process and the high court having refused mci special leave to appeal this decision mci also alleges in the
december 2014 proceeding that the company misled the market and breached obligations of continuous disclosure
in respect of its us operations the company made an application to the federal court to stay this second mci

all allegations made against it and is vigorously defending the proceeding

note 27  business acquisitions
diageo chateau  estates
on 1 january 2016 the company acquired 100 of the ordinary shares of diageo chateau  estates dce
a company incorporated in the us this included the acquisition of related assets in the uk dce is a leader
in the us luxury and masstige wine market being the owner of a collection of iconic wine brands based in napa
california additionally dce has a strong market presence in the commercial wine market in the uk
the cash consideration of 8038 million was funded by a combination of cash resources generated from the issue
of shares during the period and utilising the groups debt facilities
from the date of acquisition dce contributed 2007 million of revenue and 238 million to profit before tax
from continuing operations of the group revenue and profit from the acquired entities that would have been earned
if the acquisition had occurred at the commencement of the financial year has not been provided on the basis that
the calculation of that information is impracticable this is because the businesses were fully integrated into the

the acquisition method of accounting is used for all asset acquisitions regardless of whether equity instruments
or other assets are acquired
cost is measured as the fair value of cash shares issued or liabilities undertaken at the date of acquisition
costs directly attributable to the acquisition are generally included in the assets carrying amount transaction
costs arising on the issue of equity instruments are recognised directly in equity
where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred the amount payable in the future is discounted
to its present value

transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition
date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners
of the acquiree and the equity issued by the acquirer acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred and included
in administration expenses
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are with
limited exceptions measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date when the group acquires a business
it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with
the contractual terms economic conditions the groups operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions
as at the acquisition date the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill under the acquisition method the group has up to 12 months post the acquisition
date to finalise the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities
