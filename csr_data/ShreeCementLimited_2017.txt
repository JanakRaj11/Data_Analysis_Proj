overview

                            what immortalised bruce lee are not just his films or martial arts but his
                            philosophy he is certainly admired by everyone as an ace martial artist
                            and a global action movie hero but more importantly the world also knows
                            him as a revered philosopher who was extremely wellread and as an




                                                                                                            style
                            evolved human being this has helped his legacy outlast his films and
                            peers

                            bruce lee developed  jeet kune do  his own martial arts form the core
                            philosophical tenet behind jeet kune do was using no way as way
                            having no limitation as limitation this consisted of getting rid of the
                            formalised approach which bruce lee claimed was indicative of traditional
                            styles he developed a system with an emphasis on ingenuity
                            perseverance adaptability efficiency and focus he emphasised what he
                            called the style of no style

                            bruce lees philosophy of the style of no style finds relevance much
                            beyond the circles of martial arts he propounded that not keeping oneself
                            bound by the dominant accepted beliefsknowledge ultimately helps open
                            up opportunities find innovative solutions and attain outcomes that
                            otherwise seem to be unattainable it is this belief that we at shree cement
                            limited are inspired by

                            at shree we have our own effective and unique way of questioning status
                            quo challenging current beliefspractices and thereby creating newer
                            opportunities which are not visible to a cursory eye we are in a perennial
                            search of knowledge and keep on asking ourselves can we come up with
                            a better way can we attempt an output that no one would have yet dreamt
                            of of course there are limitations at every step of way but at shree our
                            resolute belief of overcoming all limitations has continually inspired us to
                            better our own benchmarks time and again

                            more so we remain focused and continually track developments to identify
                            risks and take actions to not only mitigate them but turn them into
                            opportunities at shree like bruce lee we learn everyday from
                            everywhere and come up with our own ingenious solutions that intercept
                            the everchanging future be it solving critical problems or growing with
                            stakeholders human resources community and environment shree has
                            always emerged a winner by coming up with its own way  a sustainable
                            and better way a way that is emulated by others in the industry clearly
                            our style is of no style
                                                                                                            no

                                                              empty your mind be formless shapeless like water
                                                              if you put water into a cup it becomes the cup you

                       if a mason says that he is putting bricks together then thats a normal
                       thing if he says he is making a wall that is also okay but if he says that
                       he is making a temple that would make things different and it would

           managing directors
           outlook




                                 the term science is used today with a wide range of meanings
                                 with sustained insistence of applying it to every branch of study or
                                 theory  the reason for this could be an attempt to satiate the need for
                                 vanity and maybe an effort towards ascribing precision and
                                 certainty to ones conclusion often we come across statements
                                 attributing to the belief that management is a science that can be
                                 used to achieve specific goals i would like to raise a pertinent
                                 question here can management be termed as a science

                                 at the core of every science is a scientific method which is a
                                 process for experimentation that is used to explore observations and
                                 answer questions this starts with an observation forming a
                                 hypothesis that possibly explains the observation and then doing
                                 experiments to test the hypothesis with data by an iterative process
                                 final outcome is a general theory that can then predict events with
                                 great precision once a theory has been proved by a scientific
                                 method it is regarded as an absolute truth applicable universally to
                                 predict the output irrespective of location or time newtons laws of
                                 motion are as applicable in new delhi as they are in new york

                                 can the same be said about management management also
                                 involves application of scientific methods it involves building cause
                                 and effect relationships experimenting applying logics and then
                                 making decisions in this sense management can be called as
                                 science the difference is in terms of its applicability as general
                                 theory and as a universal truth given the volatility complexity and
                                 other factors in the operating environment both internal and
                                 external a standard fits all and works always theory wont work for
                                 management there will be little utility of such general theory as
                                 management models if they are not tested from time to time about
                                  their utility in the ever changing world and situations specific
                                     demands management can be a science as long as it doesnt
                                       remain static and keeps evolving itself with the changing times
                                         and situations

                                           at shree we duly respect value and use the rigorous
                                            analysis and constant experimentation part of scientific
                                             method we however avoid falling into the trap of trying
                                              to enforce any fixed model or pattern or style of
                                               management into our operations and on our people
                                                 we observe and analyse things to develop our
                                                   approach that is best suited as per the specific
                                                      requirement our approach has to be dynamic
                                                         and constantly evolving with time situation
                                                           and place thus our management style is
                                                             a style of no style

we come across many organisations where creating and following             at times people fear questioning from senior leadership for over
standard operating procedures sops is the norm they believe that        stepping their authority for example in order to expedite project
these sops are built after thorough examination and review by              activities an extra crane might be deployed at a project site this
experts and are thus regarded as the absolute truth that cannot be         may however have lower than ideal utilization level typically this
improved they assume that sops are the best for them we at              small initiative may be avoided for want of tedious process of
shree find that there are no permanent and fixed set of rules that        approvals and budget sanctions our people however dont mind
need to be applied as sops on a consistent basis and in all                this extra expense as it has the chance of higher gains through
conditions instead we constantly question and test our present           speedier project execution focus has to be on practical approach
practices for continual betterment for us the sop is more of a           and not getting bogged down by theoretical textbook like safe
guiding light rather than a mandatory procedure we frequently try         approaches we give the slackness to our people to evaluate each
new things in our processes these trials in turn act as a regular       situation differently and practically this slackness allows individual
testing tool to check effectiveness of sops most of the times our        creativity if no slackness is there then creativity is totally killed
trials fail and we come back to our earlier sop with new learnings
every success however creates a new sop this continuous                   i also believe there is no irreconcilable conflict between the interests
reasoning experimentation and improvement based on constant               of the individuals and those of the company if there were any no
observation are nothing but a scientific approach                         company could exist a company is the great means through which
                                                                           individuals pursue and fulfill their ends for company is but another
often it is said that difference between success and failure is thin      name for the combination of individuals for cooperation in this
rolling stone gathers no moss many people emphasize that                  sense the individuals and company have interdependence on each
pursuing a proven route is the way to success when we experiment          other and this cooperation has to be overwhelmingly voluntary and
new things we see the output if results are not encouraging we feel     not out of compulsions this alignment of interests can be ensured if
it is better not to pursue if small success is there or results are       people are not bound by rigid rules and procedures but have the
encouraging it means it has to be pursued further success depends        independence to think and act like entrepreneurs empowering
on knowledge when to quit and when to pursue there cannot be a            people to work as owners and allowing calculated risk taking
theoretical rule which will apply in the same way in all the conditions   without being afraid of penalisation for failures ignites the
lot of flexibility has to be created in the science of management to     entrepreneurial spirit amongst all this has the potential to deliver
make it practical and successful                                          astounding results for company as well as the people this is what
                                                                           differentiates shree and its people
set theories that are propagated as science are often so rigid that
they lose all practicality dynamism and creativity in an organisation     at shree we believe that management is more than just a science it

                            ingenuity



           illustrating the trait
           ingenuity is either smartly deploying available solutions from across domainareas or thinking out
           newer solutions in order to find a way forward this calls for being alert to developments across
           sectors from time to time as well connecting the dots to find their application when facing a challenge
           in ones domain constant questioning of current state is a prerequisite for finding newer
           wayssolutions
           shree is replete with examples of inventiveness one such comes from the mines department in one
           instance the topographical survey of mines was not practically possible to the extent desirable
           spread over a vast area local factors uneven terrain etc were just some of the challenges even if
           overcome the time consumption and manpower deployment were other factors to be considered all
           this still carried a risk of the outcome having fair a margin of error this is when the team at shree
           decided to deploy unmanned aerial vehicle uav drone technology this firstofitskindinindia
           survey was entirely planned by the team at shree completed in just 3 days as against the alternative
           time requirement of two months shree is probably the first indian cement company to have
           successfully used the aerial survey by drone technology

various martial arts forms have their share of structure           also recognises that penalising an idea that didnt work or

boxer the best boxer likewise a karate or judo person  in        organizational interest hence such practices are highly
short a typecast this is because they follow a set pattern in    discouraged at shree failure is still acceptable not thinking
real life one is supposed to be a fighter not a boxer karate    enough isnt ingenuity is a way of life at shree it is a life force
judo person the best fighter is above all he kicks too well for   to stay relevant and create an edge in the competitive sector
a boxer throws too good for a karate champ and punches            here are some examples
too good for a judo man boxing judo or karate is nothing but
fixing a fighter in a pattern when one denies ones true nature                                      conserving energy by

           limestone pile in conventional technology neutrons are
           generated through a radioactive material which is always
           active emitting radiations even during shutdown of cba
           the cba installed at shree produces electrically activated
           neutrons so whenever the crusher stops it automatically
           stops it automatically gets active at the time of analysis
           whats more there is no risk of radiation during maintenance
           it gives realtime analysis of limestone feeding to pile as well
           as captures quality of 100 limestone passing through the
           belt while in conventional system only samples are taken for
           analysis due to this trust on chemical results of limestone
           has improved there is no involvement of human being in the

           which has all the things that have the potential to go wrong causing project delays accordingly despite
           best of intent and efforts given the interlinking nature of components civil mechanical electrical
           etc of a project and dependence of external agencies failures and setbacks are bound to happen
           leading to potential delay in project commissioning yet shree has not only completed all its projects
           on time but has also improved its track record each time a project is executed and in the process new
           benchmarks are created and world records are broken obstacles do deter us hurdles do hinder us and
           problems do galore it is sheer determination and resolve of our people to never give up and try one
           more time that makes us win over all such challenges each time we overcome a challenge our self
           belief builds further and gives us the energy and motivation to overcome all the remaining obstacles to

           finding root cause  finding solutions

           our raipur team was facing a problem of repetitive
           overheating and consequent melting of rotor leads wires
           of raw mill fan motor each failure of rotor leads was
           causing 45 hours of breakdown of raw mill fan and
           complete raw mill circuit as also repetitive expenditure
           towards lead replacement
           this was brought to the notice of oem supplier and their
           service engineer visited the plant twice but the root cause of
           the repetitive failure of rotor flexible leads could not be
           identified experts from oem conveyed that since the likely
           problem area in equipment was very confined it was not
           possible to perform internal inspection and the motor shall
           have to be sent to oem factory for dismantling so as to
           identify the root cause of rotor leads failure this was not a
           practical option as it was expected that the oem may keep the
           critical component with him for long and still not be able to
           identify the fault
           not satisfied with the oems approach our team started a
           detailed analysis wherein all the different factors that could
           lead to melting of rotor leads were controlled one by one to
           see if they could identify the root cause by a process of
           elimination of potential factors despite best efforts they
           could still not identify the problem
           nevertheless our people were not disheartened and the next
           time when the motor tripped due to same problem engineers
           in the team decided to make a video using a mobile of the
           internal sections of the confined areas of the equipment that
           could not be manually inspected they could then notice that
           brazings between rotor stud  slipring had failed at some
           points and this was causing overheating once the problem
           was identified our team performed proper brazing between
           rotor stud  slipring before it was restarted since then the
           motor has been operating without failure not giving up
           despite intermittent challenges helped our team to come out
           with an enduring solution to the problem at hand

quick learning  quick loading

our railway siding at ras was commissioned recently as per      soon our railway siding was started and it was seen that
the railways scheme companies have a 6 hour free time limit     despite our best efforts and implementation of best practises
for loading of rake and for any delay thereafter demurrage is    our rake loadings was initially not coming within the 6 hour
payable normally newly star ted sidings given their            time limit and at times was going as high as 1215 hours not
developing systems and operational expertise take up to 12      disheartened by the initial results our team continued to do
15 hours for doing rake loading it is only after years of       improvisation and customization to the industry best
experience that systems and processes become robust              practises and finetuned them to our local infrastructure
enough for them to cut down the rake loading time and bring it   design at ras continuous discussion amongst the team for
close to 6 hour free time limit of railways however team at     improvising the systems and constructive feedback to the
shrees ras siding was not ready to take this experience of      people at ground helped us strengthen our systems quickly
others as a gospel truth they wondered if there was a faster    no wonder within three months of commissioning of our new
way to optimize their operations in the shortest time thus      railway siding the team started achieving success with
even before the siding operations were started people were      successful instances of rake loading within the 6 hour time
sent to visit shrees operational railway sidings at beawar as   popping up from time to time it was nothing but our teams
well as that of some other companies a study was done to        persistence of taking initial setback in their stride and
see how the best system could be implemented by learning         continuous working towards their goal that helped the team
from experiences at other sites and not repeating the usual      cut down the rake loading time in minimal time as against the
initial mistakes the teams adapted the best learnings from      years taken at other places
their observations at different operational sidings and
deployed them at our ras siding

           flexibility is a natural outcome when one has his eyes fixed so hard on the goal that he is not ready to be
           beaten down by the difficulties on the path to his goal
           being ontime every time is a virtue at shree an organisation that takes immense pride in its focus on
           freezing the roadmap to project execution can face dilemma if it were to change its course or face
           project delay not shree
           the coal mill erection work was on and the time required for setting up its civil structure was likely to
           take time that had the risk of delaying the project while the obvious solution was to expedite the civil
           work but given the nature of civil construction requirement the minimum time required would have still
           been more than the time that was available for overall project commissioning evaluating the situation
           the team came up with an alternate approach of converting sections of civil structure with steel
           fabrication structure which could save time evaluating the options the case was presented to seniors
           and decision was taken to switch some sections from civil structure to steel structure end result was
           that the coal mill section got commissioned on time the teams were thus not blinded by the
           conventional way they were required to work and were flexible to alter their approach as was required
           by the situation
           adaptability at shree also recognises no compromise with values such as quality products etc yet
           shree always views the developments with an open mind and receptive to midcourse corrections this

           illustrating the trait


           shree takes pride in the performance benchmarks it has sets in all areas of its operations this has
           been possible only because of an unwavering commitment to our passion for efficiency in everything
           we do this in turn pushes us to the top spot in terms of lowest cost of production
           how much shree values efficiency is illustrated in an example an excavator procured from a global
           leader was tagged with an operating life of 13000 hours after which a major overhaul was needed our
           mines team worked on various aspects of its operation and maintenance activities including
           continuous monitoring of its health result is that they have been able to continuously operate the
           excavator for more than 41000 hours against 13000 hours time limit of supplier without requiring an
           overhaul the machines qualitative output and fuel efficiency is still at optimum level even the
           equipment supplier has appreciated the performance benchmark set by our team

           the limitation of no limitation
           in most martial arts forms unusual display of action is at play this activity without focus and adaptability is nothing but wastage
           of moves by a player in turn leading to loss of energy and time in jkd the emphasis is strongly on conserving every move to
           deliver precise punch or kick for a fighter this economy is a function of focus and flexibility economy is akin to competency that

helps the practitioner of jkd to inculcate ways and means to          our passion for efficiency helps us maintain our cost
conserve energy as well as movement what is the point in             leadership that in turn helps us keep our business profitable
wasting ones energy by just moving about aimlessly in air           across the demand cycles that commodity businesses are
                                                                      known for some of our recent achievements demonstrating
in simple words efficiency is getting maximum output for
                                                                      our passion for efficiency are presented in the next page
minimum input this includes cutting or avoiding wastes
increasing productivity and optimal utilization of resources
man machine materials passion for efficiency requires
organization to turn their isolated unidirection efforts and
initiatives into a systemic efficiency systemic efficiency
seeks to extend the concept of efficiency to a level where the
process of getting more out of less is continuous one and
runs across the breadth of an organisation real sustainable
gains are assured only if systemic efficiency is weaved into
the cultural fabric of the organization such systemic
efficiency then gets converted into an economic advantage
that is sustainable and leads to competitive leadership
efficiency has two levers first is maximizing output getting
more achieved than earlier second is minimizing input using
less men machine material time than before to move

    for people at shree the process
    of improving the input to output
    ratio is woven into a never
    ending journey
either of the two levers the starting point is to believe that our
current state is not the best and it can be improved the
people will then certainly work on finding innovative ways and
novel ideas to create more value next is the faith and
trust of the leadership to allow people to nurture their ideas
try and attempt them encourage them even if results
may not be along expected lines the incessant spree of
regular advancements and perfections will be a sure shot
outcome
shree has embedded this culture of efficiency all across its
operations for people at shree the process of improving the
input to output ratio is woven into a never ending journey
each one of them wears the hat of an entrepreneur and thus is
perpetually motivated to bring about incremental change from
the present levels for better they clearly know that what was
their best yesterday has to be improved today and what has
become best today must be further improved tomorrow
in todays hyper competitive business environment if we do
not take the proactive steps to be the leader in efficiency
marketplace may evolve and we may soon lose our cost
leadership due to steps of our competitors passion for
efficiency thus has to be sustained as a perpetual milestone
shree has exactly taken it in its right earnest as a result
shree has earned the distinction of being one of the lowest
cost producer in the industry

           efficiency in operations                                            freight cost thus a route was devised with a mix of rail and
                                                                               road transport that made sourcing slag from the new source

           relatively lower power consumption than their older versions
                                                                               suppliers
           people generally take it for granted that the vintage plants at a
           company shall be inefficient and cannot be improved but not       similarly company procures gypsum from iranoman but the
           at shree kiln no1 which was set up in 1985 and was                suppliers were substantially increasing their price over last
           upgraded from time to time was still inefficient compared to        year alternative source of procuring from suppliers of bhutan
           kilns set up thereafter team shree took the challenge and          was also not working out to be economical we evaluated the
           aimed at bringing down its power consumption to the level of        total rail movement capacity from bhutan team identified
           new units several brainstorming sessions were undertaken          that if savings of empty flow direction and station to station
           it was found that the basic layout of the plant had inherent       scheme of railways are considered bhutan supplies can be
           inefficiencies in normal circumstances people could have           economical immediately an annual contract was agreed with
           put the blame on plants layout design and stopped the quest        railways for the entire capacity available at attractive freight
           team shree however went ahead and started breaking down             rates we could save on our gypsum cost and also developed
           the power consumption to smallest equipment level and               an alternate source to deter regular price increase efforts of
           unear thed areas showing potential for improvement                 other suppliers
           individual responsibilities were assigned daily discussion on      our teams keep evaluating different options to bring down
           power consumption of respective sections and reason for             costs typical practice is to develop a particular rail or road
           variance were done such whywhy analysis with ownership            route and stick to it we however continually test the
           put on people helped the team question things that were             developing market dynamics and keep switching from one
           unquestioned till then such as can we replace a large              option to another to contain our costs developing alternative
           compressor that is to be run even when requirement is for a         supply sources helps us deter regular suppliers to use their
           very small section with smaller portable compressors              dominant position and resort to periodic unwarranted price
           similarly can we put auto power stop and start commands to         increases
           auxiliary equipment that otherwise kept on running when
           plant was down for short duration and so on                                                       efficient contract award
           the objective was to question the present and find a better
           way improvements were not very significant in first step but       people at shree believe that time is of immense importance in
           quite motivating for the team over a period of time the effort     projects they all understand that if a project activity in their
           helped reduce the power consumption substantially another          domain can be expedited by even one day it helps expeditious
           advantage was that given our multiple units operating at            completion of project aggregate impact of all such small
           multiple sites the micro level improvements learned through        initiatives helps advancing the project commissioning which
           the effort was replicated at other units to multiply the scale of   in turn translates into opportunity of tapping sale in advance

           efficiency in procurement                                           contractor typically project people call for offers make
                                                                               comparatives prepare draft terms of contract negotiate and
           at its cement plant in the state of bihar shree produces           then finalize the same at shree as soon as it gets clear that
           portland slag cement using granulated slag generated from           management has decided to start ground work on a project
           steel plants slag is procured from steel plants located in         our contract department instead of waiting for any formal
           adjoining states with increasing demand it was observed           request coming from the internal departments starts
           that price of slag was being increased by sellers team shree       working on drafting contract terms and discussing with
           started looking for newer economical sources of slag efforts       contractors to assess their readiness for mobilisation at site
           paid off when they found another source of slag in central          this ensures that no time is lost for things like contract
           india which was economical and also had advantage of                finalisation as they have been planned well in advance
           relatively lower moisture however due to the longer distance      similarly as a project is nearing completion the contracts
           freight cost nullified the entire price advantage of this new       department starts discussion with om contractors in
           source team again deliberated to examine the ways to cut           advance to ensure that the om contractors and their
           down this higher freight cost they found that the railways         contracts are finalised and no time is lost between project

strategy in action


           shrees success mantra is its focus on optimizations to keep
           improving the per formance levels here are some                                                     minimizing bag bursting
           illustrations of this approach
                                                                                 observations and inferences from captured data revealed

           focus on project monitoring
                                                                                 plants a prima facie argument to counter the view could have
                                                                                 been that since dispatches from the plant were low hence the
           a delay in project maybe a common refrain across a lot of
                                                                                 result expressed in percent point appeared higher however
           industries but this is unheard of at shree this is what sets

           company apart from the rest and it is not so difficult to
                                                                                 perspective soon the vigil at shop floor was enhanced and
           fathom while it is an accepted industry practice to review
                                                                                 every possible cause was noted every practice and
           project related developments on a fortnightly monthly
                                                                                 deviation was diligently recorded to arrive at the root cause
           quarterly and yearly basis at shree the focus is on daily
                                                                                 the underlying issues were addressed some wrong

                                                                                 practises of contract workers deployed were noticed and
           milestones on deliverables and broader timelines are shared
                                                                                 were duly corrected regular training to packing plant

           internal departments but project consultants at one end and
                                                                                 eventually the issue was resolved with significant cost
           the vendors on the other the daily monitoring is so sacred
                                                                                 savings as the incidence of bag bursting was brought within
           that it can be gauged from the fact that the management
                                                                                 acceptable limits
           tracks daily developments on broad 10 parameters while the
           execution team knows exactly what is to be achieved in a day
           and plan ahead for the next there is another advantage of this
           focused approach the schedules are tight but the pressure
           on the team is nil and above all everyone is not only aligned
           but also in control of the situation no wonder shree has
           bettered its own score with each successive project

           focus on quantifying in value equivalent

           at shree there is focus on achieving systemic efficiency
           one can argue there are targets for each and every function in
           every company and efficiency parameters defined with
           enough checks and balances in place however shree has
           moved a notch up by moving from targets driven approach
           to any parameters value equivalent terms the notional loss
           for not achieving the efficiency parameter is calculated and
           shared with respective department the idea is to bring in
           prudence in the system as only awareness can cultivate
           responsibility for instance monitoring of truck waiting
           time at shree company has set an internal benchmark of
           four hours for a truck to do its round at shree so that it hits the
           road at the earliest to reach its destination being a good
           paymaster with efficient systems there are many players
           who have been offering services to shree at competitive
           prices yet shree works out the value equivalent notional
           loss of a truck staying on campus beyond the stipulated time
           this is just to reinforce the fact that focus is not lost
           company believes no vendor will bear the cost of extra
           waiting and that sooner or later a vendor structures
           companys systemic inefficiency into its offered pricing
           which has direct impact on companys freight costs also
           this helps the company work towards and demand dynamic
           pricing in its favour from the vendors

the master knows too well that for people to be happy in what they pursue
there are three prerequisites first they must be all for it ie motivated
second they must not do too much of it in a short span ie maintain a work

           challenging assignments rather than business as usual and status quo
           the challenge for the organisation lies in institutionalising this process of idea generation from all
           quarters so that they are not limited to an occasional trickle but come out continuously thus to
           motivate employees to innovate in their domain and think out of the box shree has setup a reward and
           recognition program for celebrating innovation all employees are free to submit innovative ideas
           implemented by them in an internal system and the same is reviewed by a crossfunctional group of
           leaders based on the nature of innovation implemented the teams that implemented these ideas are
           publically appreciated and rewarded at companywide celebrations held on the republic day and the
           independence day the idea is to make our people feel that their innovations and idea generation is
           appreciated by company and the organisation is willing to trust them by supporting them in novel ideas
           generated by them

           the structure of no structure
           people are not only an asset of an organization they are the organization an organizations reputation  good or bad  for being

      fair value techniques
      the fair value of the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
      a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
      the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values
      a   fair value of cash and short term deposits trade receivables trade payables current loans other current ﬁnancial assets short
           term borrowings and other current ﬁnancial liabilities approximate to their carrying amount largely due to the short term
           maturities of these instruments
      b   long term ﬁxed rate and variable rate receivables  borrowings are evaluated by the company based on parameters such as
           interest rate speciﬁc country risk factors credit risk and other risk characteristics fair value of variable interest rate borrowings
           approximates their carrying values for ﬁxed interest rate borrowings fair value is determined by using discounted cash flow
           dcf method using discount rate that reﬂects the issuers borrowings rate risk of nonperformance for the company is
           considered to be insigniﬁcant in valuation

     c   the fair value of derivatives are estimated by using pricing models where the inputs to those models are based on readily
          observable market parameters basis contractual terms period to maturity and market parameters such as interest rates
          foreign exchange rates and volatility these models do not contain a high level of subjectivity as the valuation techniques used do
          not require signiﬁcant judgement and inputs thereto are readily observable from actively quoted market prices management
          has evaluated the credit and nonperformance risks associated with its derivatives counterparties and believe them to be
          insigniﬁcant and not warranting a credit adjustment
     fair value hierarchy
     the following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of companys asset and liabilities grouped into level 1 to level 3
     as described below
     quoted prices  published net asset value nav in an active markets level 1 this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets that are
     measured by reference to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and ﬁnancial instruments like
     mutual funds for which nav is published by mutual funds this category consists mutual fund investments
     valuation techniques with observable inputs level 2 this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets and liabilities measured using
     inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or
     indirectly ie derived from prices
     valuation techniques with signiﬁcant unobservable inputs level 3 this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
     measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data ie unobservable inputs fair values are determined in whole
     or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market
     transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data

       during the year ended 31032017 and 31032016 there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements
       and no transfer into and out of level 3 fair value measurements there is no transactionbalance under level 3
       the fair values of the ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities included in the level 2 categories above have been determined in
       accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash ﬂow analysis with the most signiﬁcant inputs being
       the discount rate that reﬂects the credit risk of counterparties following table describes the valuation techniques used and key
       inputs to valuation for level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as at 31032017 31032016 and 01072015 respectively

notes forming part of financial statements




      the company manages market risk through a treasury department which evaluates and exercises independent control over the
      entire process of market risk management the treasury department recommends risk management objectives and policies which
      are approved by senior management and the audit and risk management committee the activities of this department include
      management of cash resources implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures borrowing strategies and ensuring
      compliance with market risk limits and policies
      the board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarized below
      market risk and sensitivity
      market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instruments will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market
      prices market risk comprises two types of risk currency rate risk and interest rate risk financial instruments aﬀected by market risk
      include loans and borrowings deposits investments and derivatives ﬁnancial instruments foreign currency risk is the risk that the
      fair value or future cash ﬂows of ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates interest rate risk is
      the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market interest rates this
      is based on the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities held as at 31032017 and 31032016
      the sensitivity analyses excludes the impact of movement in market variables on the carrying value of postemployment beneﬁt
      obligations provisions and on nonﬁnancial assets and liabilities the sensitivity of the relevant statement of proﬁt and loss item is the
      eﬀect of the assumed changes in respective market rates the companys activities exposes it to a variety of ﬁnancial risk including the
      eﬀect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the company uses derivatives ﬁnancial instruments such as
      foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currency and interest rate swaps of varying maturity depending upon the underlying
      contract and risk management strategy to manage its exposures to foreign exchange ﬂuctuation and interest rates
      interest rate risk and sensitivity
      the companys exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the long term debt obligations and buyers
      credit obligations with ﬂoating interest rates
      the companys policy is to manage its ﬂoating interest rate loans and borrowings by entering into interest rate swaps in which the
      company agrees to exchange at speciﬁed intervals the diﬀerence between ﬁxed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by
      reference to an agreed upon principal amount
      the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible changes in interest rates on that portion of loans and
      borrowings aﬀected aﬅer the impact of hedge accounting with all other variables held constant the companys proﬁt before tax is
      aﬀected through the impact on ﬂoating rate borrowings as follows

      the assumed movement in basis points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the currently observable market environment
      foreign currency risk and sensitivity
      the company has obtained foreign currency loans and has foreign currency payables for supply of fuel raw material and equipment
      and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk the company uses cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts to
      eliminate the currency exposures
      the impact on proﬁt before tax is due to change in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities including non designated foreign
      currency derivatives

       ﬁnancial loss the company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily trade receivables and from its investing
       activities including deposits with banks mutual funds and ﬁnancial institutions and other ﬁnancial instruments
       trade receivables
       the company extends credit to customers in normal course of business the company considers factors such as credit track record in
       the market and past dealings for extension of credit to customers the company monitors the payment track record of the
       customers outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored the company evaluates the concentration of risk with
       respect to trade receivables as low as its customers are located in several jurisdiction and industries and operate in largely
       independent markets the company has also taken advances and security deposits from its customers which mitigate the credit risk
       to an extent

            under indian gaap the company accounted for long term investments in bonds and debentures as investments measured at
            cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments under ind as the company has designated
            these investments as ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost at the date of transition to ind as diﬀerence between
            amortized cost and the indian gaap carrying value has been recognized in retained earnings subsequent to the date of
            transition to ind as interest income has been recognized based on eir method
      b    financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss fvtpl
            under indian gaap the company accounted for long term investments in preference shares and mutual funds as investments
            measured at cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments and current investments at
            lower of cost or market value under ind as the company has designated these investments as ﬁnancial assets measured at fair
            value through proﬁt or loss ind as requires that investment designated at fvtpl are measured at fair value at the date of
            transition to ind as diﬀerence between fair value and the indian gaap carrying value has been recognized in retained earnings
            subsequent to the date of transition to ind as fair value gain or loss has been recognized to statement of proﬁt and loss
      c    derivative financial instruments
            the fair value of cross currency and interest rate swaps is recognized under ind as under indian gaap there is no mandatory
            standard that deals with accounting of swaps hence the same was not recognized the swaps which were designated as hedging
            instruments under indian gaap have been designated as at the date of transition to ind as as hedging instruments in a cash ﬂow
            hedge the corresponding adjustments have been recognized as a separate component of equity under the eﬀective portion of
            cash ﬂow hedge reserve
      d    deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities
            both under indian gaap and ind as the company recognized costs related to post employment deﬁned beneﬁt plan on an
            actuarial basis under indian gaap the entire costs including actuarial gains and losses are charged to statement of proﬁt and
            loss under ind as remeasurements comprising of actuarial gains or losses the eﬀect of the asset ceiling excluding amounts
            included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net
            interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit
            to retained earnings through other comprehensive income thus the employee beneﬁt cost is increased by  532 crore and
            remeasurement gain on deﬁned beneﬁt plan has been recognized in the other comprehensive income net of tax
      e    provisions
            under indian gaap the company has accounted for provisions including long term provisions at the undiscounted amount in
            contrast ind as 37 requires that where the eﬀect of time value of money is material the amount of provision should be the
            present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation the discount rates should not reﬂect risk for
            which future cash ﬂow estimates have been adjusted ind as 37 also provides that where discounting is used the carrying
            amount of a provision increases in each period to reﬂect the passage of time this increase is recognized as borrowing cost this
            led to a decrease in the provision for mines reclamation expenses on the date of transition by  1237 crore and which was
            adjusted to retained earnings

      f   deferred tax
           indian gaap requires deferred tax accounting using the income statement approach which focuses on diﬀerences between
           taxable proﬁts and accounting proﬁts for the period ind as 12income taxes requires entities to account for deferred taxes
           using the balance sheet approach which focuses on temporary diﬀerences between the carrying amount of asset or liability in
           the balance sheet and its corresponding tax base the application of ind as 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred
           tax on new temporary diﬀerences which was not required under indian gaap
           in addition the various transitional adjustments lead to temporary diﬀerences according to the accounting policies the
           company has to account for such diﬀerences deferred tax adjustments are recognized in correlation to the underlying
           transaction either in retained earnings or a separate component of equity
           mat credit entitlement is in the nature of deferred tax under ind as hence on transition to ind as mat credit entitlement of
            9587 crore as on 01072015 and  10740 crore as on 31032016 has been grouped under deferred tax assets from current
           tax assets

           under indian gaap government grants in the nature of promoters contribution are recognized to capital reserve under ind as
           all government grants has to be recognized to the statement of proﬁt and loss accordingly government grants recognized to
           the statement of proﬁt and loss further the government grants credited to capital reserve under erstwhile indian gaap have
           also been reclassiﬁed to retained earnings as per ind as 101  first time adoption of indian accounting standards
      h   sale of goods
           under indian gaap sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty however under ind as sale of goods includes excise duty
           excise duty on sale of goods is separately presented on the face of statement of proﬁt and loss accordingly sale of goods under
           ind as for the nine months ended 31032016 has increased by  67632 crore
           under ind as cash discount and other sale incentives are required to be netted oﬀ from sale of products which was accounted as
           expenses under indian gaap hence sale of products is decreased by 11672 crore for the period ended 31032016
           under ind as when goods or services are exchanged or swapped for goods or services which are of a similar nature and value the
           exchange is not regarded as a transaction which generates revenue thus sale of products and cost of material consumed has
           been decreased by  2120 crore for the period ended 31032016
      i   statement of cash flows
           the impact of transition from indian gaap to ind as on the statement of cash flows is due to various reclassiﬁcation
           adjustments recorded under ind as in balance sheet statement of proﬁt and loss and diﬀerences in the deﬁnition of cash and
           cash equivalents in ind as and indian gaap

           under indian gaap transaction costs incurred in connection with borrowings are charged upfront to statement of proﬁt and
           loss for the periodyear under ind as transaction costs are included in the initial recognition amount of ﬁnancial liability and
           charged to statement of proﬁt and loss using eﬀective interest method
      k   other comprehensive income
           under indian gaap the company has not presented other comprehensive income oci separately hence it has reconciled
           indian gaap proﬁt or loss to proﬁt or loss as per ind as further indian gaap proﬁt or loss is reconciled to total comprehensive
           income as per ind as
      l   proposed dividend and tax on proposed dividend
           under indian gaap proposed dividends including tax on proposed dividend are recognized as liability in the period to which they
           relate irrespective of the approval by shareholders under ind as proposed dividend is recognized as a liability in the period in

      fair value techniques
      the fair value of the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
      a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
      the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values
      a    fair value of cash and short term deposits trade receivables trade payables current loans other current ﬁnancial assets short
            term borrowings and other current ﬁnancial liabilities approximate to their carrying amount largely due to the short term
            maturities of these instruments
      b    long term ﬁxed rate and variable rate receivables  borrowings are evaluated by the company based on parameters such as
            interest rate speciﬁc country risk factors credit risk and other risk characteristics fair value of variable interest rate
            borrowings approximates their carrying values for ﬁxed interest rate borrowings fair value is determined by using discounted
            cash flow dcf method using discount rate that reﬂects the issuers borrowings rate risk of nonperformance for the company
            is considered to be insigniﬁcant in valuation

     c   the fair value of derivatives are estimated by using pricing models where the inputs to those models are based on readily
          observable market parameters basis contractual terms period to maturity and market parameters such as interest rates
          foreign exchange rates and volatility these models do not contain a high level of subjectivity as the valuation techniques used do
          not require signiﬁcant judgement and inputs thereto are readily observable from actively quoted market prices management
          has evaluated the credit and nonperformance risks associated with its derivatives counterparties and believe them to be
          insigniﬁcant and not warranting a credit adjustment
     fair value hierarchy
     the following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of companys asset and liabilities grouped into level 1 to level 3
     as described below
     quoted prices  published net asset value nav in an active markets level 1 this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets that are
     measured by reference to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and ﬁnancial instruments like
     mutual funds for which nav is published by mutual funds this category consists mutual fund investments
     valuation techniques with observable inputs level 2 this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets and liabilities measured using
     inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or
     indirectly ie derived from prices
     valuation techniques with signiﬁcant unobservable inputs level 3 this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets and liabilities

      during the year ended 31032017 and 31032016 there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and
      no transfer into and out of level 3 fair value measurements there is no transactionbalance under level 3
      the fair values of the ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities included in the level 2 categories above have been determined in
      accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash ﬂow analysis with the most signiﬁcant inputs being
      the discount rate that reﬂects the credit risk of counterparties following table describes the valuation techniques used and key
      inputs to valuation for level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as at 31032017 31032016 and 01072015 respectively

      the company is exposed to market risk credit risk and liquidity risk
      the company manages market risk through a treasury department which evaluates and exercises independent control over the
      entire process of market risk management the treasury department recommends risk management objectives and policies which
      are approved by senior management and the audit and risk management committee the activities of this department include
      management of cash resources implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures borrowing strategies and ensuring
      compliance with market risk limits and policies
      the board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarized below
      market risk and sensitivity
      market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instruments will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market
      prices market risk comprises two types of risk currency rate risk and interest rate risk financial instruments aﬀected by market risk
      include loans and borrowings deposits investments and derivatives ﬁnancial instruments foreign currency risk is the risk that the
      fair value or future cash ﬂows of ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates interest rate risk is
      the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market interest rates this
      is based on the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities held as at 31032017 and 31032016
      the sensitivity analyses excludes the impact of movement in market variables on the carrying value of postemployment beneﬁt
      obligations provisions and on nonﬁnancial assets and liabilities the sensitivity of the relevant statement of proﬁt and loss item is the
      eﬀect of the assumed changes in respective market rates the companys activities exposes it to a variety of ﬁnancial risk including the
      eﬀect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the company uses derivatives ﬁnancial instruments such as
      foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currency and interest rate swaps of varying maturity depending upon the underlying
      contract and risk management strategy to manage its exposures to foreign exchange ﬂuctuation and interest rates
      interest rate risk and sensitivity
      the companys exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the long term debt obligations and buyers
      credit obligations with ﬂoating interest rates
      the companys policy is to manage its ﬂoating interest rate loans and borrowings by entering into interest rate swaps in which the
      company agrees to exchange at speciﬁed intervals the diﬀerence between ﬁxed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by
      reference to an agreed upon principal amount
      the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible changes in interest rates on that portion of loans and
      borrowings aﬀected aﬅer the impact of hedge accounting with all other variables held constant the companys proﬁt before tax is
      aﬀected through the impact on ﬂoating rate borrowings as follows

      the assumed movement in basis points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the currently observable market environment
      foreign currency risk and sensitivity
      the company has obtained foreign currency loans and has foreign currency payables for supply of fuel raw material and equipment
      and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk the company uses cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts to
      eliminate the currency exposures
      the impact on proﬁt before tax is due to change in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities including nondesignated foreign
      currency derivatives

       ﬁnancial loss the company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily trade receivables and from its investing
       activities including deposits with banks mutual funds and ﬁnancial institutions and other ﬁnancial instruments
       trade receivables

       the market and past dealings for extension of credit to customers the company monitors the payment track record of the
       customers outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored the company evaluates the concentration of risk with
       respect to trade receivables as low as its customers are located in several jurisdiction and industries and operate in largely
       independent markets the company has also taken advances and security deposits from its customers which mitigate the credit risk
       to an extent

          under indian gaap the company accounted for long term investments in bonds and debentures as investments measured at
          cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments under ind as the company has designated
          these investments as ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost at the date of transition to ind as diﬀerence between
          amortized cost and the indian gaap carrying value has been recognized in retained earnings subsequent to the date of
          transition to ind as interest income has been recognized based on eir method
     b   financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss fvtpl
          under indian gaap the company accounted for long term investments in preference shares and mutual funds as investments
          measured at cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments and current investments at
          lower of cost or market value under ind as the company has designated these investments as ﬁnancial assets measured at fair
          value through proﬁt or loss ind as requires that investment designated at fvtpl are measured at fair value at the date of
          transition to ind as diﬀerence between fair value and the indian gaap carrying value has been recognized in retained earnings
          subsequent to the date of transition to ind as fair value gain or loss has been recognized to statement of proﬁt and loss
     c   derivative financial instruments
          the fair value of cross currency and interest rate swaps is recognized under ind as under indian gaap there is no mandatory
          standard that deals with accounting of swaps hence the same was not recognized the swaps which were designated as hedging
          instruments under indian gaap have been designated as at the date of transition to ind as as hedging instruments in a cash ﬂow
          hedge the corresponding adjustments have been recognized as a separate component of equity under the eﬀective portion of
          cash ﬂow hedge reserve
     d   deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities
          both under indian gaap and ind as the company recognized costs related to post employment deﬁned beneﬁt plan on an
          actuarial basis under indian gaap the entire costs including actuarial gains and losses are charged to statement of proﬁt and
          loss under ind as remeasurements comprising of actuarial gains or losses the eﬀect of the asset ceiling excluding amounts
          included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net
          interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit
          to retained earnings through other comprehensive income thus the employee beneﬁt cost is increased by  532 crore and

     e   provisions
          under indian gaap the company has accounted for provisions including long term provisions at the undiscounted amount in
          contrast ind as 37 requires that where the eﬀect of time value of money is material the amount of provision should be the
          present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation the discount rates should not reﬂect risk for
          which future cash ﬂow estimates have been adjusted ind as 37 also provides that where discounting is used the carrying
          amount of a provision increases in each period to reﬂect the passage of time this increase is recognized as borrowing cost this
          led to a decrease in the provision for mines reclamation expenses on the date of transition by  1237crore and which was
          adjusted to retained earnings



                                                                                                                 annual report 201617  263

notes forming part of consolidated financial statements




      f    deferred tax
            indian gaap requires deferred tax accounting using the income statement approach which focuses on diﬀerences between
            taxable proﬁts and accounting proﬁts for the period ind as 12income taxes requires entities to account for deferred taxes
            using the balance sheet approach which focuses on temporary diﬀerences between the carrying amount of asset or liability in
            the balance sheet and its corresponding tax base the application of ind as 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred
            tax on new temporary diﬀerences which was not required under indian gaap
            in addition the various transitional adjustments lead to temporary diﬀerences according to the accounting policies the
            company has to account for such diﬀerences deferred tax adjustments are recognized in correlation to the underlying
            transaction either in retained earnings or a separate component of equity
            mat credit entitlement is in the nature of deferred tax under ind as hence on transition to ind as mat credit entitlement of
             9587 crore as on 01072015 and  10740 crore as on 31032016 has been grouped under deferred tax assets from current
            tax assets
      g    government grants
            under indian gaap government grants in the nature of promoters contribution are recognized to capital reserve under ind as
            all government grants has to be recognized to the statement of proﬁt and loss accordingly government grants recognized to
            the statement of proﬁt and loss further the government grants credited to capital reserve under erstwhile indian gaap have
            also been reclassiﬁed to retained earnings as per ind as 101  first time adoption of indian accounting standards
      h    sale of goods
            under indian gaap sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty however under ind as sale of goods includes excise duty
            excise duty on sale of goods is separately presented on the face of statement of proﬁt and loss accordingly sale of goods under
            ind as for the nine months ended 31032016 has increased by  67632 crore
            under ind as cash discount and other sale incentives are required to be netted oﬀ from sale of products which was accounted as
            expenses under indian gaap hence sale of products is decreased by 11672 crore for the period ended 31032016
            under ind as when goods or services are exchanged or swapped for goods or services which are of a similar nature and value the
            exchange is not regarded as a transaction which generates revenue thus sale of products and cost of material consumed has
            been decreased by  2120 crore for the period ended 31032016
      i    statement of cash flows
            the impact of transition from indian gaap to ind as on the statement of cash flows is due to various reclassiﬁcation
            adjustments recorded under ind as in balance sheet statement of proﬁt and loss and diﬀerences in the deﬁnition of cash and
            cash equivalents in ind as and indian gaap
      j    borrowings
            under indian gaap transaction costs incurred in connection with borrowings are charged upfront to statement of proﬁt and
            loss for the periodyear under ind as transaction costs are included in the initial recognition amount of ﬁnancial liability and
            charged to statement of proﬁt and loss using eﬀective interest method
      k    other comprehensive income
            under indian gaap the company has not presented other comprehensive income oci separately hence it has reconciled
            indian gaap proﬁt or loss to proﬁt or loss as per ind as further indian gaap proﬁt or loss is reconciled to total comprehensive
            income as per ind as
      l    proposed dividend and tax on proposed dividend
            under indian gaap proposed dividends including tax on proposed dividend are recognized as liability in the period to which they
            relate irrespective of the approval by shareholders under ind as proposed dividend is recognized as a liability in the period in
            which it is declared by the company when approved by shareholders in a general meeting or paid therefore the proposed
            dividend and tax on proposed dividend of  5870 crore as on 01072015 has been derecognized and recognized in 201516 on
            approval by shareholders and payment
