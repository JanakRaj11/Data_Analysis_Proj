caring for a world
of patients

e   very year more people are crossing borders for
    healthcare with over 345000 patients from
outside of thailand bumrungrad is among the most
popular destinations
  traveling far from home for medical treatment
requires courage and trust one way we serve
patients from abroad is with referral offices in other
countries over a dozen such offices in cities such
as addis ababa muscat dhaka yangon ulan bator
and melbourne offer patients a local point of contact
with a friendly face to answer their questions
   together with the hospitals awardwinning
website these referral offices highlight our facilities
help patients select and make appointments
with appropriate specialists estimate costs and
plan their trip most importantly they initiate the
communication and coordination with doctors and
staff at the hospital thus the care that is delivered
at bumrungrad begins with caring close to home
