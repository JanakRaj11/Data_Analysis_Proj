we want to be
the forerunner and
bring new thinking
to the industry


investments in offshore markets for these reasons the
amount of orders for new freight carriers collapsed and
offshore investments decreased sharply during the year
this weakened the demand for macgregors equipment and
services
    world trade grew at a slower rate in 2016 than in
the previous year however we believe that most of the
megatrends will increase demand in the coming years key
megatrends for our businesses are urbanisation the new
middleclass consumers entering the markets in developing
countries and the increasing stringency of safety and
environmental regulations related to logistics

digitalisation to further develop the level of smartness in      we value transparency and its growing role in the digital
equipment and ecosystems as a market leader we are in          society we want to be an attractive investment proposition
a good position to develop the entire industry our goal is      for our shareholders and a soughtafter partner for our
to increase our operational profitability and cash flow and to   stakeholders

fibrerope retrofit expands operational window
we introduced a fibrerope retrofit option with which a cranes original
steel wire rope can be replaced with a synthetic fibre rope it weighs
virtually nothing in water so a cranes lifting capacity is not limited by
water depth
     with a fibre rope smaller cranes and vessels can be used for more
assignments allowing owners to bid their vessels on a wider range of
contracts the retrofits modular design allows factory system testing and
rapid installation fibre rope can be spliced to replace damaged sections
or increase length it also does not require lubrication which eliminates a
pollution source

        ensure that the review is comparable with other companies and fulfils requests by external stakeholders our current
        sustainability reporting framework has been influenced by peer and competitor benchmarking as well as daytoday
        work that involves analysing investor and customer requests our sustainability reporting has also been influenced by
        requests arising from cargotecs commitment to the un global compact and other key international commitments and

        report matters that are both internal priorities and of interest to our stakeholders although no major requirements were
        received from external stakeholders regarding the reporting content we made some adjustments to further prioritise the
        material issues and ease comparisons in later reporting

          there is currently no industrial standard for evaluating the environmental impacts of any of the cargotec products or
          services the cargotec product range is wide which increases the difficulty in having one evaluation methodology or same
          parameters to evaluate all products or services therefore business areas have developed evaluation methodologies
          and related parameters for individual products andor services when required by customers regulation or other market
          development need we do not publish calculation methodologies or detailed information about the technical achievements
          due to business confidentiality

          kalmar
           electric powered fastcharge straddle and shuttle carriers launched in 2016 are completely free of exhaust emissions
            and also reduce noise emissions compared to conventional diesel technology see also kalmar sections page 29
           the lead battery of kalmar light electrical forkllifts can now be replaced with a liion battery thus reducing
            environmental burden
           kalmar announced in november 2016 that it will start cooperation with ssab in sweden to develop a hydrogen
            powered mediumrange forklift truck the aim is to find a more sustainable solution for our customer ssab and help
