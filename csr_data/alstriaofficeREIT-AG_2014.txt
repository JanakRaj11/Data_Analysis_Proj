       ladies and gentlemen
       dear stakeholders
       there is no onesizeﬁtsall approach to sustainability nor any magic
       formula that can improve the impact of any company on its stake
       holders improving our nonﬁnancial results is an ongoing process
       that only works if it is done naturally we will have succeeded when
       in a similar fashion to monsieur jourdain in the middle class gen
       tlemen by moliere we will live sustainably without even thinking
       about it
       although our reporting is still to be perfected our approach is starting
       to bear tangible results we have changed our energy procurement
       policy and are switching our entire contract into renewable energy
       and whenever we have the opportunity and the possibility changing
       our heating system into district heating whenever we need to work
       on lighting it becomes automatic to switch the systems to led and
       if we work on a roof the question of whether or not to implement
       solar panels also comes automatically

                            chief executive ofﬁcer ceo

as a result of this our scope 1 and 2 emissions have gone down
dramatically which earned alstria its ﬁrst cdp climate action award
as we hinted last year we have not been submitting data to the
global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb this year as
our concerns have not been yet taken into consideration however
we have made the gresb data available on our website for those
of you who need them
we hope you will enjoy reading this report as much as we have
enjoyed preparing it we are always happy to engage with you on
any corporate social responsibility csr  topic and look forward
to a constructive discussion
                              kind regards

       about this report
       h ow to r e a d t h is r ep o rt
       this is the ﬁfth sustainability report provided by alstria the sustain
       ability report provides its readers with the most valuable informa
       tion in the most efﬁcient way about our engagement in the ﬁeld
       of sustainability it aims to explain and illustrate our sustainability
       approach which is based on the threepillar concept furthermore
       we describe concrete measures within our sustainability framework
       and how we engaged in 2013 targets are therefore derived from
       these measures and monitored for more information please refer
       to  pages 12 to 19
       sustainability topics are also increasingly integrated in our annual
       report  part i and ii



       r e p o r t i n g                              p e r i o d
       alstria reports annually on sustainability within the company al
       though publication dates differ the sustainability reporting cycle is
       aligned with the ﬁnancial reporting cycle this report covers activities
       of the ﬁnancial year 2013 january 1 2013 to december 31 2013
       and should be read together with the annual report 2013  parts i
       and ii the annual report is available on alstrias website  http
       wwwalstriacomeninvestorsreportseventsﬁnancialreports
       date2013

       whenever possible we have provided 2012 and 2011 data the
       report has been written in accordance with the global reporting
       initiative gri 31 guidelines and the construction and real estate
       sector supplement cress as well as the european public real
       estate association epra best practices recommendations on sus
       tainability reporting

scope                   of            reporting
alstrias activities did not change over the reporting period and no
signiﬁcant changes are planned for the upcoming years the consoli
dated ﬁnancial statements of alstria ofﬁce reitag and its subsidiaries
together the alstria group have been prepared in accordance with
the international financial reporting standards ifrs of the inter
national accounting standards board iasb
unless otherwise stated economic and social data refer to the alstria
group

environmental data refer to assets directly held by the alstria group
excluding joint ventures in order to align with the international
framework of the greenhouse gas ghg protocol initiative we
follow the operational approach when it comes to data evaluation
this approach clearly identiﬁes emissions where we have direct con
trol over our own emissions and where emissions accrue due to the
companys activity scope 1 and scope 2 represent emissions which
are related to our operations and scope 3 represents all emissions
that occur in the value chain it also includes downstream activities
such as leased assets the information from tenants consumption
which is published under scope 3 depends on data that is provided
to us by our tenants in addition no adjustments for special circum
stances were made such as weather patterns or age of building
the calculation methods and the number and share of assets included
in the calculation are stated in the notes for each relevant indicator



likeforlike                              approach
not only do we report on the absolute consumption for each year
but we also want to compare data on an annual basis therefore we
use the likeforlike approach in our portfolio for better comparability
between the reported years the likeforlike approach disregards
assets which have been added or excluded from the portfolio during
the reporting frame period and solely focuses on the ones that have
contributed during the entire period we report on the likeforlike
changes with respect to the total consumption of our tenants for
electricity heating co2 emissions and water
it should however be noted that the likeforlike comparison only
applies to the absolute indicators whereas intensity indicators look
at the total portfolio at the date of reporting

       alstrias
       csr policy
       alstrias business model can be summarised as follows we invest the
       companys equity into real estate assets which we manage for the
       long term our business cycle is long by deﬁnition real estate time
       passes slowly it can take up to four or ﬁve years to plan and prop
       erly refurbish a property and lease it completely the building itself
       should be designed to ﬁt tenants needs for the next 20 to 30 years

       given the limited trading approach to our business sustainability
       comes as a natural feature within alstria any decision we make will
       inﬂuence the company for a long time and most of the decisions
       are deﬁnitive once a decision is executed there is no turning back
       no changes are possible or they are only marginal or very expensive
       as a commercial organisation our main goal is to yield the best
       riskadjusted return on the equity of the company over time

       our sustainability approach is based on the threepillar model any
       business decision will have an impact on each of the pillars we will
       achieve the greatest proﬁt over time by following the middle path
       which maximises the returns on each of the three pillars

       any decision that considers environmental and social aspects will economy
       enhance the economics of alstrias operations over the long run as it
       will minimise the risk on the value of our assets and in the best case
       scenario improve the value by increasing the underlying land value

       taking this into account allows us to reduce the speed of obsoles environment
       cence of our assets and increase the attractiveness of our ofﬁces
       to our tenants

       unlike other businesses our success is tied to the location in which social
       we invest and therefore we have a vested interest in the strong
       development of the local community

our aim is the further improvement of our data collection data
measurement and of course the sustainability reporting itself on
an ongoing basis we have however tried as much as possible to
underline the shortcuts which we have taken from time to time the
decision to get approximate data was in a limited number of cases
also driven by the threepillar approach here we felt that the cost
beneﬁt analysis was better as an estimation rather than providing
more precise ﬁgures

as a listed and customeroriented company alstria has manifold
relationships with stakeholders involved in our business our most
important stakeholders are our investors our tenants our employees
and the community in which we operate we believe that each of
these stakeholder groups has a vested interest in each of the three
sustainability ﬁelds

we always strive to work closely with stakeholders across a broad
front creating shareholder value working for the beneﬁt of our
tenants providing a healthy and secure working environment and
enhancing the quality of life in the communities surrounding the
assets in which we invest

                       with our ﬁrst sustainability report we set up a framework which
                       explains our approach towards csr our stakeholder engagement
                       and the impact of alstrias csr policy on our daily business the
                       framework provides a basis for continual improvement in the future
                       to achieve our goals and set new ones as we move forward

key achievements in 2013 the green lease project group was awarded the sustain
                 ability award 2013 by the immobilienmanager for its excellent and
                 interdisciplinary work on the green lease recommendations in
                 addition we began to change the energy supplier for our properties
                 to 100 green electricity which is produced without any emissions
                 in 2013 21 of our portfolio was supplied by it in the future we will
                 increase the number of green supplied properties with the aim of
                 switching all our electricity procurement to emissionfree electricity
                 furthermore the company continued to support its employees by
                 improving standards in administration and recruiting and setting up
                 new programmes and initivatives one such programme is a family
                 advice service which alstria has offered to its employees since the
                 beginning of 2013 another achievement concerning alstrias em
                 ployees is the successful implementation of a trainee programme as
                 from may 2013

        challenges even if we make progress data gathering was is and will be one of
                   our greatest challenges in the future as energy consumption and
                   ghg emissions within our portfolio are mainly produced by our ten
                   ants we therefore rely on their cooperation and share the responsi
                   bility to reduce energy consumption and ghg emissions

    future targets our goal is to identify room for improvement within our sustainability
                   framework take the right actions monitor the progress and continu
                   ally improve it is a matter of course that we report on our progress
                   which is stated on each stakeholder group under how we engage
                   instead of resting on our laurels we further develop our targets in line
                   with the existing ones and try to improve our sustainable engagement
                   and transparency in reporting by 2015 we aim to evaluate 100
                   of our assets monitor the data and derive measures

mundsburg
o f f i c e to w e r

the mundsburg ofﬁce tower was erected
between 1969 and 1971 and is situated
between the two hamburg districts
uhlenhorst and barmbek as a mixed
use building it houses ofﬁces residences
and a shopping centre with its height of
approximately 100 m the ofﬁce tower is one
of hamburgs tallest and bestknown ofﬁce
buildings in the city
after 40 years of existence without any
substantial refurbishment the building
was entirely redeveloped by alstria between
2010 and 2012

       lo c at i o n                   and            history
       the name mundsburg refers to an area in hamburg that is situated
       in the hamburg district barmbeksüd the three nearly 100mhigh
       tower buildings of the mundsburg are widely visible in the silhouette
       of hamburg they mark the entrance to barmbek the ensemble is
       listed as one of hamburgs historic monuments

       the name of the area is dated to the former owner and wine mer
       chant johann heinrich mund in 1721 he bought the farmyard
       immenhöfe on the left side of the river alster and built his main
       farm building the homestead was named after him mundsburg
       and was used as a farm with some livestock during the industri
       alisation of the 19th century the area evolved rapidly and at the
       beginning of the 20th century the city expanded and it developed
       into a heavily builtup city district

       the historical buildings along the hamburger straße with around
       300 shops and restaurants were completely destroyed during world
       war ii in the 1950s the idea arose to combine all properties along
       the street into one big development with a shopping mall and
       ofﬁceresidential towers the shopping mall opened in 1970 and
       still operates under the name hamburger meile the mundsburg
       is the head building of this development and the ﬁrst building block
       in this district coming from the city centre

       with ofﬁce residential shopping and sport activities under one roof
       the mundsburg represents the life style model of the 1970s in the
       late 90s the base building was modiﬁed and after an additional
       multiplex cinema was added the links connections were destroyed
       today the mundsburg consists of approximately 12500 sqm shop
       ping mall the residential tower with 165 apartments the ofﬁce
       tower and 300 car parking spaces

                 the location and infrastructure of the mundsburg within the city of
                 hamburg is ideal close by is a metro station bicycle speed lanes
                 two parking houses and with the local suppliers in the mall and the
                 other utilities this historical site can be rated as a very attractive
                 urban district

                 after completion of the mundsburg ofﬁce tower in mid 2013 alstria
                 began redeveloping the base structure of the mundsburg center in
                 2015 this redevelopment will be ﬁnished and the whole of munds
                 burg will be restored to its former glory

       r e d e v e l o p m e n t
       the redevelopment of the building was necessary given that after
       40 years of use the ofﬁce areas did not meet todays demands for
       a modern and economic working space the energy efﬁciency and
       sustainability of the building were especially suboptimal

       the main aim was to create ﬂexible ofﬁce spaces with stateofthe
       art building services the interior space was completely redesigned
       and the ofﬁce structure optimised with a much improved comfort
       level although more work stations could still be implemented

       to enhance the overall energy efﬁciency of the building the façade
       needed to be completely rebuilt and improved for the winter and
       summer periods it was essential that the character of the façade was
       not changed as the tower is listed as a monument building after the
       development the mundsburg ofﬁce tower is again fully integrated
       into its surroundings and embodies a major point of reference within
       the cityscape of hamburg

       an essential element of the technical modernisation was the complete
       replacement of all building services all components were in a very
       poor condition and therefore very inefﬁcient due to an upgraded
       façade the new building services are very efﬁcient and energysaving
       the ofﬁce users have a much higher comfort level with these systems
       the existing foyer needed a redesign as it was very small and
       nonrepresentative now the lobby is generous bright inviting and
       suitable for wheelchair use

        replacement of existing façade with a new metal curtain wall with in detail
         triple glazing and integrated sunshades the remaining parapet
         was thermally insulated

        redesign of the interior with raised ﬂoors lightweight partition
         walls new doors and heatingcooling ceilings for maximum ﬂe
         xibility

        refurbishment of all sanitary installations and ﬁxtures
        new heating mechanical ventilation with heat recovery instru
         mentation and control electric services and lighting

        redesign of the entry foyer

conclusions and achievements
since the beginning of 2013 the building has been occupied and
for the ﬁrst time after the redevelopment the energy consumption
is metered in 2013 more than half of the building was let which is
nearly the same situation as before the redevelopment therefore
the consumption from 20082009 can be easily compared with the
consumption from the year 2013

it was important to verify if the theoretical design calculation was
met in practice

       what impact does green certiﬁcation have
       the mundsburg ofﬁce tower was one of the ﬁrst assets in germany
       to achieve a dgnb silver certiﬁcation for refurbishment of existing
       building however the performance described herein was not the
       result of the certiﬁcation process the green building process did not
       per se add anything to the building efﬁciency and its performance
       as it had little impact on the technical planning of the asset neither
       it did materially impact the leasing prospect of the asset as the
       prelet of the building was achieved precertiﬁcation as such this
       ﬁrst experience that alstria had with green building tends to sustain
       our initial feeling that green certiﬁcation in germany is much more
       about communication and marketing than it is about improving the
       environmental footprint

                     after the modernisation the electricity consumption in the common
                     areas was reduced by more than half this positive outcome is due to

                     the redevelopment of the mundsburg ofﬁce tower not only helps
                     to reduce large amounts of carbon dioxide emission every year but
                     it also offers stateoftheart ofﬁces for nearly the same gross rent
                     as prior to the refurbishment
                     beforehand a typical tenant was paying around 7 to 8  per sqm for
                     additional service charges including heatingcooling and common
                     areas electricity thanks to the replacement of the façade and building
                     services these additional charges could be reduced to just 3 sqm
                     even though the energy prices grew substantially in the last couple

                     increased only marginally from about 18 sqm to approx 19 sqm
                      it appears that a substantial redevelopment like the mundsburg
                     ofﬁce tower doesnt necessarily lead to additional costs for the

       ffo approximately eur 45 m were in line with the forecast for
       the reporting period our revenues grew by 29 and our ffo per
       share improved by 40 based on our very consistent strategy we
       have been able to annually increase our ffo per share by on average
       82 since 2010 despite the letting market environment being ﬂat

       in 2013 we reﬁnanced more than twothirds of our debt in early financial

       investment decisions at alstria are based on the analyses of the acquisitions
       local markets and on the adequacy of a building within its local
       environment in terms of location size and quality alstrias strategy
       is to enter new markets and build critical mass through longterm
       secured assets in light of this approach in 2013 alstria added two
       properties and approximately 16900 sqm of lettable space to the
       portfolio helping to reinforce its position in two of its core markets
       namely stuttgart and düsseldorf

       leasing activity was very successful in 2013 alstria signed new leasing activities
       leases totalling approximately 35600 sqm and prolonged lease
       agreements of around 49000 sqm this resulted in a decrease of

       in addition over 60  of lettable area of the lease agreements
       which were due to expire in 2013 could be retained during the year
       with the successful leaseup of 7700 sqm of ofﬁce and additional
       space at hansböcklerstraße 36 alstria signed one of the largest
       new leasing contracts in düsseldorf in the reporting year
       in terms of letting achievements another climax was the signing of
       an agreement with a new tenant for the property ernsthaldenstraße
       17 stuttgart for which a ﬁveyear contract comprising around
       2500 sqm of ofﬁce and ancillary space has been signed

       alstrias operations have a ﬁnancial impact on several stakeholders
       such as tenants employees shareholders and banks

       the company redistributes most of its ﬁnancial resources to its
       shareholders to its lenders to the government to its service provid
       ers and the wider community and to its employees as a reit real
       estate investment trust alstria barely keeps any of the proceeds
       generated for itself by doing so alstria remunerates the capital it
       employs both debt and equity participates in government ﬁnance
       through taxes and stimulates the underlying economy by spending
       on its assets and paying wages and salaries

alstria had a good start at the beginning of 2014 having reﬁnanced
twothirds of our longterm debt on favorable terms in 2013 we
continued our efforts in the ﬁrst quarter of 2014 with the reﬁnancing
of two further loans to the amount of eur 121 m replacing our
maturing debt in 2014 and 2015 the new credit agreements have an
average term of 85 years and secure the attractive current ﬁnanc
ing conditions on a longterm basis with our recent reﬁnancings
in place the average debt maturity increases to approximately six
years we now have no substantial ﬁnancing needs until mid2018

moreover a special success in the ﬁrst quarter of 2014 was the
agreement of a longterm lease in our bamler service park in essen
where we were able to relet 8900 sqm of ofﬁce space directly
replacing an upcoming lease expiry in 2015

       managing
       our portfolio
       sustainably
       managing the portfolio in a sustainable manner implies properly
       measuring our impact and acting in order to limit it during the year
       we have concentrated on further integrating sustainability in our
       real estate operations teams and especially into our development
       projects the awareness and importance of sustainability at alstria
       is thus increased the focus is on combining modern techniques and
       energy efﬁciency with the requirements of our tenants

       in order to better understand the companys impact on its environ
       ment we started to buildup a meaningful environmental reporting
       system in 2010 the collection of data is a largescale complex
       process as we depend on the reliance of our tenants consumption
       data in close collaboration with our tenants we have been able to
       reach a stable level of coverage of our reporting base

       a stringent reporting base allows us to use the data for our envi
       ronmental balance sheet as well as to derive measures from data
       evaluation by identifying the priority targets data evaluation helps
       us to steer the companys investments into ﬁelds that are linked to
       sustainability

               we have measured the consumption and emission data of our

               changes in consumption might result from a change of the tenants
               usage improvements in the granularity of the data collection a

       portfolio emissions and resource
       consumption from tenant areas
       the following description of consumption data reﬂects the perfor
       mance of the tenant areas of our portfolio in 2013

       we were able to measure the energy data from longdistance heating
       heating oil and gas of around 90 of the total lettable area of
       894400 sqm in 2013 2012 90 2011 69 regarding the abso
       lute performance measures total energy consumption from heating
       and cooling in 2013 our tenants consumed almost 860 mwh more
       than in 2012 an increase of approximately 56 kwhsqm in 2013
       although the lettable area of the accounted assets was slightly lower
       than 2012 approximately  34 we assume that the increase is
       caused by the very long heating period at the beginning of 2013
       nevertheless the likeforlike approach shows the opposite as the
       total energy consumption for district heating and cooling decreased
       by almost 900 mwh

                   proach shows that water withdrawal increased by approximately
                   44500 cbm or 70 lsqm in 2013 on the same property basis in the
                   reporting years
                   the greenprint performance reporttm shows for ofﬁce buildings a
                   water intensity of 05 cqmsqm which is 48 higher than the water
                   intensity of alstrias portfolio

                       some of our tenants stated that the increase in water consumption
                       resulted from work on renovation maintenance and breakdown

  produces waste is generated which affects the environment depending on the type
but saves material of waste and its treatment we report about the waste of our de
                   velopment projects on a regular basis however a comparison of
                   data is not possible because of the different designs of buildings
                   and thus different types of waste in addition our development
                   projects are at different stages so that even a comparison between
                   two reporting periods of one project is not possible the disposal of
                   construction waste is performed only by local waste management
                   companies as well as licenced companies for hazardous waste to
                   our knowledge the waste is properly disposed of in germany and
                   not abroad in 2013 construction waste was generated during the

       alstrias carbon footprint totalled 2477 tco2e in 2013 2012
       2485 tco2e 2011 1142 tco2 our own consumption is described
       in detail in the section emissions and resource consumption from
       alstrias operations electricity and heating consumption were not
       the only sources of emissions from our operations we also cause
       co2 emissions during our business travel and employee commuting
       in 2013 we took 516 business trips by plane 2012 391 2011 606
       which represent a cumulative distance of approximately 362347 km
       2012 511075 km 2011 718300 km

to state the results of 2013 the decrease of the ghg emissions by
21 tco2e of our company vehicles can be explained using a differ
ent calculation method in 2012 we summed up the total usage
including private rides of our company cars and analysed the total
generated ghg emissions whereas in 2013 we only analysed the
emissions generated by business usage of our company vehicles

we try as much as we can to reduce our carbon footprint this can
be illustrated by the commuting allowance we have offered our
employees since 2009 by which we subsidise a local public transport
ticket to encourage the use of this environmentallyfriendly means
of commuter transportation rather than cars about half of alstrias
employees made use of the companys subsidy in 2012 and 2013
in 2013 an employee of alstria initiated the acquisition of an electric
company car this ecofriendly car generates no emissions on the
road

another milestone for the reduction of ghg emissions was the
change to green electricity for the controlled common areas with
100 emissionfree electricity alstria saved 688 tco2e in 2013
which corresponds to a reduction of 42 compared to 2012 for
2014 the saving will be even higher as more assets will switch to
green electricity



leading                        by           ex a mple
alstria occupies ofﬁce space for its own operations as a company
working in one of our assets we want to lead by example and have
therefore implemented a number of measures that we recommend
to our tenants today we have rainwater harvesting grey water
usage which recycles the rainwater into the undrinkable water
distribution system thus reducing the amount of water needed to
operate the building

                 opened in mid2012

                 however the data also shows that even though alstria opened a
                 new ofﬁce not every type of consumption increased alstrias em
                 ployees already try to behave more sustainably this can be seen
                 for example by the heating energy that decreased 12 kwh per sqm
                 and the resulting energy intensity per sqm which dropped 4 kwh in
                 2013 our aim for 2015 is to also reduce the remaining consumption
                 of electricity water and waste

       ing regulation and sustainability discussions we have broadened
       our engagement with national and international initiatives to take
       part in different working groups in the real estate sector one im
       portant reason for this contribution is our vision of increasing trans
       parency in the real estate sector this engagement provides us with
       the opportunity to meet all regulatory requirements to react at an
       early stage to new trends and even to set new trends

       among others we are a member of the german sustainable building
       council dgnb epra european public real estate association zia
       zentraler immobilienausschuss dirk deutscher investor relations
       verband e v and the real estate share initiative for an explanation

       structure or cash ﬂow management can be answered and analysed
       interdisciplinary by the ebsremi

       we have also designed and initiated along with ipd the german
       ofﬁce rent reversion index dmx which has been published
       every year since 2007 and shows the reversion potential of the main
       german ofﬁce markets market participants are able to compare
       their rents operating costs or expenses with the current develop
       ment on the german market this can help companies and inves
       tors to make bettereducated investment decisions and provide the
       market with a new key indicator the complete dmx results are
       available from ipd free of charge at  wwwipdcomgermany or

in our daytoday asset management we embrace the support and
maintenance of historical buildings it is our responsibility to preserve
places of cultural interest with our refurbishment projects we give
new life to these places while keeping the original essence intact

in 2013 we refurbished the most striking building in hamburgs
kaiserwilhelmstraße the holstenhof the art nouveau kontorhaus
was designed by albert lindhorst in 190001 its design exagger
ates the epochal trend with its dissolution of the lower façade into
glass surfaces

to protect its historical look and the cultural value the entire holsten
hof was extensively revitalised while saving the historic façade to
make this development project possible alstria had a close working
relationship with hamburgs ministry of culture and the ofﬁce for
the protection of historic buildings during the whole refurbishment
period

       lieve in the positive impact of a professional and strategic human re people
       sources management as we reported last year the focus in january
       2012 of the newly established hr department was professionalising
       the hr administration building an efﬁcient and strengthsbased
       recruiting process and strengthening the management structures
       within our company

       in 2013 we continued on this path alstria launched a trainee
       programme to support longterm succession planning within the
       company and to increase internal interdisciplinary cooperation
       commencing may 2013 we frequently hire young professionals
       to complete a twoyear trainee programme especially designed to
       educate about our real estate business and the corporate culture
       throughout this process we also further optimised recruiting meth
       ods we established socalled assessment days especially for young
       professionals with the aim of getting to know the candidate in the
       best possible way as well as for the candidate to learn about alstrias
       culture and people recruiting people goes hand in hand with high
       responsibility  we take recruitment seriously

diversity it is a principle of alstria to create the same working environments
          for all employees including the selection hiring and training of
          employees as well as working conditions and the termination of an
          employment relationship

            the management board pays attention to diversity in ﬁlling its
            management positions and aims to consciously consider women
            for these positions as at december 31 2013 44 of the manage
            ment positions at alstria were held by female employees 2012 44
            2011 50 as in 2012 75 of these female positions were ﬁlled

we also strive to reduce the risk of absenteeism the number of
absent days per employee was 79 in 2013 and 97 in 2012 which
equates to an absentee rate of 33 in 2013 female 40 male
22 and in 2012 38 female 47 male 23 i e 33 
of alstrias total workforce during the year 2013 could not operate
due to illness lost days are scheduled work days and counted from
the ﬁrst day of absenteeism

on average german employees were absent 19 days due to
illness in 2013 in comparison alstria was able to undercut this rate
by around eleven days among the actions taken by alstria to limit
the risk of sick days the company offers its employees a free vac
cine against inﬂuenza in 2013 and 2012 around 25 of alstrias
employees made use of this opportunity each year

as an employer it is in our responsibility to offer adequate job posi

work in such cases we have long prelimenary conversations with
the affected employee and offer individual solutions
