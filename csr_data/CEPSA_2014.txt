classification

of products

the united nations globally
harmonised system ghs has the
aim of standardising all information
relating to the danger posed by certain
chemicals by means of regulation
12722008 on classification labelling
and packaging clp the ghs defines a
framework to classify label and package
these chemicals which has favoured
the internationalisation of our products
thanks to our strict adherence to
this regulation

although this regulation only applies
to chemical substances as from 2015
it will also cover mixtures which is
why cepsa has taken a step ahead

its stakeholders opinions with a view
not only to maximising the positive
impacts but also to minimising the
possible adverse effects of the activities
it carries out the company has tools
for dialogue as well as policies and
procedures for identifying preventing
and minimising possible impacts on
the environment

in this regard environmental and
social impact studies are fundamental
items in these processes in the
area of exploration and production
before embarking on a project the
company identifies the stakeholder
groups involved and carries out initial
diagnostics to define sensitive areas
in the social legal and environmental
contexts similarly the needs of the
communities living near the facilities are
identified and assessed and steps are
taken to ensure the participation of all
groups concerned

as regards the industrial activity the
facilities are in areas close to urban
settlements so the company maintains
close relations with its neighbours and
has wellestablished and appropriate
channels of communication among
which we would highlight
