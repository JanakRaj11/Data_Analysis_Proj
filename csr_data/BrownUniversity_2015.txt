i executive summary

   this past year has proven to be a dynamic and accomplished year for the sustainability office the office
   has continued to work with the sustainability strategic planning and advisory committee sspac to
   advance metrics collection tracking and standardization in order to facilitate future development of
   sustainability goals across operational areas including dining transportation energy water and waste
   diversion

   while greenhouse gas ghg emission reduction through energy efficiency programs continues to
   be our flagship sustainability program there have been challenges in the past year we had the coldest
   winter on record resulting in increased heating energy demand although conservation efforts allowed
   brown to actually decrease its energy use from the previous fiscal year by 2 the cold winter played a
   significant role in this increase primarily because the new england electricity grid utilized more carbon
   intensive fuels due to a shortage of natural gas pipeline infrastructure in the region thereby increasing
   the co2 emissions per kilowatthour by 13 that said our ghg emissions increased from the previous
   year by more than 3200 metric tons leaving us at 22 below 2007 levels as compared to our interim
   target of 28 however we are progressing towards reaching our goal of a 42 reduction in ghg
   emissions by 2020 from our 2007 baseline as indicated by our ability to grow while still reducing overall
   energy consumption  while new england electricity grid continues to invest in cleaner and renewable
   energy sources and brown continues to invest in energy efficiency

   since inception of our ghg reduction plan we have added new systems and equipment whose energy
   consumption is equivalent is 6400 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents mtcde 9 of our 2007
   baseline emissions these systems and equipment will continue to grow as the campus meets its
   research teaching and quality of life missions since 2008 we have already invested approximately 24
   million for a net investment of 20 million after accounting for 4 million in energy efficiency incentives
   this has reduced our carbon footprint by almost 14500 mtcde which is on track to meet our original
   energy efficiency plan although opportunities for reductions continue to become harder to find we
   continue to invest in innovative technologies and systems to help achieve our 42 goal

   beyond energy use we have begun to gather baseline data this year particularly in waste diversion water
   conservation and management and food systems that will lend to setting specific institutional goals in
   the near future lastly we have reorganized our office to better support a more comprehensive campus
   wide sustainability plan and better serve student and academic programs that engage the campus as a
   living lab our staff includes two energy engineers a student engagement coordinator and a sustainability
   manager dedicated to supporting and implementing the sspac recommendations brown university
   continues to expand and evolve its sustainability efforts building on past success and integrating its goals
   within a growing network of trained and engaged members of the brown community for example over
   the past year the office of sustainable energy and environmental initiatives ee has partnered with
   the providence community and various brown departments to spearhead two highly sucessful compost
   pilots in preparation for a campuswide compost program also commencement 2015 was the first to
   feature a plastic water bottle free event that successfully hydrated over 10000 participants

   the ee office is proud to share this report with our partners and friends throughout the brown
   university community and our peer institutions

iv facilities management

  the department of facilities management is responsible for ensuring that the planning design construction
  operation and maintenance of all university facilities and grounds support the academic research and
  administrative functions of the university while balancing financial and technical constraints with aesthetic
  and historical concerns in providence the university owns and maintains 241 buildings totaling approximately
  6900000 gross square feet the mission of facilities management is to support the university by enhancing
  the quality of physical facilities facilities does this through planning designing engineering constructing and
  maintaining in a responsive serviceoriented effective and environmentallyconscious manner

    ii energy efficiency program
       the energy efficiency investments in existing buildings are being achieved by
       1 steam system condensate over 1400 steam traps throughout campus buildings were replaced along
       with other improvements to increase the efficiency of the overall heating systems and improve system
       performance
       2 lighting and lighting controls a total of 93 buildings were upgraded between 2009 and 2014 with
       implementation costs of approximately 3 million and an estimated annual savings of 609000 for an
       average payback of 5 years and an internal rate of return of 20 percent we are currently beginning a new
       lighting initiative to convert campus lighting systems to led systems with advanced controls
       3 retrocommissioning rcx for existing buildings this program evaluates facilities both from an
       operational and system design perspective identifying efficiency opportunities through improving how
       existing systems are operated andor through replacement of existing systems or equipment a majority of
       our buildings have completed this phase
       4 brown ongoing commissioning bocx as part of its ongoing and continuous building commissioning
       program brown deployed skyspark software to test its ability to identify wasteful andor unknown
       energy practices during normal building operation the software downloads data from browns existing
       controls systems and uses the data to determine if buildings are using energy effectively in addition we
       created a process to engage operations staff to minimize repeat sparks we have completed implementing
       this process on over 20 of our largest energy consuming buildings and are now working to expand as many
       as an additional 50 buildings
       5 heat recovery systems developed and implemented our first heat recovery chiller system at macmillan
       hall a heat recovery system takes the waste heat from an air conditioning system and recycles it for use in
       heating this system is ideal when we have a simultaneous need for heating and cooling as is the case in all
       of our lab facilities where we need dehumidification we were able to eliminate two hotwater boilers from
       macmillan hall reducing our carbon footprint and energy use

  b waste  diversion
     in fy 2015 considerable progress has been made toward understanding brown universitys waste stream
     a major step in planning for programs that will significantly increase our waste diversion brown undertook
     several waste audits and pilots this year including a dining waste audit removal of deskside waste bins pilot
     campuswide bin and signage assessment and compost pilots these initiatives allowed the university to
     identify gaps and potential options to increase overall campus waste diversion going into fy 2016
     the diversion rate for fy 2015 was 232 percent of total waste not including construction and demolition
     current diversion rates include a variety of methods such as recycling donations composting and reuse
     brown will continue to work toward improving recycling rates by focusing efforts on bin standardization and
     communications however significant attention will be given to diverting organic waste due to the substantial
     impact it has on the universitys waste stream as well as new rhode island state law requiring organics
     diversion
     based on the dining audit with the implementation of organics diversion at the six main eateries on campus
     overall campus waste diversion is expected to increase at least 10 percent it is also expected as the pilots
     revealed with increased communication concerning organics diversion recycling rates will increase as diners
     become more educated on proper waste disposal
     recycling browns recycling rate is a reflection of total tonnage of recyclables through our waste hauling
     service ie cardboard paper bottles cans in fy 2015 brown university recycled paper containers and

    i unused food resources
       a composting
         composting is the process of transforming organic materials such as food waste into a nutrientrich
         natural fertilizer composting has many benefits including enriched soils reduced contributions to
         landfills and decreased release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as such composting is an
         essential part of browns commitment to sustainability
         students have shown themselves to be open to composting in spring 2015 brown recovered over
         23 tons of organic waste in two 1017 week composting pilot programs the diverted organic
         material was hauled by a local vendor to a local facility about 33 miles away from campus
         brown is a leader among rhode island institutions in its commitment to comply with the states
         2014 compost law ideally the compost law will eventually make composting less expensive and
         more convenient for brown the university will begin to plan for its campuswide composting
         program in fy 2015 and expects to rollout the program in late 2016 or early 2017 it is facilities
         managements goal to make this transition easy and accessible for all of browns staff faculty and
         students in the future all brown dining facilities offices and residential halls will divert organic
         materials
         the environmental impact of a campuswide composting program will be highly significant
         through composting at just the six main eateries and catering brown could reduce its annual
         landfillbound waste by 155 percent this translates into about 420 tons of organic material that will
         become a useful local resource




                         based on these numbers in one year 88366 lbs of organic
                        material from andrews dining could be composted resulting in
                            an overall andrews dining hall diversion rate of 62


                                                                                                                   10

  a brown nitrogen footprint
    brown university was selected as one of 10 institutions to test the first institutional nitrogen footprint
    tool this entailed gathering organizing and analyzing a wide range of data across many sectors of the
    university once the baseline nitrogen footprint was calculated scenarios for pollution reduction can
    be tested within the tool this can help project the likely impact of sustainability initiatives browns
    nitrogen footprint project is spearheaded by a team of faculty scientists undergraduate researchers and
    sustainability staff from across campus
    a nitrogen footprint is the contribution of the university to nitrogen pollution through its activities
    like carbon nitrogen is released into the environment through fossil fuel energy consumption for
    utilities and transportation additional activities that are big contributors to nitrogen release are also
    food production consumption and waste management the calculation of a nitrogen footprint gives an
    indication of how much reactive nitrogen different activities contribute using the nitrogen footprint tool
    will help institutions reduce losses of nitrogen to the environment as a result of their activities and use of
    resources

    what have we learned so far
    on the whole activities on campus contribute
    to the release of 126000 kilograms of nitrogen
    per year to the environment as expected food
    production is the biggest contributor to the
    universitys nitrogen footprint 78 of the total
    production of meat dairy and eggs are the biggest
    contributor to the universitys nitrogen footprint
    other contributors to the overall nitrogen footprint
    includes the use of fossil fuels for utilities and
    transportation 9 total use of research animals
    8 food consumption 4 and the use of
    fertilizer on campus 1 the amount of nitrogen
    released from utilities was surprisingly small
    reflecting the reliance in new england on natural gas

    what are the next steps
    in the coming year browns nitrogen footprint team will be            preliminary scenario tests for
    refining our calculation to best represent the universitys                reducing n footprint
    activities and understand how the nitrogen footprint has
    changed in the last several years we will also be exploring               composting food waste
    ways in which changes to our nitrogen footprint can support                 45 reduction of total
    existing sustainability initiatives or help identify new             replacing 25 of beef with chicken
    opportunities for example we will be investigating how                   3 reduction of total
    much composting food waste increasing food donations
                                                                                   more local food
    and increasing poultry and vegetarian protein options might

                             155000 gallons per school year studies also suggest that eliminating trays may
                             reduce food waste because people take fewer items without them


     beyond the bottle btb is an initiative started
     by students with the goal of reducing the
     supply and demand of bottled water at brown
     as a result bds has reduced its water bottle
     purchasing by 95 since 2008 this goal is
