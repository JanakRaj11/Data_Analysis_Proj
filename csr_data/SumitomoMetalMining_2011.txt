    ahead along with the companys goals

                                                                              a2       progress has been good of our three core businesses


    q1 what
                                                                                       mineral resources and smelting and refining businesses
             issues do you believe the
                                                                              have been particularly strong due to rising metal prices on the
       world faces                                                           other hand in the materials business where we supply the market

    a1        there are three typesfinancial risk in advanced
              nations inflation risk in emerging nations and global
    environmental and energy risks i think we can attribute these
                                                                              with items like cathode materials for secondary batteries installed
                                                                              in electric vehicles a number of factors have meant demand has

    risks to the persistent following of existing formulas for growth         that contributes to improvements in energy efficiency and we will
    despite recognition of the earths finite nature at this rate it will   continue to focus on it
    not be long before limits are reached                                       in developing core businesses we place utmost importance on
        smm has engaged in mineral resources and smelting and                gaining the trust of people living and working in communities
    refining businesses inside the pacific rim with copper nickel and       where our plants and other facilities are located and showing
    gold being our three main areas but if we are to help resolve            consideration toward the surrounding environment in emerging
    societys problems i think we have to free ourselves of                  nations laws and operational aspects can be quite different but
    conventional frameworks restricting us to certain types of minerals       we work to build up trust through close communication based on
    or geographical regions and operate across a broader field for          good faith at coral bay nickel corporation cbnc there is new
    example we could use our technology to develop items whose               potential for turning iron in residue into a resource we will
    costs are disproportionate to the benefit or their development            continue working on this as it would contribute to waste reduction
    technically difficult or even items we have not previously               and effective use of resources
    acknowledged as resources we need to make efforts to achieve
    effective use of the limited resources available

        it is three years since smm
 q    3 commenced     csr activities how                              q5 where  did your ideas about csr
                                                                          originate
        well have they taken hold inside
        the company

  a3       the response is promising except so far the focus has
           been on heads of divisions and facility representatives
                                                                        a5         to become a major company in the nonferrous metals

 leading by example now we need all employees to embrace              in japan may not apply i realized we had a responsibility to learn
 activities take safety for example it is employees working at the   what society needs and to learn about internationallyobserved
 front line of operations who are more likely to get caught up in an   standards
 accident while managers and supervisors are more aware and              when i first started thinking about csr i found myself recalling
 safety assurance systems have been improved that awareness has       the 1995 sarin gas attack on tokyos subway system i had been
 yet to spread to everyone but if we did try to get everyone on       shocked to hear that among the perpetrators were budding
 board all at once a sense of having been forced might prevail     scientistspeople like me i saw the attack as the reckless actions
 rather than companywide education what we will do is have           of scientists who had devoted themselves to nothing but research
 supervisors try to get through to individual employees primarily     in their chosen fields what they lacked was ethics and an
 through education in small groups                                    objective view of the impact their actions would have on society
                                                                       as a whole

       i maintain machinery and equipment in raw                                          until march 2011 i was head of the road safety
       material sintering processes im now involved in                                  committee at shinko this involved participation in
       training younger employees so im really trying to                                 road safety campaigns run by nagano prefecture
       be a good example to achieve that i think its                                   and roadside campaigns along national highways
       important in addition to having maintenance                                       during the same period as well as informing
       skills to be an upstanding member of society         koichi osaki                employees about road accidents occurring in the               hidemasa
       especially when i caution employees in my              maintenance                vicinity and inviting road safety officers from the ina      nakamura
       charge i cant forget my responsibilities and have    engineering sect          police to give road safety lectures when reporting           corporate
       begun to take better note of my own words and          harima smelter              on actual accidents i urged employees to drive safely        planning dept
       conduct                                                                           by adding cautions they could take to prevent similar         shinko co ltd
          the first two pieces of advice i give new                                       accidents happening to them
       employees aregreet people properly and stick to decisions made                      even if accidents are similar i think the information should be repeated as
       employees will not be able to ensure front line safety if they cannot              it leads to greater awareness when driving and helps to develop personnel
       manage these two things so i drill it into them seeing younger                   who are going to follow rules and avoid accidents in fy2010 one road
       employees getting involved in the community outside work in activities             accident caused by other parties occurred while there were no accidents
       like cleanup campaigns and festivals i feel hr development activities            caused by shinko parties no accidents occurred during the winter period
       are contributing indirectly to society through them i want to continue            when they are more likely to occur i get the feeling committee activities
       leading by example to help create a closeknit workplace where                     have contributed to an improvement in awareness about safe driving i
       colleagues at any level can talk and consult openly with one another              want to continue to help maintain zero accidents and serve as a model for
                                                                                          younger employees by being a careful driver with respect for human life

    mr okazaki i feel you have an issue in the fact that many                                       is direct complicity which is when a company knowingly assists in
    consumers believe environmental and safety problems faced by                                      a violation of human rights the second is beneficial complicity
    resources companies are concerns for the companies and nothing                                    an example of this might be tacit approval of force used by police
    to do with them in the case of overseas projects you will need to                               to suppress a strike at a plant resulting in people getting injured
    ensure transparency of money flows and clarify how profits will be                                this would include human rights violations along the supply chain
    channeled back into local communities                                                            for instance purchasing items made very cheaply the third is

    what to do with the knowledge
    gained in the alaskan wilderness
    the pogo gold mine is the first overseas mine that the smm group has been involved in from the exploration stage
    based on the knowledge and skill accumulated we are now working towards further development in alaska by
    accommodating strict alaskan environmental regulations using the most advanced mining and processing
    techniques to maximize resources building excellent relationships with the local community and educating our
    employees




                                                                            other water management measures include a system that has

    smm had created an international consortium for joint exploration      proven environmental performance is a priority for both sumitomo
    the discovery of gold deposit was made after other companies            and the pogo mine
    had withdrawn from the consortium now smm is the principle               in addition we submit reports on environmental considerations
    partner in the mine operations with a majority stake of 85 of the      to local agencies every quarter and these are made available to
    interests this is the first time that smm has an operatorship and      the public we also hold annual meetings and share information
    holds responsibility for operations at an overseas mine unlike our     with governmental bodies and citizen groups in the future we

    a defining characteristic of the pogo mine is as a environmentally     initial recovery at the pogo mine was not as high as expected
    friendly mine with comprehensive environmental measures in               as toshihito toyoshima a senior metallurgist recalls at that
    addition to accommodating stringent united states and alaskan           point we decided to change the reagents and those addition
    environmental regulations we are keeping the environmental             schemes we use in the mineral processing the process of
    impact of our operations to a minimum through regular monitoring       extracting valuable metals from the mined ore and thereby
       the most important element of this is our water management           attempt to increase the gold recovery the questions were then
    system since toxic cyanide is used to recover the gold we employ      what reagents to use and what conditions would be most
    a system to ensure that no cyanide can be leaked from the process      effective we gathered and analyzed information based on past

this as part of pogos social responsibility as norifumi ushirone
president of sumitomo metal mining pogo llc points out in
mining we can never operate in isolation from the location where
the resources are for this reason cooperation with the local
community is vitally important
   before smm became the operator of pogo mine there was
very little contact between the local community and pogo and
stories about pogo rarely appeared in the local media at that
point smm became the operator whereupon ushirone actively
