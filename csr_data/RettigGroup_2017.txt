    review




    2016
                            was a year of high activity the biggest         last years taking of a 10 per cent holding in eq plc and
                            and hardest decision of 2016 by far        the earlier acquisition of the italian company emmeti now
                            was the divestment of bore ltd              part of rettig icc serve as excellent examples of steps in
    the bore steamship company was founded 120 years ago in              that direction
    march 1897 at a time when steam power was being increas                we are humbly aware of the fact that history is no reliable
    ingly used at sea enabling bigger and stronger ships its first     indicator of future growth nevertheless we believe that the
    ship ss bore built for yearround traffic between turku and       longterm perspective and experience that our history brings
    stockholm was delivered in 1898 my greatgreatgrandfather         to the decisions that we make today and that will define our
    fredrik von rettig was one of the founding members of bore          future are a great asset and a tremendous benefit that set
    my grandfather dr hans von rettig acquired the company               rettig group apart from other investment companies with
    in 1926 and bore had remained an important part of rettig           a longterm view
    ever since                                                              as we continue to build our history change is also in
         the sale of bore in 2016 was a major important decision       volved i would like to thank our employees for their continued
    it offered an interesting next step in the development of bore      support and commitment to our business during this period
    which became part of a larger shipping company that also has         of change
    long traditions in shipping                                             i also want to thank the customers of our portfolio compa
         the divestment also gave rettig group improved flexibility      nies and all our business partners for their continued support
    to develop its business model                                       and trust in our business as we continue the work towards our
         our 200 years of business history have been shaped by           unchanged mission  value for generations
    numerous acquisitions and divestments i very much expect
    that part of our business activities to continue over the years
    to come we will actively be looking at two kinds of investment
    opportunities those that support our core investments and
    those that support our risk diversification strategy ie that of
    diversifying into entirely new businesses where rettig group
    can add value as a longterm owner
