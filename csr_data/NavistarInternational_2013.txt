    delivering improvements
    in emissions and energy use
    navistars long history of product innovation includes pioneering steps in emissions
    reduction since the advent of federal regulation by the us environmental protection
    agency epa emissions of nitrogen oxides nox from diesel engines have been reduced by
    more than 90 percent emissions of particulate matter pm have been cut by 99 percent and
    emissions of carbon monoxide co and hydrocarbons hc have been reduced to nearzero                community coffee was one of the first customers
    levels navistar has been in the forefront of these reductions                                       to take possession of the international prostar
                                                                                                          with the cummins isx engine with selective
    we were the first north american engine manufacturer to release a smokeless diesel engine            catalytic reduction scr
    and worked with the epa to advocate reducing the sulfur content of diesel fuel to 15 ppm
    in order to cut emissions of nox and pm navistar then became the first truck and engine
    manufacturer certified by the epa as meeting 2007 standards for pm and hcsix years
    ahead of requirements

    iin july 2012 navistar announced its commitment to utilizing selective catalytic reduction
    scr as a key component of its emissions solutions we have worked closely with the
    epa and california air resources board carb to assure that our engines with scr meet
    emissions requirements and have obtained epa certification for our proprietary 13liter
    engine in combination with cummins proven scr aftertreatment our heavy truck and
    engine combinations are scr based and epa certified

    navistar also contributes to reduced emissions by offering many antiidle solutions including

       v auxiliary power units cooling systems and thermal recovery systems


       v a full line of diesel exhaust emission retrofit products verified by epa and carb that help
          customers achieve their state and local environmental goals for reducing pm and nox

    all navistar engines are epacertified for onboard diagnostics obd a selfdiagnostic and
    reporting capability that ensures emissions control components are working effectively all
    of the companys diesel engines can operate using biodiesel up to b20 and navistar also
    offers alternativefuel vehicles such as the international transtar  with the cummins islg
    natural gas engine

    as part of our formal environmental protection and energy conservation policy navistar works
    to minimize the environmental impacts of our products throughout their lifecycle from raw

fuelefficient products on the road

our bestselling heavyduty vehicle the international prostar  was designed to be the most
aerodynamic and fuelefficient class 8 truck ever recent refinements include its patented
new roof design which optimizes slope while its minimized bumper gap and a lowered hood
have created an even more streamlined air flow another aerodynamic leader is the classic

in october 2012 the prostar and our proprietary 13liter engine won the fifth annual china
international truck energy conservation competition demonstrating that navistar has a
significant opportunity to help drive improved fuel economy in markets around the world

continued strides in greenhouse gas reduction

in its project horizon concept vehicle unveiled in march 2013 navistars product
designers used advanced yet available technologies to demonstrate the potential for             the project horizon concept vehicle features an
future improvements in fuel economy safety and ease of operation while also meeting the        active shutter grille that opens and closes

the concept vehicle uses smart approaches to aerodynamics such as an active shutter
grille that opens and closes based on the vehicles cooling demands reducing drag it also
deploys a new moldedplastic chassis skirt system that improves aerodynamic flow while
allowing easy access for tire service

in may 2013 the company became the first truck oem to receive federal approval for an
innovative clutched air technology it uses for reduction of ghgs emitted by its vehicles the
approval came from the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa

navistar is also coordinating closely with the epa regarding its products compliance with
future ghg emissions requirements in 2012 the springfield ohio truck assembly plant
hosted a group from the epas national vehicle and fuel emissions laboratory in ann arbor
mich which is tasked with implementing the agencys ghg standards for heavyduty
vehicles the epa team was impressed with both the complexity of the ghg compliance
requirements and with the strides navistar has taken to develop a vehicle labeling and          navistar engineers helped the company become

    employees pursue ambitious energy and ghg goals

    navistar has accordingly set and achieved ambitious goals for energy use and greenhouse
    gas ghg reduction from 2008 to 2012 the company achieved a 17 percent reduction in
    ghg emissions and is on track to achieve its goal of a full 20 percent reduction by the end
    of 2013 using 2008 as the baseline this 20 percent goal is an absolute goal and is not
    adjusted by production volume revenue or other factors the company also has reduced
    nonproduction electric load at its truck assembly plants to 45 percent of production load
    down from 60 percent in 2008 and 50 percent in 2010
