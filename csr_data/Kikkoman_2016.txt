internal control systems

the kikkoman group believes establishing an internal control system that ensures proper
execution of business practices is high on our corporate agenda accordingly the group is
enhancing the framework for ensuring effective and efficient operations as well as compliance with
laws and regulations


we periodically review and update the basic policy for establishing an internal control system
that the board of directors adopted in may 2006 in accordance with the revision of companies act
in japan which became effective on may 2015 we made significant revisions on the basic policy


moreover in order to comply with the internal controls reporting system mandated by the financial
instruments and exchange act which went into effect in april 2008 we established an internal
control committee and internal control department in november 2008 to this same end we have
adopted a basic policy concerning internal controls as they relate to financial reporting and
established a structure for strengthening internal controls related to financial reporting


kikkoman performance index

in 2002 the kikkoman corp introduced the kikkoman performance index kpi as our internal
performance evaluation system since then the system has been improved and adopted across
the wider group companies in the kpi results are measured numerically and progress is reviewed
twice a year the results of these evaluations are linked to bonuses for senior managers of
kikkoman corp


the kpi consists of seven main indicators the seven indicators include financial elements such as
sales volume and nonfinancial elements such as reducing co 2 emissions and health and safety
standards




                                     the kikkoman data book 2016
                                                  7

kikkoman corps group companies operate businesses in different categories as such each
group company selects kpi indicators that are important and appropriate for their business
category this system allows the group companies to reflect the nature of their unique
management challenges for their evaluations in addition there are departmentlevel kpi targets
that are linked to companylevel kpi


the kpi system aims to motivate group companies to reach their distinct goals rather than
compete with other group companies additionally kikkoman corp works to effectively convey the
priorities of both financial and nonfinancial management goals to its group companies by changing
the kpi indicators over time

environmental initiatives

basic approach of the kikkoman group
the kikkoman group believes that its corporate slogan seasoning your life can be realized
through the bounty of nature the kikkoman group uses many raw materials for its products such as
soybeans wheat vegetables fruit and water they all contain the condensed power of nature only
a healthy environment can be the starting point of seasoning your life because they cannot carry
out their role as raw materials without the assistance of the natural environment
therefore the natural environment is the base that enables the kikkoman group to season peoples
lives in food cultures all over the world and preserving the natural environment for food is the core
position of all kikkoman group environmental preservation activities


the corporate slogan seasoning your life suggests that as kikkoman seasons and enriches your
food it also brings fulfillment to life as a whole

the kikkoman group will take action with two approaches to preserve the natural environment for
food
1 conduct environmental preservation activities by setting specific targets
2 appeal the importance of environmental preservation activities to encourage active participation
by all


practical activities to preserve the natural environment for food
the kikkoman group has set three concrete goals for its practical activities as follows
1 to realize a lowcarbon society to protect the food environment against global warming
2 to realize a recyclebased society to effectively use food resources
3 to realize a symbiotic society to preserve the sources of the food environment

environmental management promotion system

the kikkoman group established the general environmental preservation committee as the
supreme decisionmaking organ for environmental preservation activities of all group companies
the committee which is chaired by the kikkoman corporation president and ceo will formulate
promote and supervise all aspects of medium and longterm environmental policies
under the direct supervision of the general environmental preservation committee the
environmental preservation promotion committee consisting of management employees and
environmental administrators of groups companies has been established to supervise and
provide instructions on environmental preservation activities from a groupwide perspective
specific activities are conducted under the leadership of the environmental preservation
committee which has been established at each site while information and technologies that need
to be shared or utilized across the group are shared through environmental managers information
exchange meetings that are held among major group companies




kikkoman group companies have pursued effective programs of environmental preservation
activities under the management and leadership of the environmental preservation promotion
committee during and after fy 2017 the group will continue to establish new objectives and
conduct its business activities in an environmentally friendly manner

mediumterm environmental preservation goal 1
 low carbon society

to reduce co2 emissions
the kikkoman group has been promoting activities to reduce co2 emissions considered the main
cause of global warming at all of its factories plants and offices in the mediumterm
environmental preservation goals for the period from fy 2013 to fy 2015 we set objectives for
co2 emission reductions as below

objectives of mediumterm environmental preservation goals fy 201315
1 reduce total co2 emissions at the major companies in japan by at least 17 from fy 2006
levels by fy 2015
2 reduce co2 emissions per unit of production at the major companies in japan and major
overseas manufacturing companies by at least 1 yearonyear

in fy 2015 the total amount of co2 emissions at major companies in japan was 113458 tco2
thereby achieving the objective with a total co2 emission reduction of 31518 tco2 217 from
total emissions in fy 2006 144976 tco2 in addition major companies in japan and major
overseas manufacturing companies achieved the objective with co2 emissions per unit of
production at 0156 tco2t or a decrease of 0005 tco2t 31 from the previous year 0161
tco2t based on these results of our activities we established the mediumterm environmental
preservation goals for fy 2016 to fy 2018 as below

objectives
objective 1 to reduce co2 emissions in manufacturing
1 to reduce the co2 emissions per unit of production at the domestic manufacturing divisions by
20 or more from the fy 2006 levels by fy 2018

divisions by 3 or more from the fy 2015 levels by fy 2018
3 to reduce the co2 emissions at the domestic sales and backoffice divisions annually by 1 or
more from that of the previous fiscal year fy
in the mediumterm environmental preservation goals for the period from fy 2013 to fy 2015 the co2 emissions
per unit of production was calculated by using manufacturing volume t including packaging materials weight
but in the new mediumterm environmental preservation goals for the period from fy 2016 to fy 2018 we
adopted a calculation method using manufacturing volume t excluding packaging materials weight

kikkoman performance index
at the kikkoman group we introduced an index called the kikkoman performance index kpi as
a means to managing corporate objectives refer to page 7 of this report by adopting co2
emission reductions into kpi items in addition to sales and asset turnover ratios we aim to clearly
show group companies that the importance of reducing co2 emissions is equivalent to that of
actual financial affairs while utilizing it in terms of progress management at each division for more
efficient initiatives
kpi is prescribed at each division in all scopes based on the co2 reduction objective refer to
page 20 of this report by the kikkoman group general environmental preservation committee at
such divisions achievement rates based on the objective are evaluated at the end of the first half
april to september and the second half october to march each fiscal year in addition bonuses
for executive officers are directly linked to the kpi scores achieved

utilization of renewable energies and sustainable resources
at the kikkoman group we are working on co2 reductions through the utilization of renewable
energies we installed solar panels and wind power generators while utilizing them as power
sources for facilities at the kikkoman foods noda factory nagareyama kikkoman saitama
kikkoman and kikkoman general hospital in japan and also the kfi california factory in
addition as part of an initiative to utilize sustainable resources we use forest certified paper
packaging in certain products

participation in international initiatives
in 2009 the kikkoman group signed the caring for climate initiative which is an initiative led by
the un global compact caring for climate is a framework for reducing risks due to climate
change and promoting initiatives towards solving various issues through cooperation between
signatory companies at the kikkoman group we are working on countermeasures for climate
change issues via the exchange of information with signatory companies and various
organizations

 symbiotic society

preservation of the water environment
the business of the kikkoman group is supported by and depends on the water environment
water plays a crucial role in both the manufacture of products and also the production of crops in
the form of raw materials in addition water is a precious resource for society at large and we are
well aware of the sheer importance of water preservation
for this reason at the kikkoman group we implement various initiatives in order to make the most
efficient use of water and reduce the environmental load we established mediumterm
environmental preservation goals for the period from fy 2016 to fy 2018

objectives
objective 1 to preserve water environment
1 reduce wastewater bod to less than 10 mgℓ or cod to less than 8 mgℓ at domestic river
discharge areas

objective 2 to reduce water consumption
1 keep the water consumption per unit of production at the domestic and major overseas
manufacturing divisions comparing with the level of the previous fiscal year or below
2 work on reducing water consumption at all domestic sales and backoffice divisions
in the corporate citizenship report 2015 detailed version water consumption per unit of production is calculated
by using manufacturing volume t including packaging materials weight but in the new mediumterm
environmental preservation goals for the period from fy 2016 to fy 2018 the calculation method was changed to
manufacturing volume t excluding packaging materials weight

initiatives
objective 1 to preserve water environment
at the kikkoman group we set our own standards that are stricter than the legal standards
regulations designated by the nation prefectures and municipalities for all wastewater bod
biochemical oxygen demand or cod chemical oxygen demand produced as a result of our
manufacturing activities we put great effort into the preservation of water environments
surrounding our factories by reviewing manufacturing processes and equipment introducing the
latest technologies and facilities and taking the most efficient measures possible
in addition we improve the knowledge and skills pertaining to wastewater treatment by periodically
conducting training for managers and employees at wastewater treatment facilities such as
training for wastewater treatment facility managers while also optimizing facility management
and improving on capabilities to deal with unexpected situations


objective 2 to reduce water consumption
at kikkoman group domestic and major overseas manufacturing divisions 23 factories we are
aiming to efficiently reduce water consumption by measuring water consumption as a result of our
manufacturing activities and controlling water consumption per unit of production while also
reviewing existing processes and undertaking effective initiatives in addition we aim to reduce
water consumption at the domestic sales and backoffice divisions by reviewing business activities
and conducting awarenessraising activities for water conservation

support of water stress reduction activities
the kikkoman group has manufacturing bases in regions where water stress has become a
significant social issue such as the us the netherlands and singapore at these manufacturing
bases we support water environment preservation activities that are conducted by local
governments and ngos in order to contribute to solving such issues please refer to page 55
major social activities overseas for further detailed information in relation to this
water stress situation when water demand exceeds the amount of water available at certain periods of time or
when use of water is limited as a result of water quality


participation in initiatives in japan and overseas
in fy 2016 the kikkoman group participated in water project which is hosted by the japanese
ministry of the environment we also signed the ceo water mandate an initiative that is led by
un global compact we will continue to put our environmental policy into practice by participating
in initiatives that protect precious water resources towards the future and integrate them into our
activities

initiatives with supply chains
at the kikkoman group we explain our basic ideas philosophies and policies in relation to
transactions through the kikkoman group transaction policies to business partners furthermore
we added an item on environmental preservation in priority items in which we require business
partners to follow aiming to conduct environmental preservation activities through supply chains
we also confirmed initiatives that pertain to co2 reductions and forest protection from a
perspective of global warming prevention when holding discussions with business partners
please refer to page 51 of this report for further details

energy resource and discharge flows

the kikkoman group manufactures and sells an assortment of products including soy sauce soy
sauce derivative products beverages ketchup wine soymilk etc to customers both within and
outside of japan in the process of manufacturing these products we consume not only raw
materials but also energy water and packaging materials moreover we discharge solid liquid
and gas waste


the kikkoman group strives to minimize its environmental load by seeking to consume less energy

major environmental communication programs during fy 2016




objective 2 to response against environmental risks
1 water pollution prevention
as we use and discharge large volumes of water in the manufacturing and washing process of our
products we pay attention to improve water qualities and prevent river pollution through setting our
own standards for wastewater we introduced management objectives using bod or cod as
indicators and systems to evaluate the achievement levels of these objectives in mediumterm
environmental goal for fy 20162018


2 manual for the proper disposal of industrial waste
we sort industrial waste before disposal reduce industrial waste as much as possible and pursue
recycling in japan we contract the collection transfer processing and disposal of industrial
waste to licensed service providers we compiled the kikkoman manual for the proper disposal of
industrial waste and strive to ensure that waste is disposed of properly


3 noise vibration and odor prevention
to reduce noise vibration and odors we have been installing quieter machines and
soundproofsoundabsorbing walls around our factories noise and vibration levels are monitored
regularly along the boundaries of our factories to ensure they do not exceed the levels prescribed
by local community regulations


4 air pollution prevention
in addition to observing regional regulations on the concentration and total amount of sulfur oxides
sox nitrogen oxides nox and soot and particulate emissions we seek to control these

5 black mold pollution prevention
trees roofs and walls in the vicinity of soy sauce and mirin factories can be darkened by mold
classified in the genus aureobasidium it propagates through the intake of alcohol and its
presence can generate a black pigment on material surfaces in consideration of local residents
the kikkoman group hermetically seals the source of emissions installs cleaning devices on air
ducts and recovers alcohol content from discharged gases to prevent the microbe from spreading
to residential areas


objective 3 to keep improvement of the environmental management system
since obtaining iso14001 certification for all major group facilities as a whole in japan in june
2011 the kikkoman group aims to achieve higher levels of environmental management by further
enhancing groupwide communication while also continually improving environmental
management systems we use the pdca cycle in order to steadily implement the management
system throughout the group and promote continuous improvements through specific activities at
each division we improve our environmental management systems by establishing objectives and
policies for environmental conservation activities from a perspective of the entire group and
prepare structures to exchange information while reviewing results at all sites in addition we
conduct internal audits at group companies inside and outside japan we conduct training for new
and midlevel employees in order to recognize global and ecological perspectives and the
importance of environmental conservation while also conducting more specialized training for
environmental conservation representatives

exaggerated or unfair labeling and descriptions of unscientific effects at the same time
kikkomans intellectual property department plays a lead role in verifying that kikkoman does not
violate patents trademarks etc held by other companies

of some of our products stopped for a temporary period of time neither productions nor logistics
were seriously damaged but the group decided to introduce bcp business continuity plan in
preparation for the possible future disasters
