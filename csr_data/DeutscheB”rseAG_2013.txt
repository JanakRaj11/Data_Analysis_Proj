dear readers and shareholders



deutsche börse has worked hard and with great success not only to become the number one
in germany but also to reach the pinnacle of its industry worldwide your company is now
among the worlds leading exchange organisations and holds the top spot in europe well ahead
of its formerly much stronger competition deutsche börse groups employees and executives
have achieved excellent results over the past few years we intend to continue these successes
even though 2012 proved to be a more difficult year due to cyclical effects and the weaker
sector as a whole the priorities of our company remain investing in future growth and in a
reliablehighlyefficientinfrastructureforthefinancialmarketsworldwidetogetherwithensuring
cost discipline and enabling shareholders to participate in our success

we will reach these challenging targets although we are well aware that it will not be easy our
opportunities for growth have dwindled as a european company we have to acknowledge that
for our sector at least there is currently a disadvantage to being located in europe at least
when it comes to the european commissions decisions at the same time our competitors are
striking hard and regrouping making the most of the disproportionately more supportive condi
tions in their own countries we cannot rest for a minute and we do not plan to our focus
remains on growing under our own steam by moving into new markets and leveraging new mar
ket opportunities

the capital markets all over the world according to the world federation of exchanges wfe
the order book volume on regulated securities exchanges fell by 22 per cent worldwide and

model not only provided stability it actually generated growth this was true for example in

our new cash market segment for corporate bonds issued by mediumsize companies the
relatively new volatility index derivatives and derivatives on government bonds outside of our
traditionally successful products the bund future and index derivatives as well as our
posttrade services for investment funds

however these growth segments are not large enough in terms of their scale or to be more
precise they are not large enough yet the aims of our strategy for this and the coming years

sources of income outside of our traditional business this in no way means that we intend to
neglect our core competency of organising regulated markets on the contrary we want to build
on this core competency and extend it to new services that are tailored to the current market
situationnamelythegreaterneedforriskmanagementandefficientcollateralmanagementas

intangible assets

capitalised development costs are amortised from the date of first use of a software using the straight
line method over its expected useful life the useful life of internally developed software is generally
assumed to be five years a useful life of seven years is used as the basis in the case of newly developed
trading platforms

purchased software is carried at cost and reduced by systematic amortisation and where necessary
impairment losses amortisation is charged using the straightline method over the expected useful life
or at most until the right of use has expired

intangible assets are derecognised on disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected to
flow from them

the amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at least at the end of
each financial year if the expected useful life of an asset differs from previous estimates the amortisa
tion period is adjusted accordingly

goodwill is recognised at cost and tested at least once a year for impairment

the cost of the other intangible assets acquired in the course of business combinations corresponds to

             financial assets

             financial assets comprise investments in associates and financial assets as described in the         financial
             instruments section

             investments in associates consist of investments in joint ventures and other associates they are
             measured at cost on initial recognition and accounted for using the equity method upon subsequent
             measurement

             impairment testing

             in accordance with ias 36 specific noncurrent nonfinancial assets are tested for impairment at each
             balance sheet date the group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be im
             paired in this case the carrying amount is compared with the recoverable amount the higher of
             value in use and fair value less costs to sell to determine the amount of any potential impairment

strategic perspectives  the exchange  responsibility  governance  management report  financial statements  notes                 221
                                                                                                                basis of preparation




the value in use is estimated on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows from continu
ing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal before taxes for this purpose discount rates are esti
mated based on the prevailing pretax weighted average cost of capital if no recoverable amount can be
determined for an asset it is allocated to a cashgenerating unit for which the recoverable amount is
calculated

irrespective of any indications of impairment intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible
assets not yet available for use must be tested for impairment annually at least impairment tests are
performed where there are indications of impairment if the estimated recoverable amount is lower than
the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised and the net book value of the asset is reduced
to its estimated recoverable amount

goodwill is allocated to identifiable groups of assets cashgenerating units or groups of cashgenerating
units that create synergies from the respective acquisition this corresponds to the lowest level at which
deutsche börse group monitors goodwill an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the
cashgenerating unit to which goodwill is allocated including the carrying amount of this goodwill is
higher than the recoverable amount of this group of assets the impairment loss is first allocated to the
goodwill then to the other assets in proportion to their carrying amounts

a review is conducted at every balance sheet date to see whether there is any indication that an impair
ment loss recognised on noncurrent assets excluding goodwill in the previous years no longer applies
if this is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased and the difference is recognised in profit
or lossthe maximum amount of this reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have resulted
if no impairment loss had been recognised in previous periods in accordance with ias 36 impairment
losses on goodwill are not reversed

financial instruments comprise financial assets and liabilities for deutsche börse group financial as
sets are in particular other equity investments receivables and securities from banking business other
financial instruments and other loans receivables and other assets as well as bank balances financial

ing business financial instruments of eurex clearing ag cash deposits by market participants as well as

             subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities
             subsequent measurement of financial instruments follows the categories to which they are allocated in
             accordance with ias 39 and which are described below as in previous years deutsche börse group
             did not take advantage of the option to allocate financial assets to the heldtomaturity investments
             category in the year under review in addition the group waived the possibility to designate financial
             assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss fair value option

             assets held for trading
             derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments as well as financial instruments of eurex
             clearing ag see details below are measured at fair value through profit or loss apart from financial
             instruments of eurex clearing ag this category includes in particular interest rate swaps currency swaps
             and forward foreign exchange transactions

             fair value of these derivatives is calculated based on observable current market rates if resulting from
             banking business realised and unrealised gains and losses are immediately recognised in the consoli
             dated income statement as other operating income and other operating expenses or if incurred out
             side the banking business as financial income and financial expenses

             loans and receivables
             loans and receivables comprise in particular current and noncurrent receivables from banking business
             trade receivables as well as other current receivables they are recognised at amortised cost taking into
             account any potential impairment losses if applicable premiums and discounts are included in the
             amortised cost of the instrument concerned and are amortised using the effective interest method they
             are contained in net interest income from banking business if they relate to banking business or in
             financial income and financial expense

             availableforsale financial assets
             nonderivative financial assets are classified as availableforsale financial assets if they cannot be
             allocated to the loans and receivables and assets held for trading categories these assets comprise
             debt and equity investments recognised in the other equity investments and other financial instruments
             items as well as debt instruments recognised in the current and noncurrent receivables and securities
             from banking business items

             availableforsale financial assets are generally measured at the fair value observable in an active market
             unrealised gains and losses are recognised directly in equity in the revaluation surplus impairment and
             effects of exchange rates on monetary items are excluded from this general rule they are recognised in
             profit or loss

             equity instruments for which no active market exists are measured on the basis of current comparable
             market transactions if these are available if an equity instrument is not traded in an active market and
             alternative valuation methods cannot be applied to that equity instrument it is measured at cost subject
             to an impairment test

             realised gains and losses are generally recognised under financial income or financial expense interest
             income is recognised in the consolidated income statement in net interest income from banking business

tially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred financial liabilities are
derecognised when the obligations specified in the contracts are discharged or cancelled

clearstream banking sa acts as principal in securities borrowing and lending transactions in the context
of the aslplus securities lending system legally it operates between the lender and the borrower with
out being an economic contracting partner transitory items in these transactions the securities borrowed
and lent match each other consequently these transactions are not recognised in the consolidated
balance sheet

netting of financial assets and liabilities
financial assets and liabilities are offset and only the net amount is presented in the consolidated balance
sheet when a group company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts
and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously

impairment of financial assets
financial assets that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss are reviewed at each balance
sheet date to establish whether there is any indication of impairment

deutsche börse group has laid down criteria for assessing whether there is evidence of impairment
these criteria primarily include significant financial difficulties on the part of the debtor and breaches
of contract

the amount of an impairment loss for a financial asset measured at amortised cost is the difference
between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the
original effective interest rate a subsequent reversal is recognised at a maximum at the carrying amount
that would have resulted if no impairment loss had been recognised

the amount of an impairment loss for a financial asset measured at cost equity instruments that are
nonlisted is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future
cash flows discounted at a current market interest rate subsequent reversal is not permitted

in the case of availableforsale financial assets the impairment loss is calculated as the difference
between cost and fair value any reduction in fair value already recognised in equity is reclassified to
profit or loss upon determination of the impairment loss a subsequent reversal may only be recognised
for debt instruments if the reason for the original impairment loss no longer applies

             financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit and loss

             financial liabilities not held for trading are carried at amortised cost these liabilities comprise issued
             bonds and private placements the borrowing costs associated with the placement of financial liabilities
             are included in the carrying amount within the framework of the effective interest method if they are
             directly attributable discounts reduce the carrying amount of liabilities and are amortised over the term
             of the liabilities



             financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss

             a forward transaction with a noncontrolling shareholder for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests
             that is settled in cash or by delivering other financial assets is a financial liability recognised at fair value
             it is subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss the equity interest attributable to a
             noncontrolling shareholder underlying the transaction is accounted for as if it had already been acquired
             at the time of the transaction



             derivatives and hedges

             derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk all derivatives are carried at their
             fair values the fair value of interest rate swaps is determined on the basis of current observable market
             interest rates the fair value of forward foreign exchange transactions is determined on the basis of for
             ward foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date for the remaining period to maturity

             hedge accounting is applied for derivatives that are part of a hedging relationship determined to be
             highly effective under ias 39 and for which the conditions of ias 3988 are met as follows

             cash flow hedges
             the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument determined to be highly effective is recognised
             directly in equity this gain or loss ultimately adjusts the value of the hedged cash flow ie the gain or
             loss from the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss when the hedged item is recognised in
             the balance sheet or in profit or loss the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately
             in the consolidated income statement

             fair value hedges
             the gain or loss on the hedging instrument together with the gain or loss on the hedged item underlying
             attributable to the hedged risk is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement any
             gain or loss on the hedged item adjusts its carrying amount

             hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
             the effective portion of the gain or loss from a hedging transaction that is designated as a highly effec
             tive hedge is recognised directly in equity it is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation
             is sold the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
             statement

for products that are marked to market futures and options on futures eurex clearing ag recognises
gains and losses on open positions of clearing members on each exchange day by means of the variation
margin profits and losses on open futures positions resulting from market price fluctuations are settled
on a daily basis the difference between this and other margin types is that the variation margin
does not comprise collateral but is a daily offsetting of profits and losses in cash in accordance with
ias 3917 a and ias 3939 futures are therefore not reported in the consolidated balance sheet
for futurestyle options the option premium is not required to be paid in full until the end of the term or
upon exercise option premiums are carried in the consolidated balance sheet as receivables and liabili
ties at their fair value on the trade date

traditional options for which the buyer must pay the option premium in full upon purchase are carried
in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value correspondingly credit default swaps are also carried at
fair value fixedincome bond forwards are recognised as derivatives and carried at fair value until
the settlement date receivables and liabilities from repo transactions are classified as held for trading
and carried at fair value receivables and liabilities from variation margins and cash collateral that is
determined on the reporting date and only paid on the following day are carried at their nominal
amount

the fair values recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are based on daily settlement prices

of current prices and potential future price risks are covered up to the date of the next collateral payment

226   deutsche börse group corporate report 2012




             in addition to these daily collateral payments each clearing member must make contributions to the
             clearing fund for further details see the risk report in the combined managment report cash collat
             eral is reported in the consolidated balance sheet under cash deposits by market participants and the
             corresponding amounts under restricted bank balances

             in accordance with ias 3920 b in conjunction with ias 3937 securities collateral is not derecog
             nised by the clearing member providing the collateral as the transfer of securities does not meet the
             conditions for derecognition



             treasury shares

             the treasury shares held by deutsche börse ag at the reporting date are deducted directly from share
             holders equity in accordance with ias 3233 gains or losses on treasury shares are taken directly to
             equity the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of treasury shares are accounted for
             as a deduction from shareholders equity net of any related income tax benefit



             other current assets

             receivables other assets and cash and cash equivalents are carried at their nominal amount adequate
             valuation allowances take account of identifiable risks

             restricted bank balances include cash deposits by market participants which are invested largely over
             night mainly in the form of reverse repurchase agreements with banks



             noncurrent assets heldforsale

             noncurrent assets that are available for immediate sale in their present condition and whose sale is
             highly probable within a reasonable period of time are classified as noncurrent assets held for sale a
             transaction is highly probable if measures for the sale have already been initiated and the relevant bod
             ies have adopted the corresponding resolutions



             pensions and other employee benefits

             pensions and other employee benefits relate to defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans

defined benefit plans
provisions for pension obligations are measured separately for each pension plan using the projected
unit credit method on the basis of actuarial reports the fair value of plan assets taking into account the
asset ceiling rules if there are any surplus plan assets is deducted from the present value of pension
obligations this results in the net defined benefit liability or asset net interest for the financial year is
calculated by applying the discount rate determined at the beginning of the financial year to the net
defined benefit liability determined as at that date

the relevant discount rate is determined by reference to the return on longterm corporate bonds with a
rating of at least aa moodys investors service standard  poors fitch ratings and dominion bond
rating service on the basis of the information provided by bloomberg and a maturity that corresponds
approximately to the maturity of the pension obligations moreover the bonds must be denominated in
the same currency as the underlying pension obligation measurement of the pension obligations in
euros is based on a discount rate of 35 per cent which is determined according to the towers watson
global ratelink methodology updated in line with the current market trend if the pension obligations
had been measured at the reporting date using a discount rate of 30 per cent as determined according
to the method used in the previous year the pension obligations would have been around 28 million
higher

actuarial gains or losses resulting from changes in expectations with regard to life expectancy pension
trends salary trends or the discount rate as compared with the estimate at the beginning of the period
or compared with the actual development during the period are recognised directly in other comprehen
sive income actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income may not be reclassi
fied to profit or loss in subsequent periods similarly differences between the interest income on plan
assets determined at the beginning of the period and the return on plan assets actually recorded at the
end of the period are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income the actuarial gains or
losses and the difference between the expected and the actual return or loss on plan assets are recog
nised as revaluation surplus

other longterm benefits for employees and members of executive boards total disability pension tran
sitional payments and surviving dependents pensions are also measured using the projected unit credit
method in accordance with ias 19127 actuarial gains and losses and past service cost are recognised
immediately and in full through profit or loss



other provisions

provisions are recognised if the group has a present obligation from an event in the past an outflow of
resources with economic benefit to settle the obligation is probable and it is possible to reliably estimate
the amount of this obligation the amount of the provision corresponds to the best possible estimate of
the expense which is necessary to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date a provision for restruc
turing is only recognised when an entity has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised
a valid expectation in those affected that the restructuring measures will be implemented for example
by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it contingent
liabilities are not recognised but disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits is remote

deferred tax assets and liabilities

deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the balance sheet approach in accordance with
ias 12 the deferred tax calculation is based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts
in the tax accounts and the carrying amounts in the ifrs financial statements that lead to a future tax
liability or benefit when assets are used or sold or liabilities are settled

the deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are currently expected to apply
when the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date deferred tax assets are recognised for the carryforward of unused tax
losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available deferred tax assets
and deferred tax liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities exists and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority



leases

leases are classified as operating leases or finance leases a lease is classified as a finance lease if it
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset from the lessor to the
lessee all other leases are classified as operating leases

leased assets and the associated liabilities are recognised at the lower of fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments if the criteria for classification as a finance lease are met the
leased asset is depreciated or amortised using the straightline method over its useful life or the lease
term if shorter in subsequent periods the liability is measured using the effective interest method

expenses incurred in connection with operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straightline
basis over the lease term



consolidation

all subsidiaries directly or indirectly controlled by deutsche börse ag are included in deutsche börse
ags consolidated financial statements this condition is generally met if deutsche börse ag directly or
indirectly holds more than half of the voting rights or is otherwise able to govern the financial and oper
ating policies of the other entity

initial consolidation of subsidiaries in the course of business combinations uses the purchase method
the acquirees identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair values at
the acquisition date any excess of cost over the acquirers interest in the fair value of the subsidiarys
net identifiable assets is recognised as goodwill goodwill is reported in subsequent periods at cost less
accumulated impairment losses

             services as well as dividends distributed within the group are eliminated deferred taxes are recognised
             for consolidation adjustments where these are expected to reverse in subsequent years

             interests in equity attributable to noncontrolling interest shareholders are carried under noncontrolling
             interests within equity where these are classified as puttable instruments they are reported under
             liabilities



             currency translation

             foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date

             at the balance sheet date monetary balance sheet items in foreign currency are measured at the ex
             change rate at the balance sheet date while nonmonetary balance sheet items recognised at historical
             cost are measured at the exchange rate on the transaction day nonmonetary balance sheet items
             measured at fair value are translated at the closing rate on the valuation date exchange rate differences
             are recorded as other operating income or expense in the period in which they arise unless the underlying
             transactions are hedged gains and losses from a monetary item that forms part of a net investment
             in a foreign operation are recognised directly in accumulated profit

             the annual financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated
             into the reporting currency as follows assets and liabilities are translated into euros at the closing rate
             the items in the consolidated income statement are translated at the average exchange rates for the
             period under review resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in accumulated profit when
             the relevant subsidiary is sold these exchange differences are recognised in consolidated profit for the

any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carry
ing amounts of assets and liabilities arising from initial consolidation are reported in the functional
currency of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate



key sources of estimation uncertainty and management judgements

the application of accounting policies presentation of assets and liabilities and recognition of income
and expenses requires the executive board to make certain judgements and estimates adjustments in
this context are taken into account in the period the change was made as well as in subsequent periods
where necessary

   note 11 contains information on the assumptions applied in performing annual impairment tests
on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life in each case the respective business
plans serve as the basis for determining any impairment these plans contain projections of the future
financial performance of the cashgenerating units if their actual financial performance fails to meet
these expectations corresponding adjustments may be necessary for further information on the impact
incurred due to changes in the discount rate and further assumptions please see       note 11

accounting for provisions for pensions and similar obligations requires the application of certain actuarial
assumptions e g discount rate staff turnover rate so as to estimate their carrying amounts see above
  note 22 shows the present value of the obligations at each balance sheet date these assumptions
may fluctuate considerably for example because of changes in the macroeconomic environment and
may thus materially affect provisions already recognised a sensitivity analysis of the key factors is
presented in note 22

deutsche börse ag or its group companies are subject to litigation such litigation may lead to orders to
pay against the entities of the group if it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will occur a
provision will be recognised based on an estimate of the most probable amount necessary to settle the
obligation if such amount is reasonably estimable management judgement includes the determination
whether there is a possible obligation from past events the evaluation of the probability that an out
flow will occur and the estimation of the potential amount as the outcome of litigation is usually uncer
tain the judgement is reviewed continuously for further information on other risks please see note 37

   note 39 contains disclosures on the valuation model used for the stock options where the estimates
of the valuation parameters originally applied differ from the actual values available when the options are
exercised adjustments are necessary such adjustments are recognised in the consolidated income
statement for the period if they relate to cashsettled sharebased payment transactions

in addition the probable utilisation applied when establishing provisions for expected losses from rental
agreements is estimated see note 24 in the creation of personnelrelated restructuring provisions
certain assumptions were made with regard to for example fluctuation rate discount rate and salary
trends should the actual values deviate from these assumptions adjustments may be necessary

goodwill the stock exchange licence acquired as part of the acquisition of ise as well as the acquired
trade name of stoxx ltd are intangible assets with an indefinite useful life the recoverable amounts
of the cashgenerating units with allocated goodwill were based either on their values in use cgu clear
stream segment and cgu eurex segment or on their fair value less costs to sell cgu market data 
analytics segment cgu infobolsa and cgu clearstream ireland only in cases in which one of these
values value in use or fair value less costs to sell does not exceed the carrying amount the respective
other value is calculated since there is no active market for the cashgenerating units a discounted
cash flow method was used to calculate both value in use and fair value less costs to sell

the key assumptions made to determine the recoverable amounts vary depending on the cash
generating unit concerned pricing or market share assumptions are based on past experience or market
research other key assumptions are mainly based on external factors significant macroeconomic indi
cators include for instance equity index levels volatility of equity indices as well as interest rates ex
change rates gdp growth unemployment levels and government debt the discount rate is based on a
riskfree interest rate between 20 and 21 per cent and a market risk premium of 65 per cent it is
used to calculate individual discount rates for each cashgenerating unit that reflect the beta factors the
cost of debt and capital structure of the peer groups concerned

             each calculation of the sensitivities stated below was based on the adaption of a parameter discount
             rate sales revenue and growth rate of a perpetual annuity by assuming that all other parameters in the
             evaluation model remain unchanged possible correlations between the parameters were not considered

             eurex
             the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of ise is allocated to a group of cashgenerating units in the
             eurex segment

             since the ise goodwill had been calculated in us dollars an exchange rate difference of 207 million
             occurred in 2012 2011 312 million

             assumptions on volumes of index and interest rate derivatives and volumes in the us equity options
             market which were derived from external sources were the key criteria applied to determine the value
             in use with the discounted cash flow method

             cash flows were projected over a fiveyear period 2013 to 2017 for european as well as us activities
             cash flow projections beyond this period were as in the previous year extrapolated assuming a 10 per
             cent growth rate the pretax discount rate used was 130 per cent 2011 124 per cent

             neither an increase in the discount rate by 10 per cent nor a reduction in the planned sales revenue by
             50 per cent per year nor a decrease in the growth rate of the perpetual annuity to 0 per cent would lead
             to a goodwill impairment in the cashgenerating unit eurex

             clearstream
             the clearstream goodwill is allocated to the clearstream cashgenerating unit the recoverable amount
             is determined on the basis of the value in use applying the discounted cash flow method assumptions

             other intangible assets ise
             ises other intangible assets were tested for impairment at the end of the year the recoverable amount
             of these assets was calculated on the basis of the value in use of the ise cashgenerating unit which is
             attributable to the eurex segment the cashgenerating unit of the ise subgroup is the us options ex
             change international securities exchange llc

             the key assumptions made which are based on analysts estimates relate to expected volumes and
             transaction prices on the us options market cash flows were projected over a fiveyear period 2013
             to 2017 a 25 per cent growth rate was assumed beyond 2017 2011 25 per cent the pretax
             discount rate used was 162 per cent 2011 166 per cent

             exchange licence of ise
             in the course of the purchase price allocation carried out in december 2007 the fair value of the ex
             change licence was determined the exchange licence granted in 2000 by the us securities and
             exchange commission permits the ise subgroup to operate as a regulated securities exchange in the
             united states the exchange licence held by the ise subgroup is estimated to have an indefinite useful
             life because the licence itself does not have a finite term and eurex management expects to maintain
             the licence as part of its overall business strategy

the exchange licence does not generate cash flows largely independent from those generated by
the ise subgroup as a whole consequently the exchange licence is allocated to the ise subgroup
as the cashgenerating unit

member relationships and market data customer relationships of ise
in the context of the purchase price allocation the fair values of member and customer relationships
were calculated both assets are being amortised over a period of 30 years using the straightline meth
od cash flows do not result from either the member or the customer relationships which would be inde
pendent of the entire ise subgroup consequently both items are allocated to the cashgenerating unit
ise subgroup

ise trade name
the ise trade name is registered as a trade name and therefore meets the ifrs criterion for recognition
separately from goodwill in accordance with the purchase price allocation of december 2007 the asset
is being amortised over a period of ten years using the straightline method as there are no cash inflows
that are generated independently from the ise subgroup the trade name is also allocated to the cash
generating unit ise subgroup

an increase in the discount rate by 10 per cent a reduction in the planned sales revenue by 50 per
cent per year or a decrease in the growth rate of the perpetual annuity to 0 per cent would lead to an
impairment in the other intangible assets in the cashgenerating unit ise amounting to a volume of
20 million to 50 million a more positive development of the parameters in future could in contrast
to the assumptions above result in a reversal of impairment of the other intangible assets of ise

other intangible assets stoxx
the stoxx trade name the companys customer relationships as well as fully amortised noncompete
agreements and other intangible assets were identified as part of the acquisition of stoxx ltd and allo
cated to the stoxx cashgenerating unit as they do not generate cash independently the stoxx cash
generating unit was allocated to the market data  analytics segment

the impairment test was based on fair value less costs to sell taking into account expected develop
ments in the licence and sales fees for indices and data cash flows were projected over a fiveyear
period 2013 to 2017 cash flow projections beyond 2017 were extrapolated assuming a 20 per cent
2011 20 per cent growth rate the aftertax discount rate amounted to 102 per cent 2011 94 per
cent

stoxx trade name
the stoxx trade name includes the trade name itself the index methodologies and the internet domains
because these can generally not be transferred separately as the trade name is registered it meets the
ifrs criterion for recognition separately from goodwill an indefinite useful life was assumed for the
stoxx brand name given its history and the fact that it is well known on the market

             customer relationships of stoxx
             stoxx ltd has relationships with customers which are based on signed contracts and thus meet the
             identifiability criterion for recognition separately from goodwill

             neither an increase in the discount rate by 10 per cent nor a reduction in the planned sales revenue by
             50 per cent per year nor a decrease in the growth rate of the perpetual annuity to 0 per cent would lead
             to a goodwill impairment in the other intangible assets in the cashgenerating unit stoxx

             regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios

             clearstream banking sa clearstream banking ag and eurex clearing ag as well as the regulatory
             clearstream group are subject to solvency supervision by the german or luxembourg banking super
             visory authorities bundesanstalt für finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht bafin and commission de surveil
             lance du secteur financier cssf respectively all companies that are subject to this supervision are
             nontradingbook institutions market price risk positions consist only of a relatively small open foreign
             currency position as a result of these companies specific businesses their riskweighted assets are
             subject to sharp fluctuations and their solvency ratios are correspondingly volatile thereby the volatility
             of the ratio within the clearstream subgroup is significantly higher than at eurex clearing ag and is
             subject to major fluctuations on a daytoday basis in the course of the year due to a high degree of
             collateralised or zeroweighted cash investments the capital requirements for credit and market price
             risks of eurex clearing ag are relatively stable

             the capital requirements are subject to the national regulations of the individual companies these are
             based on eu banking and capital requirements directives which are ultimately based on basel ii the
             companies concerned homogeneously apply the standardised approach for credit risk for calculating
             the operational risk charge eurex clearing ag uses the basic indicator approach while the clearstream
             companies apply the ama advanced measurement approach

             of the companies subject to solvency supervision only clearstream banking sa has a very limited
             amount of tier 2 regulatory capital from the revaluation surplus under the relevant ifrs treatment a
             minimum solvency ratio of 8 per cent applies the individual companies capital resources sufficiently
             reflect the fluctuation in riskweighted assets stress considerations are used to determine the capital
             required for expected peaks and additional reserves for unexpected events are added the capital require
             ments determined in this way are met through the capital resources as the actual capital requirements
             are below the expected peaks  significantly so under normal circumstances  this may lead to a very
             high technical closing date solvency ratio

             the capital requirements of the clearstream companies rose in the year under review this was mainly
             driven by increased capital requirements for operational risk that arose during the annual review of the
             risk scenarios as well as by higher business volumes at clearstream banking ag combined with slightly
             lower capital requirements for credit and market risk at clearstream banking sa the reduction in the
             regulatory capital of the clearstream holding group under hgb and the simultaneous increase in the
             equity of clearstream banking sa under ifrss are primarily the result of different accounting re
             quirements especially in relation to the timing of measurement gains or losses recognised directly in
             equity

the change in equity at clearstream banking ag is mainly attributable to additions to retained earnings
with the approval of the annual financial statements 2011 the increase in equity at clearstream bank
ing sa was primarily driven by the effects of dividends and fluctuations in the revaluation surplus

the deposited cash collateral at eurex clearing ag fluctuated in the course of the year rising overall to
an equivalent value significantly in excess of 20 billion this is due among other factors to the interest
rate situation on the money and capital markets especially with respect to the swiss franc which now
has negative interest rates however since cash investments with central banks in germany or switzer
land are riskfree from a regulatory perspective and most other collateralised cash investments are
backed by prime collateral the increase in cash deposits and by implication also in bank balances
did not lead to a noticeable absolute increase in regulatory capital requirements for credit risk at eurex
clearing ag

eurex clearing ags internal risk model assumes higher capital requirements for operational risk than
does the accountingbased basic indicator approach in accordance with regulatory requirements for this
reason eurex clearing ag has always maintained a capital buffer for these types of risk over and above
the minimum regulatory requirements against this background the banking supervisory authorities
encouraged eurex clearing ag in 2011 to expand the basis for calculating the regulatory capital re
quirements to include an adequate clearing portion of the fees collected for the account of the operating
companies this resulted in an increase of around 61 million in its regulatory capital requirements to
70 million in 2011 the capital requirements for operational risk are calculated once a year on the
basis of a threeyear average of historical income including the assumed clearing fees and are therefore
not subject to daily fluctuations compliance with the minimum supervisory ratio is maintained at all
times due to the sufficient capital buffer for uncollateralised cash investments to further strengthen its
capital base eurex clearing ag increased its own funds in 2012 by adding 25 million to capital re
serves moreover in anticipation of further increases in the capital requirements for eurex clearing ag as
a central counterparty under the emir regime eurex clearing ag increased its equity by another
110 million in january 2013 by making a further contribution to capital reserves

             eurex clearing ag has been accredited by the financial services authority fsa in the uk as a recog
             nised overseas clearing house roch the fsa expects regulatory capital equivalent to at least half
             the operating expenses of the previous year to be maintained the resulting regulatory minimum capital
             required by the fsa amounted to 480 million as at 31 december 2012 2011 328 million

             in principle the regulatory minimum requirements were complied with at all times by all companies
             during the year under review and in the period up to the preparation of the consolidated financial state
             ments the situation on the money markets especially in swiss francs has brought about a change in
             customer behaviour cash receipts stay with the clearstream companies for longer than usual and as a
             result credit balances accumulate in clearstream banking sas nostro accounts which are maintained
             for securities settlement in combination with the strict largeexposure rules for the interbank business in
             force since 31 december 2010 this led to isolated shortterm breaches of the largeexposure limits
             both at clearstream banking sa and at the level of the clearstream group given the difficult market
             environment the group took appropriate countermeasures

             composition of plan assets
             in germany the plan assets are held by a trustee in safekeeping for individual companies of deutsche
             börse group and for the beneficiaries at the companys instruction the trustee uses the funds trans
             ferred to acquire securities on a trust basis without any consulting on the part of the trustee the contri
             butions are invested in accordance with an investment policy which may be amended by the companies
             represented in the investment committee in agreement with the other members the trustee may refuse
             to carry out instructions if they are in conflict with the funds allocation rules or the payment provisions
             in accordance with the investment policy about 50 per cent of fund assets are invested in shares with
             the aim of replicating the stoxx europe 600 index a total return approach is pursued for the remaining
             fund assets and investments can be made in different asset classes

             the investment strategy with the aim of maximising returns in relation to a benchmark this benchmark
             is derived in equal parts from the return on fiveyear german federal government bonds and the return
             on the euro stoxx 50 index according to the investment policy the fund may only invest in fixed
             income securities shares and listed investment fund units and it may hold cash

risks
in addition to the general actuarial risks the risks associated with the defined benefit obligations relate
especially to financial risks in connection with the plan assets including in particular counterparty credit
and market risks

270   deutsche börse group corporate report 2012




             market price risk
             the return on plan assets is assumed to be the discount rate determined on the basis of corporate bonds
             with an aa rating if the actual rate of return on plan assets is lower than the discount rate used the net
             defined benefit liability increases accordingly however due to the equity ratio in particular in the plan
             assets held in germany the actual return is expected to exceed the return on corporate bonds with a
             good credit rating in the medium to long term  although in the short term this may contribute to greater
             market price volatility of the plan assets

             deutsche börse group considers the share price risk resulting from the equity ratio of the plan assets to
             be appropriate the company bases its assessment on the expectation that the overall volume of pay
             ments from the pension plans will be manageable in the next few years that the total amount of the
             obligations will also be manageable and that it will be able to meet these payments in full from operating
             cash flows any amendments to the investment policy take into account the duration of the pension
             obligation as well as the expected payments over a period of ten years

             moreover the level of the net liability is influenced by the discount rates in particular whereby the cur
             rent low interest rates contribute to a relatively high net liability a continued decline in returns on corpo
             rate bonds will lead to a further increase in defined benefit obligations which can be only partially offset
             by the positive development of the fair values of the corporate bonds included in the plan assets

             inflation risk
             possible inflation risks that could lead to an increase in defined benefit obligations exist because some
             pension plans or the annual capital components are directly related to the salaries ie a significant
             increase in salaries would lead to an increase in the benefit obligation from the plans in germany how
             ever there are no contractual arrangements with regard to inflation risk for these pension plans an in
             terest rate of 6 per cent pa has been agreed for the employeefinanced deferred compensation plan the
             plan does not include any arrangements for inflation so that it has to be assumed that there will be little
             incentive for employees to contribute to the deferred compensation plan in times of rising inflation

             in luxembourg salaries are adjusted for the effects of inflation on the basis of a consumer price index no
             more than once a year this adjustment leads to a corresponding increase in the benefit obligation from
             the pension plan since the obligation will be met in the form of a capital payment there will be no
             inflationlinked effects once the beneficiary reaches retirement age

             in switzerland the benefit plans at axa stiftung berufliche vorsorge and prevas sammelstiftung in
             clude the provision that the board of the foundation decides annually whether the retirement pensions
             will be adjusted to price trends the decision takes into account in particular the financial capability of
             the foundation there are no arrangements for automatic adjustments to price increases over and above
             the legal requirements that apply to certain surviving dependants and disability pensions

             the carrying amount of other loans current receivables and other assets as well as current and non
             current receivables from banking business measured at amortised cost restricted bank balances and
             other cash and bank balances corresponds to their fair value

             the other equity investments item which is carried at historical cost less any impairment losses
             comprises nonlisted equity instruments whose fair value generally cannot be reliably determined on
             a continuous basis for the year under review their fair value is estimated to be close to their carry
             ing amount

             the bonds reported under interestbearing liabilities and under other current liabilities have a fair value of
             14309 million 2011 11253 million the fair values are the quoted prices of the bonds as at
             31 december 2012 the fair value of the private placements is 3910 million 2011
             4006 million this figure was calculated as the present value of the cash flows relating to the private
             placements on the basis of market parameters

             the carrying amount of current liabilities and cash deposits by market participants represents a reason
             able approximation of fair value

             the financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are to be allocated to the following
             three hierarchy levels financial assets and liabilities are to be allocated to level 1 if there is a quoted
             price for identical assets and liabilities in an active market they are allocated to level 2 if the inputs
             on which the fair value measurement is based are observable either directly as prices or indirectly
             derived from prices financial assets and liabilities are allocated to level 3 if the fair value is deter
             mined on the basis of unobservable inputs

             in financial year 2012 only puttable instruments with a carrying amount of 34 million were allocated
             to level 3 in the previous year the investment in direct edge holdings llc was disclosed as level 3
             after obtaining significant influence this investment is accounted as an associate in 2012 no profits or
             losses were involved relating to these instruments in 2012

management approach

sales revenue is presented separately by external sales revenue and internal intersegment sales reve

provision of data by eurex to market data  analytics

due to their insignificance to segment reporting the financial income and financial expense items
have been combined to produce the net financial result

credit risk concentrations
deutsche börse groups business model and the resulting business relationships with a large part of the
financial sector mean that as a rule credit risk is concentrated on the financial services sector potential
concentrations of credit risk on individual counterparties are limited by application of counterparty credit
limits

the regulatory requirements such as those arising under the großkredit und millionenkreditverordnung
gromikv ordinance governing large exposures and loans of 15 million or more in germany and the
corresponding rules in luxembourg arising under the revised cssf circular 06273 are in principle
complied with

the german and luxembourgian rules are based on the eu directives 200648ec and 200649ec
commonly known as crd as revised in 2009 with effect as at 31 december 2010

             see also      note 20 for an explanation of regulatory capital requirements

             deutsche börse group carries out var calculations in order to detect credit concentration risks in 2012
             no significant credit concentrations were assessed

             the economic capital for credit risk is calculated for each business day and amounted to 184 million
             as at 31 december 2012 2011 226 million



             market price risk

             as part of the annual planning the treasury policy of deutsche börse group requires that any net earn
             ings exposure from currencies be hedged through foreign exchange transactions if the unhedged expo
             sure exceeds 10 per cent of consolidated ebit foreign exchange exposures below 10 per cent of consol
             idated ebit may also be hedged

             during the year actual foreign exchange exposure is monitored against the latest ebit forecast in case
             of an overstepping of the 10 per cent threshold the exceeding amount must be hedged

             in addition the policy stipulates that intraperiod open foreign exchange positions are closed when they
             exceed 150 million this policy was complied with as in the previous year as at 31 december 2012
             there were no significant net foreign exchange positions

             currency risks in the group arise mainly from the operating results and balance sheet items of ise
             which are denominated in us dollars plus that part of clearstreams sales revenue and interest income
             less expenses which is directly or indirectly generated in us dollars as at 31 december 2012 ise ac
             counted for 22 per cent of the eurex segments sales revenue 2011 20 per cent in addition the
             clearstream segment generated 9 per cent of its sales revenue and interest income 2011 8 per cent
             directly or indirectly in us dollars

             acquisitions where payment of the purchase price results in currency risk are generally hedged

             the group has partially hedged its investment in ise against foreign currency risks by issuing fixed
             income us dollar debt securities the investment in ise hedged item constitutes a net investment in
             a foreign operation the us dollar securities designated as hedging instruments for the net investment
             hedge were issued in a nominal amount of us4600 million

             interest rate risks arise further from debt financing of acquisitions the acquisition of ise was financed
             through senior and hybrid debt senior debt was issued in euros and us dollars with tenors of five to
             twelve years and fixed coupons for the life of the instruments the hybrid debt issue has a fixed coupon
             for the first five years to be refixed in case the instrument is not called

             in october 2012 deutsche börse ag successfully issued a senior bond in an amount of 600 million
             that largely serves to refinance some of the outstanding longterm financial liabilities

equity price risks arise to a limited extent from contractual trust arrangements ctas and from the
clearstream pension fund in luxembourg in addition there are equity price risks arising from strategic
equity investments in other exchange operators

economic capital is calculated at the end of each month for market price risks that can arise in connec
tion with cash investments or borrowing as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange
rates as well as through hedging corporate transactions on 31 december 2012 the economic capital
for market price risk was 1 million 2011 7 million

in financial year 2012 impairment losses amounting to 133 million 2011 202 million were
recognised in profit and loss for strategic investments that are not included in the var for market price
risk



liquidity risk

for the group liquidity risk may arise from potential difficulties in renewing maturing financing such as
commercial paper and bilateral and syndicated credit facilities in addition required financing for unex
pected events may result in a liquidity risk most of the groups cash investments are shortterm to en
sure that liquidity is available should such a financing need arise eurex clearing ag remains almost
perfectly matched with respect to the durations of received customer cash margins and investments
which in only limited amounts may have tenors of up to one month while the clearstream subgroup may
invest customer balances up to a maximum of one year under strict control of mismatch and interest rate
limits see note 31 for an overview of the maturity structureterm investments can be transacted via
reverse repurchase agreements against highly liquid collateral that can be deposited with the luxem
bourg central bank and can be used as a liquidity buffer in case of need

other litigation and liability risks

contingent liabilities may result from present obligations and from possible obligations from events in the
past deutsche börse group recognises provisions for the possible incurrence of losses only if there is a
present obligation from an event in the past which is likely to cause an outflow of resources and if it is
possible to reliably estimate the amount of such obligation in order to determine for which proceedings
the possibility of incurring a loss is more than unlikely as well as how the possible loss is estimated
deutsche börse group takes into account a multitude of factors including the nature of the claim and
the facts on which it is based the jurisdiction and course of the individual proceedings the experience
of deutsche börse group prior settlement talks as far as have already taken place as well as reports
and evaluations of legal advisors however it is possible that a reliable estimate for a given proceedings
could not be determined before the release of the consolidated financial statements and that  as a
result  no provisions are recognised

clearstream banking sa vs ofac
the us treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac has contacted clearstream bank

securities transfers within the clearstream settlement system in 2008 these transfers implemented the
decision taken by clearstream in 2007 to close its iranian customers accounts ofac had been in
formed of the closing of the accounts in advance

ofac has now invited clearstream to pursue closure of the matter through substantive discussions and
settlement in accordance with ofacs standard procedures thereupon clearstream has decided to enter
into such settlement discussions with ofac on 9 january 2013

ofac has communicated to clearstream its preliminary views on the investigation ofacs preliminary
views are that 1 apparent violations of us sanctions may have occurred in 2008 in connection with
the aforementioned securities transfers and 2 if ofac were to issue a civil prepenalty notice based
only on information currently available to it such a prepenalty notice would indicate an amount of

             approximately us340 million these views were shared for discussion purposes only and are subject
             to potential significant change in favour of clearstream depending on the outcome of discussions with
             ofac ofac has not taken any final decision either on a finding of any violation or on any amount any
             settlement with ofac would not constitute a finding of a violation

             clearstream continues to believe that its actions were in compliance with any applicable us sanctions
             regulations and considers ofacs preliminary figure to be unwarranted and excessive clearstream ap
             preciates the opportunity to engage in substantive discussions with ofac on the facts and reasons why
             a penalty should not be imposed or if a settlement payment is agreed upon why it should be in a far
             lesser amount

             up until the release of these consolidated financial statements the amount of a payment  also taking
             into account experts opinions and different evaluation methods  cannot be estimated reliably by

             pate in the sbp a beneficiary must have earned a bonus the number of stock options for senior execu

             year divided by the average share price xetra closing price of deutsche börse ags shares in the
             fourth quarter of the financial year in question neither the converted sbp bonus nor the stock options will
             be paid at the time the bonus is determined rather the entitlement is generally received two years
             after having been granted socalled waiting period within this period beneficiaries cannot assert
             shareholder rights in particular the right to receive dividends and attend the annual general meeting
             the beneficiaries claims resulting from the sbp are calculated on the first trading day following the
             last day of the waiting period the current market price at that date closing auction price of deutsche
             börse share in electronic trading on the frankfurt stock exchange is multiplied by the number of sbp

             since 1 january 2010 a different method has been applied to calculate the number of stock options for
             executive board members which is described below

             to calculate the number of stock options for executive board members under the 2010 sbp tranche and
             all subsequent tranches the supervisory board defines the 100 per cent stock bonus target in euros
             for each executive board member at the beginning of each financial year based on the 100 per cent

stock bonus target by the average share price xetra closing price of deutsche börse ags shares in
the two calendar months preceding the month in which the supervisory board adopts the resolution on
the stock bonus target any right to payment of a stock bonus vests only after a performance period of
three years the year in which the 100 per cent stock bonus target is defined is taken to be the first
performance year

the calculation of the subsequent payout amount of the stock bonus for the executive board depends
on the development of two performance factors during the performance period firstly on the relative
performance of the total shareholder return on deutsche börse ags shares compared with the total
shareholder return of the stoxx europe 600 financials index as the peer group and secondly on the
performance of deutsche börse ags share price this is multiplied by the number of virtual shares at
the end of the performance period to determine the stock bonus the share price used to calculate the
cash payment claims of executive board members from the stock bonus is calculated as the average price
of deutsche börse ags shares xetra closing price in the two full calendar months preceding the end of
the performance period

on 20 april 2009 the luxembourgian commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf pub
lished a circular on remuneration policies in the banking sector that addresses key aspects of remunera
tion practices for sustainable corporate governance and support their implementation in banking institu
tions daytoday operations according to this circular every banking institution is required to introduce
a remuneration policy that is in harmony with its business strategy and corporate goals and values as
well as the longterm interests of the financial enterprise its customers and investors and which mini
mises the institutions risk position clearstream companies in luxembourg have therefore revised their
remuneration system for executive boards in line with the circular and introduced a socalled stock plan
the exercise process of this stock plan stipulates the allocation of a stock bonus at the end of each
financial year which will be paid in three tranches of equal size with maturities after one two and three
years respectively there is a cash settlement obligation for claims under the stock plan

the number of stock options under the stock plan is determined by the amount of the individual per
formancebased bonus established for each executive board member divided by the average market
price xetra closing price for deutsche börse ag shares in the fourth quarter of the financial year in
question as the contracts require the stock bonus to be exercised gradually it is divided into three sepa
rate tranches which are measured according to their respective residual term using the corresponding
parameters of the stock bonus plan for senior executives

in april 2012 eurex frankfurt ag introduced a special remuneration component for its executive board
members in the form of a separate sbp tranche with a term of 21 months

for the stock bonus of senior executives under the 2010 to 2012 tranches deutsche börse ag has an
option whether to settle a beneficiarys claim in cash or shares the company decided to settle the 2010
tranche claims due in 2013 in cash a cash settlement obligation exists for claims relating to the stock
bonus of the executive board under the newly issued 2010 2011 and 2012 sbp tranches all future
stock bonus programmes issued for the executive board and the stock plan for the executive board
members of the clearstream companies

in accordance with ifrs 2 the company uses an adjusted blackscholes model merton model to cal
culate the fair value of the stock options
