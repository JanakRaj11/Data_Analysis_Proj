l percent of vpp and iso certified sites and
l annual ehs performance including safety incidents ehs certification reviews natural
  resource use and waste data

throughout our history ehs matters have served as important drivers of hospiras business
decisions we focus on employing an ehs management system that incorporates measurable
goals stakeholder input and continuous improvement we use the plan do check act model
which encompasses standards for environmental health and safety the ehs performance metrics
discussed herein are driven by the ehs management system framework

system requirements as well as regulatory requirements audits are performed under a defined
governance audit program which incorporates iso19011 guidelines for auditing management
systems internal auditors are required to possess formal training in systems auditing including
training as lead auditors under recognized standards incorporating both iso14001 environmental

environmental metrics
each year hospira collects data from our global manufacturing locations for a number of environmental
parameters these environmental metrics are then normalized to the annual hospira sales figures and
compared to environmental targets normalizing environmental metrics by annual sales is a common
method to ensure that the data account for changes in a companys business over time
during 2013 special waste rose compared to the 2005 baseline due primarily to reclassification of
hazardous waste to special waste
the environmental metrics and targets hospira proposed in 2005 have been restated to include all
hospira manufacturing operations acquired since 2005 the results of this restatement are reflected
in the environmental data graphs and in table 1
2011  2015 environmental targets
continuing with the environmental metrics baseline established by hospira in 2005 our 2011
2015 goals are as follows these actuals are then normalized by revenue and form the basis for
hospiras environmental targets

usbased transportation fleets

    direct ghgco2 emissions are for fuel combustion carbon content only not the other 5 main ghg and are based on factors of 1614 lbs co2million btu for fuel oil
    and 117 lbs co2million btu for natural gas
2
    indirect ghgco2 emissions for electrical use are calculated using a conversion factor of 137 lbskw the typical value given by the us environmental protection
    agency
increasing direct carbon emissions are primarily the result of increased fuel oil usage at international locations
the rise in indirect carbon emissions in 2013 is the result of using locationspecific emissions factors compared to previous years which used one common factor for all
  locations



regulatory requirements for ghg emissions and reporting
several geographies where hospira operates have regulatory requirements for ghg reporting
andor reductions including the european union eu australia and the united states

current reporting and cap thresholds do not require the company to report or reduce emissions
in the eu hospira does report carbon emissions in australia as required by the national
greenhouse and energy reporting system ngers in the united states no hospira facility
exceeds the environmental protection agency epa threshold to report sitespecific carbon
emissions see table 2 for hospira carbon emission data

supply chain sourcing reporting trends
conflict minerals are minerals mined in conditions of armed conflict and human rights abuses
notably in the democratic republic of the congo or in adjoining countries the minerals are
cassiterite columbitetantalite gold wolframite and their derivatives tin tantalum tungsten
and gold referred to as 3tg
we analyzed our products and determined that
3tg is contained in certain raw material
used in the assembly of our infusion
pump products we were unable to
determine whether 3tg used in
those pumps were or were not
from the democratic republic of
the congo or adjoining countries
we will continue our due
diligence efforts to determine
the origins in 2014
