    leading our industry  responsibly
    our vision at polarcus remains crystal clear despite the prolonged challenging market conditions throughout 2016 to be
    a pioneer in an industry where the frontiers of seismic exploration are responsibly expanded without harm to our world
    polarcus was formed around three core values responsibility innovation and excellence these core values were born as
    the guiding principles of the company at inception they evolved into central attributes of a young and dynamic organization
    responsible for attracting and retaining significant industry talent and putting polarcus on the radar of our clients globally
    today these core values are stronger than ever and truly define being polarcus
    in this corporate social responsibility report we aim to bring the polarcus core values to life to the external world
    responsibility we dig into the polarcus explore green agenda to demonstrate just how far polarcus has gone to pioneer
    environmental leadership in our industry in addition to delivering unwavering focus on safety security business ethics and
    contributing to the communities in which we work and live
    innovation the unique design and functionality of polarcus vessels have been differentiating features of the company from
    the outset our innovative approach has continued and has evolved further through exciting new mechanical maritime
    and geophysical initiatives such initiatives have enabled polarcus to continuously challenge and redefine the norms of our
    industry
    excellence here we focus on the glue that holds everything together  our people attracting developing and engaging our
    highly talented workforce enables us to deliver our industryleading performance and maintain our safety operational and
    geophysical excellence
    i invite you to join me as we continue the polarcus journey guided by our core values


    we never forget that our business is about imaging tomorrows energy responsibly and efficiently for
    the benefit of everyone in the world community

    defining corporate social responsibility
    corporate social responsibility csr is a widely used term which may be defined in many different ways csr is
    sometimes also referred to as social responsibility corporate conscience citizenship social performance or
    sustainable responsible business
    polarcus is listed on the oslo stock exchange oseplcs and despite not officially being a norwegian company we follow
    norwegian guidance on csr reporting
    the norwegian corporate governance code identifies csr through the following statement at the core of the concept
    of csr is the companys responsibility for the manner in which its activities affect people society and the environment it
    typically addresses human rights prevention of corruption employee rights health and safety and the working environment
    and discrimination as well as environmental issues
    the norwegian accounting act section 33c requires norwegian companies to report on csr and refers to csr as human
    rights labor rights and social conditions environmental issues and the combating of bribery and corruption
    as a reflection of various rules and guidelines the principles and activities included in csr reporting vary greatly and are
    largely for an individual company to decide based on the company culture and ambition

    managing our sea emissions
    ballast water treatment system
    ballast water is required to ensure the stability trim and
    structural integrity of a ship on a seismic vessel it is used
    to replace the weight of consumed fuel and to offset the
    weight of deployed streamers in order to maintain stability
    and efficiency when in operation
    it is estimated that as many as 4500 invasive species
    of plants and animals are transported per day in ships
    ballast around the world the introduction of invasive
    marine species into new environments by ships ballast
    was identified as one of the greatest threats to the worlds
    oceans and to global biodiversity
    the polarcus fleet operates with the alfa laval pureballast
    water management system which is 100 chemical free
    and eliminates all invasive species from the ballast water


    bilge water treatment system
    bilge water is not exactly water but rather a mixture of
    fresh water sea water oil sludge chemicals and other
    shipboard fluids by design it collects in the lowest
    compartment of a ships hull below the waterline where
    the two sides meet at the keel this area is known as the
    bilge or bilge well
      current imo regulation mandates that discharged bilge
       water shall contain no more than 15 ppm of oil residue
          we operate stateoftheart bilge water treatment
           plants that clean the contaminated water to 5ppm
            which is 300 below regulatory levels
               all polarcus vessels are using environmentally
                friendly oils and lubricants including all open
                  deck hydraulic systems this significantly
                    reduces the impact of any potential spill
                      to sea in the event of a system failure or
                       difficulty polarcus had zero recordable

     polarcus maintains a strong grasp on the health safety and

     is engaged or has plans to pursue business opportunities
     for every project a security risk assessment is carried
     out additional information is gathered depending on the

     in 2016 additional support measures were introduced to
     improve preparedness in the event of an incident in any of
     the companys main onshore locations a country specific
     procedure was introduced to cover the companys head
     office which acts as a framework for other locations and
     provides supporting documentation tools and checklists
     that can be adapted according to the circumstances of any

     to 2017 we will provide further focus in this area to ensure
     our people remain fully briefed and aware of circumstances
