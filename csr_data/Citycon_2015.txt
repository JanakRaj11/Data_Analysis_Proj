commitment to one citycon
all of our actions this year have been
governed by a true commitment to
strengthening one citycon and hence
driving corporate efficiency today we
see ourselves as a nordic player working
smoothly across borders in june we also
appointed a new coo jurn hoeksema
with broad international experience
under his operational leadership we will
reach a new level in benchmarking our
operational results and sharing best
practices within the company
    without the great support and
dedication of our motivated and

never have reached the position it is in
today therefore i am grateful to work in
such an environment every day one that
makes me excited to work towards an
even better future for citycon
