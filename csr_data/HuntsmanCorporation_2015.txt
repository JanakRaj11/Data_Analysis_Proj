         as a leader in the global
         chemical manufacturing
         industry huntsman makes it
         our business to stay aware of
                                         the worlds water use has been increasing at more than
                                         twice the rate of population growth over the last century
         megatrends that impact our
         operations our products        according to the united nations department of economic
                                         and social affairs an increasing number of regions are
         and our stakeholders           chronically short of water and too much of our fresh
                                         water is wasted polluted and unsustainably managed


                                         we continue to listen to feedback from our stakeholders
         water scarcity is one of
                                         and look at our own risk management processes to identify
         these megatrends
                                         areas where we need to place more emphasis to address
                                         the needs of society and our longterm sustainability
                                         water is a critical resource in our manufacturing processes
                                         we recognize our heavy dependence on its availability
                                         and the risks associated as a result including adequate
                                         access the impact of drought and flood and risks from
                                         contamination thats why we are focusing on water in

keys to success

to segregate the river water within the site a combination of processes
and procedures are applied
 the site owns a lagoon within the kokemaki adjacent to the
    riverbank beside the water intake pipe and operates a settling
    pond to manage outfall water that is returned to the estuary some
    218 yards 200 meters down river
 inlet water is segregated into two types
     o cooling water is settled filtered and processed via a pumping
        station on a closed plant loop to various site utilities
     o treated water is purified via a water treatment plant and either
        placed in a potable system or prepared for use in the
        tio2 washing process
 all process water is treated at a site effluent treatment plant before               in fact the potable water is so pure that the

    discharge to sea                                                                  pori site has an agreement to act as standby

                                                                                       of an emergency water is available 24 hours

the lagoon is extremely useful as a blending facility it can be used by huntsman      which would use some 10 percent of the
operators to control salinity of the river inlet water and to balance slush from the   generated potable water at the water
river if it freezes in winter the site team members are very proud of honing the     treatment plant

                           in this report huntsman shares 11 key metrics from the global reporting
                           initiative gri sustainability reporting guidelines for 2014 our sustainability
                           report generally conforms to the gri 31 guidelines the list of 11 gri standard
                           disclosures on which we are reporting can be found on page 42

                           this year for the first time since we started reporting on sustainability we are
                           including data that relates to an acquisition specifically the acquisition of the
                           performance additives and titanium dioxide businesses of rockwood holdings
                           inc in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result we have made some changes to
                           the way we usually present our performance data

                           our intention always is to present our data so that stakeholders can easily track
                           our progress so in this 2014 report we show the data from rockwood  now
                           known as pigments and additives pa  separately from our usual corporate
                           metrics graphs pa data are shown to the side of each graph in a circle
                           containing a singular value

                           this is the first year the new pa sites have been asked to submit data for
                           huntsmans metrics because we have no historical data for comparison we
                           are unable to apply huntsmans usual quality assurance protocol to the 2014
                           pa data however we are confident that the values listed for rockwood site
                           metrics have been reported carefully and accurately please note while the
                           pa sites joined huntsman in the fourth quarter of 2014 the values shown are
                           the annual values for these sites

cod levels continued to drop compared to 2010 levels                                             for this trend first we are complying with

reductions are due in part to increased permit limits                                              hand in hand with the efficient use of water
