                                               by sluggish economic conditions in europe and a

                                               due to the sharp decline in crude oil prices overall

     group set up a volunteer leave program the                                   why i decided to sign up with the program myself by
     program not only provides special leave to employees                          the way i had opportunities to talk with many volunteers
     who engage in social contribution activities but also                        at the disaster site and i got the impression that
     funds a portion of the costs involved many employees                         surprisingly few companies have instituted programs like
     now take advantage of this program to participate in                          ours to support employees who want to volunteer to help
     volunteer activities we asked four employees about                           the people of tohoku
     their motivation for volunteering what they did and
     the signiﬁcance of that work
