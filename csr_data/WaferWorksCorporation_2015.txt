ch2 friendly environment

based on the concepts of sustainable development fulfilling our responsibilities to protect the environment and resources and protect the
environment and health of neighboring communities wafer works has established effective risk management such as potential emergencies
natural disasters and environmental impacts and we have established comprehensive response plans and procedures in place in terms of
environmental protection and management the operations of wafer works are compliant with environmental protection regulations both
yangmei plant and longtan plant have passed the iso 14001 certification for environment management system to ensure environmental
protection can be managed in a systematical way



air pollution prevention

at wafer works our air pollution prevention strategy is to firstly utilize advanced processing techniques to reduce the number of pollutants that
will enter in the emissions followed by the use of highly efficient equipment to process the pollutants in the emissions so as to ensure that the
concentration of pollutants in the waste air emissions are less than or compliant with government regulations depending on the characteristics
of the waste air emissions the emissions can be broadly divided into 4 categories of alkaline exhaust acidic exhaust volatile organic compounds
and particulate pollutants there are different types of air pollution prevention equipment dedicated to the different types and characteristics of
pollution at the same time we also respect the right of neighboring companies and residents which is why we have integrated the operation
status of all equipment into our central monitoring system which will be observed 24 hours a day by staff on rotational shifts all operation
condition changes will be within the scope of constant surveillance and any deviation exceeding the preset values will trigger an immediate
alarm wafer works ensures that the various air pollutants and emissions conditions are compliant with local government regulations




                                                                        4

water resources and water pollution prevention


water recycling effectiveness of yangmei plant
in 2014 through the recycling and backwash system online analyzer water recovery the pure water system improvement has reached 1112 tons
 day in addition in management of source water usage we have also introduced recycling procedures in the preceding cleaning processes
allowing a total recovery of 502 tons  day in preceding cleaning processes
water recycling effectiveness of longtan plant
in 2014 the sand filtration ac backwash water recycling and pure water meter recycling recovered a total of 160 tons  day



waste management

in order to ensure the destination and proper handling of waste wafer works has carefully chosen our contractor for waste disposal and reuse
each year wafer works will conduct annual waste treatment contractor audit checks to review the certification of the contractor and conduct
onsite inspections so as to ensure all waste are handled or recycled in compliance with regulations
at wafer works the waste management has changed from the conventional disposal and treatment to an approach with more emphasis on
recycling and reuse we have also set up a dedicated department to manage the recycling and reuse of waste products at the same time the
plants will also actively strive to reduce the amount of raw materials required in production taking yangmei plant for example the 2013 raw
material reduction program has greatly reduced the amount of waste produced
as wafer works does not have any hazardous industrial waste therefore there are be no leakage incidents or complaints of environmental
impacts
in 2014 wafer works has no violation of environment regulations and there are no incidents of fines by government departments



                                                                         5

greenhouse gas investigation

in 2010 wafer works began its first autonomous greenhouse gas investigation and took the initiative to disclose the greenhouse gas emission on
the greenhouse gas website industrial development bureau due to client requests and international trends in recent years wafer works
participated in the greenhouse gas investigation guidance plan organized by ministry of economic affairs in 2011 cooperating with the
promotion by consulting firms wafer works successfully published its first greenhouse gas investigation report and passed the iul iso 14064
certification as of 2014 wafer works has been constantly conducting investigation and analysis of greenhouse gas emissions to be used as
corporate targets for energy saving and carbon reduction


2014 yangmei plant greenhouse gas investigation results

the main source of emission of greenhouse gases for yangmei plant is category 2 purchased electricity which accounts for 834 of total
greenhouse gases followed by category 1 which accounts for 166 category 1 includes gases used for cvd nitrous oxide and
octafluoropropane fuel used in boilers natural gas and diesel diesel used in generators and transportation gasoline and refrigerants used in
official cars carbon dioxide filling used in firefighting equipment refrigerant used in chillers refrigerators and drinking fountains


2014 longtan plant greenhouse gas investigation results

the main source of emission of greenhouse gases for longtan plant is category 2 purchased electricity which accounts for 9017 of total
greenhouse gases followed by category 1 which accounts for 983 category 1 includes gases used for cvd nitrous oxide and
octafluoropropane fuel used in boilers natural gas and diesel diesel used in generators and transportation gasoline and refrigerants used in
