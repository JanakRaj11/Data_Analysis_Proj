urban utopia
the worlds major cities are growing rapidly according to united nations estimates
more than 36 million people will be living in tokyo by 2030 mexico is expected to count
more than 20 million inhabitants and the population of los angeles will likely exceed
18 million urban conurbations of this size require an enormous amount of energy produce
large volumes of waste and pollute the air with greenhouse gases however megacities
also give rise to opportunities in densely populated areas resources can be used more
efficiently and technical innovations rolled out in a more costeffective manner bosch is
already working to turn urban areas into powerhouses for sustainability

all for one goal
according to the international energy agencys iea world energy outlook 2012 fossil fuels
remain dominant in the energy mix despite the increase in lowcarbon energy sources in light
of this the aim of limiting the increase in the global temperature to two degrees celsius seems
a distant dream but there is hope energy efficiency is a key lever of climate protection with regard
to of increasing energy prices and political requirements it is also becoming a competitive factor
for companies

      climate protection based on its own        energy consumption of approximately 930

heat from cooling water
measures that may seem laborious in theory
are quickly becoming a reality at the bosch
locations one example is the utilization of
waste heat from cooling water at the german
plants in reutlingen and kusterdingen to
produce ultrapure water the locations use
drinking water from lake constance the
water which has a temperature of less than
ten degrees celsius has to be heated to
10 degrees celsius for this purpose the
plants use the heat from cooling water which
is recovered using two heat exchangers this
reduces the combined energy requirements          reutlingen plant uses waste heat from cooling water to reduce its
of both locations by around 14 million kilo      energy consumption

    this plant each year rodez uses the energy       and climate protection at bosch can be

    and process heat on average the energy
    generated by the wood chip plant covers
    90 percent of the locations heating needs
    and since the incineration of biomass
    releases only the same volume of carbon
    dioxide that trees previously absorbed from

 commitment to the planet
 the main idea behind earth week at many bosch group
 locations was to set an example for environmental and climate
 protection when the initiative was launched on march 31 2012
 nonproduction departments turned off the lights for an hour
 to help protect the climate the following week associates took
 part in a number of different environmental protection initiatives
 for example associates planted trees cycled to work or car
 pooled in other words they helped the planet and encouraged
 others to do the same

a system based on measuring instruments a base station and programs
to process health data with this system patients can take measurements
themselves and send them to their doctors the data is presented in such
a way that doctors can assess their patients state of health at a glance
telehealth thus enables the chronically ill to lead a normal life without
