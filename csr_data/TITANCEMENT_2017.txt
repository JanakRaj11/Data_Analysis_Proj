key assumptions
the recoverable amount of all cgus has been determined based on valueinuse calculations these calculations use pretax
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a fiveyear period cash flows beyond the
fiveyear period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below
the calculation of valueinuse for the groups evaluated cgus is most sensitive to the following assumptions

 sales volumes
 selling prices
 gross margin
 growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the specific projection period and
 discount rates

sales volumes
volume assumptions have been provided by local management and reflect its best estimates as derived from sales forecasts for
the development of which a combination of factors have been taken into consideration past performance local market growth
estimates infrastructure projects in which the company will participate public investments etc in the usa sales volume growth
rates are also based on published industry research and take into account demographic trends including population growth
household formation and economic output among other factors in the states where the group operates in addition to
demographic trends longterm growth rates take into account cementconcrete intensity in construction which has historically
varied from state to state based on building codes availability of raw materials and other factors

selling prices
price assumptions have been provided by local management and reflect its best estimates factors that have been taken into
consideration involve inflation brand loyalty growth rate of the regional economy competition production cost increases etc
τhe group has assumed the following compound annual growth rates for sales for the five year period

of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates the discount
rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the group and its operating segments and is derived from its weighted
average cost of capital wacc the wacc takes into account both debt and equity the cost of equity is derived from the
expected return on investment by the groups investors the cost of debt is based on the interest bearing borrowings the group is
obliged to service countryspecific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors the beta factors are evaluated
annually based on publicly available market data

sensitivity of recoverable amounts
on 31 december 2016 the group analyzed the sensitivities of the recoverable amounts of each cgu to a reasonable possible
change of a key assumption notably to a change of one point in the discount rate or the perpetual growth rate

impairment of goodwill
in greece a significant reduction in demand of construction materials due to the persisting economic recession led to the
reduced revenues compared to the last year forecasts as a result the group recorded an impairment loss of 25 million 2015
40 million on the goodwill based on the respective value in use as calculated using a discount rate of 95 2015 116

in south eastern europe the significant decrease of a terminals commercial viability resulted in the recognition of an impairment
loss of 28 million the calculation of value in use was based on a discount rate of 82

the ratio of fixed to floating rates of the groups net borrowings is determined by market conditions group strategy and financing
requirements occasionally interest rate derivatives may be used to mitigate the relevant risk and balance the mix of fixed and floating
rates of the groups borrowings

on 31 december 2016 following the issuance of 300 million notes by which part of existing fixed rate notes of 875 coupon rate were
refinanced prior their maturity the groups ratio of fixed to floating interest rates taking into account outstanding cross currency swaps
stood at 6238 31 december 2015 4357

the management assessed that the cash and shortterm deposits trade receivables trade payables bank overdrafts and other current liabilities
excluding the put option approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments

fair value hierarchy
the group and the company use the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of the assets and liabilities by valuation
method

level 1 based on quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

level 2 based on valuation techniques whereby all inputs having a significant effect on the fair value are observable either directly or
indirectly and includes quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not so much actively traded

level 3 based on valuation techniques whereby all inputs having a significant effect on the fair value are not observable market data

the following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the groups and the companys assets and liabilities as at 31 december
2016 and 2015

34 fair value measurement continued
the fair value of level 3 investment property is estimated by the group and the company by external independent certified
valuators note 12
the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced liquidation or sale the following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair values

level 1

level 1 availableforsale financial assets are banks listed securities acquired by the company through the greek banks
recapitalization during 2015 part of these shares has been disposed in the fiscal year of 2015 and the remaining part has been
disposed in the 1st half of 2016

level 2
level 2 long and short term borrowings are evaluated by the group and the company based on parameters such as interest rates
specific country risk factors or price quotations at the reporting date especially for longterm borrowings quoted market prices or
dealer quotes for the specific or similar instruments are used

level 2 derivative financial instruments comprise cross currency interest rate swaps interest rate swaps and oil swaps note 33

τhe group and the company use a variety of methods and make assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each
reporting date the aforementioned contracts have been fair valued using a forward exchange rates that are quoted in the active
market b forward interest rates extracted from observable yield curves c oil prices extracted from observable yield curves which
are quoted in the active market

level 3
level 3 availableforsale financial assets refer mainly to investments in foreign property funds in which the group owns an
insignificant percentage their valuation is made based on their financial statements which present the assets at fair value

level 3 put option consists of the put option that the group has granted to noncontrolling interest shareholder of its subsidiary in
albania antea cement sha the put option is valued using a discounted cash flow model the valuation requires management to
make certain assumptions about unobservable inputs to the model certain significant unobservable inputs are disclosed in the
table below

                                                                               2016          2015
gross margin growth rate                                                      260         354
discount rate                                                                  82         106

in addition to the above forecast cash flows for the first five years are a significant unobservable input the management regularly
assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs and determines their impact on the
total fair value

an increase of the forecast cash flows or the change in gross margin for cash flows in the subsequent periods would lead to an
increase in the fair value of the put option on the other hand an increase in the discount rate used to discount the forecast cash
flows would lead to a decrease in the fair value of the put option

the significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated the fair value of the put option is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable
change in the forecast cash flows or the discount rate however it is sensitive to a reasonable fluctuation of the change in gross
margin as described in the following table

          report criteria
         reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the report to ensure consistency


the limitations of our engagement
the reliability of the assured data is subject to inherent uncertainties given the available methods for determining calculating or estimating
the underlying information it is important to understand our assurance conclusions in this context our independent assurance statement
provides no assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website including controls used to achieve this and in particular whether any
changes may have occurred to the information since it was first published


our observations
we have provided titan with a separate detailed management report without affecting the conclusions presented above we have the
following key observations
         titan has a comprehensive set of group policies and has strengthened and revised a number of these in 2016 including human
          rights antibribery and corruption and competition law titan should consider enhancing the implementation of group policies by
          developing performance standards to provide operations with a set of comparable and auditable performance expectations beyond
          local legislation and market norms through which alignment with group policies can be measured
         titan identifies corruption as a strategic and operational risk in a number of countries in which it operates while titan has
          implemented whistleblowing hotlines in greece and the usa employees in other countries have limited mechanisms to
          anonymously report potential noncompliances with the companys code of conduct and related group policies we recommend
          that priority is given to an early extension of an anonymous local language hotline system to all countries of operation in order to
          improve corporate monitoring of possible noncompliances with the group policies

1  active quarries within containing or adjacent to areas designated for their high biodiversity value
2  sites with high biodiversity value where biodiversity management plans are actively implemented
3  since 2011 coverage of wholly owned active quarries has expanded to include both quarries attached to titans cement plants
    and quarries for aggregates production
4  indirect co2 emissions are related to emissions released for the production of the electrical energy consumed at titans facilities
    for their calculation we use emission factors provided by the supplier of the electrical energy or other publicly available data if no
    such data are available the most recent data provided by csi are used
