global rd system

at present the global medical device market is undergoing seismic shifts as the aging of japans
society continues the industrialization of healthcare and nursing care has led to a flood of new
entrants from different business sectors on the other hand emerging countries are seeing rapid
growth in their medical device markets as development of healthcare infrastructure progresses in
step with economic advancement moreover western countries are demanding medical device
products and systems offering even higher medical cost efficiency given that curtailment of medical
expenses is a key priority


as the market landscape becomes increasingly complex in these ways terumo is working to
develop and introduce new products according to regional market needs with the aim of growing
into an enterprise with a strong presence on the global stage



    the terumo groups rd bases

  boosting development with ma



since 2000 terumo has been actively acquiring companies and technologies and establishing
subsidiaries on a worldwide basis obtaining technologies strengthening product lines and
capturing market share have been important objectives in undertaking these activities another key
interest however has been the creation of synergies combining the fundamental technologies that
have long been our strength with those of other companies to give rise to new value through
technological innovation


in the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 for example we acquired usbased harvest
technologies corporation a company with outstanding technological capabilities in cuttingedge
medicine most notably devices for harvesting various cells used to stimulate surgical wound
healing and used in cellular therapy


and in january 2012 we acquired technology from usbased onset medical corporation adding
its unique large internal diameter sheaths to our own product line has solidified terumos leading
position in the area of vascular access management



    enhancing development capabilities through ma




                            terumo corporation    58    annual report 2014

to realize synergies with these overseas subsidiaries terumo in
recent years has actively assigned engineers from japan to
foreign subsidiaries to encourage codevelopment with local
engineers


moreover in order to respond to the healthcare regulations in
each country group companies collaborate with one another and
                                                                       pta balloon catheter
some of the headquarters functions of terumo business divisions
which have been placed overseas by these means terumo has
created a structure that enables faster global promotion of new
products


we have also been collaborating actively with other companies in
april 2013 for instance we signed an agreement with kaneka
corporation to expand our peripheralinterventional business
through the codevelopment of pta percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty balloon catheters for use in treating peripheral lower
extremity artery disease in march 2014 we entered into an
agreement with arterial remodeling technologies sa art of
france to acquire an exclusive acquisition right in that company
which is developing a bioresorbable stent technology under the
agreement we will also pursue joint development of a drugeluting
bioresorbable stent and make staged investments in art


by actively collaborating with other companies while we invest in
our own development activities we are expanding the markets we
serve beyond our existing fields of business



  new rd system based on globalized businessled management



anticipating our impending shift to a companyled global management approach in april 2014 we
reorganized our rd into two groups in july 2013

  upgrading improving and sharing fundamental technologies



technologies that increase biocompatibility are one example of an essential technology commonly
required for the development and manufacture of medical devices of all kinds as such
biocompatibility technologies are improved on a daily basis and shared throughout the terumo
group medical devices are used for diagnostic and treatment purposes by accessing the patients
body in many different ways some medical devices make contact with the surface of the patients
body while others are inserted within the body or implanted in the body for extended periods of
time for this reason a key priority is how to access the patients body safely while minimizing any
undesirable physical burden on the patient enhancing the biocompatibility of a product by
developing materials that inhibit allergic reactions blood clotting or other responses and making
structural enhancements can be one factor that distinguishes a product as an outstanding medical
device


furthermore materials used in medical devices must offer various characteristics such as light
resistance deformity resistance sterilization resistance and pharmacological compatibility
according to the application terumos wealth of experience and technology in the materials field is
put to good use in the entire process from the development and selection of appropriate materials
to processing and forming into shapes that reflect userfriendliness and other considerations


in the performance of processing molding sterilization and other production operations on these
materials terumo applies an efficient rigorous quality assurance system based on technologies
and expertise production technology underpinned by many years of proven experience in
addition each terumo factory amasses production technologies related to the products it
manufactures while taking part in a crossfactory system to assist with production at other
factories this ensures a highquality production system at all factories

  organizational capabilities the link in translating technologies into
  products



medical devices represent the integration of an
extremely diverse range of elemental
technologies from a host of scientific disciplines
including physiology biochemistry
pharmacology cell technology polymer
technology metal processing technology and
electronics because of their use within the
human body regulatory authorities in japan and
elsewhere have set the bar for safety
exceptionally high for approving the manufacture
and sale of these devices


as discussed earlier the terumo group has a
variety of elemental technologies and the bulk of
its human resources possess highly
sophisticated expertise however to stay ahead            basic flow chart from development to sales

in a medical devices industry made fiercely
competitive by new entrants from outside
industries and deliver new products to society at
a rapid steady pace the company must have an
organization framework capable of integrating
existing inhouse elemental technologies into
concrete product development controlling the
flow linking these products to sales and dealing
with the very rigorous approvals process specific
to medical devices


to achieve this terumos rd headquarters is strengthening its project management function for
expediting research through to commercialization the twopronged structure consists of groups
responsible for seeking out new medical needs and underdeveloped technologies to draw out new
value and those charged with developing these into products for mass production the bases
underpinning this structure are located in the rd center and key terumo factories this
configuration establishes an environment in which the entire process from initial rd stages for
new products to mass production stages can occur unimpeded


as part of this structure terumos own evaluation center has the capacity to evaluate devices along
physical chemical and biological dimensions the evaluation center can gather the experimental


                             terumo corporation       63        annual report 2014

data the rd headquarters and each factory need for rd activities enabling nonclinical studies
which precede clinical trials to be performed inhouse this capacity has the added merit of
enabling terumo to acquire expertise in performing safety evaluations responding to a diverse
range of technologies



in addition numerous departments are functionally interlinked from the early stages of
development allowing for efficient conversion of rd activities into viable products these
departments include those that coordinate clinical trials those responsible for submitting
applications in compliance with foreign and domestic regulatory affairs laws and negotiating with
approval bodies those that research and oversee postmarket product effectiveness and safety
matters and an intellectual property department charged with the research and protection of
intellectual property rights in recent years terumo has promoted strategic collaboration with
overseas subsidiaries leveraging its competitive edge in having multiple development bases
overseas to swiftly incorporate technology and develop new products for example terumo has
conducted clinical trials based on european union regulations under which trials can be
implemented more speedily than in japan it has also performed simultaneous multinational clinical
trials in close collaboration with subsidiaries these trials are aimed at obtaining early approval by
enabling the approval bodies of each country to share data obtained in their respective countries


terumo has honed this organizational frameworkone that can smoothly support processes from
product development through to salesin the course of business activities over its long history as a
medical device company and as a result of such initiatives as proactive mas and business
alliances with other leading companies around the world in recent years as such this framework
makes up a vital part of the intellectual assets that support terumos strengths




                             terumo corporation    64     annual report 2014

utilization of intellectual property in each business segment


  basic policy



terumo currently operates in three core business segments while exploring new fields expected to
drive future business development each business segment has unique characteristics based on
differences in products intended users and other attributes accordingly terumo plans and
promotes optimal business development initiatives for each business segment by combining proper
materials production technologies and regulatory affairs strategies


the product management of each company is comprised of two componentsadvanced products
and platform products advanced products are innovative highgrowthhighmargin and shortlife
cycle platform products are stablegrowthhighmargin longlifecycle products offering upgraded
and improved performance in managing products stable earnings of platform products are
invested in advanced products and then the brand image and technologies of advanced products
feed back into platform products


  cardiac  vascular company



the cardiac  vascular company is a good example of a business where terumo combines two
elemental technologiescoating and metal alloymetal processing technologies for example we
have incorporated superelastic metal alloy technology into our intravascular imaging guide wires
and laser processing technology into ptca percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
balloon catheters in addition application of our hydrophilic coating m coat to both of these
products plays a key role in achieving improved accessibility to deep blood vessels in recent years
terumo has developed and introduced a stent combining precision processing and microfabrication
technologies with these elemental technologies the stent features a highly flexible design to
ensure resistance to compression bending and twisting from normal body movement


at present terumos longterm goal is to become a company with a global presence to realize this
goal we are applying technologies nurtured in the cardiac and vascular field to enhance product
pipelines in medical imaging peripheral intervention and neuroendovascular intervention where
the groups elemental technologies precision processing and miniaturization technologies have
also been put to good use

future growthwhile also striving to achieve nextgeneration development and build new
businesses in our traditional fields of endeavor based on our corporate mission contribute to
society through healthcare we are developing new applications for minimally invasive treatment
devices new drug delivery devices and new products focused on reducing pain and improving
postoperative care


regenerative medicine terumo embarked on research in cardiac regenerative medicine 10 years
ago with the technology we have developed the patients own cells are harvested and cultured
and cell sheets are produced and applied to the patients heart at present we are engaged in the
worlds first therapeutic use of cell sheets in treatment being performed in japan with a view
toward commercialization


drug delivery devices meanwhile in the area of drug delivery devices we have developed a
device that makes intradermal injections possible adding to the traditional intravenous
subcutaneous and intramuscular pathways for drug delivery intradermal delivery is known to
enhance the sensitizing potential of vaccines and is therefore expected to increase the number of
patients who can benefit from small amounts of precious vaccines our new device brings simplicity
and reliability to intradermal injection hoping that it will lead to major innovations we and daiichi
sankyo company limited reached a basic agreement in april 2012 to apply our respective
expertise in the fields of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to commercialize new infectious
disease vaccines and are now moving ahead with clinical development

postoperative pain went on the market in november 2013 we are now looking to expand our line
of pain management products and take other steps that will add to our efforts to help improve
patient comfort surgical adhesions are another qol issue for patients and here we are working to
prevent them altogether after surgery internal organs can become firmly attached to the surgery
site these adhesions are known to occur with great frequency regardless of the type of surgery
and are a cause of complications such as bowel obstruction chronic pain and infertility to prevent
adhesions we have developed an adhesion barrier in the form of a sprayon gel that is currently
undergoing clinical studies in japan

patents


  fundamental policies and strategic positioning



terumo believes that the management of innovative ideas as patents and other forms of intellectual
property and activities that strategically use intellectual property and convert it into profits are
critical for a manufacturer the terumo group has established the following two fundamental
policies for its global intellectual property development activities

   foster a culture of innovation
   increase the stock of intellectual properties

the terumo group formulates and promotes global intellectual property strategies that are closely
coordinated with both rd and business strategies this ensures that innovative ideas generated
through global rd activities including overseas sites provide a base of intellectual property that
contributes to the profits of the terumo groups global business operations


  conducting ip development activities across divisional boundaries



at terumo engineers and intellectual property staff work closely together from the initial stages of
development invention and the creation of new technologies are pursued based on a comparison
of terumo inventions with the patents and products of competitors and consideration of both the
direction that should be taken in development activities and the type of intellectual property portfolio
that should be built terumo has created an environment in which intellectual property staff can
casually consult with engineers to promote efficient intellectual property development activities
terumos intellectual property department works to strengthen patent application activities and
intellectual property rights in countries and regions where an enhanced intellectual property
portfolio is necessary for contributing to the growth of the terumo group through invention




                              terumo corporation     72     annual report 2014

  fostering awareness of intellectual property



terumo believes that raising associates awareness of intellectual property and stimulating their
interest in this topic are vital to enlarging its valuable intellectual property portfolio based on this
belief terumo internally disseminates news on intellectual property rights in various countries
around the world in a timely manner every year terumo also conducts a wide range of training
programs organized by the intellectual property department these programs are structured
systematically according to associates level and job category ranging from basic courses to
specialized practical skills training such training programs are a part of efforts to create conditions
that enable endless creation of inventions and technical ideas

measures against counterfeit products

as the foregoing activities make clear terumo must constantly safeguard and strengthen its brand
image as it expands its business globally counterfeit products tarnish the terumo brand and could
negatively impact users who trust it as a manufacturer terumo has an obligation to take resolute
measures to clamp down on counterfeit products this includes identifying such products at an
early stage through global surveys


in one such survey terumo determined that a us company was selling a radial artery
hemostasis device made in china and called the rband terumo believes this product infringes
the patents and trademarks associated with its trband product and accordingly brought a lawsuit
against the us company in a new jersey federal court in february 2013

global production system

in recent years terumo has been pushing ahead with further globalization of its production with
our japanese factories serving as principal manufacturing facilities we are actively propagating
and transferring control of production technologies to develop overseas production centers mainly
in asia we provide support that will enable stable production with the requisite performance and
quality at overseas facilities


back in japan where we have long been working to create a multipolar production configuration
we have established a new factory in yamaguchi prefecture


new construction is also being planned for overseas production new buildings will be added to
existing plant sites in vietnam to increase production of interventinal products and in the
philippines to increase production of syringes and needles furthermore a second whole new
plant will be built in vietnam to meet the growing demand for transfusion products demand is also
rising for the coils used to treat cerebral aneurysms and a new factory has been opened in costa
rica to respond to this need by building a global production system with key facilities in japan and
other parts of asia we are giving ourselves the ability to meet global demand while simultaneously
enhancing cost competitiveness



     strengthening our global production system

a new japanese facility to support the global production system
terumo yamaguchi corp

the terumo groups new yamaguchi factory terumo yamaguchi corp located within
the 96000squaremeter yamaguchi techno park began operating in april 2014


for some medical devices the separation of development work from production is
impossible and some highly advanced highprecision production technologies are not
suited for transfer overseas terumo has positioned production sites in japan as mother
factories for developing core product technologies and refining others the new
yamaguchi factory is expected to play a key role in manufacturing catheters and dd
drug and device products requiring the use of advanced production technologies


yamaguchi was chosen as the location for this factory for two basic reasons one was
the need to prepare for disasters by geographically dispersing our production facilities
which are concentrated in eastern japan the other reason was that the location in
yamaguchi city presented attractive benefits in terms of convenient access a stable
supply of electric power and outstanding human resources


at present the factory is engaged in the test production of catheter guidewires the
related technology and expertise were transferred from other factories in japan and
work is proceeding apace for a transition to commercial production in the coming fiscal
year there are also plans to begin production of dd products

  respect for bioethics



in developing and evaluating medical devices and pharmaceuticals terumos first concern is the
dignity of life as we pursue our business activities we comply with all relevant laws and
ordinances follow social norms and give equal weight to science and ethics as we have outlined
in company rules


regarding the use of animals for rd and product evaluations the head of our animal
experimentation group established the animal experimentation committee enabling us to
supplement the 3r principles  clearly specified in a 2005 revision of a japanese law with a fourth
r standing for responsibility the animal experimentation committee undertakes employee
education initiatives examines experimentation plans confirms that experiments were properly
carried out and finished and performs inspections to determine whether animals are being properly
cared for to ensure responsibility in the use of animals in experimentation


it has been assured by an evaluation performed by the japan health sciences foundation that our
organizational approach to animal testing is in compliance with the basic guidelines for animal
experimentation by organizations under the jurisdiction of the japanese ministry of health labour
and welfare

3r principles first proposed by w m s russel and r l burch in 1959 the three rsreplacement switching to research
  approaches that do not use animals reduction use of fewer animals and refinement reduction of the pain felt by animals 
  are principles for the ethical use of animals in experimentation in japan the 3rs were codified in the 2005 revision of the act on
  welfare and management of animals

outside of japan with the expertise we have cultivated in japan for improving quality we in turn
learn much about other perspectives on systematic approaches and standardization as these
exchanges increase factories outside of japan have also begun introducing shoki ryudo initial
quality assessment  an evaluation method developed in japan

 initial quality assessment is a system designed to reaffirm the quality and product specifications of new products from the

together with partners

terumos corporate mission of contributing to society through healthcare is reflected in our
procurement activities it is vital that patients and healthcare professionals be able to use our
products safely and with peace of mind we therefore exercise great care in selecting and vetting
suppliers for our raw materials and services



  raw material procurement policy



in october 2009 we developed our human x eco development guidelines in line with our
commitment to being a people and environmentfriendly company with these guidelines we are
making an effort to reach a new level of people and environmentfriendly procurement with
particular consideration given to the following

  1 selecting materials that will not produce harmful impacts for the next generation reducing
     environmental impact
  2 selecting materials that can be used effectively and produce no waste saving resources

based on these ideas we maintain fair and equitable relationships with our suppliers at the same
time we continue to procure raw materials in compliance with pharmaceutical regulations and rules
in the respective countries concerned




                             terumo corporation    90     annual report 2014

  promoting continuous quality improvement



to ensure product quality we actively seek to upgrade quality controls not only for raw materials
but also for those services that affect our quality management systems such as the design of
production facilities and molds and any outsourced production


in particular stricter fda regulations for medical devices and other recent changes have made it
more important to manage quality across global supply chains we are fully aware that the quality of
materials and services provided by our suppliers has an impact on the quality of the final product
that we supply


we work with our suppliers to make continuous improvements to quality and conduct regular audits
of their qa systems


we also share qa audit information and other quality information between terumo group
production sites in an effort to improve the quality of our final products through better procurement
activities


  initiatives for stable procurement



terumo manufactures products in five factories within and 19 factories outside japan and
distributes them in over 160 countries with the rapid changes in procurement we place top priority
on ensuring quality and a stable supply and procure materials from the most appropriate sources
to deliver high quality products to healthcare providers


in 2011 despite supply interruptions caused by the great east japan earthquake we were able to
keep medical supplies flowing to customers by working with suppliers based on the shared
understanding that supplies for healthcare must come firstthat healthcare must not be stopped
based on this experience we have sought the cooperation of suppliers in making further
improvements to enhance the safety and reliability of our supply chain




                             terumo corporation    91       annual report 2014

  supplier surveys



in japan each year terumo conducts a survey of its suppliers to make further improvements and
ensure we become a trusted purchaser for our suppliers


the survey includes a wide range of questions involving their transactions with terumo and covers
topics including our business manners transactional ethics and how we select our materials to
ensure stable procurement without interruption to healthcare we added a survey regarding
business continuity planning bcp beginning in 2011 based on the responses and opinions from
our business partners we analyze the issues facing our materials division and provide feedback to
our factory materials divisions the feedback not only aids in resolving the issues identified but also
serves as a tool for verifying the direction of and reflecting customer input in our procurement
activities going forward


when necessary we also meet directly with partners who provide their opinions and work to
further improve our relationships of trust


  purchasing compliance education



as a measure for ensuring good mutual communications with our
suppliers terumo briefs its employees on its basic rules for
suppliers including supplier selection ordering and payment
and conducts training to ensure that all employees are familiar
with and understand the act against delay in payment of
subcontract proceeds etc to subcontractors abbreviated in this
document as the subcontracting law                                    internal purchasing compliance
                                                                        training
in addition to building awareness of our internal controls we also
work to maintain and improve compliance with the subcontracting
law


in addition terumo promotes and encourages understanding of the subcontracting law by actively
participating in workshops held by the fair trade commission and the small and medium enterprise
agency during the month the government promotes compliance with the act we run a series of
checks and interviews to verify compliance status and work to thoroughly instill and reaffirm

a key characteristic of medical devices is that unlike pharmaceuticalsin which the effectiveness of
the product determines therapeutic efficacyit is only when optimal medical devices are used by
medical professionals to practice an appropriate therapeutic technique that a high degree of
therapeutic efficacy can be obtained


globalization is now taking hold in the activities of medical professionals numerous medical
specialists and nurses from emerging regions of the world now study therapeutic techniques in the
us europe and japan and then return to their home countries and share what they have
learned as a result the products of medical device are coming into demand in new markets of
globe


the efficacy of devices used in the field of intervention intravenous therapy depends greatly on
the manual dexterity of the medical professionals using them therefore while improving products
and their usability is critical from a monozukurior art of manufacturingperspective the
importance of medical professionals simply growing accustomed to using them cannot be
underestimated terumo believes that disseminating the most advanced medical technology and
academic information through not only products but also training is its duty as a medical device
manufacturer whose products are the choice of medical professionals across the globe


  supporting the development of healthcare professionals from throughout the
  world at a mock hospital equipped with the latest devices



in 2002 terumo opened terumo medical pranex a comprehensive medical training facility within
its own rd center where it assists healthcare professionals from throughout the world improve
their skills replete with various types of simulators operating rooms with realworld facilities and
catheterization laboratories the terumo medical pranex is essentially a mock hospital with faithful
recreations of medical environments


from improvement of coronary and neurovascular intervention therapy skills to safety improvement
and emergency response in hospitals and homes and even basic skills for new nurses this facility
as one where meticulous training can be undergone in a realistic medical environment is used by
around 10000 healthcare professionals from around the world every year

  working with jica to promote tri in central and south america



in 2014 the interventional systems is division of terumos cardiac  vascular company
submitted a proposal to the japan international cooperation agency jica for the initiation of its
project for the promotion of private sector technology toward social and economic development in
developing countries a publicprivate partnership project


the proposal was selected from among many competitors and terumo and a japanese medical
institution have now been commissioned by jica to conduct training in the use of transradial
coronary intervention tri an interventional treatment that uses a blood vessel in the wrist as an
entry point for approaching the coronary arteries training will be provided over a period of two
years to medical professionals from mexico colombia argentina and brazil four countries in which
this technique has been used relatively infrequently


the purposes of this project are to 1 promote the adoption of
tria treatment technique that can mean less physical stress on
patients and lower medical expensesin countries where heart
disease has become a serious problem and 2 contribute to
better health in these countries by increasing the treatment rate
for people with heart disease it is also thought that the initiatives
of this project could contribute to friendly relationships between
japan and the participant countries in the first phase of the
project physicians from mexico and colombia came to japan in
may 2014 to participate in training

  disseminating information on the efficacy and safety of new technologies and
  products



terumo gathers and widely disseminates academic information in
a broad variety of medical fields

conference presentations on clinical trials we widely distribute information on the utility of new
products and efficacy of therapies furthermore in the field of general hospital business at

effective use of resources

the earths limited resources are what make terumos business activities possible


we therefore strive to utilize needed resources effectively and efficiently through activities that all
associates can do including wastereduction effective resource utilization and improved recycling



  making efforts to reduce the amount of landfill waste



manufacturing processes and business activities at our factories rd center and offices generate
a variety of waste we have therefore set a target of keeping landfill waste to less than 05 of
the total amount of waste generated at all of our sites in japan to ensure we achieve this
reduction target we urge the proper sorting of waste and continue to refine our waste disposal
methods and rules in fiscal 2013 only 04 of our total waste by volume was disposed of in
landfills meaning that we achieved our target for the tenth consecutive year




     target for the reduction of landfill waste

     reduce the amount of landfill waste to less than 05 of the total amount of waste
     generated at our sites in japan

  reducing packaging



for effective use of resources and improved usability terumo is making efforts to reduce
packaging materials without impairing functionality these efforts include developing smaller lighter
and slimmer packages and reviewing package design

reducing the paper used for semisolid nutritional liquid meals


by adopting a less compressible octagonal packing container we have been able to use thinner
cardboard and eliminate partitions these changes have cut the amount of paper used in the
packaging by about 53 the removal of partitions also makes the cardboard easier to fold saving
disposal space for customers the reduction in cardboard volume is 57 in addition the improved
container design eliminates the need to use packing tape reducing weight and waste further




     reducing the amount of paper used in packaging




  promoting recycling



while our industrial waste sc one of our ehs expert subcommittees plays a big role in sharing
important information among sites all our associates make efforts to recycle due to their unique
properties and product safety concerns it is not usually possible to recycle our products for use in
other medical products we do however recycle various types of waste generated in our
production processes and officebased business activities for use in other plastic products
including floor tiles recycled plastic fuel rpf and organic fertilizer in fiscal 2013 our recycling
rate reached 95 in japan

alternatives to hcfc141b


in response to the montreal protocol japan prohibited domestic manufacture of hcfc141b in
2010 at terumo we established the hcfc network under the chemical substances subcommittee
in 2005 in the years following the network comprised of representatives from all of our factories
worked on alternatives to hcfc141b which involved listing processes that use the substance
sharing information on alternatives and sharing the results of studies undertaken at the various
sites by the end of 2009 we had completed the manufacturing changes to accommodate
alternatives and are now using up 141bcontaining materials that we have already purchased
although we continue to consume the instock materials for some purposes needing a small amount
of the substance our 141b emissions will gradually decrease to zero

at the product design stage designers are informed of regulated substances so that they can
refrain from using environmental pollutants wherever possible we use our human x eco
development guidelines as a tool to raise designer awareness meanwhile the quality assurance
department and sections in charge of material procurement cooperate to investigate the amount of
regulated substances contained in materials procured this material investigation is conducted in
the form of a comprehensive survey that serves a wide variety of purposes and covers items that
are necessary in assuring product quality
as survey results become available the quality assurance department enters them into a database
so that we can use the data immediately when needed
