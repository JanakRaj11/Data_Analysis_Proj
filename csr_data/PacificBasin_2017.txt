programme with a campaign to target zero lost time
injuries which includes enhanced prejoining and onboard training and monthly alerts to the fleet with reminders of injuries

holistic and effective approach

very sadly one of our deck cadets died in february 2016 from a fall overboard while assisting with the lashing of deck cargo
in the port of tauranga the main lesson learned from this fatal accident was that crew must attach their safety harness
to a fall arrestor while working close to the edge of the cargo stack in accordance with our company requirement to do so
the lessons were well noted and steps were taken to mitigate the risk of a repeat of such accident and to ensure that the
companys safety management system and our safe working procedures are strictly adhered to on all our vessels in its
report on the accident the transport accident investigation commission of new zealand taic endorsed our followup
safety actions which they said negated their need to make any recommendations we sincerely regret and were deeply
saddened by the accident and our thoughts continue to be with the family of the deceased cadet

     we sustained no navigational accidents in 2016 our navigational performance has benefitted from an extensive
     engagement exercise which collected wideranging feedback from our ships officers and managers as well as company
     specific bridge team management training for all our navigating officers which we introduced in 2013

     we encourage nearmiss reporting which in 2016 accounted for 783 reports 2015 539 through which officers and crew
     described safety incidents and nearmisses however minor which serves as a valuable tool for the prevention of injury and
     loss

     staff wellbeing ashore
     we believe that exercising and staying fit is very important for all of us in 2017 we will implement a global health well being
     and fitness initiative to encourage our staff to be more physically active and spend more time outdoors

                    drawing on our natural capital
                    the primary environmental impacts of shipping are emissions and discharges at sea and in port these
                    outputs are substantially all regulated and compliance is enforced across international regional and local
                    jurisdictions

                    we recognise our responsibility to reduce the impact of our operations on air sea and land and our

                    operations including our environmental outputs


our environmental philosophy is centred on our commitment to being a responsible company at the forefront of environmental
efforts within the dry bulk shipping industry

we have embedded across our global footprint at sea and ashore environmental programmes and initiatives that embrace
environmental stewardship and specifically serve to reduce our atmospheric emissions marine discharges and resource

environmental responsibilities

we seek to minimise our impact on the environment
from atmospheric emissions resource consumption
and marine discharges
through the adoption of energyefficient and environmentallyfriendly ship designs technologies and practices at sea and
ashore the information below is a summary of significant initiatives we pursue to reduce our environmental impact




atmospheric emissions  fuel efficiency
the main measures and technologies we use to minimise our emissions include

fuelefficient operational measures                 application of antifouling paints over

green efforts ashore
across our offices ashore we do what we reasonably can to minimise our
footprint by addressing environmental elements that are within our control

guidelines and communications are regularly posted and policies and practices
are in place across our network of offices to

 reduce consumption of electricity water and materials

 recycle office waste

pacific basin was awarded a silver label in the wwfs lowcarbon office
operation programme that measures and tracks outputs and energy consumption from our headquarters in hong kong

an independent audit of our environmental performance determined that our office in hong kong where 59 of our shore
based staff work produced carbon emissions of 1067 metric tonnes for the 20152016 audit year 201415 1329

our hong kong headquarters carbon intensity in 2016 reduced 20 to 53 tonnes co2 per employee due to a number of
initiatives including

 eliminating ten computer servers

 more skypebased video meetings reducing the need for air travel and

 switching from business class to economy class air travel
