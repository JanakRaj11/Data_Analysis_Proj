2017 integrated annual report

looking ahead
the new structures and standardised processes have streamlined
risk reporting and management across the group going into 2018
our focus is on further embedding this structure into each of the
businesses and ensuring compliance and consistent application of
the relevant principles we also intend to enhance the governance
processes and compliance lines as we look to integrate governance
risk compliance and sustainability functions grcs through the
creation of a groupwide grcs foundation the immediate focus areas
within this platform will be information governance and compliance

it is critical to the value proposition of the group and to ensuring
proper integration of management processes that our information
governance structures are firmly in place we therefore aim to ensure
that the new processes that we are implementing provide us with
relevant and timely information so that we can monitor the risks
facing the group and take swift action where required this in turn
will assist the organisation to increase its ability to make well
informed decisions and react rapidly to risks and opportunities
both in the short and long term the grcs platform will gradually
be implemented over the next 24 months and we anticipate that the
benefits and efficiencies to the group created through this foundation
will be significant

                   material issues
                   the group continues to identify two core material issues related to financial sustainability namely profitable
                   growth and capital and costefficiencies in 2017 as in 2016 we have also managed and dealt with a third
                   material issue rationalising and refocusing the business as creating a leaner operation will create both
                   efficiencies and drive profitable growth

                   while much progress has been made in rationalising and refocusing the business over the last year this remains
                   a critical priority as this process will continue to distract the group from addressing the two primary issues until
                   it is resolved however we continue to view this third material issue as temporary in nature and likely to fall away
                   once the strategic repositioning of the group has been achieved

 2017 integrated annual report

      our approach
      altron has been relatively shortterm focused over the last 18 months implementing our strategy of
      refocusing the group into the ict sector our priorities have been to find incremental organic growth
      opportunities and maintain stability in our core operations in the noncore operations the focus has been
      on running disposal processes while trying to improve the performance of these businesses  many of which
      were in very difficult positions

      given the uncomfortably high borrowings on the groups balance sheet at the end of the 2016 financial
      year during 2017 we also continued to emphasise cash flow management in order to reassure all of our
      stakeholders that appropriate progress was being made on reducing the borrowings to sustainable levels in
      the shortest possible period of time

                  will take time and like many aspects of empowerment will be made
                  more challenging by the new ict sector codes but we believe that we

                  by ensuring their wellness and satisfaction at work going forward
                  it is important that we continue to communicate with all our staff
                  regarding our discontinued operations and to support those who
                  are directly affected it is also critical that we motivate and drive the
                  human capital within our continuing operations which although
                  healthy are themselves operating under difficult market conditions

                  we believe that our employees like to work for altron it is an exciting
                  business with a bright future and it is important to us that our people
