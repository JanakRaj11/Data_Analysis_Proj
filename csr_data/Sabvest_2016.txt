                                       u      our aim is to maintain and grow a portfolio of equity interests in a spread of

      u      we may hold equity investments that are small in percentage terms but where we
             are able to exert influence through board representation or shareholder
             agreements conversely we may hold majority or joint controlling interests but
             without direct management responsibility accordingly we participate in good
             businesses with firstclass management without being restricted by a required size
             of holdings
      u      our approach to our investments is similar to that of a diversified holding

                        be affected by any strengthening of the rand and weaker trading conditions
                        the groups listed investee companies are performing to expectation in a difficult trading
                        environment however share prices have weakened in the first two months of the year and future
                        movements in share prices are obviously uncertain
                        it is not possible to comment on overall expected 2016 performance at this stage due to the likely
                        effects on fair values of reduced listed share prices and of the strengthening rand on foreign currency

                                  the board is comfortable with the level of combined assurance obtained from management
                                  the audit and risk committee the external auditors and the internal audit service provider
                                  relative to the groups key risks and its control environment the board is of the view that all
                                  of the risks listed have been mitigated to the extent feasible and that all residual risks have
                                  adequate controls or are monitored closely the board is not aware of any impending material
                                  risks that have not been disclosed herein
                                  nothing has come to the attention of the audit committee or the board that has caused them
                                  to believe that the groups system of internal controls and risk management is not effective

                 9 remuneration policy
                        the remuneration committee ensures that the remuneration of executives and staff is competitive
                        sabvests policy is to pay cost to company packages in the upper quartiles for comparable positions
                        shortterm incentives for executives are targeted at between 50 and 100 of cost to company
                        packages in the case of the ceo 25 of package is awarded if normal dividends over the three
                        year period to the accounting date have increased by at least 10 pa and the second award is
                        calculated as 2 of pat the cfo may earn 25 of package based on preset qualitative kpis
                        and the balance of his incentive is calculated as 1 of pat our performance is allowed to 200 of
                        package
                        sabvest has a longterm incentive plan ltip for executives and staff participants receive a notional
                        award of between 12 and 100 of their cost to company packages annually which is invested
                        in the groups net asset value the growth in this notional investment is measured annually and is
                        tested after four years an award will only vest if a hurdle rate of 10 per annum growth in net asset
                        value is achieved there is no retesting adjustments are made to account for the notional
                        reinvestment of dividends the awards are cash settled and accounted for in profit and loss annually
                        the awards are capped at a gain of 200 of the notional investments
                        awards prior to 2012 had testing periods of 3 to 5 years

                          integrated report to stakeholders
                                                  continued




      accordingly when the shortterm incentive scheme and the ltip are viewed together most of the
      potential annual incentive to executives is based on growth in nav per share over one year and over
      four years and the balance on the growth in dividends
      managements interests are also aligned with those of shareholders relative to share prices
      both executive directors are shareholders in the company and have previously received allocations
      from the share trust or the sars scheme
      accordingly the bases for shortterm incentives and the ltip combined with the previous allocation
      of shares to executive directors directly motivate management to achieve growth in sabvests key
      performance indicators
      the sars share trust and share option schemes are currently dormant
      some of the directors who take the responsibility of appointments to the boards of the groups
      investees may receive directors fees from some of those companies in addition the groups three
      unlisted investees pay consulting fees directly to sabvest
      the ceo holds certain nonexecutive directorships independently and not as a representative of the
      group these enhance the groups influence improve the groups access to new investments and
      result in income to the group from time to time the ceo retains the fees from those appointments
      nonexecutive directors receive annual fees for their roles as directors as board committee members
      and for sitting on the boards of investees on behalf of the group the board does not regard
      separate attendance fees as appropriate or necessary unless the time allocation to meetings expected
      of directors is materially more than normal in a particular year
      the company secretarial function has been outsourced and is charged to the group on a time basis

10 shares and shareholders
      at the year end sabvest had 171m ordinary shares and 289m n ordinary shares in issue the
      ordinary shares carry 500 votes per share and the n ordinary shares carry 1 vote per share
      sabvest had 477 shareholders at the year end as profiled in annexure 2 the shareholdings of
      directors are recorded in the directors report on page 35

11 commentary and conclusion
      performance will be improved through encouraging and facilitating the growth of the groups
      unlisted investment companies and by the continued realigning of the investment portfolio to realise
      investments in any underperforming entities and to reallocate those funds within the portfolio
      sabvest targets to be fully invested to optimise returns and to enhance returns on capital by
      maintaining a level of borrowings although at a conservative level
      shareholders are referred to section 7 for the outlook for the financial year

financial reporting standards council they have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for
certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value or at amortised cost the significant
accounting policies and methods of computation are consistent in all material respects with those applied
in the previous financial year

the group has also adopted the revised or amended accounting standards issued by the international
accounting standards board iasb and the ifrs interpretations committee ifric which were
effective and applicable to the group from 1 january 2015 the application of these changes had no
impact on the groups financial results for the period

the principal accounting policies adopted are set out below

basis of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and entities
controlled by the company its subsidiaries at 31 december each year control occurs where the
company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain
benefits from its activities

on acquisition the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair
value any excess of the cost at acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is
recognised as goodwill if the cost is less than the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired
ie a discount on acquisition this difference is credited to profit or loss in the period of acquisition

all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation

investments

all investments are accounted for at fair value in terms of investment entities

where investments are listed equities fair value is calculated as market value should the disposal of any
investment be restricted then the market value is reduced by a discount to arrive at fair value gains and
losses arising from changes in the fair value are included in the statement of comprehensive income for the
period on disposal of the investments the profit or loss is accounted for as the difference between the
consideration received and the fair value of the investment at the commencement of the financial year

where investments are unlisted equities fair value is calculated using the maintainable earnings model
maintainable earnings are based on historic and projected net operating profit after tax nopat
earnings as appropriate the multiples are selected after considering peer group multiples and adjusting as
appropriate the resultant valuations are then adjusted for net cash or net debt balances they may be
measured for reasonableness against net asset value if this is a relevant metric recent transaction prices
andor discounted cash flow dcf valuations

for other unlisted investments fair value is determined using an appropriate valuation model

                 financial instruments

                 financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the groups statement of financial position when
                 the group has become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument

                 financial instruments recognised on the statement of financial position include cash and cash equivalents
                 investments finance advances and receivables accounts payable and borrowings

                 equity instruments issued are recorded as the proceeds received net of direct issue costs

                 derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent
                 reporting dates

                 accounts payable are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost
                 using the effective interest rate method

                 changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow
                 hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the
                 statement of comprehensive income in the same period in which the hedged firm commitment or forecast
                 transaction affects net profit or loss

                 interestbearing loans and overdrafts are recorded as the amounts of the proceeds received net of direct
                 raising costs finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are accounted for
                 on an accrual basis and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not
                 settled in the period in which they arise

                 originated loans and receivables are measured initially at cost the loans and receivables are measured
                 subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method if the terms of a loan or receivable
                 are not marketrelated the payments are discounted at a marketrelated rate to determine the fair value at
                 initial recognition

                 cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other shortterm highly
                 liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an
                 insignificant risk of changes in value offset by other current interestbearing debt

                 longterm investments are measured at fair value they are recognised as being held for trading
                 purposes and gains or losses in fair value are included in the statement of comprehensive income for the
                 period where investments are listed equities the fair value is calculated using market value and where the
                 investments are unlisted equities the fair value is calculated using inputs that are observable either
                 directly or indirectly

                 on disposal of investments the profit or loss is accounted for as the difference between the consideration
                 received and the carrying value of the investment and is included in the statement of comprehensive
                 income

                 redeemable or callable reset bonds purchased to hold to maturity or to callreset dates are recognised at
                 cost any surplus or discount to the maturity or call values are accounted for over the period to
                 maturitycall and the investments are accounted for accordingly the carrying values calculated on this
                 basis are regarded as appropriate estimates of fair value at the reporting date
                 specific impairment provisions or debt writeoffs may be deducted from finance advances and receivables
                 or investments where in the opinion of the directors taking into account that as a result of one or more
                 events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset the estimated future cash flows from the asset
                 have been impacted recoverability is doubtful or unlikely

estimated useful lives using the straightline basis

the gain or loss arising on disposal of assets is determined as to the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying amount of the assets and is recognised in profit or loss

foreign currencies
the individual financial statements of each group entity are presented in the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates its functional currency for the purpose of the
consolidated financial statements the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in rands
which is the functional currency of the company and the presentation currency for the consolidated
financial statements
in preparing the financial statements of the individual entities transactions in currencies other than the
entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the
dates of the transactions at the end of each reporting date monetary items denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the end of each reporting date nonmonetary items
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on
the date when the fair value was determined nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated
exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and on the retranslation of monetary
items are included in profit or loss for the period exchange differences arising on the retranslation of
nonmonetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences
arising on the retranslation of nonmonetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in

foreign operations including comparatives are expressed in rands using exchange rates prevailing at the
end of each reporting date income and expense items including comparatives are translated at the
average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period in

are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred to the groups translation reserve such
translation differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is
disposed of

                 impairment provisions
                 associate companies and investments are considered annually for impairments in value if in the opinion
                 of the directors there is an impairment an impairment provision is deducted from the
                 carrying value of the associate company or investment impairment provisions created or reversed during
                 the year are written offwritten back through the statement of comprehensive income where there is a
                 reversal of an impairment loss the asset is increased to the estimated recoverable value which will not be
                 greater than the carrying value had no impairment loss been recognised in the prior years
                 at the end of each reporting date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its other tangible assets to
                 determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss if any such
                 indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
                 impairment loss if any
                 recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use
                 if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount
                 of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit
                 or loss
                 where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount of the asset cashgenerating unit
                 is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount but so that the increased carrying amount
                 does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
                 recognised for the asset cashgenerating unit in prior years a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised
                 immediately in profit or loss unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount in which case the
                 reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase

                 provisions
                 provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a
                 past event it is probable that the group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can
                 be made of the amount of the obligation
                 a provision for the longterm incentive plan ltip measured annually and calculated on the growth in
                 the notional investments is expensed annually and the total amount expected to be paid is shown as
                 a liability
                 the amount recognised as a provision is a best estimate of the consideration to settle the obligation at the
                 reporting date taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation

revenue recognition
revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction
will flow to the group and the amount of revenue can be reliably estimated
dividends from investments are recognised when the right to receive payment is established
interest is recognised on a time proportion basis
capitalisation shares elected in lieu of a cash dividend are accounted for in investment income at the cash
dividend equivalent

lease agreements
rentals payable under lease agreements entered into for premises occupied by the group are expensed on
a straightline basis over the term of the relevant lease

related party transactions
all related party transactions are unless otherwise disclosed at arms length and are in the normal course
of business refer to note 20

retirement benefits and medical aid schemes
payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged and expensed as they fall due
there are no defined benefit plans or postretirement medical benefit obligations

taxation
income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax
the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year taxable profit differs from profit as
reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible
the groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the end of the reporting period
deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit
deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit
deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries associates longterm and shortterm investments and interests in joint ventures except where
the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future

                 the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each end of the reporting period and reduced
                 to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part
                 of the asset to be recovered

                 deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
                 settled or the asset realised deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss except when it relates to
                 items charged or credited directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity

                 deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
                 assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
                 authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis

                 cash and cash equivalents

                 the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
                 carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are detailed in the notes to the financial statements where
                 applicable

                 with regard to the fair value presentation of the investment holdings both longterm and current for the
                 listed investments critical judgement and estimates are limited as external observable market data is used
                 to determine carrying value

                 in respect of the unlisted investments which are carried at fair value significant judgement and estimate is
                 used to select the appropriate valuation model determine maintainable earnings and estimate the earnings
