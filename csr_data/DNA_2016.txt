manage without good connections however consumers may find the product service and solution offering of
the telecommunication operator sector very complex and even difficult to understand as an operator dna
shares the responsibility of understanding the customers needs and providing solutions that meet these needs
dna also strives to inform the customer about these services and their possibilities as clearly as possible and to
help the customer identify key issues that they should be aware of in the digital world

dnas business objective is to make customers lives more inspiring productive and entertaining dna also
considers it important that connections services and devices are provided to consumers and companies in a
clear easy and costefficient manner

services were brought under the dna brand in 2015 and
the dna store dna business and dna welho brands

customer experience was enhanced further in many
ways customer service and other service channels
work in closer cooperation now and online services
were renewed by introducing new handy features such
as click and collect which allows customers to buy
products online and collect them from the local store

users to access several dna services without having to
login separately to each of them

dna sets climate objectives
                                          as a finnish telecommunications group dna
                                          wants to be responsible and work towards
                                          reduction of emissions and increased energy
                                          efficiency dna has calculated its greenhouse gas
                                          emissions since 2012 to identify the direct effect of
                                          dnas operations on climate change according to
                                          the results most of the greenhouse gas emissions
                                          originate in production ie the electricity
                                          consumption of dnas radio network and transfer
equipment as well as the maintenance of their equipment facilities

dna consumes a large amount of electricity which means that the indirect greenhouse gas emissions from
dnas own energy consumption are significant this is why dna specified the following climate objectives in
2015

 while the expansion of dnas networks continues we aim to reduce our total emissions by 15 per cent by
  2020 from the levels reported in 2014
 we will improve the energy efficiency of our radio network and reduce emissions from the radio network in

  proportion to annual data transfer volumes by 80 per cent by 2020 from 2014
in november 2015 in accordance with the new climate objectives dna began using renewable energy in its
direct procurement of electricity green electricity is estimated to reduce the indirect greenhouse gas
emissions from dnas own energy consumption by 40 per cent by the end of 2016 which means about 13000
tonnes less greenhouse gases per year this amount equals about 2000 trips around the world in a car

the renewable energy purchased by dna is hydro power and comes with a guarantee of origin hydro power is
an emissionfree energy source and as such a good option in terms of reducing the climate impacts of dnas
business however renewable energy generation does have its problems and this also applies to hydro power
hydroelectric plants can prevent the movement of migratory fish in rivers fish passages and ladders are
constructed in finland according to finlands national fish passage strategy to enhance the viability of
migratory fish stocks dna is monitoring the situation and regularly assesses the origin of purchased electricity


climate risks assessed
dna also wants to consider the options available for adjusting to currently prevailing effects of climate change
to this end dna has assessed its climate risks covering effects of phenomena such as rainstorms and floods
on dnas operations as well as the business impact and opportunities of regulation and changes in consumer
behaviour


energy efficiency in production
modernisation of base stations in the mobile network proceeded as planned in 2015 some 80 per cent of the
old base stations have been replaced by more energyefficient models the project is expected to be completed
by 2017 the new system requires fewer devices thereby reducing relative energy consumption during the
network upgrades hundreds of radio units have also been relocated from inside the equipment facilities to the
masts removing the need for mechanical cooling this saves significant amounts of energy

increased mobile data volumes challenge the energy efficiency of the radio network because the continuously
growing volumes require more equipment which in turn increases energy consumption on the other hand the
4g network reduces the relative perdata energy consumption through improved technical performance of lte


energyefficient facilities and working methods
the new dna house completed in the autumn of 2012 was constructed by yit according to its energy genius
concept energy efficiency of the building was carefully considered already in the design and construction
phase dnas headquarters have earned an international leed gold certification as a recognition of the
buildings ecological energy and water consumption materials used and emissions

dna conducted a mandatory energy review towards the end of 2015 in company offices and equipment
facilities while measures that can further improve energy efficiency and energy savings were identified during
