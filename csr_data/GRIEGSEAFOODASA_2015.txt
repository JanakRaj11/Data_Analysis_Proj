                it is important and a duty for
                us as fish farmers to work
                systematically with fish health
                through prevention so that the
                fish get the best conditions to
                stay healthy




why it is important to us                                          the group we have introduced weekly reporting on indicators
fish health is vital to ensure sustainable resource utilisation   such as mortality and daily snapshots are also available to
good fish health implies that the highest possible share of        management from all regions in 2014 we have also reached
fish are doing well growing normally and survive at all stages    our goal of reporting our mortality rate in a way that is
of the lifecycle it is an important duty for us as fish farmers   comparable to the rest of the sector as part of the gsi we
to work systematically with fish health through prevention        now report according to the standards agreed by this group
so that the fish get the best conditions to stay healthy high     an important contributor to the monitoring efforts is statutory
mortality also has a major negative impact on profitability       fish health checks at all locations this includes monthly
                                                                   reporting on fish health to the authorities which includes
                                                                   records of external injuries eventual diagnoses and mortality
our main principles                                                monitoring is also adapted to the region for instance in
we aim for a systematic longterm approach to achieve good         rogaland we carried out gill controls for detecting agd twice
growth and high harvesting quality with a focus on ensuring       weekly during vulnerable periods
resistance this includes the preparation of overall fish health
plans for each region the plans cover regionally adapted
infection prevention and vaccine strategies fish health plans
are revised upon need but at least once a year for an optimal    figure 1 12 months rolling mortality supplied as one
mutual response we also focus on local cooperation and            number for jan  dec 
transparency with other participants


our efforts and results
we work every day to ensure that we keep the fish alive and
healthy preventive fish health measures are essential to our
success these measures include our health feed programs
which focus on increasing the fish robustness and ability to                                                           target mortality
cope with stress and external influences thereby also reducing                                                        less than 7
medical treatments these preventive programmes involve
measures such as site visitation order use of disinfectant
and disinfectant footbaths routine mortality removal and
offsite storage isolation of installations by prohibiting
transfers between facilities unless the boat is disinfected and
pcr screening for earlier detection of parasites viruses and
bacteria

another important preventive measure is the establishment
of management agreements to maintain best practice                 mortality is defined as total no of mortalities in sea last 12

                    in short sea lice management
                    is paramount to secure long
                    term sustainability of the
                    industry




why it is important to us                                            but the last three years we have commenced on projects in
dealing with lice is high on our stakeholders agenda due to         an attempt to develop the use of lumpsuckers in rogaland
the potential negative impact on wild populations and farmed         finnmark and shetland the results are promising but there
salmons health and welfare alike treating lice is also cost        are still some challenges to be resolved before lumpfish are
and resource intensive and high levels imply lower productivity      an effective method to control sea lice on salmon we are also
and quality improper handling of lice can lead to resistant lice   looking into the use of several alternative nontherapeutic
which again could lead to natural constraints on future growth       sea lice options there are some technologies that can be
of the industry in short sea lice management is paramount          deployed against lice for example in finnmark and shetland
to secure longterm sustainability of the industry                  we have introduced sea lice skirts we also cooperate with
                                                                     other actors in the regions where we operate to keep sea lice
                                                                     levels low
our main principles
lice levels should stay below norwegian authorities limits in       figure 2 shows the average monthly level of sexually mature
all our fish farms in norway we also strive to comply with the      female lice in each region of grieg seafood grieg seafood
same standard in our operations in other countries to ensure        has defined 05 sexually mature females as a threshold for
compliance we strive always to be ahead of lice outbreaks            implementation of measures in each region this is stricter
through continuous monitoring and response delousing                than the national guidelines in the uk and bc sea lice levels
efforts should also be balanced with a focus on fish welfare         is still our biggest challenge although in three out of four
and avoiding resistance we therefore prioritise nonchemical        regions we have managed to keep the se lice levels relatively
delousing methods when possible for the best possible               constant as compared to 2013 unfortunately the sea lice
shared response we will also focus on local cooperation            challenge grew in shetland in 2014 this was in part caused
coordination and transparency with other participants               by large preharvest salmon as well as gill problems in some
                                                                     of the localities which meant that these fish could not endure
                                                                     lice treatment in bc we still face challenges in managing sea
our efforts and results                                              lice levels when the wild salmon come back to the coast and
a key step in our efforts to prevent and treat against lice is the   up the rivers bringing with them sea lice
statutory systematic monitoring of sea lice levels in all our
fish farms the salmon is checked for lice every week at water       in rogaland the combination between wrasse and 100 clean
temperatures above 4 c at water temperatures below 4 c
lice is counted every other week out of consideration for fish
                                                                     figure 2 adult female lice per salmon per
health and welfare due to less pressure with regards to sea
lice in bc the routine differs slightly based on the results      month for 2014 lepeoptheirus salmonis
relevant agents are applied examples of such measures
include conducting lice counts several times a week at high
sea lice levels as well as susceptibility testing of sea lice
populations before treatment is engaged

in 2014 we have convened a crossregional technical group to
discuss best practices for managing and monitoring sea lice
levels this group will continue to meet on a regular basis

revolving use of the fewest possible chemical agents is
extremely important in lice treatment in order to minimize
the development of resistance to current treatment we have
therefore focused on rolling over the use of chemical agents
and active use of wrasse in rogaland we now have extensive
experience with the use of wrasse the natural conditions are
not right for the traditional use of wrasse in the other regions

impacted the high level of active substances used this year
in finnmark in particular with regards to the use of chitin

have been limited to infeed treatments for small fish which
has lower levels of active substances

in shetland there is a large discrepancy with regards to sea
lice levels and the use of active substances this is because
shetland has mainly relied on the use of hydrogen peroxide

grieg seafood can affect the local communities in which we
operate both positively and negatively at the same time
we depend on these communities thriving and on good
