                                             several years ago starbucks partners wanted a way to help their peers who fell
                                             on troubled times their desire led to the creation of the cup fund an emergency

t  hrough starbucks partner view survey we asked the majority of our partners in 2003
   what they thought about working for the company it was the most extensive research
weve done with this many partners at one time we went beyond surveying for satisfac
tion attitude to include engagement behavior which has a strong and consistent link
to overall business performance

partners rated the following five items as important or very important in their decision
to join starbucks
1 the opportunity to work with an enthusiastic team
2 working in a position where i add value
3 medical benefits
4 opportunity to grow and develop skills
5 growthoriented company

                                              which was measured at 73 placing starbucks among the best employers in the world
                                              based on engagement studies conducted by an independent consultant of 1459 compa

                                              the 2003 partner view survey confirmed that starbucks mission statement and guiding
                                              principles have a positive impact on partner engagement we also heard how important
                                              health benefits were to our store partners in their decision to join starbucks although
                                              soaring us health care costs have challenged starbucks and other companies we are
                                              committed to designing health plans that ensure our partners have continued access to
                                              affordable health care




                                              partner benefits


                                              the story has been told many times but its worth repeating when howard schultz
                                              became head of starbucks he vowed to leave no one behind the commitment stemmed
  when eric yu was attending college          from his childhood experiences as the son of a bluecollar worker an injury kept his
  five years ago he joined starbucks as      father out of work and without companyprovided health coverage the family suffered
  a parttime barista and qualified for       tough times this instilled a vision at starbucks to treat people like family and they will
  healthcare coverage and other benefits     be loyal and give their all
 as a college student the healthcare
  benefits were very important to me
                                              the importance of treating people like family has never worn off today starbucks has
  now that im a fulltime assistant
                                              one of the most competitive benefits and compensation packages in the retail industry
  manager the healthcare coverage and
  other benefits are still important          here are a few examples of our total pay programs
  to me
                                             in 1987 starbucks became one of the first retail companies to offer our parttime
                                              partners who work at least 240 hours per calendar quarter the same comprehensive
                                              health benefits that our fulltime partners receive this includes medical prescription
                                              drug dental vision and alternative healthcare coverage

                                             starbucks pays approximately 75 of the costs of healthcare coverage for us partners

                                             starbucks pays 60 of the healthcare coverage cost for our us partners dependents
                                              including their samesex and oppositesex domestic companions

  arabica coffee is sold in two distinct markets  the commodity and specialty markets

 commercialgrade arabica coffee is traded as a commodity in a highly competitive market
  on the new york c the worldwide reference used by coffee traders for commercial
  grade coffee during 2003 c prices for commercialgrade arabica coffee were as low
  as 055 per pound 121 per kilogram

 higherquality arabica beans are sold to the specialty coffee market which represents
  10 of total worldwide coffee purchases specialty coffee is produced mostly on
  smallholder farms and can command much higher prices than commercialgrade arabica

  in recent years a variety of factors have stimulated a rise in global coffee production
  while consumption has remained relatively static the result is a coffee surplus that has
  driven prices down to levels not seen in 30 years this has been devastating for many
  coffee farmers who produce commercialgrade coffee they are not earning enough to
  cover their costs of production or make a profit

  one encouraging sign is the rise in consumer demand for highquality specialty coffee
  since the early 1990s this segment of the market has grown dramatically as consumers
  have demonstrated their willingness to pay more for gourmet coffee as a result farmers
  who produce highquality coffee can command better prices for their crops from
  starbucks and other coffee companies that buy only premium beans

paying fair prices and offering favorable

terms


a fair price to a guatemalan coffee farmer living in a small remote village may be
different than that of a farmer living in kenya but in the end both farmers must
earn enough to cover their costs of production and adequately support their families
otherwise they may stop growing coffee

thats why for the vast majority of our purchases we negotiate prices outright this way
our suppliers know in advance that they will be paid a fair price for their highquality
coffee regardless of any downturn in the market

in fiscal 2003 when prices of commercialgrade arabica coffee ranged from 055
070 per pound 121154 per kilogram starbucks paid an average price of 120
per pound 264 per kilogram for our green unroasted coffee excluding freight

         than 25 million customers through our
         doors every week its the coffeehouse
experience  a third place between work and
home  that connects customers to coffee in
an inviting enriching environment that is
comfortable and accessible we call it the
starbucks experience

from the beginning we have upheld our principle of developing enthusiastically
satisfied customers by assuming that everything matters especially the quality of
our coffee and customer service after every visit our customers depart with a
memory of their experience our most loyal customers visit starbucks 18 times a
month on average therefore our success depends on consistently providing our
customers the optimal starbucks experience every time they visit

but it takes more to gain the trust of consumers these days most prefer to do
business with companies that demonstrate strong values and act responsibly in this
regard we want our customers to know what starbucks stands for and to hold us
accountable if our actions appear out of line with our guiding principles

                       starbucks customers are discerning they want highquality products and excellent
                       service we know this from conducting ongoing consumer research and getting feedback
                       from our customers we believe the reasons we appeal to millions of customers are
                       because of our great products our focus on customer service and the pleasing ambiance
                       and convenience of our locations

                       what we have learned from our customers is that starbucks greatest strength is also our
                       biggest challenge  providing a consistent starbucks experience and highquality products
                       everywhere starbucks is served and sold around the globe our customers expect every
                       starbucks experience to be of the same quality that they receive in their home store

                       when we miss the mark our customers let us know we take their feedback seriously
                       and dedicate ourselves to improve in the areas in which we have fallen short of our
                       customers expectations at all times we are focused on being and offering the best and
                       empowering our partners so they can provide each customer with a personalized uplift

crops that have been genetically modified gm are ones that utilize biotechnology to
speed up the process of traditional plant breeding biotechnology has become a very
prevalent practice in us agriculture used widely to produce corn and soy crops which
are converted to ingredients used in many products

two years ago starbucks received a number of inquiries regarding gm ingredients in our
products at that time starbucks determined and has consistently reaffirmed that our
coffees and teas are not genetically modified moreover the majority of our beverage and
food products are also free of ingredients from gm sources currently the us does not
require specific labeling of gm ingredients making identification difficult for businesses
that sell readymade foods

                              the processed cocoa and chocolate starbucks uses in our products is sourced from several
                              tropical countries including côte divoire west africa in 2001 reports appeared in the
                              media that have raised concerns over the alleged use of forced child labor associated with
                              cocoa production in côte divoire




csr 2003          customers                             46

  we have relayed these concerns to our cocoa suppliers and asked them to address
  these issues in west africa through the joint protocol which was signed by chocolate
  manufacturers and related organizations in the cocoa industry and witnessed by
  members of the us congress international labor organization ilo and several
  nongovernmental organizations

  what weve learned from a comprehensive survey conducted by the international
  institute of tropical agriculture of labor and other practices on 3000 west african
  cocoa farms is that 967 of the children working on farms in côte divoire were related
  to the farmers this is a typical occurrence on small family farms where everyone in the
  family helps during the harvest season

  to help ensure economic sustainability of cocoa farming our suppliers are committed
  to paying a fair price to farmers for their cocoa according to the international cocoa
  organization icco commodity prices for cocoa are currently at their highest level
  in years

  beyond what weve asked of our suppliers starbucks actively supports the world cocoa
  foundation wcf an organization that includes leaders in the cocoa industry and non
  industry partners through its targeted educational and scientific programs the wcf is
  successfully encouraging sustainable and responsible cocoa farming in africa asia and

coffee tea and paper


one of our greatest environmental impacts includes coffee growing which is addressed in
an earlier section of this report beginning on page 22 as we have reported starbucks is
taking significant measures to encourage the sustainable production of coffee

tea
like coffee tea is an agricultural product tazo tea company a wholly owned subsidiary
of starbucks sources a variety of raw materials used in tazos tea blends including tea
leaves botanicals and spices tazo is committed to purchasing certified organic materials
for its tea blends whenever feasible appreciating that organic farming practices have
environmental benefits because of the limited reliance on chemical fertilizers herbicides
and pesticides see tea sourcing graph above left

paper
starbucks uses large quantities of paper  from the cups napkins and shopping bags
used in our stores to the shipping cartons used in our operations in an effort to reduce
our environmental footprint starbucks strives to purchase paper with high levels of
postconsumer fiber pcf and unbleached fiber we believe our efforts will contribute to
forest conservation and help to reduce waste

we measure our performance in this area as the percentage of pcf content and
separately unbleached fiber that is contained in all the paper we purchase in fiscal 2003
the overall percentage of pcf content exceeded our goal of 20 but compared to fiscal
2002 our performance wasnt as strong over half of the paper we purchase is used in
our hot cups we are researching ways to incorporate pcf in our cups additionally we
are confident in our ability to raise the pcf content in future noncup purchases and
have targeted 30 pcf content see paper sourcing graphs above right

store design and operations


collectively starbucks stores in north america use considerable amounts of energy
and water and generate a great deal of waste our environmental retail initiatives are
focused on reducing energy and water consumption and minimizing waste by reusing and
recycling we also examine ways to improve the environmental performance of our stores
through better design specifications and equipment purchases

energy conservation
there are easy and costeffective measures that can reduce energy usage and decrease
greenhouse gas emissions starbucks has found for example our stores use a best
practice energy checklist that includes practical conservation measures moreover last
year starbucks undertook a number of conservation projects in our north american
stores these included replacing inefficient bulbs and fixtures in more than 2700 existing
stores and resetting thermostats to increase heating and cooling efficiency

despite these initiatives our energy usage in fiscal 2003 increased based on data we
collected from a sample of stores in an effort to improve our performance in this area in
2004 we will launch an energy test bed over two years in a sample of our stores to
monitor all energy usage including equipment and test new energy conservation initiatives

water conservation
sometimes simple solutions can have a big impact this was true of our water conserva
tion measures last year starbucks installed low flow toilets in some of our locations we
also adjusted the flow on a specialized faucet located in our espresso bars more than
3000 stores were installed with waterefficient rinsers which clean the pitchers used to
mix our frappuccino blended beverages see store design and operations graphs above

                             principles were conceived
                             profitability was included
as a core value but intentionally placed
last on the list this was done not because
profitability is least important instead we
believed that adhering to our strong values
and our commitment to good sustainability
performance would ultimately lead to good
financial performance

as we reflect on the reasons for starbucks financial success we believe our
responsible business conduct has been a strong factor but it comes down to the
commitment our partners make to operate in a manner consistent with our values
so its fitting that the rewards of starbucks performance benefit all shareholders
including our partners

                                    in 2003 starbucks undertook numerous corporate governance initiatives designed to
                                    make the board stronger more independent and better informed

                                    here are a few examples of the changes starbucks adopted last year

                                   appointed senator bill bradley olden lee and mike ullman as new board members
                                    which improved board diversity and ensured 34ths of the directors met the securities
                                    and exchange commission and nasdaq definition of independence

                                   enhanced whistleblower procedures to protect those who raise concerns

                                   limited the number of boards on which starbucks directors may serve so their attention
                                    will be more focused on starbucks business
