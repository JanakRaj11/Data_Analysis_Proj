the transformation of rush has been nothing short of
 remarkable the eightyear journey that began with our
 collective desire for a stateoftheart campus has
 resulted in a worldclass facility that has surpassed our
 expectations it is a success story of the highest order
 this outcome would not have been achieved without
 the grand collaboration between physicians clinicians
 staff and the powerjacobs team we are enormously
 proud of this accomplishment a testament to the
 legacy started more than 140 years ago now manifest

     this same challenge was addressed in october 2006 by economist
     nicholas stern in his stern review a major report for the british
     government that examined the economics of climate change
     according to the stern review without action the overall costs of
     climate change could be be equivalent to losing at least five percent
     of global gross domestic product gdp each year now and forever
     however stern also concluded that conversely the benefits of
     strong early action on climate change would outweigh the costs of
     inaction this was the basis for the ministern report for the scottish
