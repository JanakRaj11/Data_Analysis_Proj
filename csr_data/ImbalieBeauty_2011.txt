    overview of skinwell
    continued



    beauty care remains a priority to south african consumers however consumers remain very cautious and pricesensitive and will continue
    to be prudent in the years ahead the focus of the consumers has shifted to beauty maintenance products compared to seasonal offerings
    consumers are continuously trading down and are searching for promotional offerings innovation and new product launches also continued
    to stimulate consumer interest in the market according to the euromonitor international report released in july 2010 beauty and personal
    care  south africa

    during the 2011 year the group rolled out a new point of sales system to more than 80 of its corporate and franchised beauty outlets with the
    objective to install it into the remainder of beauty outlets imminently this has significantly enhanced and simplified monthly reporting and
    the tracking of promotions held within the group in conjunction with the new point of sales system the group rolled out an integrated gift
    card system which resulted in overall cost savings for the group

    two new placecol branded salons were opened during the 2011 year in sea point and george in the western cape the group has successfully
    converted four of its existing beauty salons to the world of beauty brand which is a onestop innovative offering that incorporates all beauty
    services skin nails and hair care

    strategic considerations dictated the defranchising and the closure of certain outlets during the 2011 year which resulted in the group
    increasing its number of corporate outlets to 16 at year end these outlets are included under inventories as they are available for resale
    the assessment of corporate store profitability is an ongoing process and continued emphasis will be placed by the group on restoring the
    profitability of all corporate stores

    in order to improve the overall profitability of the franchise chain the group has successfully launched new treatments and retail slimming
    products which were beneficial to the groups systemwide sales during the 2011 year by strengthening the training team the group has
    trained many therapists during the 2011 year in terms of general continuous training in order to improve overall service levels

    the group received certain accolades where placecol branded salons were voted as the number 1 beauty salon as part of the beeld newspaper
    readers awards in november 2010 and dreamnails and body salons as the number 1 nail salon by the star newspaper as part of the stars
    annual readers choice awards december 2010

    cash flow remained a constraint during the 2011 financial year and further funding through shareholders loans was required an improvement
    in cash flow was achieved during the latter part of the financial year reduced stock purchases and the festive season which normally results
    in an upturn in the beauty industry contributed to this

    year to date achievements
    the group became the exclusive distributor of the dr gobac cosmeceuticals skin care range and beauty treatments which are being distributed
    to its own and independent beauty salons albeit being at lower margins the services and products were successfully launched in beauty
    salons in may 2011

    the group is in the process of testing technology which if successful will be introduced to the underlying footprint in order to differentiate our
    salons from other independent and competitor beauty salons

    prospects
    the launch of the groups new loyalty programme is imminent with the expected date of launch in september 2011 the group will continue
    to source products and services which can be successfully introduced to its distribution footprint it is envisaged that more beauty salons will

    report of the chairman and
    chief executive officer
    introduction
    skinwell continues to distinguish itself as one of the leading beauty salon groups in south african through its placecol beauty centres dream
    nails  body and world of beauty branded salons through a national footprint of almost 100 beauty salons the main objective is to ensure
    that we have a healthy network of beauty salons and the viability and sustainability of existing salons will continuously be under scrutiny

    the group continued to be resilient because it owns its own brands the year continued to be very challenging with ongoing restructuring as
    part of the overall turnaround strategy of the company

    the closure of more companyowned stores in underperforming retail centres in the first half of the financial year that were opened prior to
    the downturn in the economy was inevitable but part of the turnaround strategy of the company certain stores were also defranchised due
    to noncompliance with franchise agreements

    one of the groups ongoing challenges is to find and retain qualified beauty therapists in its national footprint it remains a challenge to train
    the groups beauty therapists and nail technicians to ensure a very high standard of services to our customers that visit our salons and to ensure
    standardisation across the nationwide footprint

    as the group is a marketing and sales organisation where brand perceptions are critical focus will remain on marketing activities

    financial overview
    while systemwide sales increased by 16 company revenue decreased by 19 to r566 million 2010 r699 million the decrease in
    revenue was a result of less beauty outlets being opened during the 2011 year the disposal of the manufacturing concern and training institute
    in 2010 the closure of certain loss making beauty outlets during the 2011 year and the overall condition of the economy

    gross profit increased by 12 to r397 million 2010 r355 million and gross profit margins improved to 703 2010 509 due to
    increased royalty revenue without associated cost of sales

    operating costs before depreciation and amortisation decreased by 41 to r408 million 2010 r692 million as a result of significant cost
    savings implemented as part of the groups turnaround strategy the groups marketing and advertising spend increased towards the latter part
    of the year operating costs for 2011 include once off retrenchment costs incurred of approximately r783 000

    earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortisation increased to r13 million 2010 loss of r308 million losses attributable to
    ordinary shareholders decreased to r512 400 2010 loss of r258 million loss per share decreased to 022 cents 2010 loss of 166 cents
    and headline loss per share decreased to 015 cents 2010 loss of 137 cents

    corporate stores available for resale to the value of approximately r5 million are included in inventories it will be a primary focus point
    of management to sell these stores to franchisees in order to strengthen the cash flow of the group the group had no material capital
    commitments for the purchase of property plant and equipment as at 28 february 2011

    directorate
    the group appointed melinda jacobs on 1 january 2011 as financial director the group is considering the balance and composition of the
    board and envisages in the near future to strengthen the marketing expertise of the board

report of the chairman and
chief executive officer continued
prospects
the group remains cautious but the interventions such as certain marketing initiatives as well as training initiatives are yielding positive
returns the overhead cost structure will be monitored closely and further cost savings will be implemented where appropriate

the group has formed certain strategic alliances to strengthen its own inhouse research on product development and innovation and as part
of this strategic vision will continue to launch innovative new treatments and products in beauty salons as the group is a marketing and sales
organisation where brand perceptions are critical focus will shift to above the line marketing activities

the group will continue to open placecol dreamnails  body and world of beauty outlets in instances where appropriate franchise owners
have been identified to ensure that individual franchised or corporate stores generate more revenue service and retail offerings will be
broadened

appreciation
the directors would like to thank all our stakeholders for their continued support during the year

accounting policies
for the year ended 28 february 2011




1   presentation of annual financial statements
     the annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards and the companies act
     of south africa act no 71 of 2008 as amended and the listing requirements of the jse limited the annual financial statements have
     been prepared on the historical cost basis and except for the measurement of certain financial instruments at fair value and incorporate
     the principal accounting policies listed below

     they are presented in south africa rand

     these accounting policies are consistent with the previous period

     except for the adoption of the new and revised accounting standards the principal accounting policies of the group are consistent with
     those applied in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 february 2010

     adoption of standards and interpretations effective in 2012

     a full list of standards that will become effective in the next financial year are disclosed in note 2

     11     consolidation
             basis of consolidation
             the consolidated annual financial statements incorporate the annual financial statements of the company and all entities
             including special purpose entities which are controlled by the company

             control exists when the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain
             benefits from its activities

             the results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated annual financial statements from the effective date of acquisition to
             the effective date of disposal

             adjustments are made when necessary to the annual financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in
             line with those of the group

             all intragroup transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation

             noncontrolling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified and recognised separately from the groups
             interest therein and are recognised within equity losses of subsidiaries attributable to noncontrolling interests are allocated to
             the noncontrolling interest even if this results in a debit balance being recognised for noncontrolling interest

             transactions which result in changes in ownership levels where the group has control of the subsidiary both before and after
             the transaction are regarded as equity transaction and are recognised directly in the statement of changes in equity

             the difference between the fair value of consideration paid or received and the movement in noncontrolling interest for such
             transactions is recognised in equity attributable to the owners of the parent

             where a subsidiary is disposed of and a noncontrolling shareholding is retained the remaining investment is measured to
             fair value with the adjustment to fair value recognised in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal of the controlling
             interest

             business combinations
             the group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting the cost of the business combination
             is measured as the aggregate of the fair values of assets given liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued
             costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed as incurred except the costs to issue debt which are
             amortised as part of the effective interest and costs to issue equity which are included in equity

             contingent consideration is included in the cost of the combination at fair value as at the date of acquisition subsequent
             changes to the assets liability or equity which arise as a result of the contingent consideration are not affected against goodwill
             unless they are valid measurement period adjustments

             the acquirees identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities which meet the recognition conditions of ifrs 3 business
             combinations are recognised at their fair values at acquisition date except for noncurrent assets or disposal group that are
             classified as heldforsale in accordance with ifrs 5 noncurrent assets heldforsale and discontinued operations which are
             recognised at fair value less costs to sell




                                                                                                                                                     21

     skinwell holdings limited and its subsidiaries



     accounting policies
     continued



                  contingent liabilities are only included in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree where there is a present obligation
                  at acquisition date

                  on acquisition the group assesses the classification of the acquirees assets and liabilities and reclassifies them where the
                  classification is inappropriate for group purposes this excludes lease agreements and insurance contracts whose classification
                  remains as per their inception date

                  noncontrolling interest arising from a business combination is measured either at their share of the fair value of the assets and
                  liabilities of the acquiree or at fair value the treatment is not an accounting policy choice but is selected for each individual
                  business combination and disclosed in the note for business combinations

                  in cases where the group held a noncontrolling shareholding in the acquiree prior to obtaining control that interest is measured
                  to fair value as at acquisition date the measurement to fair value is included in profit or loss for the year where the existing
                  shareholding was classified as an availableforsale financial asset the cumulative fair value adjustments recognised previously
                  to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are recognised in profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment

                  goodwill is determined as the consideration paid plus the fair value of any shareholding held prior to obtaining control plus
                  noncontrolling interest and less the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree

                  goodwill is not amortised but is tested on an annual basis for impairment if goodwill is assessed to be impaired that
                  impairment is not subsequently reversed

         12      significant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty
                  in preparing the annual financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
                  represented in the annual financial statements and related disclosures use of available information and the application of
                  judgement is inherent in the formation of estimates actual results in the future could differ from these estimates which may be
                  material to the annual financial statements significant judgements include

                  trade receivables
                  the group assesses its trade receivables for impairment at the end of each reporting period in determining whether an
                  impairment loss should be recorded in profit or loss the group makes judgements as to whether there is observable data
                  indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a financial asset

                  the impairment for trade receivables is calculated on a portfolio basis based on historical loss ratios adjusted for national
                  and industryspecific economic conditions and other indicators present at the reporting date that correlate with defaults on the
                  portfolio

                  allowance for slow moving damaged and obsolete stock
                  an allowance is made for stock to write stock down to the lower of cost or net realisable value management have made
                  estimates of the selling price and direct cost to sell on certain inventory items

                  impairment testing
                  the recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units and individual assets have been determined based on the higher of value in
                  use calculations and fair values less costs to sell these calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions it is reasonably
                  possible that the assumptions may change which may then impact our estimations and may then require a material adjustment
                  to the carrying value of goodwill and tangible assets

                  the group reviews and tests the carrying value of assets when events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying
                  amount may not be recoverable in addition goodwill is tested on an annual basis for impairment assets are grouped at the
                  lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities if there are
                  indications that impairment may have occurred estimates are prepared of expected future cash flows for each group of assets
                  expected future cash flows used to determine the value in use of goodwill and tangible assets are inherently uncertain and
                  could materially change over time

                  goodwill
                  goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the purchase consideration transferred and the amount of the noncontrolling interest
                  in the acquired value in terms of ifrs 3 over the net of the acquisitiondate amounts of the identified assets acquired and
                  liabilities assumed measured in terms of ifrs 3

    13      property plant and equipment
             the cost of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised as an asset when

              it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and

              the cost of the item can be measured reliably

             property plant and equipment is initially measured at cost

             costs include costs incurred initially to acquire an item of property plant and equipment and costs incurred subsequently to
             add to replace part of or service it if a replacement cost is recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property plant and
             equipment the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised

             land and buildings is carried at revalued amounts being the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent
             accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses

             when an item of property plant and equipment is revalued any accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is
             restated proportionately with the change in the gross carrying amount of the asset so that the carrying amount of the asset after
             revaluation equals its revalued amount

             the revaluation surplus in equity related to a specific item of property plant and equipment is transferred directly to retained
             earnings when the asset is derecognised

             property plant and equipment are depreciated on the straight line basis over their expected useful lives to their estimated
             residual value

             property plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses

             the useful lives of items of property plant and equipment have been assessed as follows

             item                                      average useful life

             buildings                                             60 years
             plant and machinery                                    5 years
             furniture and fixtures                                 6 years
             motor vehicles                                         5 years
             office equipment                                       6 years
             it equipment                                           3 years
             computer software                                      3 years
             leasehold improvements                                10 years
             laser equipment                                        5 years
             promotional equipment                                  4 years

             the residual value useful life and depreciation method of each asset are reviewed at the end of each reporting period if the
             expectations differ from previous estimates the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate

             the depreciation charge for each period is recognised in profit or loss unless it is included in the carrying amount of another
             asset

             the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is included in profit or loss when the
             item is derecognised the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is determined
             as the difference between the net disposal proceeds if any and the carrying amount of the item

    14 	intangible assets
          an intangible asset is recognised when

              it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and

                  expenditure on research or on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense when it is incurred

                  an intangible asset arising from development or from the development phase of an internal project is recognised when

                   it is technically feasible to complete the asset so that it will be available for use or sale

                   there is an intention to complete and use or sell it

                   there is an ability to use or sell it

                   it will generate probable future economic benefits

                   there are available technical financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset

                   the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably

                  intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses

                  an intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when based on all relevant factors there is no foreseeable limit
                  to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows amortisation is not provided for these intangible
                  assets but they are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired for all
                  other intangible assets amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over their useful life

                  the amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed every periodend

                  reassessing the useful life of an intangible asset with a finite useful life after it was classified as indefinite is an indicator that
                  the asset may be impaired as a result the asset is tested for impairment and the remaining carrying amount is amortised over
                  its useful life

                  internally generated brands mastheads publishing titles customer lists and items similar in substance are not recognised as
                  intangible assets

             classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were obtained  incurred and takes place at initial
             recognition

             initial recognition and measurement
             financial instruments are recognised initially when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments

             the group classifies financial instruments or their component parts on initial recognition as a financial asset a financial liability
             or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement

             financial instruments are measured initially at fair value except for equity investments for which a fair value is not determinable
             which are measured at cost and are classified as availableforsale financial assets

             for financial instruments which are not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs are included in the initial
             measurement of the instrument

             transaction costs on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss

             regular way purchases of financial assets are accounted for at trade date

             impairment of financial assets
             at each reporting date the group assesses all financial assets other than those at fair value through profit or loss to determine
             whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets has been impaired

             for amounts due to the group significant financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy
             and default of payments are all considered indicators of impairment

             in the case of equity securities classified as availableforsale a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security
             below its cost is considered an indicator of impairment if any such evidence exists for availableforsale financial assets the
             cumulative loss  measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value less any impairment loss on
             that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss  is removed from equity as a reclassification adjustment to other
             comprehensive income and recognised in profit or loss

             impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss

             impairment losses are reversed when an increase in the financial assets recoverable amount can be related objectively to an
             event occurring after the impairment was recognised subject to the restriction that the carrying amount of the financial asset
             at the date that the impairment is reversed shall not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment
             not been recognised

             reversals of impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss except for equity investments classified as availableforsale

             impairment losses are also not subsequently reversed for availableforsale equity investments which are held at cost because
             fair value was not determinable

             where financial assets are impaired through use of an allowance account the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or
             loss within operating expenses when such assets are written off the write off is made against the relevant allowance account
             subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses

             loans to from group companies
             these include loans to and from holding companies fellow subsidiaries subsidiaries joint ventures and associates and are
             recognised initially at fair value plus direct transaction costs

             loans to group companies are classified as loans and receivables measured at amortised cost

             loans from group companies are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

             loans to shareholders directors managers and employees
             these are loans classified as loans and receivables and are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are
             subsequently carried at amortised cost less any accumulated impairment

             these financial assets are not quoted in an active market and have fixed or determinable payments




                                                                                                                                                        25

                  trade and other receivables
                  trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
                  effective interest rate method appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when
                  there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired significant financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the debtor
                  will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the
                  trade receivable is impaired the allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and
                  the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition

                  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised
                  in profit or loss within operating expenses when a trade receivable is uncollectable it is written off against the allowance
                  account for trade receivables subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses
                  in profit or loss

                  trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables

                  trade and other payables
                  trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
                  rate method

                  cash and cash equivalents
                  cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other shortterm highly liquid investments that
                  are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value these are initially
                  and subsequently recorded at fair value

                  bank overdraft and borrowings
                  bank overdrafts and borrowings are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
                  effective interest rate method any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of
                  borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the groups accounting policy for borrowing costs

                  other financial liabilities
                  other financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
                  method

         17 	tax
               current tax assets and liabilities
               current tax for current and prior periods is to the extent unpaid recognised as a liability if the amount already paid in respect
               of current and prior periods exceeds the amount due for those periods the excess is recognised as an asset

                  current tax liabilitiesassets for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid torecovered
                  from the tax authorities using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
                  reporting period

                  deferred tax assets and liabilities
                  a deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences except to the extent that the deferred tax liability
                  arises from

                   the initial recognition of goodwill or

                   the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which

                      is not a business combination and

                      at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profittax loss

                  a deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries branches
                  and associates and interests in joint ventures except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied

                   the parent investor or venturer is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and

                   it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future

             a deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit
             will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised unless the deferred tax asset arises from the
             initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that

              is not a business combination and

              at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profittax loss

             a deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries branches and
             associates and interests in joint ventures to the extent that it is probable that

              the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and

              taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised

             a deferred tax asset is recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
             profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised the directors assessed that the assessed tax losses
             will be recovered with future profitability forecasts

             deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised
             or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
             reporting period

             tax expenses
             current and deferred taxes are recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the period except to the
             extent that the tax arises from

              a transaction or event which is recognised in the same or a different period to other comprehensive income or

              a business combination

             current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited to other comprehensive income if the tax relates to items that are credited
             or charged in the same or a different period to other comprehensive income

             current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited directly to equity if the tax relates to items that are credited or charged
             in the same or a different period directly in equity

    18 	leases
          a lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership a lease is
          classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership

             finance leases  lessee
             finance leases are recognised as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at amounts equal to the fair value
             of the leased property or if lower the present value of the minimum lease payments the corresponding liability to the lessor is
             included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation

             the discount rate used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease

             the lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the outstanding liability the finance charge is
             allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate on the remaining balance of the liability

             operating leases  lessee
             operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term the difference between
             the amounts recognised as an expense and the contractual payments are recognised as an operating lease asset this liability
             is not discounted

             any contingent rents are expensed in the period they are incurred

    19 	inventories
          inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value

             net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and
             the estimated costs necessary to make the sale




                                                                                                                                                     27

                  the cost of inventories comprises of all costs of purchase costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories
                  to their present location and condition

                  the cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and goods or services produced and segregated for
                  specific projects is assigned using specific identification of the individual costs

                  the cost of inventories is assigned using the weighted average cost formula the same cost formula is used for all inventories
                  having a similar nature and use to the entity

                  when inventories are sold the carrying amount of those inventories are recognised as an expense in the period in which the
                  related revenue is recognised the amount of any writedown of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories
                  are recognised as an expense in the period the writedown or loss occurs the amount of any reversal of any writedown
                  of inventories arising from an increase in net realisable value are recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories
                  recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs

         110 	impairment of assets
                the group assesses at each end of the reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired if any
                such indication exists the group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset

                  irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment the group also

                   tests intangible assets with an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not yet available for use for impairment annually by
                    comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount this impairment test is performed during the annual period and
                    at the same time every period

                   tests goodwill acquired in a business combination for impairment annually

                  if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired the recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset if it is not
                  possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which
                  the asset belongs is determined

                  the recoverable amount of an asset or a cashgenerating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use

                  if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its
                  recoverable amount that reduction is an impairment loss

                  an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation is recognised immediately in
                  profit or loss any impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation decrease

                  goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the cashgenerating units or
                  groups of cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination

                  an impairment loss is recognised for cashgenerating units if the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount
                  of the units the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit in the following order

                   first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating unit and

                   then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit

                  an entity assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for
                  assets other than goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased if any such indication exists the recoverable amounts
                  of those assets are estimated

                  the increased carrying amount of an asset other than goodwill attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss does not exceed
                  the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods

                  a reversal of an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation other than goodwill
                  is recognised immediately in profit or loss any reversal of an impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation
                  increase

             shortterm employee benefits
             the cost of shortterm employee benefits those payable within 12 months after the service is rendered such as paid vacation
             leave and sick leave bonuses and nonmonetary benefits such as medical care are recognised in the period in which the
             service is rendered and are not discounted

             the expected cost of compensated absences is recognised as an expense as the employees render services that increase their
             entitlement or in the case of nonaccumulating absences when the absence occurs

             the expected cost of profit sharing and bonus payments is recognised as an expense when there is a legal or constructive
             obligation to make such payments as a result of past performance

    113     provisions and contingencies
             provisions are recognised when

              the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event

              it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and

              a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation

             the amount of a provision is the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation future
             expenditure is discounted at the pretax discount rate reflecting the market assessment of the time value of money adjusted for
             risks associated with the obligation

             where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party the
             reimbursement shall be recognised when and only when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity
             settles the obligation the reimbursement shall be treated as a separate asset the amount recognised for the reimbursement
             shall not exceed the amount of the provision

             provisions are not recognised for future operating losses

             if an entity has a contract that is onerous the present obligation under the contract shall be recognised and measured as a
             provision

             after their initial recognition contingent liabilities recognised in business combinations that are recognised separately are
             subsequently measured at the higher of

              the amount that would be recognised as a provision and

              the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation

             contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised contingencies are disclosed in note 29

    114     revenue
             revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied

              the group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods

                   the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably

                  revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for
                  goods and services provided in the normal course of business net of trade discounts and volume rebates and value added tax

                  interest is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method

                  royalties are recognised on the accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements

                  dividends are recognised in profit or loss when the companys right to receive payment has been established

                  service fees included in the price of the product are recognised as revenue over the period during which the service is performed

         115     cost of sales
                  when inventories are sold the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the period in which the
                  related revenue is recognised the amount of any writedown of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories
                  are recognised as an expense in the period the writedown or loss occurs the amount of any reversal of any writedown of
                  inventories arising from an increase in net realisable value is recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised
                  as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs

                  the related cost of providing services recognised as revenue in the current period is included in cost of sales

         116     borrowing costs
                  borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised
                  as part of the cost of that asset until such time as the asset is ready for its intended use the amount of borrowing costs eligible
                  for capitalisation is determined as follows

                   actual borrowing costs on funds specifically borrowed for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset less any temporary
                    investment of those borrowings

                   weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the entity on funds generally borrowed for the purpose of obtaining
                    a qualifying asset the borrowing costs capitalised do not exceed the total borrowing costs incurred

                  the capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when

                   expenditures for the asset have occurred

                   borrowing costs have been incurred and

                  		activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress

                  capitalisation is suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted

                  capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale
                  are complete

                  borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred

   21    standards and interpretations effective and adopted in the current year
          in the current year the group has adopted the following standards and interpretations that are effective for the current financial
          year and that are relevant to its operations

             ifrs 3 revised business combinations
             the revisions to ifrs 3 business combinations require

              acquisition costs to be expensed

              noncontrolling interest to either be calculated at fair value or at their proportionate share of the net identifiable assets of
               the acquiree

              contingent consideration to be included in the cost of the business combination without further adjustment to goodwill
               apart from measurement period adjustments

              all previous interests in the acquiree to be remeasured to fair value at acquisition date when control is achieved in stages
               and for the fair value adjustments to be recognised in profit or loss

              goodwill to be measured as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of consideration paid noncontrolling
               interest and fair value of previous shareholding and the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree

              the acquirer to reassess at acquisition date the classification of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree except for leases
               and insurance contracts

              contingent liabilities of the acquiree to only be included in the net identifiable assets when there is a present obligation with
               respect to the contingent liability

             the effective date of the standard is for years beginning on or after 01 july 2009

             the group has adopted the standard for the first time in the 2011 annual financial statements

             ias 27 amended consolidated and separate financial statements
             the revisions require

              losses of the subsidiary to be allocated to noncontrolling interest even if they result in the noncontrolling interest being a
               debit balance

              changes in level of control without loss of control to be accounted for as equity transactions without any gain or loss being
               recognised or any remeasurement of goodwill

              when there is a change in the level of control without losing control the group is prohibited from making reclassification
               adjustments

              when control is lost the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary as well as noncontrolling interest and goodwill are to be
               derecognised any remaining investment is remeasured to fair value at the date on which control is lost and a gain or loss
               on loss of control is recognised in profit or loss

                  the amendment is as a result of amendments to ias 27 consolidate and separate financial statements the amendment refers
                  to situations where a subsidiary on acquisition date did not recognise a deferred tax asset in relation to deductible temporary
                  differences because for example there may not have been sufficient future taxable profits against which to utilise the
                  deductible temporary differences if the deferred tax asset subsequently becomes recognisable the amendment now requires
                  that the deferred tax asset should be recognised against goodwill and profit or loss to the extent that it exceeds goodwill only
                  if it results from information in the measurement period about circumstances that existed at acquisition date no adjustment
                  may be made to goodwill for information outside of the measurement period

             this new standard is the first phase of a three phase project to replace ias 39 financial instruments recognition and
             measurement phase one deals with the classification and measurement of financial assets the following are changes from the
             classification and measurement rules of ias 39

              financial assets will be categorised as those subsequently measured at fair value or at amortised cost

              financial assets at amortised cost are those financial assets where the business model for managing the assets is to hold the
               assets to collect contractual cash flows where the contractual cash flows represent payments of principal and interest only
               all other financial assets are to be subsequently measured at fair value

              under certain circumstances financial assets may be designated as at fair value

              for hybrid contracts where the host contract is within the scope of ifrs 9 then the whole instrument is classified in

    at present the group does expect to pay all liabilities at their contractual maturity in order to meet such cash commitments the company
    expects the operating activity to generate sufficient cash inflows in addition the company holds financial assets for which there is a
    liquid market and that are readily available to meet liquidity needs

    interest rate risk
    financial assets and liabilities that are sensitive to interest rate risk are cash and cash equivalents bank overdrafts loans receivable and
    payable the interest applicable to these financial instruments are on a floating basis in line with those currently available in the market

    the groups sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase in variable rate debt
    instruments and the increase in interest rates

    the analysis has been performed for floating interest rate financial liabilities and cash the impact of a change in interest rates on floating
    interest rate financial liabilities has been assessed in terms of changing of their cash flows and therefore in terms of the impact on net
    expenses

    the group does not have any fair value sensitivity in respect of fixed rate instruments as at reporting date
