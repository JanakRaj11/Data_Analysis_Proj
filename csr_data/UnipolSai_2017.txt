human rights
the unipol group has not currently evaluated the risk of violating human rights as significant either within its organisational units
or with direct suppliers operating primarily in italy and making recourse to italian suppliers for 97 of its supplies with lowrisk
product types therefore the commitment made in the code and then outlined in the csr policy was deemed sufficient in this
regard
indeed the nature and geographical location of the companys business do not give rise to particular critical issues along the
supply chain moreover also to ensure supplier relationship oversight unipolsai is developing a model for the reduction of
environmental social and governance esg risks along the entire supply chain in accordance with its 20162018 plan objectives

                                                                                                                                               10

and the fundamental standards of the international labour organisation ilo the reference to the declaration and the ilo
standards which relate to fundamental freedoms as well as other issues such as child labour discrimination and working
conditions is included in the responsible investment supplier selection and human resource management policies within this
context unipolsai promotes specific policies to protect and support individual and family requirements with no discrimination
based on gender sexual orientation or political cultural and religious beliefs
in particular the topic of human rights is also dealt with in the code of ethics of the unipol group which in the version updated at
the end of 2015 reinforced its reference to human rights gender equality transparency and integrity versus international
principles of ethics and the fight against corruption and describes the role and behaviours of directors in greater detail the code

retaliation to obtain clarifications andor interpretations concerning the best models of conduct to avoid violations or breaches

profitability of the groups activities
in 2016 the unipolsai group achieved satisfactory results in line with the new business plan objectives within a complex
macroeconomic and sector situation characterised by persisting low interest rates high volatility in the financial markets and
strong competitive pressures particularly in the mv insurance segment in which the group is the market leader

during the period in question direct insurance premiums gross of reinsurance were equal to 12497m 13982m in 2015 106
direct premiums in the nonlife business came to 7218m 16 compared to 7334m in 2015 impacted by the effects of
continuous competitive pressure on mv tpl rates

in the life business the volume of direct premiums amounted to 5279m with a 206 decline when compared with the same
period of 2015 the slowdown in business regarded primarily the bancassurance channel and can also be ascribed to the
commercial policy adopted by the group meant to limit traditional policy business by focusing the offer more on class iii or multi
segment products new business in terms of ape net of noncontrolling interests amounted to 547m

the profitability of the financial investments portfolio produced a significant return in the period in question equal to 37 of
invested assets a return which takes into account the writedown on the investment in the atlante 1 fund in the amount of 195m
equal to 24 of the investment during the year the policy to gradually reduce the share of domestic government bonds

investment policies
the investment policies implemented by the group adhered in terms of longterm investments to the general criteria of
prudence and of preserving asset quality through a process of selecting issuers based on their strength and
diversification in line with the investment policy
the policy was updated in 2016 to incorporate provisions on investments and assets covering technical provisions
introduced by the most recent ivass regulation which adopts the guidelines issued by eiopa on the corporate
governance system with particular reference to the prudent person principle laid out in solvency ii pertaining to
investments



responsible investments
in order to verify the compliance of investments with the values expressed by the group a policy with exclusion criteria
was defined which calls for independent quarterly sustainability monitoring 4 as of 2012 but adopted in practice over time
to further strengthen this monitoring starting this year the group pledged to comply with the principles for responsible
investment pri 5

sustainability monitoring analyses investments in listed and unlisted financial instruments excluding investment trusts
unit trusts set up and managed by sgr openended investment companies including investments in assets held as a
hedge against technical provisions including investments relating to supplementary pension schemes and unitlinked
and indexlinked investments managed directly by unipolsai

the exclusion criteria at the basis of the sustainability monitoring are supplemented by the assessment of the level of
compliance with the esg principles of each issuer expressed by means of a rating which identifies its minimum
acceptable standard according to the methodology described in the document proprietary portfolio black list rules

the exclusion criteria at the basis of sustainability monitoring consider in the case of countries the study of a series of
indicators which demonstrate an insufficient degree of compliance with the principles defined by the united nations in
                           6

in drawing up its investment policy unipolsai also focussed greatly on the issue of speculation on the agricultural
commodities market soft commodities and chose not to invest either directly or indirectly as the manager of its
customers assets in that market likewise in the area of investment property unipolsai has never invested in the
purchase or sale of land adopting a precautionary approach to protect the rights of the weakest members of society with
regard to the phenomenon of land grabbing or the largescale coercive hoarding of unused land which is sold or rented
to third parties companies or governments of other countries without the consent of the communities that live there or
cultivate that land for food to verify the maintenance of this commitment a dedicated coding and monitoring activity will
be launched in 2017

sustainable and responsible investments or sri in this regard unipolsai invests in alternative funds a category that
includes private equity funds hedge funds and investments in real assets which are also relevant for sri purposes

for the selection and reporting of investments in this area methodological due diligence was conducted which alongside
the usual financial analyses calls for an analysis of socialenvironmental and governance esg criteria which are
continuously revised and updated and the mapping of nonfinancial risks which could have an impact reputational
regarding the carbon footprint etc currently the methodology for the selection of investments in real assets which are
also relevant for sri purposes is applied to all evaluation analyses in 2016 the total value of these investments
amounted to approximately 148m

in the field of the green economy investments were made primarily in alternative energies also selecting important
sustainable mobility initiatives in this regard the investment in funds for the acquisition of existing forests is significant
which generate income based on the annual cutting of trees but which are constantly replanted to maintain the value of
the asset at the end of the duration of the fund the incomegenerating forests are also more controlled and managed
than virgin forests and therefore they are less subject to fires and disease

in welfare we maintained our investment in residential care services
we also boosted investments in the area of infrastructure for digital innovation particularly fibre for highspeed
connections also dedicated to introducing networks into rural areas triggering social benefits for local communities
there is also a fund which applies the sustainable investment strategies defined by eurosif 7 of integration 8 and soft
engagement 9

number of employees by age brackets




it should be noted that in 2016 just two years after the merger a single supplemental corporate agreement cia was
defined the approval of which was subject to consultation by means of employee vote which made it possible to unify the
regulatory economic and support conditions for all of the groups insurance area employees the compensation packages
unified and harmonised by the new group cia led to an increase in costs of approximately 242m when fully
implemented 15 growth compared to the current supplementary compensation packages

once the insurance restructuring process was completed other critical situations were also managed in agreement with
the union the mobility procedure pursuant to law 2231991 was activated for 110 employees following the placement
into liquidation of centro oncologico fiorentino with the relative dismissal of the companys entire staff for whom public
sector solutions and specific incentives were activated and for 135 employees of atahotel following the termination of
hospitality activities at the properties owned by enpam which were returned when the lease agreements expired
this model of union relations based on the principles of transparency interaction and dialogue which are implemented
through structured formal processes led to the use during the contractual renewal phase in 2016 of 31991 hours of
strikes and 192341 hours of union leave as well as the organisation of 56 union meetings for a total of 18190 hours

all employees are covered by the sector collective agreements while 59 are union members with reference to the

instruments are adopted to enhance individual capabilities and favour professional employee growth by cultivating their

degree of professionalism and individual skillset in compliance with legal and regulatory provisions and consistent with
sustainable performance requirements the key principles for determining remuneration are also internal fairness
meritocracy and comparison with the reference markets

the selffunding requirement and as a result the indicators used are based on company results as well as those specific
to the individuals professional area so as to guarantee sustainable performance over time

responsibility in which indicators connected to sustainable governance capacities are particularly relevant

any type of variable compensation or the top management on the board of directors who are all men the group figures
show a salary differential to the advantage of women among call centre personnel and seasonal personnel due to the
responsibilities they currently have at present vice versa for the other job categories the median salary of women is
lower than that of men

unipolsai offers a complete range of insurance products and solutions geared to the needs and characteristics of the
large companies the presence of socalled large customers was particularly important associated with the world of
cooperation and mediumlarge manufacturing businesses reached primarily through brokers

one characteristic of the relationship with the corporate world is the development courses aimed especially at smes
which receive support from risk management specialists in their internationalisation processes and with the expansion of
direct repair services supplemented by assistance services the measures implemented to boost the productivity and
competitiveness of business customers leverage group excellence the specialisation of the agent network and process
innovation these measures along with the strengthening of coverage for production risks and financing for innovation
and growth aim to improve policyholder services and reduce the impact of losses indeed to deal with an interruption in
production activities unipolsai and its specialised partners have launched a service for business customers particularly
smes which entails prevention activities based on the definition of disaster recovery plans and highly specialised
support services post claim such as emergency intervention and rescue actions which reduce recovery times to a
minimum the commitment to supporting the adoption of risk reduction behaviours at individual and company level is a
fundamental lever to boost production system resilience this is why in 2015 unipolsai launched a european project
entitled life derris  disaster risk reduction insurance to try out an innovative multistakeholder collaboration model
that involves the public administration insurance companies the world of research and businesses to reduce the risks
caused by extraordinary weather events
the derris project in which the unipol group plays a leading role along with its partners the city of turin cineas anci
coordinamento agende 21 and unipolsai calls for the implementation of a series of actions to transfer risk evaluation
and management skills as well as knowledge about tools and steps to take to reduce vulnerabilities and as a result
damages for individual businesses
in september 2016 the pilot test phase was launched in the municipality of turin with the involvement of 30 small
businesses in a course that includes 20 hours of training as well as technical support through two inspections at each
company to evaluate and reduce weatherclimate risk exposure during the pilot phase it was also possible to test the
risk selfevaluation tool cram tool designed in the first phase of the project which using georeferencing analyses the
level of danger of the area where the company is located with reference to the 7 dangers of the derris project flood
precipitation wind lightning hail temperature  heat and cold waves  and landslides and provides the company with
information on its risk and resilience index based on a series of questions based on the replies provided by the company
the tool makes several suggestions selected from amongst the 70 suggestions contained in the tool regarding the
actions to be implemented to mitigate or manage the risk the pilot test phase under way in turin aims to guide turin
based companies in preparing an action plan by the end of march 2017 before extending the project to another 10 cities
and 200 smes located throughout the country which will in turn be engaged in a process for the adoption of business
adaptation plans

at the end of 2016 the groups companies portfolio corporate and smes counted over 900 thousand customers equal
to 9 of the total of which roughly 96 in italy

outside italy unipolsai also operates in serbia the subsidiary ddor novi sad represents the second operator in the
serbian market with a portfolio of more than 230 thousand customers to which it provides nonlife and life services and
products




                                                                                                                              29

the range of products
considering current trends and new emerging risks unipolsai is moving along two paths the application of telematics
and big data analysis on one hand and direct and integrated governance of service processes contiguous with the core
business on the other
in this first regard the company boasts a significant position with 3m devices installed in italy also thanks to the ongoing
launch of new products that use telematics such as the trials with business policies and the agribox applied on
agricultural machines
with regard to the integration of processes and services contiguous with the core business unipolsai stands out due to
its inhousing of support emergency response maintenance and direct damage repair supporting its customers by
providing solutions not only compensation for the damages suffered as a result the following play a decisive role
           finitalia for payment by monthly instalments with no additional costs
           auto prestobene and apb car service constituting a network of more than 2700 repair shops present
            throughout the country to offer mv policyholders certified repairs with no cash advance
           myglass which provides repair and glass replacement services through 187 glassfitting centres
           the network of craftsmen distributed throughout the country for direct repair anywhere in italy
at the end of 2016 298 of the claims managed were channelled to repair centres belonging to the auto prestobene
network reducing the average repair cost by 29 in the case of myglass 65 of claims are channelled to its network
resulting in an average financial benefit for the company of 14

the service provided helps to consolidate customer relationships as demonstrated by the 855 retention rate of
customers that acquire policies with integrated services provided by the apb network against the mv tpl average of
812

another distinctive element of the unipolsai offer is its longlasting commitment to responding to a changing society by
meeting new environmental or social requirements in particular unipolsais leadership position in the nonlife and
pension funds segments is in and of itself an important response to the increasingly significant welfare and security
needs arising in the communities in which the company carries on business

corresponding product families

additional costs this service is important to maintain and strengthen relationships with customers as seen by our higher
retention rate 878 for those who use it compared to the unipolsai average which amounts to 869 for mv tpl
policies upon expiry and is higher than the market average 83

in the life protection business the products with a particularly high social value

report dedicated to current and potential subscribers for years now which adheres to the model of the european sri
transparency code issued by eurosif  european sustainable investment forum likewise the percentage of
investments for the individual pension schemes and the personal pension plans currently under management that satisfy
the esg criteria was published in the obligatory documents required under the covip regulation calculated for each
individual pension scheme and personal pension plan

and for individual multisegment 988 while the individual pension schemes reached 994

in the life business with a view to simplifying the acquisition of products by customers while reducing mismatch risk
the life product certification procedure continued alongside a significant streamlining of the life product price list to
ensure reliability and reduce the structural informational asymmetry existing between customers and the insurance
company this certification calls for the verification by bureau veritas  a company specialised in control compliance
audit and quality certification services  of unipolsais compliance with product specifications in accordance with the
values of transparency full understandable and trackable information fairness clear and balanced cost and product
value protection of capital and investments selected the certification body checked compliance with these values by
monitoring requisites and indicators running along the entire process ranging from identification of needs to aftersales
management thanks to transparent and fully tracked organisational practices the relevant aspects are on one hand
respect for the balance between meeting the interests of the final customer the company and the community and on the
other the search for simple and transparent communication to enable customers to make informed choices currently
the unipolsai life product range concerned by this certification is the investment line including class iii products
during 2017 the products from the savings line will also be audited in accordance with the threeyear sustainability plan

with respect to the opportunity arising from financial inclusion and the expansion of access to financial services to
disadvantaged segments of our society aside from the initiatives already mentioned in the life segment unipolsai is
developing microinsurance products and innovative sales and accumulation models for the base of the pyramid and is
also conducting detailed analyses concerning the potential and specific needs of the nonprofit sector to support its
growth as well
alongside these initiatives present in the 20162018 threeyear sustainability plan is the local welfare action also to
be implemented during the plan period and aiming to develop policyholder aggregation solutions to extend healthcare
and welfare coverage outside the world of work




                                                                                                                               31

                                                                              unipolsai assicurazioni 2016 sustainability report




claims handling
claims handling is a critical step in which the customer interfaces with the company and assesses its fairness efficiency
and quality this is why unipolsai has maintained and strengthened its commitment to improving the excellence of its
operating mechanism through settlement structure specialisation and investment in electronic settlements

in particular on the claims settlement efficiency front significant initiatives are being carried out in three main areas
         an organisational restructuring which led to the specialisation of the settlement structures while maintaining
          a widespread geographical presence in the community the unipolsai group has decided to sign partnership
          agreements with adjusters physicians and claims handlers the network of approved representatives consists
          of 1213 adjusters 429 medical experts and 1290 lawyers in italy and abroad
         the evolution of settlement processes integrated with telematics as a tool to guarantee increasing speed
          of execution and capacity to combat fraud in the case of vehicle black boxes the effectiveness guaranteed by
          the use of online data during settlements is greater in areas which historically have more claims where the
          vehicle black box has been used due to expected improvements in risk assessments and as a result is more
          widespread indeed in the centresouth 48 of claims allow for the use of data from telematics and
          settlement process speed has improved by 28 compared to claims with personal injury not supported by
          telematics with an average cost for the company of less than 377 also with a view to combating fraud an
          innovative antifraud engine has been developed which selects the sample of potentially fraudulent claims to be
          channelled to the dedicated settlement structure
         the new claims management system which continues to evolve so as to allow for an increasingly direct
          relationship with customers and enable important process innovations from antifraud engines to proprietary
          portals for trustee management



antifraud measures
unipolsai strengthened its commitment to pursue fraud and other criminal behaviour by preventing and combating fraud
in order to protect not only the interests of the company to reduce costs arising from undue settlements and the
insurance market but also those of the customer and consequently of society as a whole to avoid speculation which may
impact rates in addition in 2016 significant new legislation impacted criminallaw initiatives to a considerable extent
especially in the underwriting phase the abrogation of the crime of falsification of private agreements legislative
decree no 7 of 15 january 2016 this abrogation resulted in a further concentration of antifraud activities on the
identification of cases of fraud for which document falsification and alterations constitute instrumental aspects and not
the primary objective of the conduct
activities for preventing and combating fraud are broken down over two levels
          the special claims area function which centralises the management and settlement of claims at risk of fraud
           of all types with the exception of the transport assistance bonds legal expenses and health segments
           operating for all companies except ddor novi sad and reporting to the fraud function where necessary the
           claims subject to indepth examination in 2016 this function received a total of 20395 reports 67 were
           reports from the network of suspicious claims which resulted in 12162 challenges
          the antifraud function which carries out further investigations also aimed at possible criminallaw initiatives
           and deals  if applicable  with complaintrelated activities also managing the criminal proceedings and handling
           relations with the police authorities in 2016 the unipolsai assicurazioni spa antifraud function managed a
           total of 5623 reports of fraud associated in part with the underwriting of policies entered into fraudulently and
           in part with falsified documents and reports relating to claims at risk of fraud
in response to these reports the function identified 1505 deserving of investigation for the necessary assessments and
filed 412 complaints while the total cases under management irrespective of the year in which they were opened
amounts to roughly 10000

in the unipolsai groups life bancassurance segment there are two types of control the first is conducted by the
management offices on the operations of individual adjusters the second consists of widespread control over all
documentation provided to the company by the branches for transactions requiring management authorisation




                                                                                                                                 32

                                                                              unipolsai assicurazioni 2016 sustainability report




customer relations
our focus on the customer takes the form of a digital strategy meant to simplify customers decisionmaking processes
through all channels and devices as well as the digitalisation and streamlining of sales and administrative processes in the
agency in terms of customer experience to foster direct contact between the company and customers the unipolsai
business model has begun to shift towards a multichannel structure by means of a gradual process that will make all
customer services fully accessible from remote and mobile channels while maintaining the presence and advisory skills
of the agency network as a central element through a multichannel model supported by professional agents a series of
personalisable online services have been activated which seek to facilitate and simplify the customers decisionmaking
process also with a view to comprehensibility transparency fairness and accessibility in communications between
unipolsai and its customers information tools  newsletters and blogs on specific topics based on the company  have
been improved upon and the service has been updated resulting in a 12 increase in unipolsai home insurance apps
have also had good productivity with a considerable increase in downloads by customers in the last year 142 these
initiatives join those already launched on process simplification digitalisation and integration between the agency and
the company described in the agents and agencies section



complaint management
unipolsai aims to avoid as much as possible recourse to the judicial authorities if disputes arise with customers the
approach to dispute management is based in fact on safeguarding the customers interest preferring to strive for out
ofcourt solutions also in order to avoid where possible with respect to the prevalently costgenerating nature of this
type of dispute costly lengthening of dispute management times and of related costs charged to customers recourse to
judicial proceedings mainly occurs in the event of a clear attempt to speculate of excessive andor unjustified demands
for compensation and other fraudulent conduct
therefore the function that receives complaints and provides specialised support to customers is very important not
only to avoid or reduce the occurrence of sanctionable cases but especially to ensure that customers feel that their rights
are protected supporting the reputation of a knowledgeable and efficient company customers are invited to resolve the
dispute first of all by speaking with the agent the closest player to him or her

in this regard during the year the unipol gruppo finanziario spa board of directors updated and approved the
complaints management policy to incorporate the provisions of ivass measure no 46 of 3 may 2016 which introduced
new requirements on the management of complaints relating to the conduct of insurance intermediaries the complaints
management policy defines guidelines for the proper timely management of complaints relating to the conduct of the
unipol groups insurance companies as well as the agents and direct brokers on which the former rely for brokerage
activities inspired by the principles of fair treatment of policyholders insured parties beneficiaries and injured parties

in the course of 2016 complaints addressed only to unipolsai declined by 13 compared to the previous year 2348
fewer cases nonlife complaints marked a downturn of 15 while life complaints rose by 17 although the initial
figure was not particularly relevant
the breakdown of complaints by area shows that the decrease was concentrated above all in the claims and industrial
areas however the percentage breakdown reflects the results from 2015 indeed roughly 79 of complaints related to
claims while the remainder were linked primarily to technicalunderwriting industrial area and commercial type issues
lastly again with reference only to the company unipolsai there has been a constant reduction over the years in average
days for responding to complaints which reached 234 in 2016 and the percentage of complaints out of all claims
reported came to 071




                                                                                                                                 33

                                                                           unipolsai assicurazioni 2016 sustainability report




complaint management and division of complaints by area




the charts regarding complaint management and the breakdown by area include all unipolsai group companies but do
not include complaints for the company ddor novi sad 2580 in 2016 since the divisions established by ivass are not
applicable
requests for information and assistance to customers translated into 255k contacts concentrated primarily in the
technical commercial and claims areas all information collected by the assistance services of the group companies is
catalogued and used to improve the quality of the servicesproducts provided according to a specific structured process
for each entity

the model of direct governance and integration with service processes contiguous with the core business is reflected in
the results of the customer satisfaction and loyalty surveys amongst the elements that were most appreciated is
recourse to telematics for settlements making the process more objective and reliable while also speeding up timing and
therefore reducing any inconvenient delays




                                                                                                                            34

                                                                                                               unipolsai assicurazioni 2016 sustainability report




customer satisfaction csi measured with respect to the relationship with unipolsai is better than the market average
in the individuals segment and is quite considerable especially in relations with smes 14 the results measured for
unipolsai mv customers are also good leading the company to be recognised as the best company of the year 15
unipolsai customers have had high levels of satisfaction overall unipolsai csi 979 in the relations 99 and service
97 areas the high levels of overall satisfaction in the various segments confirm the increasing trend seen in recent
years
the most significant factor in the companys mv tpl churn rate is the financial component although unipolsai
customers have demonstrated their appreciation for and positive assessment of the breadth of products and accessory
services offered customers also recognise that the agents are competent available to offer insurance support on a
continuous basis and clear and accurate in the responses provided formulating an opinion that is positive on the whole
regarding these relationships

against the significant investments made in service digitalisation and the development of innovation customers
recognise the speed and fairness of settlements the professionalism and skill of the adjusters and the ease of
relationships with agents andor claims handlers as the points of excellence of the company unipolsai
in addition the net promoter score which indicates how highly unipolsai would be recommended came to 112 in 2016
which is positive overall although the companys share of detractors was higher than the market standard penalising its
total                                                                                                             score

controlled mechanism for the underwriting derogation process and implementing tools to boost the efficiency of the
work of underwriters and the network industrialising the assistance model and processes and tools for quantitative and
qualitative monitoring of the management of network requests and streamlining content and methods for
communication with the network

with a view to establishing partnerships and longterm relationships that take shape in the supplier portal where aside from
highlighting economic and financial capacities and technicalorganisational characteristics the approval process also provides
information to guarantee regulatorylegal compliance this translates into commitments by the same suppliers to fight against all
forms of discrimination comply with anticorruption measures occupational safety regulations current laws and national labour
agreements and ensure to the group that they have enacted the necessary protections which govern the assignment of activities
to external individualsbusinesses

in addition to the information ensuring legal regulatory conformity financial solvency and qualitative performance the approval
process therefore requires suppliers to provide information relating to their conformity with the legality rating and commitment
to sustainability illustrating the extent to which they take account of and observe social and environmental aspects this
information is associated with the possession of environmental certifications the measurement of polluting emissions the use of
nondiscriminatory company policies the promotion of diversity the cultivation of worklife balance and the management of
worker health and safety in order to enhance the sustainability policies they have already adopted all of these aspect contribute
to giving a rating score that approves the supplier on the whole

chain moreover also to ensure supplier relationship oversight unipolsai is developing a model for the reduction of
environmental social and governance esg risks along the entire supply chain in accordance with its 20162018 plan objectives

breakdown of suppliers




in line with the partnership approach described above during the year unipolsai took concrete steps in collaboration with its
suppliers to reduce indirect impacts ie those which derive from activities connected and functional to the core business but
which are out of the companys control by testing a system for the online resale of assets recovered from insured events
unipolsai gave life to an asset recycling process that reduces costs and improves profit margins there are several advantages
for the company a net limitation of claim costs as the indirect costs of settlement to the insured decline and a decrease in timing
for settlement and collaboration with the adjuster in accounting for property for the insured the possibility of benefitting from
reduced business interruption times as recovering assets quickly frees up warehouses avoiding reputational damage and
reducing business down time if they cannot be sold the assets are donated to charity organisations this is one way in which
unipolsai seeks to favour the full use of resources by extending their useful life with a view to promoting the circular economy
and                                                           reducing                                                         waste

environmental impacts
as the owner of almost all properties belonging to the unipol group unipolsai adopts and implements the specific policies and
commitments of the unipol group to reduce its direct and indirect impacts on the environment
over the years they have been defined to obtain a reduction in the direct and indirect effects on the environment also thanks to
the involvement of employees associates and suppliers that the group incentivises and supports in this area

management of environmental impacts




as regards the year 2016 specifically the process of certifying consumption management in all buildings owned by unipolsai
and in particular at the operating sites in accordance with the iso 50001 standard continued during the year the number of

                                                                                                                                     45

buildings rose from 17 to 19 and aside from constant monitoring of documentrelated and technological aspects to improve
energy efficiency a structured system for the collection of consumption data continued to be built as regards the certified
buildings the company committed to reducing its electricity and thermal energy consumption by 2 compared to 2014 and
based on the certification of 2016 data the objective was met and renewed for this year the aim of this objective is to pursue
standardisation in the activities carried out by enabling the reporting tracking and repeatability of the energy management
system as an integral part of the certification since 2015 100 of the energy supplied comes from renewable sources based on
framework supply agreements


consumption and emissions




the basis of reporting electricity consumption is based on the concept of control again this year therefore the consumption of
the buildings over which unipolsai has direct control is reported from the operating sites to the diversified companies such as
tenute del cerro and marina di loano also including the properties in which atahotels carries out its activities for other sources
of energy and water reporting includes only the large properties among the operating sites

with respect to reporting for many years now the calculation methodology laid out in directive eu86 of 2003 on the emission
trading scheme has been adopted in addition to the international classification laid out by the ghg protocol standard in scope 1
scope 2 and scope 3 this decision was dictated by the desire to promote greater transparency and comparability of
environmental data including in comparison with other companies in addition to cultivating a culture of transparency regarding
environmental data which is not very widespread in the sector although unipolsai has placed importance on this aspect with a
view to the full assessment of its corporate performance and responsibility

consumption was also impacted by the initiatives to increase the efficiency of the information technology structures among the
main sources of energy consumption after heating in relation to unipols business
the server virtualisation process allowed a further reduction of around 16720 mwhyear in electricity consumption for powering
and cooling it equipment corresponding to roughly 6715 tonnes of co2 not emitted
in addition all workstation it assets and 95 of the server farm equipment have been certified as meeting high energy and green
standards thanks to the careful selection of suppliers like energy star rohs furthermore the migrations of different
structures which had previously been spread throughout the country to the new data processing centre have been completed
the data processing centre has been certified tier core 4 the highest level of guarantee which makes it possible to deal with
serious technical incidents without ever interrupting server availability bearing witness to the centres high degree of innovation
and security
