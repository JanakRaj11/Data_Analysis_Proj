ever changing climate
though the world is trying hard to mitigate the challenges of
global warming the steps taken are clearly not adequate in
the past few years the world has been a witness to the wrath
of the nature  from kashmir floods to devastating
earthquake in nepal from boston snow storms to typhoon in
philippines world is running past the now or never stance
at an alarming rate

at indianoil such grave is our task that we on one hand have
to put in the most sincere efforts to ensure energy sufficiency
and security for all while on the other be even more
committed towards ascertaining that our actions have the
minimalistic negative impact on the environment

we have made huge investments at our refineries to
implement encon energy conservation projects in order to
further reduce the co2 emissions replacing diesel generator
sets used at ros by solar pv to generate electricity is another
feat that 2664 indianoils rosksks have achieved
considering the renewable energy intensive future we have
also forayed into off and on grid solar energy and wind energy
making major events carbon neutral and generating
awareness about sustainability in the organization among the
employees are the other thrust areas of sustainable

       oil spills often result in both immediate
       and longterm environmental damage
       some of the environmental damage
       caused by an oil spill can last for
       decades after the spill occurs the long
       term damage to various species and to
       the habitat and nesting or breeding
       grounds those species depend upon for
       their survival is one of the most far
       reaching environmental
       effects caused by oil spills
