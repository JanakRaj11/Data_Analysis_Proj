social
diversity
higher education opens doors to opportunities that can help create a more equitable
world and those doors must be open through affordable programs accessible to all
regardless of race gender religion socioeconomic status and other differences a
diverse student body faculty and staff provides rich resources for learning and
collaboration through stakeholder engagement it is made obvious that student and
staff members are highly concerned with diversity including diverse nationalities and
gender equality within the feb the values of feb states that the feb is committed
to being socially responsible in our role as an openminded center for debate on
corporate economic societal and ethical issues with an international and intercultural
focus

ku leuven diversity plan
as stated in the ku leuven diversity plan 20142017 the
diversity policy of ku leuven emerges from a christian
inspired desire and commitment to approach diversity as an
embedded reality in an open and transparent way

diversity manifests itself as a wideranging spectrum of
personal positions insights values and world views both in
society and in the university community these differences
stem from the effects and the interplay of numerous factors                       katlijn malfliet
                                                                       ku leuven vice rector of
including language spoken at home cultural background                    culture diversity and
                                                                            sustainability policy
gender age religion geographic area sexual orientation
disability and socioeconomic status at an increasingly inter
national university such as ours these differences are often magnified

as stated in its mission statement ku leuven pursues an inclusive policy that
bestows equal standing to all people in the university community regardless of
background through its diversity policy the university intends to play an exemplary
and inspirational role for society at large
                                                                                                  29

     this assumes both an inspired and deliberate strategy as well as a number of basic
     tenets these tenets serve as the cornerstones of the policy

     1 diversity as an ethical principle the university itself wishes to be an institution that
     informed by its own distinct view of mankind and the world seeks to value each and
     every human being

     2 stimulating and developing every talent ku leuven is undertaking initiatives to
     create an environment in which all talents can reach their fullest expression
     regardless of any potentially inhibiting diversityrelated factors

     3 an inclusive policy combined with a dynamic approach containing measures aimed
     at reaching as wide a public as possible that avoids a onesizefitsall approach



     the ku leuven diversity policy 20142017 outlines the following priorities

      improve gender diversity of academic staff ku leuven gender action plan
      improve awareness of diversity issues
      reach out to underrepresented groups in a proactive and responsible way
      support students with different needs disabilities including learning disabilities
     mental chronic locomotive visual and auditory students from an immigrant
     background individualized guidance from tutors and coaching working
     students lowincome students students who are the first in their family to attend
     university
      improve gender disparity of students in academic programs
      student engagement in diversity policy of ku leuven
      seeking practical solutions through dialogue for issues related to religious and
     philosophical diversity
      academic study programs to include a critical reflection on the human and world
     views among their course units and encourage students to develop research skills
     that take diversity into account
      incorporating diversity into research and encouraging research on diversity
      developing a diversity policy that benefits society

employment
belgian legislation
a collective employment agreement cao confirms the principle of equal treatment
during any selection and recruitment process under belgian labor laws it is
prohibited to discriminate applicants based on gender ethnicnational origin age or
any other aspect of diversity employees have the right to health care when they are
affiliated with an insured institution and pay contributions employees who temporarily
or permanently have no income due to health reasons including maternity leave are
covered by disabilityinvalidity coverage employees are granted a guaranteed wage
during the first 30 days of disability after which they receive a stipend from the
insurance company depending on the duration of leave retiring employees receive
a pension sum depending on the type of employment income and family status in
addition a widower pension is granted to spouses of deceased employees

according to belgian law mothers get 15 weeks maternity leave 19 weeks in case of
multiple birth nine weeks must be taken after the baby is born and six weeks can be
taken either before or after the birth it is obligated to take at least one week of
maternity leave before the birth of the baby if the baby is born before this one week
the maternity leave will be only 14 weeks long fathers are entitled to 10 days of
paternity leave after the birth of a child in addition to this primary maternity and
paternity leave both parents are entitled to parental leave equivalent to four months
of fulltime leave or longer parttime leave so long as the employee has been
working a minimum of 12 months during the last 15 months for the current employer
at least 75 working time parental leave can be taken anytime from birth until the
child is 12 years old

ku leuven
ku leuven has a gender action plan which states that a gender balance should be
aimed for when recruiting research professors female candidates are encouraged to
apply for all vacancies and in cases of equal qualifications priority should be given to
female applicants the goal is to achieve an equal gender distribution during the
inflow ku leuven also follows a twothirds rule in which councils on faculty and
universitywide level cannot have a gender concentration of more than twothirds of
either gender
                                                                                             31

     feb
     the feb uses a faculty resourcing approach to hiring based on parameters that
     include the febs strategic priorities including diversity of gender and nationality of
     faculty members while the individual research record and potential of applicants
     remains the key for hiring decisions diversity is considered during the hiring
     processes an elected member of the feb hiring committee has been trained in
     identifying explicit and implicit gender biases and assumes the role of referee if
     needed during the hiring process the feb faces constraints in its ability to hire
     international faculty members as belgian law regulates the amount of courses that
     can be taught in english


     turnover leave
                




     between march 2015 and february 2016 113 new employees were hired while 108
     staff members left the faculty it is not unusual for universities to experience high
     levels of employee fluctuation because of the relevance of research mobility and
     frequent turnover of phds in this period 12 women took maternity leave and 6 men
     took paternity leaveall employees returned to work after their maternitypaternity
     leave




32

renumeration
the feb uses the set salary scales of ku leuven the lowest salary of ku leuven
atp 11  163001 plus 14472 per month in extra allowances is well above the
belgian minimum wage  153193per month as of june 2016 the discrepancy
between the lowest salary and the highest salary of ku leuven is roughly four and a
half fold signifying a fairly egalitarian organization however the maximum capped
salary for academic staff can be challenging for attracting top research talent in a
highly competitive global context

by using set salary scales remuneration between men and women for the same
function remains equal but type of employment can still impact wage discrepancies
between female and male employees while females make up roughly 75 of
administrative and technical staff female administrative employees are more likely to
fill lower paid positions this is in part due to high frequency of female applicants
similarly while just over 41 of lecturers are female only 18 of full professors are
female sit can be assumed that given the febs and ku leuvens attention to gender
equality as junior academic staff progress in their careers the gender balance along
the academic continuum will improve




                                                                                          33

     internationalization
     the feb strives for greater internationalization of staff members while almost 30
     of research staff doctoral students and postdocs are international the overwhelming
     majority of teaching staff is not internationalreflecting the imposed legal limits to the
     amount of teaching that can be offered not in dutch regardless of national origin
     faculty members are quite international in background and focuswith research
     experience worldwide




34

students
attention is given to the study success of students from diverse backgrounds
specifically the impact of type of secondary education gender scholarship status
indicating socioeconomic family status pioneer status first in family to attend
university nationality and disabilities physical mental and learning the factor with
the biggest impact on students study success was the type of secondary education
students receive in belgium there are four types of secondary education students
who studied aso college prep are four times less likely to drop out within the first
two years of studying at the feb than their nonaso counterpoints in general female
students outperform their male counters points scholarship status pioneer status
and nonbelgian nationality all significantly contribute to the likelihood of students not
continuing their studies after the first two years

knowing the challenges for diverse students ku leuven and feb take active steps to
help all students succeed ku leuven is dedicated to inclusive and democratized
higher education as stated in the ku leuven diversity plan the university intends to
place a renewed emphasis on addressing financial cultural and social obstacles and
wants to challenge the status quo pertaining to less privileged students and students
who are the first in their family to go to college

ku leuven engages in the activities of the support centre for inclusive higher
education siho in close collaboration with the faculties and the offices of student
affairs and educational policy the university works to implement the principles of
universal design for learning udl the ku leuven digital accessibility working
group maintains a mainly operational role regarding the accessibility of the digital
learning environment and information processing at ku leuven as well as the
utilization of ict as a way to facilitate the teaching and learning processes of students
with a disability in past years the working group has done a great deal of work in the
area of texttospeech software digital course materials accessible websites
accessible documents and online lectures




                                                                                               35

     in addition to study support offered by individual faculties and the educational office
     students can voluntarily take part in the intensive coaching project coaching xtra
     freshmen can participate on the basis of a number of factors such as socio
     economic background language spoken at home training and cultural background
     through individual interviews and group sessions coaching xtra deals with issues
     such as how to study efficiently how to get to know your faculty how to integrate
     into student life etc

     the feb offers an introductory mathematics and statistics course for incoming
     undergraduate and master students at the start of the academic year the course
     covers essential mathematical concepts for business economics and students can
     participate for free additional math sessions are offered throughout the semester on
     a voluntary basis to students who feel they are in need of more support

     additionally each campus is served by student services that aim to remove financial
     psychosocial medical or sociocultural barriers to studying and create opportunities
     for development meeting and networking as a basis for further social integration and
     career opportunities examples of such student services activities include student
     counseling ex medical and psychological counseling counseling for students with
     disabilities and interventions in the context of the health of the student

circular economy project
students swap stuff bxl is a project of ku leuven campus brussels in
cooperation with oxfam solidariteit supported by the brussels environmental agency
leefmilieu brussel the aim of students swap stuff project is to counteract
overconsumption and waste from students as students come to live in brussels
during their studies and it is not feasible for international students to bring everything
with them students often buy cheap essentials and leave them behind when they go
back home the majority of these items end up in the waste cycle the aim of the
project is to provide a practical solution to this problem

exiting students staff and anyone who wants can drop off gently used appliances
kitchen essentials bedding etc in september students can buy the  fairly priced 
students swap stuff card with this card you can rent a number of second hand
items which can be chosen from our popup store once students go back home the
aim is to return the materials to an oxfam shop
