some of the benefits we recently offered to our employee       any csr practice to succeed consequently we published
like the full life insurance plan the two days weekend the   our first csr digital magazine aiming to increase csr
free vaccination and smoking cessation plans are unique        awareness among the community this quarterly magazine

magazine was also distributed in a digital media format        as a leading healthcare provider our patients will remain
during all our external community activities                  our first and main priority we believe that by focusing on
                                                               our patient needs and by listening to all other stakeholders
our commitment to environmental health and safety              we will be able to achieve our csr mission and maintain
was illustrated by being one of the first hospitals in         our leadership position
the kingdom of saudi arabia to get accredited for iso
14001 and ohsas 18001 however we think that the              i would take this opportunity to thank all our valuable
outcome of our gogreen campaign did not yet meet              stakeholders and our csr team for their efforts and
our expectation and we are looking forward for better          contributions in making our sustainability journey
achievement years to come                                     successful

since we developed our csr strategy in 2009 we
have been able to achieve most of our goals with
the continuous support of all our stakeholders and            sincerely
we are satisfied with our performance and progress
however based on a comprehensive dialogue with                dr mazen fakeeh
our stakeholders we started at the middle of 2011
to incorporate the csr strategy within the hospital            director general
strategy in order to have a unified strategy with clear
csr objectives and goals we believe by doing so we
will eliminate the bias of having two strategies in our
organization consequently this report will be the last
report based on our former csr strategy

i believe that the main challenge we face remains in
building a culture of sustainability and transparency in the
community we live in we understand the multicultural
nature of our community as well its limitations in
order to address these issues we have developed a csr
communication model which addresses the specific
nuances of healthcare sector in ksa furthermore
we exemplify our future commitment to pursuing csr
awareness that promotes sustainable development by
including it as a strategic goal in our newly developed
hospital wide strategy

within the same context the nursing division employs
more female staff than any other division in the hospital
with more than 700 women reporting to the chief of
nursing one of the divisional goals for 2011 through to
2012 is nursing empowerment there is some evidence
that nurses working in hospitals which practice a system
of shared governance are empowered and have control
over their practice environment shared governance is
a decisionmaking process that empowers employees
and gives them autonomy and control over practice
this control can be psychometrically tested through
the application of a validated survey tool the index
of professional nursing governance ipng hess

                                                               may be attributed to the unfair competition that exists

recruiting people with disabilities requires more than         the government should offer salaries and wages based

as mentioned in our previous csr report we have
established a comprehensive employee staff satisfaction
survey conducted once a year additionally a departmental
survey is conducted once any new intervention is
introduced into a specific department our engagement
with our internal stakeholders is a continuous twoways
communication in general an improvement in the overall
satisfaction of our employees is apparent however
opportunity for improvements was noticed in some areas
our success in addressing previously identified concerns is
reflected in the trend of year on year increase in employee
satisfaction we believe that raising staff satisfaction
is crucial not only to enhance staff retention but also
to have a positive impact on their productivity and on
patient satisfaction our statistics show the year on year
increase in staff satisfaction coupled with increase in the
trend of patient satisfaction and employee productivity
furthermore the result of the survey showed that 57
