1 message from the ceo

paris february 20th 2014


momentum is gaining in the sustainable procurement movement with many successes being attributed to
partnerships among an assortment of global stakeholders one of the most critical and historic of these
achievements in the past year was the agreement at the cop21 in paris of which we were a partner global supply
chains make up around 86 of total carbon emissions representing major improvement opportunities for
businesses furthermore there is growing pressure for companies to increase transparency throughout their value
chain and adhere to increasingly demanding reporting standards faced with these challenges we have seen
successes resulting from partnerships and growing sector collaborations including together for sustainability and
railsponsible

even as many businesses continue to seek opportunities to protect against risks in their supply chains we were
reminded in 2015 that environmental social and ethics issues continue to pervade throughout global supply
chains for instance several global food retail companies came under fire after it was revealed that the seafood
they procured was potentially linked to human rights violations in southeast asia in another example working
conditions and employee safety in factories in fujian shandong and tianjin china were heavily scrutinized and
criticized after explosions killed dozens of workers

2015 was the hottest year on record and extreme weather events have again contributed to billions of dollars
worth of damage worldwide but 2015 will also be remembered as a defining year for global climate action where
the first universal climate agreement in history was signed by 195 countries even with this agreement in place our
collective future is far from secure from the worst effects of climate change but it is this momentum that will push
governments and create business opportunities around the world to meet these challenging emissions targets

ecovadis is pleased to announce that we have made considerable progress in 2015 in expanding our operations
and continuing to leverage our expertise in finding solutions to the supply chain challenges facing our clients more
than 25 new global enterprise customers including dupont and subway joined the ecovadis network in 2015 on
its sustainable procurement platform contributing to a twoyear growth rate of 128 percent furthermore we saw
an 80 growth in the number of suppliers renewing their subscription to the ecovadis network bringing overall
participation to more than 25000 suppliers

looking forward to 2016 and beyond we aim to make further tangible contributions to supply chain responsibility
and to the sustainable development goals

ecovadis has been a signatory to the united nations global compact since 2008 and we are pleased to pledge our
continued participation in ungc and its ten principles

2 ecovadis role in sustainable procurement

through its core operations ecovadis has a positive impact on sustainable procurement through its
supplier assessments and ongoing advocacy efforts

in 2015 the number of suppliers assessed via ecovadis csr risk monitoring and management tool has
continued to grow increasing by 23 compared to 2014 this large increase was driven in part by the
launch and continuation of ecovadisled industry initiatives in particular through together for
sustainability for the chemical industry and railsponsible for the railway sector additional procurement
and sourcing partnerships with tradeshift pool4tool and stateofflux have integrated ecovadis
sustainability rating service into these platforms expanding our impact across global supply chains

on the supplier side ecovadis helps suppliers to identify improvement areas and devises corrective
action plans monitored by a team of experts this approach allows the assessed suppliers to follow a
continuous improvement cycle through a twoway feedback and capacity building process driving
improvements is one of our critical objectives we measured that in 2015 70 of suppliers were able to
demonstrate improvement in sustainability practices in a least one of the four dimensions we assess on
the buyer side we provide a sustainable decisionmaking tool that helps purchasing organizations better
integrate csr criteria into supplier selection raise procurement teams awareness on key sustainable
development issues and manage csr risk in 2015 we continued rolling out our buyer training programs
worldwide and focused on user satisfaction achieving a 98 customer satisfaction rate



additional 2015 milestones for ecovadis include
    expansion of ecovadis internal team to 250 full time employees a 118 increase from 2013

 waste emissions in paris our partnership les joyeux recycleurs provides us with an online
reporting system of recycling waste such as paper cans bottles and cartons in kilograms in
mauritius waste emissions are measured in general mixed waste and we are unable to estimate
waste emissions in the new york office due to the office being in a shared space

correlates with the continued internationalization of our business
