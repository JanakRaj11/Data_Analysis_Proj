dear stakeholder

we are living in exciting times with india continuing on its path of being
amongst the top economic powerhouses of the world but this growth also
brings the country its own challenges with growing consumption demand
outstripping the availability of natural resources demand for energy has
gone up at a galloping rate with over 300 million indian citizens still having
no access to electricity unfortunately india has low reserves of fossil fuels
of oil and gas however india has the fifth largest coal reserve in the world
and electricity for all at affordable costs is possible only through the use of
coal

it is possible to minimise the impact of coal mining on environment and society by adoption of best practices to
improve coal quality productivity and safety and by use of environmentfriendly technologies including coal
gasification beneficiation  we can fulfil our responsibility to both people and the planet


present outlook

during 201112 was 10312 million tonne mte as against 10028 mte produced in 201011 with a growth of 283

we also are amongst the first coal companies to have best practices in business processes  using latest
technological methods and process to achieve sustainable mining coal washeries are being put to provide value
added products to different consumers efforts are on to overcome the entire process of transportation and
handling of coal with minimum human intervention to ensure safety

we are striving hard to achieve the target of zero accident by continual efforts to have state of the art equipments
as required impart training create more safety awareness invest in safety related rd and periodic monitor on

we continue to pioneer value based initiatives in business processes such as deployment of surface miner
etendering eprocurement edespatch and pap based cooperatives


responsibility in governance
the company has made headway in implementing department of public enterprises dpe guidelines on
corporate governance and it gives me pleasure to share with you that the company has secured excellent rating
under the existing reporting system related to compliance of the guidelines
the governance mechanism has undergone a number of changes during last year with the following being most
remarkable
  formation of four board subcommittees other than the existing audit committee with special focus on
  matters such as technical hrm corporate governance strategic management sustainable development
  risk management and employement of land oustees etc
  inducting independent directors on the boards of subsidiary companies of mcl
  creating organisational structure for risk management and sustainable development
  monitoring of tender by independent monitors and integrity pact with contractorssuppliers


responsibility to the environment

mining sustainably is the responsibility that mcl has towards the environment and society and more so being a
public sector undertaking we continue to undertake several steps to remain a green champion in the region
taking the first step towards an integrated management system mcl was awarded the certification of iso 9001
and 140012004 on 24th march 2012 by the governing board of certification international uk limited for 22
mines and the headquarters for the reporting period we have also initiated several sustainable initiatives under
the dpe guidelines on sustainable development  rain water harvesting energy conservation solar power
generation and intensive afforestation etc


responsibility towards safety
for mcl safety of our employees is of paramount importance and we aim to achieve zero accident to create a
safe and secure work environment for our people unfortunately despite our best efforts 5 fatalities occurred at
mcl during the reporting period of 201112 this tragedy has made us more determined to invest in the best
technology and safety equipments for the safety of our workforce some of the mitigation initiatives we are
implementing are
   deployment of statutory personnel full time wholly for accident prevention work
   risk assessment and risk management has been done in all mines covering hazards and mechanism of each
   hazard control action and responsibility and its implementation is updated regularly
   recommendations of 10th safety conference standing committee on safety and cil safety board are being
   implemented
   we are already using and investing in latest tools and equipments like universal drilling machine hydraulic
   roof bolting machine man riding system in underground mines surface miner in all open cast mines
the above list demonstrates our commitment to ever increasing our value generating capacity to meet the
expectations of our stakeholders and our nation in a sustainable way

responsibility to the community
being geographically expandable it is imperative that some indigenous communities get affected by our
companys operations but mcl believes that long standing trustworthy relationship with the communities in
which it operates is mutually fulfilling and towards that end we work relentlessly with number of social initiatives
through a structured csr policy and a range of activities such as potable water supply through tankers during
summer to all the peripheral villages construction of public utility roads and community centers village health and
family welfare programmes check dams mobile medical check ups etc not only enhance our social alignment but
also symbolise true discharge of social responsibilities


responsibility to the future
we are committed to continue our journey towards sustainable development  ensure a better safer and more
responsible mahanadi coalfields with the demand for power rising we have already embarked on diversifying into
power generation through pit head super critical power plant at basundhara coalfields to create an initial
capacity of 2x800 mw a fully owned spv has been formed in december 2011 and incorporated under the
companies act 1956 this diversification promises some strong business sense under current business scenario
mcl has already applied for transmission license for the budhipadarbasundhara transmission line further
initiatives have also been taken to foray into solar power generation

we are also focussed on reducing dust emissions and investing in technology for making mining sustainable and
safer we have plans to introduce ripper dozer to remove ob and to construct four numbers of washeries of 1000
mty capacity each two in talcher coalfields one in ib valley coalfields and one in basundhara area of ib valley
coalfields technoeconomicfeasibility reports for all these washeries have been approved by the mcl board we
are also going to introduce silo with rapid loading system at all the major opencast projects of mcl

with this being our first sustainability report adhering to gri ver g31 for application level c and externally assured
we look forward to improving our reporting enhancing our disclosure parameters and introducing innovative
initiatives we also plan to include the principles of the national voluntary guidelines on social environmental and
economic responsibilities of business along with reporting as per gri g31 guidelines

we are in the process of refining and creating a robust stakeholder engagement framework and subsequent
methodology for material issue identification for this report we adopted an approach that considers
  existing organisational processes includes internal stakeholder grievance processes like customer
  satisfactions etc
  key senior management perspective issues and concerns from the perspective of key senior management
  across various departments
  peer review of material issues challenges and issues faced by peer companies including global coal
  companies related industrysectors like metals  mining and other cpses

all the issues analysed from the above approach were then prioritised by mapping each issue individually against
their significance from stakeholder perspective and significance from the organisation perspective

coal production in 201112 is 10312 mte and growth over 201011 is 283  the achievement against the aap
target is 9728 the reasons for less production against the target being frequent stoppage by villagers
particularly in talcher coalfields on rr issue environment clearance problems in ib valley coalfields and
forestry clearance problem both in talcher as well as ib valley coalfields

growth through diversification
growing market demand for power in sync with the companys existing potentials have prompted the company to
diversify into power generation through pit head super critical power plant at basundhara coalfields to create an
initial capacity of 2x800 mw a fully owned spv has been formed in december 2011 and incorporated under the
companies act 1956 this diversification promises some strong business sense under current business scenario
mcl has already applied for transmission license for the budhipadarbasundhara transmission line which has
already been charged further initiatives has also been taken to foray into solar power generation

opportunities and threats
a production performance of mcl for the financial year 201112 as compared to the target and achievement of the
previous year is given below

opportunities
  huge demand of coal in the country especially for power generation
  huge potentiality of coal mining in mcl
  power plants located in the northern india are also linked to mcl
  to formulate a sound marketing strategy and long term agreement with consumers railways and shippers
  to set up washeries
  diversification to power
  jv for coal gasification and coal to liquid oil

threats
  coal amenable to opencast mining  requirement of more land
  land acquisition and consequent social displacement
  rehabilitation and resettlement issues
  proneness of opencast mining to environmental pollution
  inadequacy of railway rakes for coal transportation
  majority of consumers are far away from coalfields ie increase in rail freight means high landed cost to the
  consumers
  moef stipulation for use of 34 ash content coal mostly available in mcl by power houses beyond 1000 kms
  the coastal based tpps have option to use imported coal
  captive mining  allotment of blocks to mcls consumers some central psus and state psus for power
  generation and coal mining by state govt companies for sale of coal in the market




                                                                                                               32

key outlook
improving coal delivery

at present there are 31 completed projects in mcl with rated capacity of 8858 mte out of which 2 projects with
rated capacity of 160 mte have been exhausted during xi plan period there are 18 ongoing projects under
implementation as on march 2012 with rated capacity of 11678 mte production from these ongoing projects
during 201112 is 35141 mte

basundhara area known as gopalpur tract of ib valley coalfields has enough potentiality with the bottleneck
being the coal evacuation arrangement the company has planned and approved a 52 km long railway line from
basundhara area to jharsuguda railway station at a capital investment of rs 46968 crore two mous have been
signed between mcl and southeastern railway for land acquisition and construction of the railway line land
acquisition work is in progress and construction work has been started the project has been delayed due to
acquisition of forest land which is pending for want of noc under fra 2006 and also construction of one major
bridge over ib river is under execution an amount of rs 14653 crore has been paid to southeastern railway out
of which rs 11279 crore has been utilised so far

similarly in talcher coalfields construction of kalingaangul link railway line is going on once this segment is
completed there will be unidirectional movement of empty rail rakes from angul side and the loaded rakes will be
evacuated through talcher side this will increase the rake movement capacity of talcher coalfields by double

to further increase the coal dispatch system rapid loading system silo will be constructed in 10 projects
including two jv projects

mcl is also planning to set up 04 numbers of washeries of its own 100 mty capacity each to cope up with the moef
stipulation to dispatch coal below 34 ash at distant power houses out of these two washeries will come up in
talcher coalfields one in ib valley coalfields and one in basundhara sector of ib valley coalfields the techno
economic feasibility report of all these washeries on bom basis have been approved by mcl board

mcl is going to construct coal corridor both at talcher and ib valley coalfields for dedicated coal transportation for
construction of 4lane 18 mts wide and 415 km long road at talcher coalfields work order has been issued to ms
ivrclamr jv at a cost of rs 25134 crore on 14122011

the low figure in the 201112 was mainly due to decrease in utilization of chpsfeeder breakers in the light of usage
of surface miners in various mines with continual increase in demand of coal in the country and up coming of new
projects in turn will assure more volume of purchases from the ancillary units of mcl as well as from other ssi units
inside odisha

the environmental monitoring results of all mines are available on the companys website wwwmclgovin

in keeping with the companys concern for environment it has kept up the long standing practices to check air
pollution with a good number of measures some of which are highlighted here
   using surface miner technology a blastless mining technology which eliminates the dust generating
   operations like drilling blasting and crushing completely while sprinkling water at the same time apart from
   that selective mining of coal and stone layers is done separately with the machine to reduce the ash content by
   about 3 resulting in less ash generation in power plant and reduction of green house gas as well
   one heavyduty truckmounted vaccumoperated mechanical road sweeper is in operation for sweeping and
   collection of coal spillage and dust over coal transportation roads at hingula oc expansion project

water consumption
as with any mining operations water management is essential to ensure  conservation of freshwater usage as well
as mitigating through water pollution measures some of the measures we have undertaken to control water
pollution are highlighted below

   mine drainage water pumped out of the mine as well as the water flowing out from ob dumps is put into settling
   ponds before being discharged in order to settle the sediments and prevent silting of rivers and other water
   bodies
   oil and grease traps ogt are used at the workshops of opencast mines to remove oil and grease as well as oily
   sludge from the waste water
   garland drains and catch drains are also provided around quarry boundary and ob dumps in order to arrest
   sediments and prevent shifting of natural drainage

water conservation initiatives
  disused quarry voids are used as water harvesting structure for recharge of ground water
  water treatment plants wtp are operational under integrated water supply schemes of talcher ib valley
  belpahar and basundhara small scale water filtration units for domestic supply are existing at talcher and
  orient areas using underground mine water

biodiversity
plans have been made to undertake biodiversity study of 3 projects lingaraj balaram lakhanpur ocps in 2013
14 an earlier minewise biodiversity study was conducted by sambalpur university in 2008 the study did not find
any specific typical and endangered plant species or endangered wild life species in the area of study as a part of
the biodiversity measures 30 of the total plantation in the mining area is of edible fruit bearing trees that attract
squirrels bats and rodents fire protection and prevention measures are undertaken to prevent fires destroying
the flora and fauna particularly during summer
as per the report there are no national park sanctuary biosphere reserve tiger reserve elephant reserve any
other reserve habitat for migratory birds  elephant corridor within 10 km of the mining area mine core zone both
in talcher coalfields and in ib valley coalfields however an elephant corridor exists within 20 km of the
bhubaneswari ocp in talcher coalfields in angul district the forest dept prepared a plan for habitat improvement
of the surrounding areas of bhubaneswari ocp and an amount of rs 50 lakhs was deposited with the forest
department towards the same in 2004
for all forthcoming new minesexpansion mines of mcl a biodiversity study shall be done as per the terms of
reference tor approved by ministry of environment  forest moef and the report will be included in the eiaemp
document for submission to moef

compliance
the deputy director mines sambalpur circle sambalpur odisha informed the company vide letter dt02112011
to project officer samleshwari ocp alleging illegal extraction of coal from 200809 to 20102011 and requested to
deposit cost price of coal amounting to rs 8625793370 as per section 215 of mines and minerals development
 regulation act 1957

the alleged violations arose due to procedural delays and the need for the project to continue mining to meet the
target in the interest of public during this entire period correspondence with deputy director mines was
continuing

as per the directive of moef the matter relating to violation with respect to production in excess of environmental
clearance ec capacity in seven mines was put up to the board of directors 140th meet on june 2012 and a
resolution to not to repeat such violations was passed
we are committed to the resolution passed by the board to conduct mining and associated operations in an
environmentally responsible manner to comply with the applicable laws and other requirements related to
environmental aspects
