               responsibility and passion in all our activities internally and                    level of transparency writing a cr report requires collation

another step another milestone
strauss group is proud to present its second corporate responsibility report to me this reports is much
more that a formal fitting and proper act  this report like the first one and like reports to come is a
declaration of the unique value we place on transparency
the content you will find in the document before you about the extent of responsibility that we take upon
ourselves as a company  is important but no less important in my opinion is the very act of methodical
reporting that is open and straightforward that invites other opinions dialog and even criticism in the
broad moral sense it is important for us to tell the entire world that we are part of it that what interests
human society is our business the fact that we and our products constitute a part in the lives of so many
people places great responsibility on us and it is very important for us to live up to it
from the business standpoint this transparency is the foundation for relations based on trust that we
wish to continue to maintain with all our stakeholders this transparency is much more than a declaration
transparency is an approach and a collection of hundreds and even thousands of actions transparency
is reflected in reporting in the way that we operate in the interviews we give and in the way we manage
decisionmaking processes it is a process that is endless
this year the report is published while the world is in deep economic crisis this crisis is first and foremost
a crisis of confidence it is very difficult to restore confidence and trust that were damaged i believe that
the way to slowly restore trust and rehabilitate the economy is to be transparent honest and open to
criticism therefore now more than ever company stakeholders and society in general must know see
and be able to examine and verify that we are doing business properly
the economic crisis may change the way or the extent to which companies operate to fulfill their corporate responsibility but i
am convinced that this is not a reason to stop doing so corporate responsibility is not simply a matter of money  it is the lens
through which we see the world social responsibility is part of the heritage of our founders and is imprinted deep in the dna of the
entire group social sensitivity a sense of commitment and responsibility to act do not depend on a time or place therefore even if
conditions force us to operate a bit differently we do not intend to lower this flag we will not cease in our efforts to continue to be
active partners in the societies in which we operate and a significant factor in global social and environmental processes
furthermore it is because we are undergoing a process of global expansion and now touch the lives of more and more diverse
populations that we must place more weight on our impact on people and on the environment in which they live the cultural and
human diversity of our expanding consumer public is also one of the reasons we chose to promote diversity and inclusion within our
company this approach is based on the belief that diversity is enriching that numerous outlooks opinions and cultures create fruitful
dialog between them improve society in general and improve business results i have taken upon myself to promote this issue and
integrate it into all the companys activities from worker employment policies organizational culture allocation of supplier resources
and development of diverse products for different sectors to the manner in which we communicate and act within the community
i have no doubt that our social endeavors are only beginning and that we have much more to give to society and the environment
the report presented to you is only one small step on the path of wonders that we wish to and can realize

sincerely

                                                                                                       unique way
     2008 was one of the most challenging years ever in the global business world in general and for us as a company in particular
     in 2008 we all experienced the global financial crisis that created economic uncertainty and a breakdown in consumer confidence
     and trust resulting in a global recession that is rapidly developing in all the worlds markets
     as a company we have succeeded in confronting these extraordinary challenges well based on meticulous daily management of
     our business with our legs planted firmly in the ground during this time we did not cease to invest in infrastructure and implement
                                policies and actions that will support our continued growth and expansion over the coming years
                                these actions included acquisition of companies and other activities outside israel introduction of tpg as
                                a financial partner 25 holding in our coffee company pepsico fritolay as partner 50 holding in
                                the sabra operations in north america implementation of the new organizational structure in israel and
                                assimilation of our new corporate identity including launching the companys brand  currently primarily
                                in israel as an important pillar of the process of building strauss as a wellknown and esteemed global
                                company in any region where it operates
                                a very important factor in these processes is corporate responsibility a field in which we have taken a
                                huge step forward in 2008 including increasing awareness for the importance of this issue assimilation
                                of the code of ethics in the entire group publishing our first global cr report initiating a tradition of
                                marking the strauss global cr day signing onto the international treaty for the promotion of fair coffee
                                trade and the initiation of numerous social and environmental projects continuing to contribute to the
                                community in israel and abroad
                                 2008 was undoubtedly a year in which traditional approaches collapsed and the rules of the game were
                                 redefined especially during 2008 we relearned the importance of the most basic components of the
                                 business world those that are always true and will be true in the future those that always work and will work
                                 prominent among these components are the importance of leadership of responsibility of transparency of
                                 reliability and of ethics also of great importance is the understanding that all these are vital cornerstones
     for the establishment of trust between business companies and stakeholders including our customers these components constitute a
     necessary condition for the development and establishment of a good strong and successful company over time on this background our
     commitment to continue to invest in development and promotion of all aspects of corporate responsibility is further reinforced
     we have chosen to publish a broad ranging and transparent cr report this year that covers additional business units that were not
     included in our first report in addition we decided to publish this report in conjunction with the publication of our annual financial
     statements and reports so as to emphasize the importance with which we view the overall representation of all the factors that
     influence us as a company from three main aspects accountingfinancialeconomic social and environmental
     this is an additional step in implementing strauss unique approach and path and reflects our sense of responsibility to report all the
     factors that influence us throughout all the groups businesses in any location in which we operate this unique path is shared by all
     of us and together we will continue the long and fascinating journey that takes us all forward one step at a time

transparency
and responsibility
strauss group is honored to publish its second corporate responsibility report and is proud to share the report with all its
stakeholders the data and results published in this report reflect the extensive work we have performed in the field of social 
environmental responsibility yet also highlight that the road we still have to walk in order to increase our cr awareness and improve
our cr performance is long the goal of the report in addition to presentation of data and information about our activities in this
field is primarily to serve as an index and benchmark for all the diverse issues that require work plans in order to improve our cr
performance both at the corporate center and at each business unit

the report presents to stakeholders in a transparent and responsible manner data and details
relating to strauss group and complies with the basic requirements of corporate responsibility by
examining the corporations activities on three levels  economic environmental and social triple
bottom line we have learned how important each one of these fields is to our various stakeholders in
our development into a global company that is committed to act according to international standards
in each one of these fields

during 2008 strauss group has implemented several significant steps in the field of cr as is reflected
in the report presented to you among others we have completed the assimilation of the strauss
code of ethics appointed environmental managers in strauss israel and strauss coffee completed
infrastructure work in the field of community relations and donations that are designed to serve as the
basis for consolidating a clear perennial policy in this important field in addition we have formulated a
compliance and enforcement program that will be launched and implemented during 2009 in all group
units the 4c project for the purchase of green coffee from growers committed to worker rights and
proper work environment has been significantly expanded the group has invested extensively in its
products with respect to nutrition and wellbeing various programs have been prepared to promote the
goal of diversity and inclusion within strauss and via its contribution to the community

in this period of economic crisis the issue of corporate responsibility is of even greater importance and requires strauss group
to work even harder to try to mitigate the negative impacts of the crisis this is reflected mainly in community relations in human
resources welfare programs and in protecting the environment through energy savings

i would like to thank all the people who participated in the preparation of this report and hope that all strauss stakeholders
and all readers of this report will enjoy it i am convinced that the presentation of strauss groups activities in the field of cr will
increase stakeholder confidence in strauss

the process  creating our code of ethics
the first step we took was identifying all the stakeholder groups   materials produced by the focus groups throughout the world
connected with our organization employees consumers              were then collected reviewed edited and transformed into
suppliers and customers competitors governmental                  principles for ethical conduct that reflect the content of the
authorities communities in which we operate and the                meetings the resulting principles were returned to the focus
environment for each stakeholder group we assigned a               groups for validation and then combined into one document
designated team a focus group of employees and managers            our code of ethics this document was then approved by the
who work in positions related to each stakeholder group             groups board of directors and published and distributed to all
in the company each team was led by a senior executive            group employees
demonstrating the companys high level of managerial
commitment towards this issue                                      attached to the code of ethics we created a dilemmas
                                                                    appendix this describes various dilemmas that may arise
each focus group held extensive discussions on the subject          during routine work at the strauss group related to the
and issues relevant to the stakeholder group they raised and       different issues described in the chapters of the code and
reviewed ethical dilemmas surrounding the various issues           presents the preferred path we expect our employees and
and ultimately set the guidelines and principles on which           managers to select when encountering such or similar
the relevant chapters of the code of ethics were based the         dilemmas in their daily work

                                                                                                                                      61

2008  strauss new health policy                                     in all of the categories and examine the nutritional status for
in 2008 we established a new comprehensive corporate health          every product category anytime and for any purpose
policy this policy was established as part of our product line
strategic planning and is a part of the companys concept of         in 2008 all of the groups products were mapped by

of implementing the new health policy we invested in the             the improvement of the products nutritional value
development of unique tools and methodologies that will assist
us in developing products appropriate for our new policy             we continue the trend with which we
                                                                      have begun long ago and continue
the following covers the three main programs on which our
new health policy is based and the different tools developed
                                                                      to ensure all strauss products do not
in order to implement this policy                                    contain trans fats and artificial colorings
                                                                                                                                         75

      the natural program
       the purpose of the natural program is to increase the
       quantity of natural ingredients in our products with the
       purpose of responding to the increasing global trend of
       preferring natural products or those containing a greater
       amount of natural ingredients as part of this program we
       work on two different aspects first offering a wider variety of
       natural products based on natural ingredients and secondly
       increasing the percentage of natural ingredients in existing
       products therefore in 2008 we completed among other
       things the move begun in 2007 of removing all artificial
       colorings out of our products we comprehensively mapped
       all of the products and examined their ingredients with the
       purpose of increasing the utilization of natural ingredients at
       the expense of artificial ingredients such as various stabilizing
       agents preservatives flavor and scent enhancers and more

       the tool intended for implementing this principle
       we are currently in the midst of developing a new tool that
       will assist us in the implementation of the approach forming
       the basis for this principle here too we are referring to new
       computer software naturepass which provides an index for
       mapping each products ingredients and grade each product
       based on its level of naturalness as derived among other
       things from a consumer conception and awareness survey
       as to the term natural as far as product ingredients in the
       various food categories

      increasing transparency and presenting the information
       more clearly and conspicuously about nutritional
       and health related issues on the packages this means
       conspicuously emphasizing the products health related and
       nutritional benefits on the packages in order to allow the
       consumer to clearly and efficiently understand and learn the
       important benefits of each product and where the added
       value lies in case they choose to consume this product

                 agricultural raw materials that meet the requirements

                 among the huge variety of products strauss offers its clients          that try to achieve nice looking crops with maximum weight to
                 there are two major product lines based on agricultural produce         disobey the law as far as the types of pesticides they utilize as

                 also made of fresh vegetables from the field herbs and other           or the use of forbidden pesticides find their way to the stores
                 types of fresh agricultural produce                                    the retail chains and the markets and from there to consumers
                                                                                         bodies putting their long and short term health in jeopardy the
                 the raw materials utilized by strauss for producing these               israeli ministry of agriculture trying to cope with this problem
                 products is always the best and freshest that can be obtained           conducts sample testing of fresh agricultural produce with the
                 from leading israeli farmers strauss invests significant resources     purpose of detecting pesticide residues based on the approved
                 for achieving this end along with a policy of zero compromise         standards and levels however the ministry only conducts some
                                                                                         1000 sample tests annually a very low figure compared to the
     the raw materials utilized by strauss for producing                                 quantities of agricultural produce grown and marketed in israel
     these products is always the best and freshest that                                 this leads to significant helplessness as to the ability to enforce
                                                                                         the existing standards for this reason many agricultural goods

     along with a policy of zero compromise                                             aspect to this problem is that in many cases the merchants at the
                                                                                         markets and retail outlets are not aware of the actual source of the
                 background the problematic agricultural produce market                 goods and the farmers identity therefore it is impossible to trace
                 it is well known that fresh vegetables just like any other             back their farming methods and the amount of pesticide used
                 agricultural crop are exposed to insects and other types of
                 pests when growing in the field and as a result the need              our solution  what does strauss do
                 arises to protect the plant and the fruit as part of the crop          based on our deep commitment to our consumers and
                 protection strategy farmers use among other things various           out of our responsibility for our products we have taken
                 types of pesticides in israel the subject of using pesticides is      upon ourselves over and above the legal requirements
                 very problematic the list of substances approved for use by            and even the accepted practice for retail chains and food
                 the ministry of agriculture which is responsible for the matter       manufacturers to invest extensive resources in ensuring that
                 is highly restricted and is actually very difficult to follow since   the produce we offer our consumers and use in our products
                 pests can develop resistance to these substances and their             is not only the best available but fully meets israeli standards
                 effectiveness is reduced this situation has led many farmers           as to pesticide residues

     some of the steps we have taken                                       we are forced to work with an unknown supplier we put
      as of the end of 2007 we at strauss employ a full time              the produce through comprehensive independent tests
       agronomist working under the groups quality headquarters          sending it into labs so as determine the produces condition
       the agronomist works in full cooperation with the companys          before any transaction takes place each unknown supplier
       quality control specialists and the crew responsible for             is individually inspected in many cases the costs are higher
       the acceptance of goods whose duty is to ensure that the            than those we could have incurred were it not for our
       agricultural produce that we acquire for use in our products is      meticulous testing but we are prepared to pay the higher
       obtained from the best farmers and meets legal and applicable        price if this means we can ensure our consumers are provided
       israeli standard requirements as to pesticide residues the          with healthier products with the confidence that the goods
       company agronomist takes part in purchase transaction and           they buy from us are the best in this aspect too
       the transactions is carried out only after his approval the
       agronomist conducts thorough field inspections including           strategic company suppliers ie suppliers with which we

       and aerial photographs and even conducts several tests that         standard mark provided by the israeli standard institute and
       are considered to be unusual such as testing the soil for heavy     compelling the supplier to conduct a risk survey personally
       metals and secondary contaminations all of this is done to          accompanied by our company agronomist
       ensure the company acquires fresh produce that is free from
       contamination and pesticide residues                               we conduct various types of tests and samplings on the
                                                                            agricultural produce at the farmers and suppliers sites these

  where we arrive at the farmers field packing house or truck       assisting our regular farmers to promote the use of as little
  bringing the produce to us take some of the produce and            pesticide as possible
  send it for pesticide residue testing such tests are conducted
  as our own initiative at our expense based on no legal or        all of these actions are done out of our sense of responsibility
  other requirement and in cases where the produce is found          towards our consumers and for the products with which
  to be inappropriate for use we cancel the transaction at           we provide them we invest significant resources for this

this data indicates great variance between the different

years we will endeavor to study the issue of energy
consumption throughout the organization in order to
improve our overall performance in this field by adopting         the groups plants abroad use natural gas for production
existing solutions from one unit in other units                   processes which significantly reduces air pollution in

with a view to the future we recognize the significant            and this depends on the provision of suitable infrastructure
advantage in using alternative energy solar energy wind          by the state
energy etc and are acting to introduce these technologies       the groups plants overseas currently use more than 7

      tons of hazardous waste were created in 2008 this year units have      product quality and safety
      begun to collect data about the removal of this type of waste and
      therefore the reported quantity for 2008 is higher than 2007 which      in 2008 we attained significant improvements in the consumption
      was 1 ton we estimate that the data presented here is inclined         of packaging materials reducing the use of packaging materials
      downward due to faults in the data collection process next year       cuts costs on the one hand and contributes to environmental
      improvements will be implemented in the data collection system          protection on the other hand by consuming less resources and
      and this will enable us to present data that is more reliable           creating less waste

      our various units use materials defined as hazardous for cleaning          to packaging reducing packaging weight and providing refill
      and maintenance purposes                                                  solutions in flexible bags instead of glass jars thus reducing the
      in 2008 data was collected about the use of these types of substances      quantity of glass jars the weight of chocolit packaging was also
      in order to set targets for improvement over coming years                 cut by replacing the tin packaging with plastic packaging saving
      in continuation of the activities we began in 2007 this year we           in packaging materials for the projects included in the project
      continued to map hazardous materials identify our compliance              totaled 340 tons of packaging
      with legal requirements for marking these materials and placement        changes to chocolit packaging also included design of cone

      our carbon footprint
      strauss constantly works to reduce emissions of greenhouse              this year we have set for ourselves an additional challenge in this
      gasses caused by its various activities at the end of 2008 we         field by including mileage gas  fuel consumption by company
      decided to set this target as part of the operational goals in israel   vehicles in our emission calculations mileage includes the
      for 2009                                                               transportation of products from plants to logistic centers from
      we are aware of the impact of our production and handling               logistic centers to customers and travel in private vehicles
      activities on global warming and climate change and are also
      aware of the effect of these changes on the activity of our plants     emissions of greenhouse gasses by strauss in 2008 totaled
      the rise in raw material prices following floods and heat waves        120000 tons in terms of co2 including mileage
      the reduction of manufacturing activities due to the depletion of       since in previous years we did not include transportation and
      clean water sources the rise in production costs due to the rising     mileage in our calculation this figure is significantly higher
      price of electricity etc                                              compared to previous years

not including mileage greenhouse gas emissions for 2008 totaled      greenhouse gas emissions israel by sources  in ton co2
slightly more than 95 thousand tons in terms of co2

the increase compared to 2007 is explained by both additional        70000
reporting by units in israel that did not report last year and by

      plant for a greener environment
       we are currently installing a steam vat at the safed instant   was the case in the past and this will result in savings in the
       coffee plant that will generate energy from coffee waste      amount of fuel oil purchased by the plant
       instead of producing energy using polluting fuels             the motivation behind this step was the desire to cut fuel oil
                                                                      and transportation costs and reduce the cost of transporting
       coffee waste that to date was shipped to landfills will be   waste to landfills in parallel from the environmental
       transported into the designated vat that was designed by       standpoint emission of pollutants from both the smokestack
       the plants engineers the heat created by the incineration    and trucks will be reduced and we will produce less waste and
       process will be channeled to generate steam for the            bury less waste in the ground an additional and significant
       plants use                                                   added value of this project is the reduction of noise in the
