             strong local interest in seismic isolation to protect large buildings
when we rebuilt our house our ﬁrst concern was to make it safe our                  that there are no running costs is big plus were using the same system
old house was made of wood and it was quite comfortable but that kind                they use in huge buildings like the prefectural government ofﬁces so we
of construction is out of date plus the city of toyota and the surrounding          feel very safe
area are in the tokai earthquake zone so we always worried whenever                     while the construction work was being done neighbors who saw the
there was an earthquake                                                              seismic isolation units laid out on the foundation congratulated us on
   when i was working in nagoya they started doing seismic isolation                 building such a sturdy house and told us that if an earthquake struck
work on the western building of the prefectural government complex                   theyd be heading for our house in a way our house has probably
and that got me thinking about seismic isolation for our house they                  become an advertisement for thks seismic isolation systems i hope
were using seismic isolation devices from thk later on i visited a model             that helps motivate more people around here to equip their own homes
house and saw and heard about another companys seismic isolation                     with seismic isolation because it will bring peace of mind to the whole
system but it seemed kind of onedimensional we had hired a builder                 area
called haneda construction
and they showed us some

offsetting the summer heat but as time went on we also found it very          into big plants contrary to my expectations though the plants grew
enjoyable just to watch it grow at ﬁrst these cute little sprouts appeared   larger and larger day after day and by the end there was a 5c difference
and several days later the plants began to send out tendrils less than a      between the temperatures on either side of our green curtain this en
month after that we had ﬂowers blooming and about ten days after the          abled us to reduce airconditioning hours inside our ofﬁce building so it
ﬂowers opened we had small melons the plants grew and grew and                actually had an energy saving effect still the most charming thing about
produced a lot of melons thanks to the efforts and ingenuity of the em       our green curtain was the way it looked i got a cool pleasant feeling just
ployees who were involved in the project and we were able to harvest the      looking at it it took time and effort to water and take care of the plants
fruit it started as a way of conserving energy but the pleasure of watch    every day but they have had a very positive effect and not just because
ing our plants grow may have been the true harvest                            they help us conserve electricity

for three days from october 29 to 31 2011 these employees worked as         supplies educational materials and athletic clothes and deliver them to
volunteers in two areas in the city of ishinomaki they helped clear debris    elementary schools in the city of kesennuma in working to help children
and served food at a temporary housing site in the citys aikawa district      who were about to start a new school year but didnt have any of the
and helped clean up a seaweed harvesting site in the jusanhama district       things they needed i received a tremendous amount of help from every
nearly seven months after the earthquake the seriousness of the disaster      one at the sendai plant and i was able to deliver a lot of supplies i also
had begun to fade from some peoples minds but problems remained             participated in an effort devoted to replanting ﬂower beds damaged by
including high unemployment and a continuing exodus of residents from          seawater in the tsunami since last year ive helped planted ﬂower beds
the area the volunteers from the kofu plant felt they needed to view the      each season at ohmagari elementary school in the city of higashi matsu

  in their own words                    a beneficiary of the inhouse recruiting system

                            during my ﬁrst ﬁve years at thk i worked at branches in japan and for the overseas

                               i wanted to use my experience to assist with the advertising and public relations
                            work that supports the thk groups globalization efforts i had long been interested
                            in designing websites and doing animation as a hobby so this was a great chance to
                            pursue those interests
                               these days im involved in operating the company websites and producing pr vid
                            eos and inhouse publications im applying some of the lessons ive learned from
 icb center employee
                            past experience and i ﬁnd it very rewarding to be able to help promote sales in the
                            future i hope to help create more video content create applications to make the
                            website more userfriendly and improve the content of our internal publications
                               the feeling at thk is that were being given a whole range of opportunities i think
                            the inhouse recruiting system is great because it gives people the chance to realize
                            their ambitions
