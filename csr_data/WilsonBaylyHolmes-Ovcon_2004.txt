                         chairmans statement



another year of         the construction industry has in general experienced a difﬁcult year in 2004 and it is therefore with some
solid growth            pride that i am able to report that wbho has once again achieved a satisfactory increase in proﬁts and
                        earnings per share headline earnings per share at 209 cents reﬂect an increase of 175 over the previous
                        year the company has now reported increased earnings for every year since the merger of wilson bayly holmes
                        and ovcon in 1995

                        the growth in earnings has been achieved despite a moderate increase in turnover for the year of 42 whilst
                        there has been a satisfactory increase in turnover from building contracts the volume of work carried out on
                        roads and earthworks contracts has again decreased as most of the roads and earthworks turnover was
                        derived from overborder contracts the percentage of foreign work has also declined from 32 of turnover in
                        2003 to 20 this year fortunately the foreign work has been more proﬁtable and the proportion of operating
                        proﬁt from this source was much higher

conditions remain       the announcement earlier this year regarding increased expenditure on capital works by the state has resulted
competitive             in the commencement of a number of large projects such as the berg river dam in the cape but in general
                        there has not been sufﬁcient work to keep the larger contractors busy a number of our competitors have also
                        decided to close down their foreign road construction operations and have brought certain of these resources
                        back to south africa this has increased competition locally for the larger road contracts and bids have been
                        exceptionally keen

                        the year has also seen a signiﬁcant increase in demand for residential property and we are involved in a
                        number of projects both as a developer and as a contractor there is a concern that the market is becoming
                        overheated and any expansion into further phases is being approached with caution

two sides to the coin   the strength of the rand has not been all doom and gloom the increase in retail demand and the relatively
                        low prevailing interest rates have stimulated a demand for the construction of new shopping centres and the
                        refurbishment of older centres of which we have received a major share on the downside we have a number
                        of contracts denominated in us dollars which have suffered in translation to rands our australian associate
                        probuild constructions also experienced a healthy increase in proﬁts when expressed in australian dollars but
                        this converted to a lower rate in rand terms the strong rand has also resulted in civil work in the mining
                        industry being either postponed or cancelled this has also affected our mix of work with civil structural work
                        being at its lowest level for many years

cash balances improve   cash ﬂow during the year showed an increase of r37 million after capital expenditure of r87 million capital
                        expenditure reﬂected an increase of r27 million over that spent in 2003 cash balances at the end of the year
                        amounted to r323 million and gearing after cash balances was nil

 chairmans statement continued



black economic              the construction industry together with labour and government are well on the way to formulating a
empowerment                 construction industry charter which should be concluded during 2005 we believe this will have a positive
                            effect on construction prospects the company has also been involved in negotiations with a number of black
                            empowerment entities seeking to acquire a stake in the group but these are still at a preliminary stage


prospects for 2005          the successful holding of elections in april and the award of the 2010 world cup to south africa produced an
                            air of optimism in the country this is reﬂected in the increased size of our order book which amounted to
                            r275 billion compared to r18 billion at the start of the year however the negative effect of the strong rand
                            on exports and on the mining industry in particular has tended to diminish this optimism to a degree because
                            of the cyclical nature of our industry it is difﬁcult to predict performance too far into the future with any degree
                            of certainty however we believe that if we are able to maintain our order book at reasonable levels we should
                            achieve increased earnings per share next year


changes to the board        in accordance with the requirements of the jse i have relinquished the post of chief executive but retain the
                            position of chairman of the company paul theessen has indicated that he wishes to play a lesser role in the
                            affairs of the company and has resigned as deputy chairman pauls extensive experience and sound judgement
                            will not be lost to the group as he will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director tasked to undertake
                            special projects from time to time

                             operational review



satisfactory results in a   the group has traded satisfactorily during the year under review despite the competitive climate and the effect
competitive climate         of the strong rand on the economy and on the results of foreign currency contracts operating proﬁts before the
                            amortisation of goodwill for the year increased by 27 compared to 2003 turnover for the year amounted to
                            r251 billion an increase of 42 a pattern which became evident in 2003 has repeated itself this year again
                            only moderate turnover growth was achieved due to a decline in turnover in civil engineering contracts being
                            compensated for by strong growth from building contracts the percentage of turnover from foreign contracts
                            reﬂected a signiﬁcant decline of 12 from 32 in 2003 largely due to the delay in the awards of certain major
                            road contracts operating margins have maintained the increase achieved at the halfyear stage and
                            represented 47 of turnover compared to 38 last year the main reason for this increase is the much
                            improved results of the roads and earthworks division this year despite the decline in turnover


roads and earthworks        a number of large contracts were either completed during the year or are in their ﬁnal stages having
results much improved       completed the r360 million road contract in swaziland from the oshoek border to the outskirts of mbabane we

                            be carried out by our joint venture partners the roads and services contract for the oubaai golf estate has

                            ﬁnancial yearend after some delay we have at last been awarded the contract for phase 1 of the upgrading of
                            the provincial road between ugie and langeni in the eastern cape this is a 30month contract worth

                            work continues on the buhemba gold mine contract in tanzania the remoteness of the site has been a
                            challenge and the strength of the rand has also eroded earnings
                            another recent award is the contract for the upgrading of the en1 highway in mozambique between
                            zandamela and maxixe payment for work done on this contract will be in a variety of currencies structured in a

                            substantial work on the massingir dam project in mozambique as a subcontractor
                            our lesotho road contract was completed and handed over during the year unfortunately we were unable to
                            reach agreement with the client regarding the settlement of certain claims and it is likely that these will be
                            decided by arbitration no reliance has been made on these claims in arriving at the results reported to date

on the economy and on the results of foreign currency contracts




                               the division has not been as busy in botswana as in previous years but there are good prospects of increasing
                               our order book in this country work on the tonota sewerage reticulation scheme has made steady progress and
                               is due for completion in march 2005

                               during the year the division was restructured with executives being delegated responsibility on a regional basis
                               we believe that this move will focus greater management attention at the contract level as well as increasing
                               scope for growth

                               another notable feature of the year has been the increase in residential projects particularly in the coastal

                               the construction and refurbishment of shopping centres continues to be a signiﬁcant source of revenue we are

                               our subsidiary company suncon pty limited in botswana has grown rapidly during the year on the back of a
                               building boom in gaborone however this is unlikely to be sustained and we are expecting a quieter year in 2005


civil contracts at             the strong rand has severely curtailed the amount of civil structural work on offer and the volume of work
a low ebb                      carried out during the year has been at its lowest level for many years

                            gain a fair amount of construction work as a result of this investment the company has also taken a 50

health and safety          july 2003 saw the promulgation of the new construction regulations under the ohs act 85 of 1993 these
                           regulations have placed additional responsibilities on the industry by holding clients accountable and thus
                           obliging them to play a far more proactive role in the health and safety of a construction project
                           to date the group is conﬁdent that the new regulations are being adhered to and this has been substantiated
                           by the positive results achieved in this years regional mba and national mbsa safety competitions regionally
                           the company was able to secure no less than 16 top three positions of which nine were ﬁrst place whilst
                           nationally the company were placed ﬁrst in two categories
                           our building division experienced a 265 decrease in its lost time injury frequency rate ltifr despite a
                           57 increase in hours worked the roads  earthworks division experienced a 15 decrease in the number of
                           lost time injuries recorded
                           hours worked by the entire group increased by 24 while the ltifr decreased by 12 the challenge
                           remains to reduce these numbers even further and with intensiﬁed health and safety training programmes the
                           company remains conﬁdent that the next round of targets will be met
                           by the end of 2003 wbho employees had worked just over four years without a single workrelated fatality
                           thus totalling 60 million fatalityfree hours this record was unfortunately tarnished when an employee was
                           tragically runover by a truck on a remote project in january of this year

          the principal actuarial assumptions used as at

          these assumptions have been based on the
          requirements of the reporting standard and
          are typically less conservative than those used
          by the valuator for funding purposes all other
          assumptions adopted in the funding valuation
          were left unchanged
