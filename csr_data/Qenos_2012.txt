qenos products also support resource and energy efficiency for example

water conservation
an estimated 395000 polyethylene tanks are produced annually with the
potential to capture 28 million litres of rainwater per year making a significant
contribution to water conservation in australia

industrial pipe
polyethylene pipes enable water savings by eliminating evaporation loss improve
transport efficiency through reduced weight and offer longer operational life 
representing a significantly reduced environmental footprint when compared to
traditional iron and concrete pipes

food integrity
the wide use of polyethylene in films and bottles has enhanced the integrity of
food products in transport on the shelf and in the home qenos continues to
improve and develop new products that will enable our customers to achieve
their product integrity goals using less polyethylene materials

packaging
over many years qenos has worked with our customers to enable our
polyethylene product to be supplied in refillable shipping containers 18 tonnes
instead of palletised 25 kg bags this has reduced the packaging materials
required and transport costs and has alleviated environmental safety and waste
concerns


in addition to our locally manufactured products qenos provides a wide
selection of imported polymers elastomers and other specialty products
all of these products provide opportunities for australians to become more
resource efficient polyethylene is increasingly used in products that contribute
to efficiency in industry agriculture and domestic settings the fundamental
attribute of polyethylene is its ability to make a fit for use product that has a
lower environmental footprint and across the supply chain provides a lower
total cost compared to alternatives

                               previously the olefins steam drum safety valves had poor
                               access for maintenance
                               due to the tight working conditions and inaccessible
                               bolts there was a considerable risk of strain injury there
                               was also the risk of falling off the steam drum as the
                               positioning of the flanges prevented the use of scaffolding
                               the valves had been installed in this configuration since
                               the original boiler construction in the early 1960s
                               identified by the maintenance group as a high risk

                               sought the support of the engineering department to help
                               implement a solution to a long term problem
                               a proposal to lift the position of the safety valves by
                               inserting a spool between the existing flanges and the
                               safety valves and stagger the position of each flange so
                               that access was not impinged was implemented at the
                               next boiler shutdown
                               this simple effective and low cost solution has eliminated
                               previous risks of strain or falling by allowing scaffolding
                               to be implemented providing safer access for safety valve

quality issues this required the hoppers to be removed for    exceptional
cleaning every 12 to 24 months
                                                               	the new trumpet has run for more than five years and
the only way to clean the polymer from the hopper was             when removed not for quality but for inspection there
to use ultrahigh pressure water blasting at 30000 psi           was less than five percent of the expected polymer build
this involved a hpww technician entering the confined             up
space vessel and cutting through the polymer with a hand       	the new hpww blasting requirement to remove this is
held lance on average it could take up to three weeks of         now half a day as opposed to twelve days therefore
continual water blasting                                         significantly reducing exposure to a high risk task using

	noise  the noise pollution from hpww blasting inside
   an overturned hollow vessel was significant not only for    	man hours have been reduced by more than 98 per
   the technician but also causing the relocation of plant        cent over six years

the low pressure hopper redesign project team at               followed

preventing the hopper from getting coated in polymer          when looking at the risk pyramid elimination is the best

a new design of trumpet cylinder was developed to reduce
turbulence in the hopper and prevent the polymer from          as a result this project was a worthy winner of the qenos

     compressor efficiency upgrade
     a project to improve the capacity and efficiency of a propylene refrigeration compressor
     has reduced steam demand on the qenos olefins site saving water and energy and
     significantly reducing co2 emissions
     the compressor on the altona plant is driven by steam turbine tc551 when under full
     power this used a disproportionate amount of high pressure steam which resulted in
     venting low pressure exhaust steam to atmosphere
     qenos engineers knew that the efficiency of the compressor declined at high loads
     in consultation with the original machine manufacturer siemens of germany they
     concluded that the compressor was suffering impeller eye stall fixing this problem
     would both improve plant capacity and reduce power demand
     this required reengineering the internal workings of c551 and replacing them during a
     plant shutdown the innovative work was undertaken at the 2011 scal 2 turnaround
     when the new internal parts were installed at a cost of a11million
     the result of the change is that site steam demand has been reduced by about 10
     percent for constant ethylene production product rundown to storage capacity has also
     been increased by around 15 percent
     the environmental impacts of this engineering change are significant reductions and
     savings in the annual rates of
