  becoming a trusted source of
  information for many
since joining cosmo oil people tell me that i have been
really fortunate ive been doing work that interests me

one of my ambitions i have more opportunities here to
meet people outside the company than i did in japan so
now i see myself not just as an individual but also as a
representative of the company
    in the future i want to use my experience to perform
my job from a broad perspective on the logistical
operations of the entire company therefore i would like
to make good use of my current situation to gain even
greater knowledge and experience and ultimately
become a trusted source of information for people in and
outside the company

     the sakaide refinery has been helping with local                               in addition to beautifying the community these cleanups
     community cleanups since 2007 the refinery also holds                         offer the opportunity to talk with people even those from
     its own neighborhood cleanup activities each spring and                        my own company who i wouldnt ordinarily see its fun to
     fall bulletin boards around the worksite promote the                          talk with new friends at the postcleanup barbeque
     events and employees volunteer                                                   i grew up here in kagawa prefecture and i wanted to
           the first time i joined a local cleanup the shoreline was               work for a local company so i joined cosmo oil in quality
     not as littered as i had expected apparently that particular                  testing at the sakaide refinery while learning about the
     beach was once covered in plastic bottles washed ashore                       petroleum business something that was completely new
     so these regular cleanups must be making a difference a                                 to me i thought it would be great to be able to
     lot of people from our refinery were there and we had a lot                              contribute to the local community via this kind of
     of fun even the little children were working hard to pick up                               volunteer activity i will certainly participate

kikkawa your promotional campaign filling up your
hearts too has steadily caught the attention of the
japanese public rather than just being a marketing
slogan this phrase directly expresses cosmo oils
commitment to corporate social responsibility employees
must know that the message has reached the public and
should carry out their work accordingly your commitment
to csr is a great asset and it is viewed favorably by
society i think this is true not only in japan but overseas
as well
ogiwara thank you we really want to do our best to live
up to this promise
kikkawa the employees of the cosmo oil group
especially the younger ones should be made aware of
what the group has achieved in abu dhabi i think cosmo
oil is the japanese company that the leaders of abu dhabi
trust most
ogiwara last december the groups development rights
in abu dhabi were renewed for 30 years the group also
obtained new development rights for the hail field which
shows our relationship of trust with the country is
becoming stronger
kikkawa you should respect and make the most of the
trust you have earned as a petroleum company that runs a
supply chain extending from oil exploration and production
to service station operation
