in our efforts to improve our accountability to stakeholders we have for the first time this year started to collate statistical information from all affiliates about the number of direct beneficiaries of oxfams work given the breadth and depth of our work we acknowledge the
difficulties in measuring this we have used our own monitoring systems to compile the data and figures have been rounded as appropriate we have worked hard to avoid any double counting however there is likely to be some overlap between specific activities as some
individuals will be supported in more than one area of our work and we cannot guarantee that in this first full round of joint data collection the data quality assurance process has been followed in all country offices to the same extent no data is available for france japan
ireland and sudan for south sudan myanmar the maghreb country cluster and guatemala data is only available in draft form and therefore not included additional data gaps may occur in relation to our regional programming additional data quality issues for australia
the figures are based on interim data from july 2013 to april 2014 in cambodia the beneficiary numbers may present a slight underestimation as not all partner reports for the financial year 201314 were available by the time this report was produced oxfam novibs data
includes all data for the period 112013  3132014 15 months

8 we consider direct beneficiaries all project participants if they are engaged in project activities and have direct access benefit to the products  services of the project we additionally include those who without being engaged in project activities also obtain direct
   benefit from activities  products  services of the project if the following three criteria apply concurrently 1 nonproject participants are explicitly identified as intended direct beneficiaries in the project plan 2 the benefit has occurred during the relevant financial
   year 201314 ie at the time of counting the benefit should already have materialized with sufficient certainty that the access benefit is direct rather than potential if doubts existed as to the occurrence or materialization of the access benefit the beneficiary was
   not counted 3 there is a direct relationship with the project participants usually through being part of the same household
9 this figure is based on oxfams joint output reporting which was carried out this year for the first time according to shared definitions we counted as partnerships those funding relationships with autonomous independent accountable organizations that are mediated
   by a written contractual agreement and where oxfam has contributed funding during the fy 201314 to achieve shared specific or longterm goals partnerships that did not involve funding were only reported if the relationship was based on a written agreement or if
   the relationship was established at least one year ago and the partner was actively involved in the different stages of the project management cycle including planning  design implementation and mel institutional suppliers consultants and contractors have not been
   considered as partners
