development of the best products we strive to build upon
our technological advances and push the limits of what we
can learn from the human body and its needs in athletic
gear

value for our customers and contribute to a healthier society

customers but also for the world around us

   since the factory became operational labor unions              labor laws and government guidance we also posted
both inside and outside the factory held meetings and              experienced workers with affiliated companies within
major demonstrations in the jakarta area to request a              our group or with other companies by these actions
revision of the minimum wage we were also affected                we were able to maintain our production and shipments
by the submitting of complaints this impeded the                  of products as scheduled
operation of the factory and resulted in a tense labor               i would like to extend our sincere gratitude to asics
management relationship                                           for their cooperation from the opening to the closing of
   making the decision to close the factory and lay off            our operations
about 2500 workers under these circumstances was                     we are looking forward to continuing manufacturing
not an easy task however we were able to complete                quality products with asics at our new locations
this action without major disruption i think this was
a result of our recognition of
the importance of csr which
we acquired through our long
relationship with asics which
enabled us to act appropriately
to various aspects of our labor
relations

  employee counseling
we have been offering counseling to all employees in japan
since 2008 the purpose of this program is to determine the
health status of each employee and to ensure employees
establish a good relationship with the health care office
which manages employee health
   consultations are generally offered every two years or
annually for new employees employees being transferred
overseas or to another department and employees requiring
followup after a regular health checkup
   since the program was launched in 2008 employee                     our one team on sports day at asics europe
awareness of the health care office has increased and more
employees are consulting with this office when they have a
health care question or concern



  the asics healthup plan
in 2010 asics began conducting a yearlong program in                  basketball and softball leagues at asics america
japan called the asics healthup plan to promote healthy
lifestyles among the employees with a fun approach
    participants first choose a health program from a list such
as the walkers rally held four times per year or the quit
smoking campaign and then earn points once the program
is completed participants can win prizes for earning a certain
number of points
    the progress of the programs and the comments of
participants are shared through the intranet and are used
to communicate with those who are not participating in the
program
                                                                        soccer games held at sales conferences at asics america

court for sports and many of our larger offices have a gym
or shower facilities that enable employees to engage in
sports activities such as running during lunchtime or after             sports events at asics america
work at our other locations around the world employees
are encouraged to engage in sports with customers during
internal sales conferences and other events and with
their colleagues during and after work to promote healthy
lifestyles asics europe provides its employees with free

message from management

our founder kihachiro onitsuka had a very clear vision of what he wanted his company to become
in depressed postwar japan he recognized the need to instill hope and optimism in the nations youth
in order to redirect any tendency toward apathy this led mr onitsuka to dedicate the rest of his life to
promoting sport and its positive impact on society
   our goal is to provide products and services that create value for customers and to contribute to a
healthy society this is but only one of the goals that contributes to our companys objective to bring
health and happiness to the world in addition to the sales and distribution of our products and services
through fair business operations we aim to fulfill our social responsibility and to help improve conditions
for communities around the world
   this commitment requires that we take responsibility for everything surrounding us including our
impact on society and the natural world asics is a part of society and as such shall never exploit the
members of society
   no company can achieve longterm success if profits are the principal goal to survive a company
must have an organizational structure that accepts change and fosters power derived from respect not
rules our priority must be to focus on quality of life adopting such an approach will inevitably result in
improved product quality higher employee productivity healthy sales and profitability
   to become a premium brand we must excel at everything we do we must benchmark our performance
to the highest standards which represent perfection by setting an ultimate goal and acknowledging
that it remains to be achieved we will remain humble excellence can be compared to infinity while it
is impossible to envision or arrive at the effort alone is inspiring and provides the direction essential to
progress
   as with any business objective our effort to achieve sustainability would be for naught if we did not
set key performance indicators kpis to measure our progress toward our goal these kpis are essential
to our organization and to measuring the success to which we aspire
   at asics our corporate social responsibility is organized and coordinated within the csr 
sustainability department at our head office and with regional affiliates in europe and north america
