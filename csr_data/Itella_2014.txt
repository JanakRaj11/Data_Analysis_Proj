president of stakeholder relations who is also responsible for group communications and corporate responsibility our
company has not had a similar post before

our employees were a key stakeholder group when we prepared and announced our new vision and strategy during the year
we recruited vision agents internally who worked at workshops on our vision for up until the year 2020 in addition we worked
on our strategy and vision at the g50 meeting which was hosted by our president and ceo the meeting was intended for
managers and experts from various business groups and countries of operation after launching our vision we have organized
numerous vision events in different parts of finland we have also established a vision channel for personnel which they can
use for submitting questions and ideas

we have reported issues considered to be important by our key stakeholders under                                          stakeholder survey

this table presents our key stakeholders and their expectations the table also includes information on key tools and forms of

corporate responsibility  interaction with stakeholders  stakeholder survey




stakeholder survey
during august and september 2013 we examined extensively which corporate responsibility issues our
stakeholders consider to be important and how they think itella has performed in terms of corporate
responsibility

we received more than 2000 responses to our survey from all of our stakeholder groups including consumers business
customers personnel subcontractors the authorities the parliament and the media

we asked our stakeholders how significant they considered various aspects of corporate responsibility to be all of our
stakeholder groups agreed on the importance of corporate responsibility issues employees considered all aspects to be more
important than did the other stakeholder groups

our tax footprint was a new aspect included in the survey and all of the stakeholder groups regarded it as being significant we
began reporting our tax footprint in the summer of 2013 supply chain responsibility was clearly regarded as being more
important than it was in our previous survey which was carried out three years ago in terms of supply chains the need to ensure
ethically sound operations in subcontracting has increased

the issues that our stakeholders found to be most important included information security responsible management and
supervision and transparent operations ensuring longterm profitability providing and developing basic postal services for
citizens in finland and making a commitment to ethical principles were considered to be very significant

compared to earlier surveys stakeholders expectations had increased in terms of transparent operations and financial
responsibility but their expectations had decreased slightly in terms of environmental issues for example however
environmental issues were still considered to be very important

for the first time respondents also included our customers in russia their expectations were similar to those of our finnish
customers however investment in wellbeing at work and longer careers was not regarded as being as significant in russia as
it was in finland in finland ensuring wellbeing at work and raising the age of retirement are frequent topics of public
discussion in addition the energy efficiency of transport and premises was not considered to be as important in russia as it was
among the other stakeholder groups however ensuring information security is a key expectation in terms of corporate
responsibility in russia as well as in finland traffic safety and occupational safety were also regarded as being very important

on the whole the respondents found our corporate responsibility performance to be fairly good

corporate responsibility  corporate responsibility risks




corporate responsibility risks
risk management serves to safeguard and improve business performance and the achievement of
strategic goals by reducing the probability and effects of materialized risks and supporting the utilization
of business opportunities

our corporate responsibility risks are updated twice a year as part of our comprehensive risk management process and they are
reported as a separate item in our risk report the risk report is processed by our corporate responsibility steering group board of
directors audit committee and executive board

during 2013 we identified outsourcing measures related to financial responsibility as a potential corporate responsibility risk in
particular they can have a negative effect on our reputation and consequently cause us to lose customers another risk that we
identified was that of information leaks particularly those related to sensitive personal information information security and
privacy protection were also key concerns in our stakeholder survey

corporate responsibility risks also include those related to corruption and the failure of internal control these are particularly
important in russia poland and the baltic countries in addition investments in russia may be considered to be unethical
because of the social and legal development related to the business environment furthermore accidents that cause extensive
damage to the environment were identified as a key environmental responsibility risk

corporate responsibility  corporate responsibility risks  challenges in 2013




challenges in 2013
during the year our video coding pilot project attracted negative attention for itella at the end of may we launched a cooperation
program with postnl the national postal service of the netherlands on an optical reading system for addresses in deliveries
during the pilot phase of approximately six months we purchased the coding service from postnl shore a subsidiary of postnl
in the philippines although postnl pays special attention to corporate responsibility we wanted to include a clause in the
agreement that ensures that all rules of corporate responsibility are respected even in the pilot phase in addition we performed
an audit in the philippines to ensure compliance with corporate responsibility despite positive experiences we decided not to
continue the cooperation after the pilot project

in addition itellas subsidiary in the british virgin islands attracted negative publicity in 2013 in 2008 we acquired the russian
nlc subgroup which included nlc international corporation in the british virgin islands and three companies owned by nlc
international corporation in cyprus we have reported our ownership since 2008 as part of our financial reporting we have also
included the company located in the virgin islands in our tax return in accordance with finnish tax regulations the company
located in the british virgin islands was registered in cyprus in october and itella no longer has operations in the british virgin
islands

in april we filed a criminal complaint with the police on the suspected use of postis electronic consumer services which require
registration for fraudulent purposes by using stolen identity information to redirect shipments ordered from online shops we
also reported the incident to the finnish communications regulatory authority we believe that the criminal or criminals had
acquired user ids and passwords in conjunction with an earlier security breach related to the services of a provider other than
posti the users whose information had been compromised had used the same user id and password for several services
which enabled the criminal or criminals to access postis services

reputation risks that materialized in 2013 included news stories related to the digitization service provided by opuscapita to
business customers claiming that itella opens 80000 postal shipments per day however we operate in accordance with the
finnish postal act some recipients have made agreements with us on opening and scanning letters if the recipient wants its
letters to be converted into electronic format their digitization does not compromise the recipients constitutional right to the
privacy of correspondence

negative public statements also emerged after the media release issued in august by the finnish post and logistics union pau
the press release was related to cooperation negotiations at the finance and accounting services unit of opuscapita stating
that itella was transferring jobs abroad from finland although some tasks in financial administration may be transferred to
opuscapitas foreign units at some point the jobs will stay at opuscapita and will not be outsourced

in late 2013 we experienced disruptions in our postal service as a result of the failure of the collective labor agreement
negotiations which led to a situation where no agreement was in force the parties were the finnish post and logistics union
pau and service sector employers palta industrial action caused a backlog and delays in postal deliveries around finland
however a strike was avoided when a collective agreement for the postal industry was reached at the end of november

corporate responsibility  responsible sourcing




responsible sourcing
more efficient sourcing is an integral part of the new performance improvement program that we
launched in april the program aims to accumulate eur 100 million in cost savings

during 2013 we adopted a new groupwide operating model for sourcing in order to ensure consistent operating methods and
more efficient solutions based on business needs we have centralized all orders in our selected sourcing channels and to
preselected suppliers more efficient operations have enabled us to reduce the number of active suppliers from 17000 to less
than 10000

purchases are classified into six main categories which all take corporate responsibility into account as part of the new
operating model we also implemented supplycenter a new sourcing channel

during the year we actively communicated changes in the operating model through various internal channels and organized
training events and online training for personnel

we have defined a supplier code of conduct that applies to all of our service providers and suppliers in addition to legality the
supplier code of conduct includes principles related to corruption human rights child labor discrimination working conditions
and environmental concerns

during the year we monitored how well our suppliers know the guidelines and comply with them we submitted a self
assessment form to nearly 600 key suppliers almost 400 of them completed the assessment the focus was on the suppliers
level of familiarity with the general guidelines most of the respondents were finnish suppliers and the response rate was
highest in the transport industry russia has not yet been included in the audit we did not conduct separate human rights audits
during the year

we had not performed a similar supplier audit previously part of the suppliers who completed the assessment will be audited
on a more accurate level during the year 2014 with this we want to make sure that the answers given in the selfassessment
are correct the percentage of selfassessments has also been a sourcing performance indicator since the beginning of 2014

in 2013 we joined the supplier ethical data exchange sedex network as a service provider we hold b membership of the
network up until now we have provided three of our customer companies with ethical data through sedex with more than
30000 members sedex is the largest collaborative platform for managing and sharing ethical supply chain data it shares
information in four key areas health and safety labor standards business ethics and the environment

financial responsibility




we implement our financial responsibility by reforming our business operations and improving our
profitability in line with our strategy and by supporting the competitiveness of our customer companies
and the public sector

we are a stateowned company that operates on market terms and our operations are entirely based on the revenue received
from our customers about half of our operations are related to postal services the rest consist of logistics and financial
management services provided to corporate customers

our financial responsibility management is described in more detail under                                  financial responsibility management

not exceed 35 and the annual net sales increases at least to an extent which corresponds to the sectors growth we also
intend to double our net sales in russia by 2020

corporate responsibility  financial responsibility  tax footprint




we began reporting our tax footprint
corporate taxes and tax heavens were discussed frequently in 2013 in our survey all of our
stakeholder groups considered tax footprint reporting to be important

we want to lead the way and report our tax footprint as openly and transparently as possible during the summer of 2013 we
calculated our tax footprint for the first time and published our tax information for 2012 on our website we report our tax
information in accordance with ifrs by geographical segments finland scandinavia russia and the baltic countries and other
countries this information will be reported regularly as part of our corporate responsibility reporting

we are a significant taxpayer by paying taxes and other public fees we contribute to improving wellbeing in society

because of itellas weakened profitability the income taxes itella has paid declined remarkably from the previous year
companies pay significant amounts of other taxes than income taxes the amount of these other taxes are not dependent on
companys profitability but for example paid salaries although 76 of itellas net sales come from finland itella pays 84 of all
income taxes and similar taxes and fees in finland in addition to this we collect significant amounts of remittable taxes such as
value added taxes that are remitted as part of business operations to tax collectors in different countries

corporate responsibility  financial responsibility  case openness on taxation




greater openness on taxation
 corporate tax contributions have hit the headlines over the past year however until now the public debate has been limited to
corporation tax which companies pay on their profits and which in actual fact makes up just a small proportion of all tax payable
by commercial enterprises

in spring 2013 we requested all companies subject to state ownership steering to submit a report on their tax liabilities broken
down by tax category and country the aim of this exercise was to find out how the companies under our steerage would
communicate their tax affairs at the time few companies volunteered information beyond the statutory requirement laid down in
finnish accounting legislation a significant shift is now underway however itella began reporting its tax footprint in the summer
and i am confident that other companies subject to state ownership steering are planning to expand on the information they
provide i consider this to be an extremely positive development

from our point of view it is important that companies are as open and transparent as possible in their communications about
tax full disclosure of their tax footprint is always an advantage for commercial enterprises as it is an opportunity for them to
demonstrate their corporate social responsibility and because the information is of interest to all stakeholder groups the eu
policies on corporate social responsibility and the new g4 guidance from the global reporting initiative require a more extensive
and detailed approach to tax disclosures

during the year we had to make difficult decisions related to personnel and launch several cooperation
negotiations

reasons related to production and finance and 20 personyears were reduced through voluntary resignations and pension plans

acting in a responsible and controlled manner is important to us we are seeking solutions to the effects on employment in
collaboration with personnel organizationsthe ongoing transformation of the postal industry and the continually decreasing
volumes require operational changes that may have effects on personnel in the future

in finland we have made an agreement on change security with the finnish post and logistics union pau change security will
be applied to all of our personnel groups in accordance with the agreement it will be implemented in conjunction with
cooperation negotiations based on productionrelated and financial reasons

as much as possible we seek to reduce the number of redundancies through voluntary arrangements if redundancies are
implemented the affected employees are entitled to a change security allowance equivalent to their salary during the period of
notice the change security allowance is paid at the end of the employment relationship

at the beginning of 2014 we launched the uusi polku new path support program for our personnel the program offers training

services its intended for people who work in transport sorting distribution warehousing or customer service roles and who
have at least three years of practical experience on the job

to gain a qualification while working fulltime for the most part all the learning happened on the job and i also did some more
formal exercises on the side the qualification also included some contact teaching time i did my onthejob training in germany

spurred me on i can definitely recommend an apprenticeship to anyone

environmental responsibility




the goal of our environmental program is to reduce emissions by 30 by 2020 between 2007 and 2013 our carbon dioxide
emissions in relation to net sales decreased by 20 which clearly exceeds the goal we have reduced the fuel consumption of
our vehicles and we have improved the energy efficiency of our premises by reducing our consumption of electricity and heat
and purchasing 100 green electricity

according to a sustainability report published by the international post corporation ipc companies in the postal industry have
decreased their carbon dioxide emissions by a total of 194 over a period of five years the replacement of vehicles has had the
most significant effect on carbon dioxide emissions the increasing number of vehicles running on alternative fuels has had the
most significant effect in 2007 the ipc set a common goal for its members to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the postal
industry by 20 by 2020


environmental damage in shushary was remediated

no significant environmental damage took place in 2013 in the serious warehouse accident in shushary in st petersburg in
2012 part of the shelving system collapsed the accident damaged customer products to a significant degree and itella was
also required to carry out environmental protection and cleaning measures we continued to develop our environmental
management and acquired the iso 14001 certification for the shushary warehouse

corporate responsibility  environmental responsibility  vehicle emissions




vehicles represent the largest part of emissions
our fleet of 4000 commercial vehicles records a total of more than 125 million kilometers each year
vehicles represent more than 80 of the total carbon dioxide emissions of our company

we reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by planning routes efficiently combining deliveries and driving in an
environmentally responsible manner in addition our goal is to increase the share of alternative vehicles to 40 of our delivery
vehicles by 2020

in the fall we began the installation of driving style monitoring devices in our delivery and transport vehicles in total monitoring
devices will be installed in approximately 3200 itella posti vehicles and around 800 itella logistics vehicles all of our delivery
vehicles will have driving style monitoring devices by the end of june 2014

in november we acquired 25 biogas vehicles most of them are used for mail delivery in the capital region biogas produces no
harmful particles and practically no greenhouse gas emissions during its life cycle

we also deliver mail by foot and by bicycle about 1400 delivery routes are handled by bicycle every day we also use
environmentally friendly electric carts and electric cars and 1000 electric bicycles up until now increasing the number of
electric cars in delivery has been challenging as electric cars suitable for winter conditions in finland are not available about
half of the mopeds we use are electric

corporate responsibility  environmental responsibility  energy and waste efficiency




we improve the energy and waste efficiency of
our premises
we want to continually improve the energy and waste efficiency of our premises completed in early
june the pennala logistics center was built in accordance with green construction principles together
with the old warehouse pennala offers more than 100000 square meters of warehouse space for the
customers of itella logistics

the center has a voicecontrolled collection system and automated forklifts among other features in addition it has energy
saving external wall panels and a hybrid heating system that uses geothermal heat and gas located in the middle of our shop
and customer network the center serves to improve efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of delivery transports among
other aspects

our goal is to cut down 2 of the electricity consumption of our properties and 3 of heat consumption annually until 2015 in
2013 we were very successful compared to last year energy consumption of large properties decreased by 2487gwh 41
and heat consumption of large properties by 1680 gwh 44 temperatureadjusted large properties such as warehouses
terminals and postal centers use about 75 of all electricity

we actively seek to reduce landfill waste and improve the efficiency of sorting we monitor the amounts of waste produced by
large sorting centers on a monthly basis our goal is to keep the share of mixed waste of all waste at a maximum of 2 we did
not reach this goal mixed waste represented about 10 of our total waste

100 carbon neutral choices
all of the letters newspapers magazines parcels and direct marketing items delivered by posti are
completely carbonneutral itella green services for our customers

by using itella green products our customers can reduce carbon dioxide emissions in their supply chain processes and
communicate to their customers that their operations are environmentally responsible

we primarily reduce emissions through projects that are directly related to our operations the emissions generated by our
services are calculated as part of our annual environmental calculations we neutralize the remaining carbondioxide
emissions related to the transport and delivery of itella green products by funding climate projects in practice if transporting
one letter produces 20 grams of carbon dioxide we use certified climate projects to ensure that an equal amount of emissions
is reduced somewhere else

we carry out climate projects in countries that have no emission ceilings we do not implement climate projects in finland or
other kyoto protocol countries that have binding targets

responsibility cover our operations with the greatest environmental impact in all of our countries of operation in finland the
environmental calculations also include the environmental impact of subcontracted transport

carbon dioxide emissions cover all of our business operations the key standards applied in our environmental accounting are

      the wbcsd world business council for sustainable development greenhouse gas protocol and
      the ghg inventory standard for the postal sector which includes more detailed instructions for the postal industry

accordance with the ifrs standards approved by the european union the consolidated financial statements are prepared in
compliance with the ias and ifrs standards valid on december 31 2013 and the related sic standards and ifric
interpretations the notes to the consolidated financial statements are prepared in compliance with finnish accounting and
