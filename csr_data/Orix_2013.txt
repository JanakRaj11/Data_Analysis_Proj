                          able to use their assets effectively customers will benefit from reduced demand for internal air conditioning at
their facilities due to the heatshielding effect of the solar panels and a reduced rate of roof aging orix is also developing solar power
generation businesses using the rooftops of commercial facilities and other properties owned by the orix group

     furthermore households can store or sell any surplus electricity generated through the combined use of storage batteries and a
     solar power system when surplus electricity is stored the household will aim for energy selfsufficiency by reducing the amount of
     power purchased from the electric power company even when surplus electricity is sold instead of stored there is no double power
     generation this allows households to sell power on advantageous terms without any losses
      double power generation allows households to sell a greater amount of power by combining solar power systems with fuel cells or storage batteries for household use a lower
       feedin tariff rate has been set for double power generation compared with power generated only by solar power systems
