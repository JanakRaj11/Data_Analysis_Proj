borrowing costs
predelivery payment assets are regarded as qualifying assets for the
purpose of the capitalisation of borrowing costs exchange differences
arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are
regarded as an adjustment to interest costs are capitalised as part of
borrowing costs as these expenses are considered part of the cost of
borrowing in foreign currency


taxation
judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes
due to the complexity of legislation there are many transactions and
calculations for which the ultimate taxation determination is uncertain
during the ordinary course of business the group recognises liabilities for
anticipated taxation audit issues based on estimates of whether additional
taxes will be due where the final taxation outcome of these matters is
different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences
will impact the income taxation and deferred taxation provisions in the
period in which such determination is made


recovery of deferred tax assets
the group recognises the net future taxation benefit related to deferred
income taxation assets to the extent that it is probable that the deductible
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future assessing
the recoverability of deferred income taxation assets requires the group
to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable
income estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash
flows from operations and the application of existing taxation laws in
each jurisdiction to the extent that future cash flows and taxable income
differ significantly from estimates the ability of the group to realise the
net deferred taxation assets recorded at the end of the reporting period
could be impacted

     interest and related foreign currency amounts incurred on account of aircraft and other qualifying assets under construction are capitalised and added
     to the asset concerned and therefore do not affect profit or loss


     the movements are recognised in other comprehensive income until such time as the other qualifying asset is complete and the aircraft has been
     delivered and recognised in which case these amounts are no longer recognised and are expensed in profit or loss when incurred the effect of a 5
     movement in foreign exchange would be rnil 2013 rnil and of a 2 interest rate adjustment would be rnil 2013 rnil


     the effect of the movement in the interest rate was only calculated for the estimated period that the loan will be outstanding
