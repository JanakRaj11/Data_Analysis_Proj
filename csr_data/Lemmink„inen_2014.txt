 electricity purchased 203 gkwh source iea 5year average 20072011
the coefficient for purchased electricity is obtained annually from data published by the iea
we have defined co₂ as the most significant greenhouse gas these emissions are generated by both transportation and energy consumption in our own
operations
scope 1 emissions cover the entire groups energy consumption and all the vehicles and fuel cards that we own
scope 2 covers the emissions generated during the production of electricity and district heating at our production facilities
our scope 3 coverage is currently being defined
in addition to co₂ we also cause environmental loading through for example noise dust vibration and odour pollution and sox nox and small particle
emissions

 the goodwill reported in the common to segment column has arisen from the asphalt business acquisitions in denmark and norway it is allocated to the
international operations baltic rim region paving and mineral aggregates cash generating unit this goodwill has been tested for impairment at the level of the
whole international operations baltic rim region paving and mineral aggregates cash generating unit in addition the goodwill allocated to each business area has
been tested separately for each country
goodwill impairment tests

goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indications of possible impairment the tests are carried out
as valueinuse calculations of individual businesses in accordance with the smallest cashgenerating unit principle in
impairment testing the discounted present value of the recoverable cash flows of each cashgenerating unit is compared with
the carrying amount of the unit in question if the present value is lower than the carrying amount the difference is recognised
through profit or loss as an expense in the current year

in 2013 the impairment tests were carried out during the third quarter of the year the tests showed that the current values of
the future cash flows exceed the book values in all business units therefore there was no need for impairment of goodwill in
2013
forecasts and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing

cash flow calculations of the cash generating units are prepared for a planning period covering the next 5 years in accordance
with the managements estimates these estimates are based on past experience cash flow forecasts beyond that planning
period are based on the cautious assumption of 1 percent annual growth this was lower than european central banks inflation
rate forecast over the medium term in effect at the time of impairment testing

the weighted average cost of capital wacc calculated for each individual unit is used as the discount factor wacc takes
into account the riskfree interest rate the liquidity premium the expected market rate of return the industrys beta value
country risk and the debt interest rate including the interest rate margin these components are weighted according to the
fixed average target capital structure of the sector pretax wacc is determined seperately for each tested unit

 the figures should not be regarded as forecasts for the entire business segment since the averages are calculated only for the cashgenerating unit to which the
goodwill has been allocated when calculating the average the differences in the size of the cashgenerating units are taken into account by weighting the figures
according to the net sales of the units
 the change in the international operations average growth rate of net sales is mainly due to building construction business in russia
sensitivity analysis

in connection with the impairment tests sensitivity analyses are made to determine how possible changes in key assumptions
of the unitspecific impairment tests would affect the results of those tests the key assumptions affecting the present value
of cash flows are the development of market and competitive conditions the scope and profitability of the tested business and
the discount factor in the sensitivity analyses the calculation variables affecting these assumptions are varied and the effects
of the changes on the margin between the carrying value and present value of the cash flows are examined

sensitivity analysis showed that reasonable and ordinary variation to key counting assumptions common to lemminkäinens
business areas would not cause a need for a significant impairment most of the groups recognised goodwill belongs to the
international operations segment arising from the acquisitions of the nordic paving units and to the technical building services
segment margins between the current values of cash flows and the book values are wide in the baltic sea area paving and
mineral affregates as well as the technical building services of the tested cash generating units most sensitive for changes is
the infrastructure segments mineral affregates unit there is risk for an impairment of goodwill less than eur 09 million for
this unit additional tests for impairment are carried out if the sensitivity tests or possible changes in the future expectations
merit them long term predictability of the lemminkäinens business units is reasonably good and the risk for the impairment of
goodwill is small

32 financial risk management
in its business operations lemminkäinen group is exposed to financial risks mainly interest rate foreign exchange rate
funding liquidity and credit risks the aim of the groups financial risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the
possible impacts that changes in fair values on the financial markets could have on the groups result cash flow and value the
management of financial risks is based on principles approved by the board of directors the treasury policy defines the
principles and division of responsibilities with regard to financial activities and the management of financial risk the policy is
reviewed and if necessary updated at least annually

execution of the treasury policy is the responsibility of the group treasury which is mainly responsible for the management of
financial risks and handles the groups treasury activities on a centralised basis the groups treasury policy defines the division
of responsibilities between the group treasury and business units in each subarea the group companies are responsible for
providing the group treasury with uptodate and accurate information on treasuryrelated matters concerning their business
operations the group treasury serves as an internal bank and coordinates directs and supports the group companies in
treasury matters such that the groups financial needs are met and its financial risks are managed effectively in line with the
treasury policy

interest rate risk
the aim of lemminkäinen groups interest rate risk management is to minimise changes affecting the result cash flows and
value of the group due to interest rate fluctuations the group treasury manages and monitors the interest rate position the
groups interest rate risk primarily comprises fixedrate and variablerate loan and leasing agreements interestbearing
financial receivables and interest rate derivatives interest rate changes affect items in the income statement and balance sheet

the interest rate risk is decreased by setting the groups average period of interest rate fixation to the same as the interest rate
sensitivity of its business the interest rate sensitivity position of the groups business is estimated to be about 15 months the
treasury policy thus defines the groups average period of interest rate fixation as 1218 months the group aims to keep 40
65 per cent of its liabilities per currency hedged

the group can have both variable and fixedrate longterm borrowings the ratio of fixed and variablerate borrowings can be
changed by using interest rate derivatives in 2013 the group has used interest rate swaps for managing interest rate risks part
of the interest rate swaps are used for hedge accounting and a hedging result of those derivatives will have impact on interest
expenses until the year 2014 there was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedge accounting during the financial year

interest rate fluctuations in 2013 did not have any unusual effect on the groups business but a significant rise in the level of
interest rates may have a detrimental effect on the demand for housing
sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk

the following assumptions are made when calculating the sensitivity caused by a change in the level of interest rates
the interest rate change is assumed to be 1 percentage point
the position includes variablerate financial liabilities variablerate financial receivables and interest rate derivatives
all factors other than the change in interest rates remain constant
taxes have not been taken into account when calculating sensitivity

foreign exchange rate risk
the aim of foreign exchange rate risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the possible impacts that changes in
exchange rates could have on the future values of cash flows business receivables and liabilities and other balance sheet
items exchange rate risk mainly consists of transaction risk and translation risk

translation risk consists of foreign exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the income statements and balance
sheets of foreign group companies into the groups functional currency in practice the groups reportable translation risk is
caused by equity investments in foreign entities and their retained earnings the effects of which are recorded under translation
differences in shareholders equity lemminkäinen group has foreign net investments in several currencies in accordance with
the treasury policy lemminkäinen group protects itself from translation risks primarily by keeping equity investments in foreign
entities at an appropriately low level and thus does not use financial instruments to hedge the translation risks

transaction risk consists of cash flows in foreign currencies from operational and financial activities the group seeks to hedge
business currency risks primarily by operative means the remaining transaction risk is hedged by using instruments such as
foreign currency loans and foreign currency derivatives the group companies are responsible for identifying reporting
forecasting and hedging their transaction risk positions internally the group treasury is responsible for hedging the groups risk
positions as external transactions in accordance with the treasury policy the general rule is that the major net positions
forecasted for the 12 months following the review date are hedged with a hedging ratio ranging from 25100 per cent and
emphasising the first six months

the key currencies in which the group was exposed to transaction risk in 2013 were swedish krona and russian rouble in

funding and liquidity risk
the group seeks to optimise the use of liquid assets in funding its business operations and to minimise interest and other
finance costs the group treasury is responsible for managing the groups overall liquidity and ensuring that adequate credit
lines and a sufficient number of different funding sources are available it also ensures that the maturity profile of the groups
loans and credit facilities is spread sufficiently evenly over coming years as set out in the treasury policy at the end of the
accounting period the maturity schedule of the groups interestbearing liabilities was frontloaded the primary reasons for
this are the eur 60 million bond that matures in october 2014 and the maturing pension loans with instalment plans current
interestbearing liabilities also include borrowings of housing companies under construction totalling eur 731 million these
borrowings will be transferred to the buyers of the coop shares when the units are handed over regarding unsold housing
units the group will bear the liability by paying financial consideration for the units in question the groups available financing
sources and liquid assets are sufficient to cover the obligations arising from current interestbearing liabilities

according to the treasury policy the groups liquidity reserve shall at all times match the groups total liquidity requirement and
it must be accessible within five banking days without any additional charges being incurred the groups total liquidity
requirement consists of the liquidity requirement of daytoday operations risk premium needs and the strategic liquidity
requirement the groups liquidity management is based on monthly forecasts of funding requirements and daily cash flow
forecasting the groups excess liquidity is managed by means of internal transactions and cash pools

due to the nature of the groups business operations seasonal borrowing is of great importance the effect of seasonal
variation on shortterm liquidity is controlled by using a commercial paper programme committed credit limits and bank
overdraft facilities the total amount of the groups commercial paper programme is eur 300 million eur 300 mill of
which eur 1502 million eur 868 mill was in use at 31 december 2013 in march 2013 lemminkäinen agreed on financial
arrangements totalling eur 255 million arrangements comprised a eur 185 million threeyear syndicated revolving credit
facility and a eur 70 million two year syndicated term facility the credit facilities are binding and unsecured arrangements
replaced eur 160 million bilateral credit facilities which were originally set to mature in december 2013 in december
lemminkäinen terminated the eur 70 million credit facility mentioned above at the end of the year the group had unused
committed credit facilities amounting to eur 1750 million eur 1396 mill and overdraft limits amounting to eur 440
million 541 the amount of liquid assets at 31 december 2013 was eur 811 million eur 939 mill

credit risk
credit risks arise when a counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligations casusing the other party to suffer a financial
loss lemminkäinen has defined a credit policy for customer receivables that aims to boost profitable sales by identifying credit
risks in advance and controlling them most of the groups business is based on established and trustworthy customer
relationships and on contractual terms generally observed in the industry the credit policy sets the minimum requirements
concerning trade credit and collections for lemminkäinen group the groups credit control function defines credit risks and the
business units are responsible for managing them

the group is exposed to credit risk through the groups trade receivables and receivables associated with deposits and
receivables the maximum amount of credit risk is the combined total of the balance sheet values of the aforementioned items
the amounts and due dates of the groups trade receivables are presented in the table below the group does not have any
significant credit risk concentrations as trade receivables are distributed among many different customers in a number of
market areas the business unit that made the contract actively monitors the receivables situation if the business units
renegotiate the terms of the receivables they must do so in accordance with the requirements of the groups credit policy the
risk of credit losses can be reduced by means of guarantees mainly bank guarantees and bank deposits lemminkäinens credit
losses have been minimal in relation to the scale of its operations the main risks are associated with business in russia as a
general rule construction projects in russia are only undertaken against receipt of advance payments if in exceptional
situations a credit risk is taken the amount permitted is always proportional to the expected margin on the project in question
receiveables transferred for legally enforceable collection are recognised as credit losses

management of capital and the capital structure
capital means the equity and interestbearing liabilities shown on lemminkäinens consolidated balance sheet lemminkäinen
groups capital management ensures costeffectively that all of the groups business sectors maintain their business viability
at a competitive level in all cyclical conditions that riskcarrying capacity is adequate for example in construction contracts
and that the company is able to pay a good dividend and service its borrowings

the amount of the groups interestbearing liabilities is affected by factors such as scale of operations seasonal changes in
production acquisitions and investments in or the sale of production equipment buildings and land the company
continuously monitors especially the amount of debt the ratio of net debt to ebitda and the equity ratio

some of the groups financial arrangements include two financial covenants the ratio of net debt to ebitda and the equity
ratio which are monitored quarterly and calculated as an average of four previous quarters in march 2013 lemminkäinen and
the other contracting parties agreed that potential damages related to the claimed asphalt cartel will be ignored in the
calculation model of financial covenants furthermore before the end of the financial period the company reached an
agreement with other parties on changes in the net debt to ebitda covenant terms for q42013 and q12014

the groups equity includes a eur 70 million hybrid bond which was issued in 2012 the hybrid bond is classified as equity
instrument but the bond holders do not have any rights of a shareholders and the bond does not dilute shareholders ownership
in the company the hybrid bond is unsecured and junior to all other borrowings of the company the bond has no maturity date
but company has the right to redeem it at its own discretion after four years of the issuance date

the company also follows the development of equity by means of the return on investment a longterm average in excess of 18
per cent is regarded as a good return the return on investment in 2013 was 94 per cent 108
