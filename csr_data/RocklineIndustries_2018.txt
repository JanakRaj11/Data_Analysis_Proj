      wet wipes coﬀee ﬁlters and baking cups rocklines current manufacturing
      processes rely heavily on nonrenewable resources which poses a longterm risk the

             our wet wipe operations use signiﬁcant quantities of water to formulate lotions for
             our wet wipe products although some of our lotion is purchased premixed in
             reusable containers called totes the majority of the lotion we use is mixed onsite in
             our specialized chemical mix departments because the amount and type of lotions
             used in our products are largely determined by our customers we have chosen
             instead to focus on increasing the eﬃciency of our water use an area over which we
             have more direct operational control

             our coﬀee ﬁlter and baking cup operations use comparatively limited amounts of
             water water is primarily used to test the ﬂow rates of coﬀee ﬁlters and to generate
             steam which is used to give basketstyle coﬀee ﬁlters and paper baking cups their
             distinctive shapes

             outside of ﬁnished goods we use water for a range of other purposes our products
             undergo extensive quality testing before we ship them for public consumption and
             many of these tests require water rockline also uses water to ﬂush clean and
             sanitize piping and other machinery used to deliver lotion to the production lines
             wastewater continues to be one of the most challenging of all of our sustainability
             goals although we will not sacriﬁce quality to save water we can increase our focus
             toward more eﬃcient water use even in testing and cleaning we have the
             opportunity to increase the accuracy of the methodology we use to track the amount
             of water in the products that we ship currently we make estimates based on
             production statistics and product speciﬁcations




             initiatives
              our springdale ar plant implemented improvement within the line vacuum
               system which resulted in a wastewater reduction further improvements will
               be made in 2018
              our montville nj plant a relatively small consumer of water was able to
               identify an issue related to the steam system resulting in wastewater
               reduction
              our booneville ar plant is working with process engineering to identify issue
               points within the process and identify improvement opportunities
              our redditch uk plant launched a major project to track water usage they
               realized signiﬁcant reductions in wastewater
              our russellville ar plant is beginning a project to reduce excess solution
               waste in fy18

               a meter previously identiﬁed as incoming water at our booneville ar plant was correctly identiﬁed
15             as a wastewater meter corrections were made back to our baseline year resulting in lower overall
               water consumption in 2015 and 2016

                waste is the ineﬃcient use of resources rockline deﬁned solid waste as all waste
                leaving our facilities regardless of how it is generated or handled our coﬀee ﬁlter
                and baking cup production generates a high amount of waste because the ﬁlters are
                cut from square sheets of paper even though the paper scrap is recycled it is still
                considered waste because a truly eﬃcient process would use all the paper
                rockline focuses on the measuring reducing and eliminating of waste from our
                manufacturing processes to provide better value to our customers every step we
                take toward reducing solid waste relieves a portion of the demand placed on
                natural resources

                we realized higher than normal increases of waste on the wet wipes side in part
                because we included our russellville ar plant into our metrics russellville is still
                ramping up as new lines are added other increases were realized due to a
                signiﬁcant amount of remnant inventory being dispositioned throughout the year




                 initiatives
                  our montville nj plant realized waste reductions for fy17 through machine
                   modiﬁcations on a ﬁlters line
                  our sheboygan wi plant installed realtime waste monitoring equipment to
                   provide visibility and allow for early corrections
                  our springdale ar plant implemented a plant focus on waste reduction
                   resulting in an 8 reduction from the baseline year
                  our booneville ar plant has worked and is working with multiple lines to
                   reduce the amount of waste created at the start of runs
                  our sheboygan wi plant established equipment setup parameters on

looking ahead
as always i want to thank you for taking the time to read the 2017 edition of
our environmental sustainability report this year we faced many challenges
we overcame many and fell short on a few but challenges have a tendency
to spark new opportunities since we are committed to continuous
improvement and open disclosure im excited to see where this journey
takes us and share it with you



there has been much conversation surrounding sustainability and its eﬀect
on climate change even though some have taken actions to separate from
global initiatives like the paris agreement im proud to say that rockline has
remained steady in our commitment and steady in our belief in the science
around climate change 2017 was an exciting year for rockline we realized
growth in many areas which resulted in the announcement of the addition
of our 6th manufacturing site in the us and 7th globally located in
morristown tn the construction of the new facility is underway with our
sustainability goals in mind finally im proud to say that we at rockline as
always operate with our values at the forefront respect renew integrity
teamwork and excellence


thanks to everyone at rockline who contributed to the journey please feel
free to contact me with any questions or suggestions


looking forward to the future
