ethical matters related to lending
an important matter in terms of ethics and
principles is the extent to which the bank should
bear the responsibility for what its customers do
this could for example apply to a borrower who
runs a company that manufactures products
that are dangerous to health with an adverse
environmental impact or that does not permit
its employees to exercise their union rights
    handelsbankens view is based on the princi
ple that it is the customer that is fully responsible
for its operation and how they are run however a

ing is that the operation is legally compliant and
fulﬁls all requirements from public authorities in

things in the banks credit policy which states
that in its lending operations the bank must
