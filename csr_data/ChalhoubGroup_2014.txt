 note although the impacts of all our material issues are across the group the qualitative and quantitative data of this report are only covering our
  uae operations with best practice examples across the region wherever possible therefore the majority of our aspect boundaries are only on our
  uae operations we intend to increase the boundaries of our report in the near future


our approach to reporting is evolving and therefore we plan to expand the boundary and scope of our
sustainability performance in the future

     unforgettable to be honest i was not able to sleep that night beside all doors that the scholarship
     will open for me i felt that there is still hope for syria the fact that there are still people who intend
     to help syrian youth and contribute to the future of syria regardless of our ethnicity religions and
     political views this fact gives me the hope that we will be able to rebuild our country again
     lastly i assure you that i will do my best to excel in university and be as expected a good

every year we contribute to numerous social and environmental initiatives that
have positive impacts on the communities we operate in going forward we
aspire to investigate the social return on investment sroi on these initiatives
which would allow us to measure the wider concept of value generated
through social investments and take into account the social economic and
environmental factors when calculating the organisations growth this would
enable us to evaluate the impact on beneficiaries identify ways to improve social
or environmental performance and enhance the performance of investments

      in collaboration with the dubai chamber of commerce for our uaebased contractors and
      suppliers in order to assist the supplier procurement process
      the questionnaire has been developed to gather information on topics pertaining to suppliers
      governance structure and business integrity in addition the questionnaire helps determine
      whether our suppliers comply with human rights child labour and local labour laws as part of
      the recruitment procedures
      we have an existing list of contractors and suppliers who voluntarily comply with our principles
      our aim is to engage and form partnerships with many more suppliers who share our business
      values
      currently our 3d business unit conducts periodic supplier reviews and selects contractors based
      on the business ethics criteria specified in the sustainable supplier questionnaire we strive to
      encourage our suppliers to show commitment to social and environmental compliance in
      the coming years we intend to employ independent auditors to conduct supplier audits that
