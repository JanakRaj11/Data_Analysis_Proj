fashion department store
rådhuset is one of uppsalas most wellknown
profile buildings and it is an important landmark
few places in uppsala  if any  have a history that
is as long and exciting as rådhusets a great deal
has taken place in the building which was
damaged by citywide fires twice in 1702 and
1766 we bought the building in 2006 and carefully
renovated it showing the utmost respect for the
soul and history of the building and since 2012
rådhuset has been a fashion department store

      electricity is responsible for the greatest share of our energy                     we have reduced our energy consumption by 16 per cent
      consumption usually we provide the tenants with electricity                       since 2014 the reduction is due in part to increased focus
      and with a few exceptions we charge on the basis of actual                        on energyrelated issues implemented operational optimisa
      consumption which creates incentives for resource efficiency                      tions and other measures but it is mostly due to changes in
      some tenants have their own subscription                                           our property portfolio a comparison of identical portfolios
           a majority of our properties use district heating as their                     indicates that energy consumption has dropped by 9 per
      heat source we also have two properties with geothermal                            cent we have also developed our system for monitoring
      heating and one project property which is heated with wood                          energy consumption and have created monthly followup
      pellets and oil comfort cooling has been installed in the                           reports the aim is to monitor the energy consumption of

       partly by district cooling and partly by selfgenerated cooling                     goal attainment for the entire property portfolio
           as the properties become more energy efficient in the use                             we believe in the importance of helping our customers in
       phase an ever greater proportion of their total energy con                         their efforts to achieve resource efficiency consequently our

topsy and siljan were the names of the first
chocolate bars produced at the chocolate
factory in sundbyberg at the end of the
1910s the chocolate factory ceased opera
tions 60 years later because the business had
grown to the point that the factory had become
too small the old industrial character including
the generous ceiling height and large windows
was preserved for the buildings current office
operations
sundbyberg as a whole is growing by leaps and
bounds more residentials is being planned for

investments and projects




      investments in our
      own properties
      acquisitions and sales

       property development is an important aspect of atrium
      ljungbergs value growth our existing project portfolio will enable us
      to invest the equivalent of approximately sek 11 billion in the future
      the goal is to invest sek 1 billion per year in our own development
      projects where new build and extension projects yield a return of
       20 per cent thus generating good value growth within the company and
       growth in the companys cash flows the projects help us achieve our
       growth objective of a 10 per cent increase in the operating net per annum

      in terms of area half of our project portfolio consists of
      residentials and half of offices retail education and hotels the project
      portfolio is divided among all of our areas where sickla and uppsala
      account for approximately 70 per cent

      the rate at which we can complete the projects depends on the
      market situation and the progress made in the detailed development
      plan process these issues are handled by our business development
      staff on a daily basis in close collaboration with internal resources such as
      project managers and market area managers but principally with our
      customers and partners a project market area is not usually started
      until we have secured a minimum return in the form of signed lease
      contracts

      we acquire properties to create value growth or to obtain strategic
      benefits this pertains both to acquiring land in order to gain access to
      development rights for future development projects and to acquiring
      investment properties that have development potential

 t3 deferred tax liability

accounting principles
deferred tax is reported on the difference between the reported value         and tax receivables are not reported if the temporary difference is
of assets and liabilities in the financial reports and the fiscal value       attributable to goodwill or if they arise as a result of a transaction
used when calculating the taxable result deferred tax is reported             that constitutes the first reporting of an asset or liability which is not
using the socalled balance sheet method deferred tax liabilities             a corporate acquisition and which at the time of the transaction
are reported for in principle all taxable temporary differences and         affects neither the reported nor the taxable profitloss no deferred
deferred tax receivables are reported for in principle all deductible         tax has been calculated on asset acquisitions in accordance with
temporary differences to the extent that it is likely that the amounts          applicable accounting recommendations
can be used to offset future taxable surpluses deferred tax liabilities
