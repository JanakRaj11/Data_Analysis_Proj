 growing demand for luxury ships fueled by marine leisure culture                                   increased natural disasters caused by climate change
 growing demand for ecofriendly ships due to high oil prices                                       rising sea level caused by global warming

the world is a single market for the shipbuilding industry and the technological impacts related to businesses are great the global economic crisis and the rise of competi
tors such as china can act as a risk factor to the domestic shipbuilding industry however with increasing traffic owing to the growth of brics countries such as south
america and india rising demand to replace ships due to tightening environmental regulations and increasing demand for deepsea energy development the shipbuilding
market is expected to steadily recover due to rising oil prices demands for large highefficiency ships lngc and offshore plants are expected to increase as well
