greenhouse gas ghg management  compliance
 anadarko implements industryleading practices and technology while continually
  looking for innovative ways to reduce emissions
    anadarko worked with industry representatives regulators and the environmental defense fund
     edf to strengthen regulations in colorado to detect and address methane leaks thereby enhancing air
     quality and building public trust learn more at wwwcoloradogov

 anadarko incorporates best management practices that reduce ghg emissions into our operations
  including
    broad usage of forwardlooking infrared flir technology for leak detection
     surveying and inefficient pipe replacement
    green and reducedemission completions
    gasrecoverysystems to reduce vented methane
    solarpowered and instrumentair pumps to replace gasfired pneumatic pumps
    replacement of older and lessefficient compressors
    electrification of formerly gasfired engines
    dualfuel pressure pumping equipment
    use of compressed natural gas cng in a growing fleet of more than 400 vehicles

 anadarko participated in a groundbreaking study with edf and university of texas to study methane
  emissions which found that methane emissions from the well completion process are 97 lower than
  previous epa estimates httpwwwengrutexasedunewsreleasesmethanestudy
    continuing partnership with subsequent studies to improve understanding of the ghg emissions in the lifecycle of
     natural gas production

hydraulic fracturing the process
                           hydraulic fracturing or fracking is technology that has
                           been in use for more than 60 years it is essential for
                           producing oil and natural gas from shales and tightsands
                           formations

                           the combination of horizontal drilling and fracking has revolutionized oil
                           and natural gas production in the us creating a new age of energy
                           abundance

                           fracking myths
                            myth fracking is a new technology
                            truth fracking was developed in the 1940s

                            myth fracking endangers water
                            truth proper well construction and geologic rock layers protect groundwater

 hydraulic fracturing safeguarding water
 baseline water sampling
  fresh groundwater sources in the us typically reside between 100 and 500 feet 30
    and 150 meters beneath the surface
  once the depths of fresh water sources in areas of activity are determined we tailor
    our well design to protect them with multiple layers of steel and cement to shield the
    water from the wellbore
  we also pressure test the wellbore to ensure its integrity and use specialized imaging
    technology before continuing the next phase of drilling operations
  in most basins before drilling commences we sample all nearby fresh water sources
    including water wells within 2500 feet 750 m of our drilling locations the results are
    verified by a third party and shared with the landowner or relevant entity




 anadarko supports the public sharing of the ingredients used in hydraulic
  fracturing we were instrumental in the creation of the ground water protection
  councils hydraulic fracturing online registry which makes this information
  available online to anyone any time at wwwfracfocusorg
 anadarko is the most active participant in fracfocus with data uploaded for
  5000 operated wells as required by law we also keep material safety data
  sheets which are prepared and provided by the thirdparty service provider to
  describe the additives used in the fracking process in detail at each well location
  please note that osha sets the criteria for the disclosure of this information
  including protecting trade secret and confidential business information and its
  reporting anadarko is not permitted by law to disclose ingredients that are
  protected as trade secret
 in 2012 anadarko created a hydraulic fracturing committee to review and
  analyze fluid content used in the companys fracking applications across us
  onshore and continuously assess opportunities to utilize greener solutions see
  page 23 for more details
