realizing high throughput
 batch thermal process system
 to meet the market needs for lower cost of ownership coo and higher process quality
for nextgeneration devices a new ecofriendly batch thermal process system has been
developed the new system realizes highquality batch thermal processing by further
enhancing the already high productivity and high reliability which are the major advantages
of the vertical system and by applying a new filmforming technology
 while maintaining a footprint the area occupied by a machine equal to that of the
conventional vertical system this new system has increased the throughput number of
wafers that the system can process within a given amount of time by about 30 and has
significantly reduced power consumption per wafer it has done this by adopting a long
highspeed temperature control furnace and wafer buffer shelf to increase the maximum
throughput as well as a highspeed wafer transfer robot to shorten the wafer transfer time
 compared with the conventional vertical system quixaceultimate released in fiscal
2010 this new system reduces co2 emissions by 21
 cost of ownership coo  all costs necessary for introduction operation and management of a system                      batch thermal process system



realizing full hd with low power consumption
  hcip3100hd electric network dome camera for

    outdoor use
 the hcip3100hd is a surveillance camera equipped with an electric zoom lens an
electric camera platform and a live fullhd image transmission function to meet the needs
of the surveillance video market for image signal digitization and full hd 1920 x 1080
compatibility
 while maintaining the same size as the existing camera the hcip3100hd achieves high
resolution by digital image processing moreover thanks to the powersaving technology
incorporated in the electric camera platform the hcip3100hd reduces power consumption
so that it can be powered through a lan cable with poe technology ieee8023at
compliant                                                                                                                         hcip3100hd
 compared with the conventional dome camera hc350 released in 2005 the hc
ip3100hd reduces co2 emissions by 58
 poe  standards for poe power over ethernet a technology that uses the power inside the lan cable to power up

       in addition to making corporate donations our company solicits
      donations from employees to support the people and areas affected
      by the kumamoto earthquake which occurred in april 2016
       in may a series of scandals related to corporate social responsibility
      were reported in the media causing us on the editorial team to
      often pause in our work and ponder for a while before continuing
      with renewed determination
       we have been familiar with the termcsrfor the last 10 years
      however each person has a different viewpoint and attitude toward
      csr and its breadth of scope and depth of content seem boundless
      ranging from social contributions through business activities to risk
      management and volunteerism once a year we report the major
      csr activities of the group focusing on the activities undertaken in
      the previous fiscal year we invite you to read through this english
