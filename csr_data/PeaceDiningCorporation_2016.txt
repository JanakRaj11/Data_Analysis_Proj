our target and progress
target implement leftover container recycling by 2015
progress achieved we have successfully implemented leftover waste recycling program to all our stores
our stores have started to segregate food and recyclable packaging containers when trashing leftover waste by
implementing this program we were able to recycle a substantial amount 4662 tons of polyethylene terephthalate
pet containers this has significant environmental benefits by reducing the use of virgin raw materials for making
new product by implementing this program we were able to reduce 110 mtco2e greenhouse gas emissions which is
equivalent to off setting 25 passenger cars from the road annually

     our next step
       our next step is continuing the practice of a sustainable transportation procedure for truck emission reduction and developing strategies for reducing car
       emissions we will monitor emissions continuously we will also conduct systematic greenhouse gas inventory based on the greenhouse gas protocol and
       develop an overall greenhouse gas reduction plan for pdc

emission reduction
our approach
climate change is one of the most challenging environmental
issues that the world is facing today as a food company pdc
recognizes the risks that climate change brings to the environment
changes in climate not only affect global food security but also our
raw materials supply by realizing this our top management has committed to
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our operations
in our first step we are focused on fleet emissions which comprise the highest
percentage of our direct emissions in our next step we will focus on all scope 1
and scope 2 emissions plus some of the scope 3 emissions of our facilities

                  emission reduction

our target and progress
target 10 fleet emission reduction by 2017 comparing to 2014 baseline                        2000
progress on track in 2015116 mtco2e greenhouse gas emission has
been achieved which is 59 compared to 2014 baseline our fleet emission
includes the emissions from company cars and trucks in 2015 we
implemented a sustainable transportation procedure for our truck operation
                                                                                                1950        1971
our trucks are equipped with improved aerodynamic devices low rolling
resistant auto inflation tires and idle reduction technology we are also
practicing fuel efficient strategies such as intermodal transfer highway                       1900
speed control and improved freight logistics our truck emission reduced by
12 but our car emissions increased slightly in 2015
                                                                                                1850
we were also able to establish a partnership with epa smartway
in 2015 for emission reduction our company will contribute to the                                                    1855

      continuing the practice of a sustainable transportation procedure for truck emission reduction and developing strategies for

energy conservation
our approach
energy use is the significant source of greenhouse gas emissions
using energy more efficiently enables us to reduce our carbon
footprint and conserve natural resources therefore we are
committed to reducing energy consumption in our facilities

our target and progress
target only purchase energy star office electronics from 2015
progress achieved our it department is only purchasing energy star office
electronics from the beginning of 2015 the it department started to review the
energy star status before purchasing any electronics in 2015 we purchased 46
laptops and 5 printers with energy star certification and achieved 40 annual
energy saving comparing to regular electronics purchase

target implement computer power management to office computers
progress off track our it department faced some technical problems
during implementing computer power management however we have extended
the implementation due date for this program we will implement this by the
end of 2016

target replace cfl bulbs with led in our showcase
progress achieved in 2015 we replaced 350 cfl bulbs with 350 led in our
sushi cases reducing our energy consumption for illuminating sushi cases
by 65 we were able to save 26530kwh electricity annually and also able to
reduce 1365 mtco2e greenhouse gas emissions annually by switching the bulbs




     our next step

       implement computer power management cpm in our office computers and implement motion sensitive lighting to our
       central kitchen we will also continue tracking our energy consumption for future strategies

product sustainability
our approach
increasing the sustainability of our products is our top priority sustainable
sourcing practice is very important for increasing our overall environmental
tperformance we are committed to using all natural and sustainable
ingredients in our product
most of our products require some form of packaging packaging is very essential for
keeping food safe but it also has significant environmental footprints as our business
grows rapidly the amount of required packaging materials is also growing however
we are committed to using sustainable packaging to increase our product sustainability
our strategy is to increase the use of recyclable pet packaging containers and
implement full recycling in our stores

our target and progress
target 100 seafood purchase based on the seafood watch guide or other thirdparty ecolabel by 2016
progress on track in 2014 we were using five items which were not covered by seafood watch or any
other thirdparty certification in 2015 we were able to reduce the number of these items down to two
we implemented sustainable purchasing procedures to purchase seafood and packaging materials we
also started an annual review of seafood sustainability based on species name origin and fishing method
traceability is our top priority we can track most of our species back to the boat or farm level we do not
buy any seafood which is listed as avoided in the seafood watch ranking we are also trying to avoid any
species which are not covered by seafood watch and also not certified with any other third party

training and awareness
our approach
we understand that our environmental footprint can also be
reduced through training and awareness programs these
kinds of programs help our team members to reduce their
environmental footprint from their daytoday activities and
encourage sustainable living therefore we are committed
to providing environmental training and awareness to our
employees our strategy is to provide basic and job specific
trainings the purpose of the basic training is to increase
the employees awareness whereas the purpose of the
jobspecific training is to provide necessary information
for performing their jobs in a more sustainable way
