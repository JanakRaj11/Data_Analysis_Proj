         interview with monika hornik director corporate compliance
         why is compliance important to sma
         as a global company sma is subject to international laws and regulations the adherence to statute and law is a
         necessary foundation of our business activities and stipulates strict conduct requirements for all sma employees our
         principle is that business that cannot be carried out in a lawful manner will be fundamentally refused in this way we
         avoid instances of liability and protect the reputation of sma and our employees

         what does successful compliance management look like
         sma focuses on counseling and training in compliance when it comes to our growing foreign markets all building
         blocks of our compliance management system are implemented worldwide and adapted to international requirements
         at the same time an effective compliance management system requires the ongoing improvement of internal control
         systems

         incorporating employees is seen as especially important how do you do this at sma
         we have made keeping personal contact with sma employees the main focus of compliance in order to ensure that
         they are aware of compliance risks training sessions in small groups are led by compliance employees who remain
         available as contacts afterwards furthermore sma employees can get assistance through the compliance help line in
         their language in the end the important thing is that each and every employee feels informed

       interview with volker wachenfeld senior vice president hybrid and storage
       what trends for offgrid solutions are on the horizon
       these markets were reliant on subsidies for a long time however the situation has changed significantly due to rising
       diesel prices and falling system costs for photovoltaics pv has become the cheapest electricity supply option in many
       countries in africa and south america particularly in gridremote regions this means that it is also economically attrac
       tive for industrial consumers to supplement their diesel electricity supply with photovoltaics in pv diesel hybrid systems

       what experience does sma have in this area
       offgrid system solutions which we are continuously developing have been a core issue for the company since its foun
       dation in the area of photovoltaic diesel hybrid systems we combine our comprehensive experience in offgrid solutions
       with our expertise in largescale pv power plants to develop intelligent system technology for system management in
       november 2012 we equipped south africas first offgrid photovoltaic diesel hybrid system in the megawatts with invert
       ers and intelligent system management in this way the operator can significantly reduce fuel costs and co2 emissions

       what are the largest challenges remaining for photovoltaic diesel hybrid systems
       the technology already works extremely well but we still have to work hard at convincing potential customers often
       they simply are not aware that such systems are the most affordable and convenient solution for supplying electricity to
       gridremote regions

        lean production this means increases in productivity in flexibility and quality five issues are of particular importance to
        me the safety and health of our employees continuous flow 100 percent added value 100 percent quality and 100
        percent delivery capability

          the human factor in this process plays a key role what does this mean for
          the employees at sma
          the production system consists of a large number of different processes these stem from employee suggestions who
          are sensitized through trainings on continuous improvement and process streamlining this also means that our manag
          ers have to support employees suggestions and promote new ideas an internalization of the production philosophy is
          therefore a precondition to fill the system with life and move closer toward our goal of continuous improvement

          to what extent can an active corporate culture help in this process
          a production philosophy can only be successful if it is understood lived and supported by our employees our corpo
          rate culture is therefore another important component a collegial open and honest interaction with each other allows
          us to solve problems acknowledge mistakes communicate them openly and to learn from them only together can we
          further develop our products structures and processes

and support smas sustainability objectives                         to labor standards and laws such as the prohibition of child labor

longstanding partnerships with strategically important suppliers    and other social contributions prohibition of forced labor and
are becoming more and more important for the success of a com       abuse guarantee of the freedom to form unions and health and

     and anticorruption




         interview with inmaculada muniz morell senior vice president infrastructure and supply chain
         how important is the supplier code of conduct at sma
         the standards described in the supplier code should be part of the business philosophy of every serious company
         therefore compatible suppliers will have an appreciation for the mandatory nature of the policies which can in ex
         change serve as the basis of a trustworthy business relationship furthermore our customers can expect sma products
         to be produced within the same framework of standards to ensure this throughout our supply chain reference to our
         supplier code or bme conduct is very useful

         why is a sustainable supply chain relevant for sma
         there are two important reasons first sma is perceived as a sustainable and socially responsible company and we
         want to also reflect these principles in our supply chain second as an international company sma conducts business
         in foreign markets uses global procurement markets and also has the ambition to act socially and environmentally
         responsible

         can you provide a concrete example
         the best example is our plant in denver us local production allows us be more flexible in responding to changes in
         demand in reducing costs and in generating local added value at our sites creating shorter supply chains to our cus
         tomers also helps us to better fulfill our ecological responsibility

      interview corporate compliance
         interview with matthias schäpers mobility management
         what are the unique challenges of mobility management at sma
         while smas facilities are situated in relatively close proximity to one another they arent in one single location but
         instead are spread out over many locations this means that strong networking between the individual locations is
         required necessitating increased transportation here it is important to develop crossdivisional strategies to avoid un
         necessary transportation and to promote selection of intelligent modes of transportation apart from a reduction in costs
         this also always leads to lower co2 emissions

            how do you motivate employees
            our employees are generally easily motivated when it comes to energy saving potential concerning both travel to and
            from work and internal transportation the issue of mobility is however often linked to old habits here we need to learn
            to question these habits and to some degree also use crazy ideas to come up with other ways and possibilities the
            important thing is to convince employees by involving them in this development process

            what does sustainable mobility mean to you
            for me sustainable mobility means recognizing that the energy transition is only possible with a transition in the way we
            get from one place to another the transportation sector is the only area in which co2 emissions go up continuously this
            is why sma is already thinking about the mobility of the future as we want to set an example in managing resources
            this also includes the topics of logistics and transportation




                                                                                                                                             33

         why is sma introducing energy management according to din en iso 50001
         as a company active in the renewable energy sector it only makes sense for sma to act as a good example in the area
         of energy efficiency we have always made sure to work efficiently and in an environmentally friendly manner energy
         management according to din en iso 50001 helps us to improve the monitoring of our efforts in this area of course
         the company also profits from the resulting added value and costs saved

         what role do employees play
         effective energy management relies on the cooperation of each and every employee this is why it is important to cre
         ate company wide awareness of the issue to ensure that the desired success becomes evident in the form of a continual
         improvement process

         and how do you create awareness among employees
         new colleagues are already introduced to the importance of energy saving and energy efficiency during the new at
         sma presentation over time an awareness of energyrelated topics is solidified through training sessions and informa

         ms müller you are involved in the mentorinnennetzwerk mentoring program for
         women in natural sciences and technology how did you get involved
         last year i was asked if i would like to participate in the mentorinnennetzwerk as a female executive in the area of
         information technology after the information session i was convinced that this was a meaningful network that i wanted
         to be a part of

         what motivated you to participate in the program for a second time
         i find the combination of cultivating young womens interest in sciences and developing ones own personality and skill
         set interesting and fruitful what both my mentee and i achieved this year was truly rewarding

         do you think programs like these can break down the barriers that make it difficult
         for women to enter careers in natural sciences and technology
         definitely these programs make it possible to network and grow with likeminded people the mentees can see that we
         all went through similar processes and this motivates them to continue on their chosen paths

        deenet competence network decentralized energy technologies
        dr hoppekilpper in 2003 sma was one of the cofounders of kompetenznetzwerk
        dezentrale energietechnologien ev what are the networks goals
        it is our goal to promote the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency in north hesse we encourage
        collaboration between companies research institutions and cities and initiate shared projects which we then oversee
        from beginning to end

          why is renewable energy so important for north hesses future
          the transition to renewable energy sources will continue to gain importance worldwide in our 2007 study nordhessen
          2020 dezentrale energie und arbeit north hesse in 2020 decentralized energy and work we previously pointed
          out that by the year 2020  20000 people in north hesse could be employed in the area of decentralized energy and
          efficiency technology and we have already come a long way in this regard within the past four years 11000 new
          jobs have been created all in all over 14000 people are currently employed in this industry in north hesse

          what is smas importance to you personally
          for me sma has always been the sign that the vision of an alternative energy supply can become reality

when it comes to the need for an energy transition society

far from over  so on a national and even more on an inter
national level globally it is an incredible challenge ﬁnding
concrete palatable ways to limit climate change that allow
both humankind and nature to adapt and in fact one that
has yet to be conquered in response to these challenges
and in the face of climate change and scarcity of fossil fu
els quick developments in renewable energies are a neces

lack of initiative for policy making are structural impediments
standing in the way of fast development

     interview corporate compliance
        interview with günther häckl vice president public affairs at sma and president
        of the german solar industry association bsw
        mr häckl how important for sma is the presidential
        position at bsw in strategical terms
        sma is germanys largest company in the solar industry the company is a frontrunner in development and the increas
        ingly important field of photovoltaic system integration in addition sma has strong corporate relationships with almost
        every player in the industry and thus a special responsibility to gather the strengths of the industry to solve conflicts of
        interest being involved with bsw allows us to bring forward important topics regarding the future of photovoltaics for
        example the provision of system services through photovoltaics an intelligent energy management system for private
        homes and the commercial sector or the integration of batteries

         just how much influence do lobby groups such as bsw have on politics these days
         political advisory carries a lot of weight especially when it comes to complex topics such as the energy transition
         here the bsw along with other associations that focus on renewable energy work to make sure politicians have the
         necessary and relevant information this happens primarily via the bundesverband erneuerbare energien bee ger
         man renewable energy federation these efforts are particularly important given the fact that representatives of the
         conventional energy industry are working hard to curb the energy transition

         how do you envision the future of the solar sector
         and most importantly how will germany assert itself
         while the industry is currently going through a consolidation phase the future is most definitely positive we need
         innovations to hold on to germanys technological advantage even the radically changing energy supply system
         represents new challenges for photovoltaics but also offers new possibilities and new business areas if we consistently
         take advantage of these opportunities germany will remain competitive on the global stage

       interview with doreen austermühl former industrial mechanic trainee
       what motivated you to take part in the employee project in madagascar
       the project was a big opportunity for me to apply my skills to improve living conditions for people in madagascar right
       from the start i was excited to work with a team of people who really wanted to effect change all team members were
       volunteers i also wanted to gain as much handson experience as i could and see how our products work in action and
       madagascar is also a great travel destination

          what impressed you the most while working in madagascar
          working with the people on location was great their thirst for knowledge and readiness to learn really impressed me
          they also do a lot of things in a much more relaxed way than we are used to  something that you learn to appreciate
          after awhile

          looking back how would you assess your involvement in madagascar
          i gained great educational experience which i would not want to go without now the new friendships that were formed
          will especially keep this adventure fresh in my mind my conclusion i would do it again and i think its great that trainees
          at sma get the chance to participate in such projects

         interview with andreas siebert mayour of niestetal germany
         sma is the largest company in niestetal how would you describe working together
         especially in recent years sma has had a lasting impact on the structural development of the community a construc
         tive collaboration is therefore fundamentally important to align the interests of a company and community together
         we have achieved this through realization of several successful projects that the region and the city of niestetal have
         both benefitted from

         sma is a very dynamic company how do you get informed about developments
         we maintain a close relationship to sma as well as to the other companies in niestetal our information is based pri
         marily on personnel contact with sma

         can you give an example of when there were difficult decisions relating to sma
         this would be the site development of the new industrial park sandershäuser berg especially during the planning and
         implementation process we realized how important and valuable collaboration is we were only able to successful com
         plete this project in such a short time frame through open communication with community members involving regulatory
         authorities early on making bold political decisions and through close coordination with sma

         how do you envision working with sma in the future
         we would be delighted if the relationship carries on successfully in the future particularly the open and friendly com
         munication between the city and sma so both parties continue to benefit from each other
