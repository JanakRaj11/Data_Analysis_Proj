 us sif
 in 2013 us sif worked on six key public policy issues
          requirements that companies disclose their political contributions
          improved corporate disclosure of environmental social and governance esg issues
          an sri option for federal employees retirement plans
          actions to curb climate change
          improvements in erisa fiduciary duty guidance on sri and
          funding and regulatory support for community investing

 to advance these issues us sif and its members met with kara stein the newest commissioner of the
 securities and exchange commission and with the staff of several congressional offices including
 senator elizabeth warren dma senator jeff merkley dor congressman keith ellison dmn and
 the senate committee on health education labor and pensions we also engaged in the numerous
 activities described below

 rulemaking related to doddfrank act much of us sifs policy work in 2013 continued to center
 on numerous provisions in the doddfrank wall street financial reform and consumer protection act of
 2010 that required the sec to draft implementing regulations us sif staff held multiple meetings with
 sec commissioners and their staffs to discuss the scope and text of such regulations and issued formal
 comments on proposed rules doddfrank provisions of particular interest to us sif in 2013 are
 discussed below

           xecutive compensation and pay disparityon september 19 the sec issued a proposed rule
         e
          on executive compensation mandated under section 953b of the doddfrank act under the
          proposal companies would be required to disclose the median of the annual total compensation of
          all its employees except the ceo the annual total compensation of its ceo and the ratio of the two
          amounts us sif has long supported this rule and issued a press release welcoming the proposal
          on december 2 us sif submitted comments to the sec underscoring three points disclosure of
          ceotoworker pay ratio is material to investors investors need the ceotoworker pay ratio data
          in order to incorporate compensation practices into financial analysis and the proposed rule allows
          flexibility in how the median compensation of nonprincipal executive officer nonpeo employees
          is calculated and allows issuers to provide this information without undue difficulty or expense
          us sif strongly encouraged its members to submit their own comments and provided them with
          a template comment letter the sec received 100000 comments on the proposed rule
           onflict minerals disclosureunder the dodd frank law publicly traded us companies that
         c
          source minerals such as tantalum and tin will need to report the measures they use to ensure that
          they are not sourcing the minerals from mines or smelters controlled by the armed factions in the
          democratic republic of the congo that are waging a war in the eastern part of the country although
          the sec adopted new rules on the disclosure of conflict minerals in 2012 the rules were legally
          challenged by the chamber of commerce the national association of manufacturers and the

         business roundtable during this period us sif and its members continued to support the rules
         and called on companies to implement them on july 24 the us district court for the district of
         columbia upheld the conflict minerals disclosure rules and dismissed the lawsuit against the sec
         the national association of manufacturers nam and others requested a temporary stay of the
         reporting rule on may 14 2014 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit denied nams request
         us sif applauded the courts decision to preserve the rules due diligence and reporting provisions
         but expressed concern that the court invalidated on first amendment grounds the rules requirement
         that companies designate whether products are conflictfree broad application of the courts
         approach to first amendment protections against compelled speech could threaten the ability of
         congress to require corporate disclosure of information that is material both to investors and to the
         public interest
         isclosure of payments to governments by resource extraction issuerssimilar to the conflict
       d
        minerals rule above the sec adopted rules in 2012 to require companies registered with the sec
        to disclose their payments to governments for the commercial development of oil natural gas or
        minerals american petroleum institute filed a lawsuit to challenge the rules on july 2 the us
        district court for the district of columbia ruled in american petroleum institute et al vs securities
        and exchange commission to vacate and remand the new rules taking issue with the secs intent
        to make companies full filings publicas opposed to summariesand to the secs refusal to grant
        exceptions for payments to countries that prohibit payment disclosure in 2013 the sec chose not
        to appeal the decision and indicated that it would revise the rule we continued to encourage the
        sec not to weaken the rule and to make it effective as early as possible

corporate political contributions disclosure in 2013 us sif and its members engaged in
efforts with other coalitions to respond to the supreme courts 2010 decision in citizens united v federal
election commission which enables corporations to spend an unlimited amount of money on political
advertising us sif joined a rulemaking petition asking the sec to require companies to disclose their
political spending andor subject their budgets for political contributions to shareowner votes on october 9
us sif participated in a senate briefing on this issue by the end of 2013 the sec had received over 640000
commentsa record numberwith most comments supportive of the rulemaking although the issue was on
the secs regulatory agenda in january 2013 and the sec had announced that it intended to move forward
with creating a rule to require all publicly traded corporations to disclose their political spending we were
disappointed to learn in november that the issue was not included in the 2014 regulatory agenda

sri option for federal employees in 2013 us sif continued to seek congressional support for
the federal employees responsible investment act feria which directs the federal retirement thrift
investment board frtib to select a corporate responsibility index as an option for the thrift savings
plan tsp this legislation if enacted would thereby grant federal employees the opportunity to select an
sri option in their thrift savings plana significant milestone and 2013 was the first time that a senate bill
was introduced on this issue on november 20 senator sheldon whitehouse dri introduced feria in the
senate and representative james langevin dri reintroduced it in the house while adding an sri option
to the thrift savings plan has been a policy priority for us sif for several years it has also called for one or
more sri options as part of the mutual fund window option under the thrift savings plan enhancement
act which authorizes the frtib to add such an option to allow participants to move investments out of
the tsp funds and into a privatesector suite of mutual funds us sif also began engagement with key
agencies including meeting with officials at the us department of state to brief them on an sri option for
federal employees and the window option in 2013 the thrift saving plan began a review of the feasibility of
implementing a mutual fund window with the aim of presenting the research to its board in 2014

 under managementincluding many us sif memberssigned an open letter welcoming the standard

 and representatives to ask them to oppose any legislation to delay or obstruct the epas carbon pollution
 standards for power plants they also asked these members of congress to support the master limited
 partnership parity act for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects and to extend the production tax
 credit for wind power

 erisa in 2013 us sif worked with a group of investment leaders to send a letter to gene sperling and
 valerie jarrett senior advisors to president obama to request the withdrawal of the department of labors
 2008 interpretive bulletins relating to investing in economically targeted investments and to the exercise
 of shareholder rights the february 25th letter signed by several responsible investing leaders criticized
 the 2008 bulletin on economically targeted investments for specifically discouraging investments that improve
 local communities such as local job creation and affordable housing and that support environmental
 sustainability

 appears in the review of its carbon footprint below

 environmental considerations for events us sif
 considers the sustainability initiatives of the prospective venues it
 reviews during the site selection process for conferences these
 considerations include energy efficiency use of renewable energy green building certifications water use
 recycling and waste management use of local organic food food donations stakeholder relations and labor
 practices us sif also weighs whether a site is compliant with the green hotel initiative and whether it has
 calculated its carbon footprint with the goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions at event venues
 us sif encourages attendees to recycle and makes recycling as easy as possible it also seeks sustainable
 organic and fair trade products in menu selections and avoids using bottled water at its events

 carbon footprint as advised by the global reporting initiative us sif used the greenhouse gas
 protocol ghg protocol developed by the world resources institute and the world business council for
 sustainable development to calculate its greenhouse gas emissions in particular it used the ghg protocols
 guidance for small officebased businesses working 9 to 5 on climate change us sif has no direct
 emissions under the ghg protocol all of us sifs emissions are indirect scope three emissions as
 us sif does not own its office space and does not own corporate cars or jets us sif focused
 measurements of its indirect emissions in four primary areas employee commuting business travel

commuting except for one employee who only walked to and from work all us sif employees used public
transportation to commute in 2013 three employees used car travel for a portion of their commute to get
to the subway although two of them commuted fewer than five days per week additionally one employee
began working parttime three days per week in april while another employee joined the staff on a
fulltime basis in april each us sif staff member was granted three to five weeks of vacation leave per
year in addition to sick leave as well as the equivalent of two weeks federal holiday leave therefore
total miles in the table above are based on a 46week work year

employee workrelated travel us sif employees are required to file trip reports for all
businessrelated travel using these reports us sif was able to calculate mileage for all types of travel
except some car travel completed without receipts from car rental companies and some travel by public
transport whenever possible mileage estimates were made using google maps and other methods to
arrive at the totals in the accompanying table

 emissions factors were drawn from the department of energys energy information administration




 office energy consumption us sif leased office space in the barr building located in farragut square
 at 910 17th street nw suite 1000 washington dc 20006 during 2013 the barr building used an estimated
 1931738 kilowatt hours kwh of electricity for its 92411 square feet or 2090 kwh per square foot
 during the year us sif occupies 2235 square feet of space of the 92411 square feet serviced by the main
 meter based on these assumptions we estimate that us sif used 46720 kwh in 2013 using the average
 emissions factor for our region 00001002 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour per the
 environmental protection agency we estimated that the carbon footprint for the us sif office from electricity
 use was 4681 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent co2e in 2013 there are several imperfections
 to this calculation that need to be improved upon in future reporting first the building did not provide kwh
 usage for 2013 and thus the 2012 estimate was used second our estimate did not account for us sifs use
 of common areas in the building in addition while us sif and the building used compact fluorescent bulbs
 throughout the facility and lighting triggered by movement to reduce energy consumption in common areas
 the barr building did not purchase renewable energy credits from pepco our local utility

 paper consumption us sif used the approximate equivalent of 100 reams of paper in the
 production of marketing materials reports business cards and daytoday office paper consumption
 the average weight of a ream of paper is 26 kilograms per ream and the carbon footprint for recycled
 content which us sif used is 1907 kilograms of co2e per kilogram of paper consumed using
 these assumptions the carbon footprint of us sifs paper use was 0496 metric tons of co2e

 total based on our calculations and assumptions us sifs carbon footprint is the equivalent of 18913
 metric tons of co2e or 2541 metric tons per fulltime staff equivalent this compares to 2094 metric tons
 per full timestaff equivalent in 2012 and 2065 in 2011 the increase was due to the approximately doubling
 of air miles traveled in 2013 from 2012 connected with holding the annual conference in chicago rather than
 in washington dc and the gsia conference taking place in singapore as opposed to london as in the
 year prior car mileage also roughly doubled when one staff member relocated a breakdown of the primary
 contributors to the 2013 total appears in the pie chart on p 24

 room for improvement us sif does not currently have a strategy for reducing its carbon footprint aside
 from following its present strategies for limiting energy consumption and paper use and utilizing the least
 energy intensive travel where possible

 eeo policy us sifs antibias policy states that it shall not discriminate and shall take affirmative action
 to ensure that it conducts all business without regard to a persons race color religion gender age

affectional or sexual orientation marital or familial status national origin ancestry nonjob related disability
veteran status or other unlawful bases as an organization based in the district of columbia us sif also is
prohibited from discriminating in employment based on gender identity

employee benefits us sif offers employees a group health and dental plan and subsidizes the premiums
it also provides a 401k plan matches contributions up to 5 percent of an employees annual salary before
taxes and offers sri and other investment options through socialk us sif provides sick vacation and
personal leave to all employees as well as disability and life insurance employees may also elect to make
pretax contributions to participate in the smartbenefits program offered by the local transportation authority
and in a flexible spending account program for medical and child care expenses

us sif also offers the opportunity to apply for a one to three week sabbatical to all employees at the
conclusion of each five years of fulltime employment unlike vacation or other types of paid leave the
objective of the sabbatical leave is to provide staff with the opportunity to enjoy a period of time away from
the day to day demands of their jobs in order to concentrate on a workrelated project and to develop further
professionally

political contributions while us sif engages a policy consultant and has select staff engage on
various policy issues on behalf of the us sif membership us sif does not make political contributions or
endorse candidates for public office

staff as of yearend 2013 us sif had seven fulltime and one parttime staff members

               relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order
               to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing
               an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control accordingly we express no such opinion
               an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
               of significant accounting estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
               the consolidated financial statements

               we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
               our audit opinion
