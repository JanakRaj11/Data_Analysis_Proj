means of competition in the technology trading market addtech strives to be a better choice than the

sustainable development at addtech

sustainable development at addtech
at addtech we aim to continue to create value for our shareholders employees society and the
environment we summarise it into three categories  added economic social and environmental value




added economic value
economic strength is a cornerstone for investing in sustainable development and addtech is dedicated to
ensuring that we are both competitive and costefficient in a constantly changing world companies must
develop to survive in the long term addtechs overall vision is to be the leader in valueadded technology
trading through clearly defined growth profitability and development requirements these concepts are
thus fundamental to addtechs sustainability work


added social value
a fundamental factor in addtechs sustainable development is taking account of all the people affected by
our operations this includes our customers suppliers employees collaboration partners and the
communities in which we operate in order to sustain our good reputation addtech shall maintain high
quality and ethics in all of its undertakings a substantial part of our subsidiaries success derives from
sound relationships with the community and mutual trust and commitment

addtechs subsidiaries strive to be attractive employers and to provide their employees with sound
personal development opportunities in order to identify areas of improvement we conduct for instance
employee surveys that then form the basis of skills development and business acumen in the group
addtech knows the importance of safeguarding our most important resource  our staff addtechs code of
conduct acts as a compass for each employee and our suppliers are encouraged to work in line with it


added environmental value
the subsidiaries work actively with finding energy efficient solutions for our customers around half of the
electricity used in the group comes from renewable sources our goal is to constantly increase this
proportion the groups companies are primarily engaged in technology trading so the operations have a
limited direct impact on the environment we continually work with improvement measures in the areas
where we ourselves can make a difference our indirect environmental impact rests with our suppliers
we hope that supplier surveys will provide a better overview of how our suppliers work with csr matters
and encourage them to change for the better

the addtech groups environmental policy is part of our code of conduct and expresses our intention to
shoulder our part of the responsibility of improving the environment and working to promote lasting
sustainable development we work proactively to continually reduce the groups direct and indirect
environmental impact ecocycle thinking and conservation of natural resources must form an important
starting point for the groups business operations important decisions shall take due account of
environmental consequences in order to create longterm value for the groups customers employees
shareholders and society at large environmental activities shall be conducted within the scope of our
business concept and be closely integrated into operational activities this implies that in the long term the
whole lifecycle of the products and services we provide shall be taken into account we can maintain a
holistic view of environmental issues through a high level of competence among our employees and by
constantly developing our knowledge of environmental consequences




                                                     3

environmental conservation measures shall be implemented to the extent they are technically feasible
reasonable in terms of business economics and environmentally justified suppliers are encouraged to
operate in line with our environmental policy suppliers shall also be familiar with and comply with
requirements defined by national legislation statutes and industry standards suppliers shall as a
minimum requirement operate a secure system for management of hazardous materials and waste
report content and boundaries

report content and boundaries
the sustainability report refers to the 20152016 financial year with comparative data from the 20142015
financial year unless otherwise indicated the report encompasses the operations of the group as a
whole

during the 20152016 financial year addtechs shareholdings in addlife were distributed through an ipo
on nasdaq stockholm as a consequence all data in this report refer to continuing operations with
retroactivity for the 20142015 financial year

the following sections provide an account of addtechs sustainability work from different stakeholder
perspectives with results for the group being presented in the form of relevant indicators and key ratios
unless otherwise indicated the figures are accumulated values for 20152016 from the groups more than
120 companies ten acquisitions were implemented during the year affecting the outcomes for the
environmental and work environment indicator data reported compared to the preceding year
acquisitions constitute a central part of addtechs growth strategy and are therefore expected to continue
to affect several areas in the sustainability report in the years ahead the measured values presented
have not been adjusted to compensate for the increased number of companies instead they constitute
the actual figures for the group

addtechs corporate structure and operations with more than 120 operating companies is a challenge
when it comes to achieving rapid results in sustainability work and many units will introduce completely
or partly new processes this work paves the way for adding further value for example through more
attractive offers to customers larger cost cuts and improved work on quality and hr the measurement
data presented in this sustainability report are based as far as possible on actual measured values from
the groups companies or from the groups suppliers in cases where the groups companies or suppliers
have been unable to obtain actual figures reasonable estimates based on available calculation tools and
models were made

one of addtechs goals for its sustainability work is to continually improve the accuracy of the
measurement data obtained from the groups companies and from our suppliers
our stakeholders

our stakeholders
addtech has identified five important stakeholder groups for the group customers suppliers employees
shareholders and the community addtech strives to maintain an open dialogue with the groups
stakeholders on how the operations are conducted and to explain priorities decisions and the results
achieved addtech considers this to be fundamental to the groups ability to focus on the right issues in its
sustainability work

information on the major sustainability issues is communicated to stakeholders mainly via the
sustainability report dialogue with stakeholders is conducted partly at group level but also by group
companies to a substantial extent the decentralised organisation with autonomous subsidiaries that work
closely with its customers and suppliers creates a natural and continuous dialogue following dialogue with
the groups stakeholders group management in consultation with the board of directors decides on
which sustainability issues are of major importance to the group and on groupwide working methods and
targets

to ensure that addtech is working and reporting on the areas of most importance to operations and
stakeholders both an internal and external stakeholder analysis has been conducted the internal
stakeholders represented addtechs four business areas and the external stakeholders comprised key
customers and major shareholders the dialogue with stakeholders showed that they value addtechs
heightened engagement in sustainability matters based on the stakeholder analysis addtech prepared a
communication and action plan for how the company is to establish the work more firmly in the group
and produced information material about what the sustainability work involves the latter is used both
internally and externally



                                                     4

the results of the stakeholder analysis showed that the matters with the highest priority were business
ethics occupational environment energy consumption and earnings trend during this financial year
addtech continued to work on these areas




the table economic value generated and distributed illustrates how the value generated by the groups
operations has grown and been distributed to various stakeholder groups during the year addtech did
not receive any substantial financial support from the public sector

added economic value

added economic value
addtechs overall objective is to be the leader in valueadding technology trading by being the most the
most competent and longterm partner for customers suppliers and employees this places demands on
the group which can be summarised as growth profitability and development




                                                    5

longterm profitable growth
growth is the basis of longterm profitability without growth the company cannot develop its operations
for addtech growth is thus a primary fundamental requirement for securing our survival in the long term

growth in the group is measured as earnings growth or the earnings expansion target this is a long
term target measured over a business cycle in which period average annual earnings growth shall be 15
percent growth is achieved through strategic efforts to focus on expansive markets concentrated on
leading suppliers and a constant customer focus the profitability target for each subsidiary is a minimum
of 45 percent measured using the relationship between operating profit p and working capital wc the
pwc model encourages high operating profit and low levels of tiedup capital when combined with the
growth target of 15 percent this enables selffunded longterm profitable growth constant development
is required to generate earnings growth and high profitability

longterm profitable growth means longterm sustainability and is important not just for addtech as a
group and for our employees sustainability also creates longterm value for shareholders addtechs
share price performance and dividend trend for its shareholders is one more way in which the company
adds value
added social value

added social value
the key to addtechs further sustainable development and success is in the longterm relationships we
have built up with our employees customers and suppliers and we always endeavour to be a responsible
player in the community it is important that addtechs subsidiaries set a good example in terms of being
reliable ethical and respected employers freedom with responsibility is a fundamental principle for
addtech it has imbued the operations for over a hundred years a large part of addtechs longterm
sustainability is based on that approach and we hope for at least another hundred years of freedom with
responsibility
employees

employees
our most important resource
addtechs employees are vital for our success a good corporate culture makes for comfort low
absenteeism and good relationships and low staff turnover addtech is and should be a company where
work and private life can coexist responsibility and freedom are two of addtechs core values and are
summarised as freedom with responsibility but never freedom without responsibility or responsibility
without freedom addtech organises its business on the basis of decentralised responsibility for
profitability and earnings this involves a high degree of responsibility for the subsidiaries but with great
freedom to for example choose the types of suppliers to be appointed and the types of customers to
focus on motivated creative and decisive employees who can prioritise work tasks yet who can lift their
gaze and look ahead at addtech are fundamental to this working in order to succeed in this addtech
works to maintain an open and positive approach to people capitalising on the full potential of employees
whatever their position and level of responsibility addtech emphasises the importance of taking account
of the distinctive character of each individual employee it is the very differences that create the
dynamics that have made addtech successful


addtechs code of conduct
addtechs code of conduct is a foundation stone for our sustainability work and has long been an integral
part of the operations the groups code of conduct acts as a compass for our employees and includes
all important issues in the environment human rights working terms and conditions and corruption its
complete scope is listed below the code is based on the uns global compact ilos core conventions
and the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises and it is aimed at our operations and those of our
suppliers the groups code of conduct as adopted by the board applies to all companies in the group
and is available on the addtech website wwwaddtechcomcsr and is readily available to all our
employees on the addtech intranet

the group complies with prevailing laws and regulations in the countries where it operates while
subsidiaries and employees are also expected to comply with addtechs code of conduct addtech also
strives for our suppliers to adhere to it too even in cases where it is more farreaching than national laws
and statutes



                                                     6

employees
addtech aims to regularly conduct employee questionnaires and has to the date conducted three the
questionnaire follows up addtechs longterm and strategic hr development work and the survey
identifies the groups and subsidiaries strengths and weaknesses as an employer as well as mapping
areas for improvement addtech has consistently achieved good results and in general has very satisfied
employees this years survey demonstrated additional improvement in the work environment  largely
thanks to the introduction of more structured performance appraisals with employees

the aim of the employee survey is to identify areas in which the subsidiaries and group currently perform
well as an employer and identify areas of improvement at the same time from a group perspective the
survey enables addtech to offer support to the subsidiaries where there are common needs while
disseminating knowledge and ideas from successful companies throughout the group

addtechs group management encourages each managing director at each subsidiary to prepare a plan of
action based on the individual results of the company as the subsidiaries size and preconditions vary
some subsidiaries have several hundred employees with a smoothly running hr department while others
are small consisting of a handful of people the results of the survey form the basis of longterm
strategic staff development work in the group addtechs ambition is to conduct annual employee surveys
in order to identify changes

the technology trading industry has historically been male dominated and this is also apparent in the
proportion of female applicants to institutes of technology in sweden in relation to male applicants
addtechs ambition is by being an attractive employer to continually increase the proportion of women in
the group the proportion of women and men in the group shall at least reflect the general gender
distribution in the industry and the proportion of graduates from institutes of technology addtech is in line
with the distribution in swedens technical courses where the proportion of female applicants and
accepted candidates is 30 percent between the 20142015 and 20152016 financial years we see small
improvements and the group continues the longterm work with recruiting more women key figures for
the gender breakdown between men and women in different functions at addtech are shown in the table
above

wage differences for men and women in the group vary between different areas of position addtech has
identified an uneven distribution in the salaries of men and women however it ought to be mentioned
that no account was taken of age scope of period of work previous experience training or productivity
addtech obviously strives to ensure that all employees in the group irrespective of gender are given
equal opportunities for remuneration for equivalent work and is working actively to break down the old
pattern




                                                                                                                                                    9

the apparently skewed relationship shown in the table above between womens and mens salaries in
production is due to the fact that the majority of the women working in production are in the nordic
countries while a large proportion of the men are employed in countries as poland and china with lower
salary levels

dialogue with the groups employees takes place at each company in the group for example in
connection with the annual performance appraisal addtechs development and competitiveness are
strongly linked to the skills development and wellbeing of its employees the group companies strive to
be attractive employers that offer our employees solid personal development opportunities

one ambition in the group is that all employees should have a personal performance appraisal meeting
with their immediate manager each year an important part of the performance appraisal is to identify
ways of improving the expertise and wellbeing of the employee another is to increase contentment and
job satisfaction in the workplace




                                                         10

over the coming year addtech will continue to review the procedures and tools that are available to
group companies in order to increase the proportion of performance appraisals conducted special
efforts are made for newly acquired companies

to develop the skills of our employees is to develop addtechs operations to this end we run our own
business school for instance for over a decade the addtech business school has trained about a hundred
addtech employees each year in areas such as group corporate culture business acumen and presentation
and negotiation techniques the table above shows the number of training days per employee and per
employee category during the year
the term training is defined as


  all types of professional courses and training

  paid leave granted to employees by the company for training

  external training paid for wholly or partly by the company

  training on special topics such as health and safety

  training at suppliers


direct instructions by a manager in the workplace are not included

health and safety forms a priority area for addtech the group has a zero vision for workrelated accidents
illnesses and incidents and an ambition to focus constantly on promoting better health and wellbeing
among our employees in addtechs various productionbased units there are potential risks of workrelated
illnesses and accidents however there are also risks of accidents in the sales process for example during
travel to and from customers and when visiting to customers factories or other facilities the health and
safety table provides an overview of addtechs results in this area no workrelated fatalities occurred during
the year



bribery and corruption
as a technology trading group addtech cannot ignore the possibility of our employees being subjected to
bribery particularly in connection with purchases in countries where corruption is generally more
extensive the trend in corruption in various countries where addtech operates is monitored constantly
for example via the transparency international website wwwtransparencyorg business ethics has
always been high on the groups agenda and are an issue that is constantly addressed in for instance
the groups own business school the group has zero tolerance towards corruption and the fact that no
cases of corruption occurred during the year 0 is thus in line with our expectations
customers

customers
contact with our customers is handled through addtechs subsidiaries more rigorous sustainability
demands from our customers are emerging more and more clearly for instance our customers are
starting to perform csr screening on their suppliers  that is addtech group subsidiaries in order to
continue to be a valuable link between manufacturer and user addtech must progress in line with the
heightened demand and be able to present its sustainability work in a satisfying way

the groups subsidiaries are active in a host of different markets and a variety of industries this involves
different types of customer requirements however it may be said in general terms that many of the
requirements relate to safety in workplaces and the environment the requirements for resource
consumption energy efficiency and environmental impact however has increased in recent years which
in turn means increased demands on addtechs companies to provide solutions and products that meet
these requirements

at some of the groups companies enquiries relating to reach the eus regulation on the registration
evaluation authorisation  restriction of chemicals are also common furthermore demands that
addtech and eventually our own subcontractors comply with international conventions on human rights
are also expressed

suppliers

suppliers
the majority of the sales generated by addtech companies comes from the resale of products and
solutions of global and marketleading suppliers addtech has a large number of suppliers worldwide and
more than 70 of the groups purchases are from suppliers outside the nordics in europe the us and
asia relationships with our suppliers are often longstanding and feature close collaboration on how the
suppliers products can be used in a variety of customer applications many suppliers have worked with
addtech subsidiaries for decades however there is always a certain amount of supplier turnover and
addtech is constantly on the hunt for new partners and agency companies that can complement or boost
our existing business our close relationship with suppliers is highly positive in terms of both the
operations and csr we continually work with deepening these relationships and ensuring that our
suppliers meet a good requirement level in relation to their employees and the environment

as parts of a technology trading group with operations in a large number of countries business ethics
risks pose a potential threat to the groups companies addtechs goal in terms of linking the issue of
responsibility to our suppliers is clear in 20102011 the groups code of conduct was updated and now
expressly describes the groups expectations as to how suppliers should act in relation to both the
environment and their employees the code is available at wwwaddtechcomcsr

the good reputation of addtech and our subsidiaries is one of our strongest competitive assets any
infringements of addtech policy on human rights and occupational conditions would therefore have a
considerable detrimental impact on stakeholder confidence no incidents of infringements of human rights
were reported either in 20142015 or earlier years

supplier survey
addtech works continuously on deepening supplier relationships and ensuring that they meet a good level
of requirements in relation to their employees and the environment as part of these efforts at the end of
20112012 addtech conducted its first supplier surveythe analysis of the suppliers sustainability and
relationship to addtechs code of conduct has continued during the year and efforts to obtain more
responses continue no significant inadequacies have emerged among the suppliers to date during the
year more companies participated in the supplier evaluation and additional companies will be channelled
into this evaluation during the financial year 20162017

the objective of supplier surveys is to ensure that addtech works with responsible suppliers addtechs
ambition is to raise expectations on suppliers and emphasise the importance of suppliers assuming social
and environmental responsibility so that the entire value chain works towards the same objective
society

society
addtechs most important positive impact on society lies in our contribution to economic and social growth
in the form of jobs and taxpayers as well as the groups own tax payments we also strive for our
products to bring efficiency improvements and to cut energy consumption for our customers

in line with the addtech philosophy of decentralised responsibility no groupwide projects connected to
social commitment are conducted apart from our subsidiaries working towards a sustainable technological
development the subsidiaries are responsible for taking into account their surroundings and maintaining
a good dialogue with the surrounding society

added environmental value

added environmental value
a strong intention to safeguard the environment forms part of addtechs business strategy the aim is to
minimise addtechs impact on the environment by working to reduce waste increase the share of
renewable energy and use natural resources more efficiently and cautiously addtechs main operations
consist today of technology sales and distribution in around 30 countries the proportion of group
companies which conduct their own production comprising the use of raw materials chemicals and fossil
fuels increased during the year however production represents only a limited proportion of the groups
operations so addtechs main direct impact on climate is from the transportation of finished goods and
business travel the majority of group purchases is from suppliers outside the nordics in europe the us
and asia necessitating a high transport volume the aggregated environmental impact of the products
provided by our companies also includes production operations at our suppliers and eventually also how
customers use the products we consequently seek to take the entire lifecycle of our operations into
account in the groups constant improvement work we are also constantly working to develop more
sustainable products and solutions that help our customers reduce their environmental impact in this
way we can make a difference on a larger scale

addtechs major environmental aspects may be summarised as follows


  transport of goods and employees

  useconsumption of energy raw materials and chemicals

  emissions and waste from production


the groups emissionrelated risks are mainly associated with carbon dioxide emissions such emissions
are caused primarily through combustion of fossil fuels in the groups own operations chiefly through the
transport of goods and employees and also indirectly through procurement of electricity generated by the
combustion of fossil fuels

the group has not either during the year or in previous years been subject to any fines relating to
breaches of environmental legislation


nearly half of the electricity used in the group comes from renewable sources ambitious work is underway to
constantly increase that share

addtechs environmental policy
the addtech groups environmental policy which is part of our code of conduct expresses our intention
to shoulder our part of the responsibility of improving the environment and working to promote lasting
sustainable development environmental activities shall be conducted within the scope of our business
concept and be closely integrated into operational activities environmental measures shall be
implemented to the extent they are technically feasible reasonable from a business economic viewpoint
and environmentally justified responsibility for ongoing environmental work rests with each individual
company in the group the environmental policy involves the addtech companies working according to
the following points


  addtech shall minimise the occurrence of waste and prevent any risks of emissions

  environmental performance shall be taken into account in the choice of products and transport methods

  addtech shall constantly encourage its employees and suppliers to perform open and committed
  environmental work

  addtechs environmental work shall lead to constant improvements and prevailing legal requirements
  are minimum requirements for the operations

addtechs energy consumption
during the year the groups total energy consumption declined to 195 gwh 208 gwh out of the
energy consumption electricity consumption accounts for 72 percent 69 comprises electricity and 28
percent 31 district heating out of the total energy 47 percent 42 came from renewable sources an
increase of 5 percentage points 5

in relation to sales the proportion of renewable energy sources decreased by 2 percent 16 while the
proportion of nonrenewable sources decreased by 19 percent one of addtechs overarching goals is to
reduce energy consumption over time relative to our sales and to strive to continuously increase the
proportion of renewablesource energy used in its operations the table displays energy consumption

climate impact
addtechs impact on the climate principally comprises carbon dioxide emissions combustion of fossil fuels
also produces emissions of other greenhouse gases but addtech has concluded that carbon dioxide
emissions represent the biggest threat from the groups operations

in the calculation of carbon dioxide emissions arising from electricity generation the calculation was
based on nordic electricity generation where 1 kwh is estimated to generate 01 kg co2

in addition to emissions arising from the internal use of fossil fuels and electricity carbon dioxide
emissions are also generated by various kinds of transport including transport of materials and products
as well as employee travel addtech reports carbon dioxide emissions for employee travel and for
materials and product transport according to the table below which shows the groups co2 emissions
