    presented in kenya shillings shs rounded to the nearest thousands except where otherwise indicated

   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates it also requires
   management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the groups accounting policies the areas involving a higher degree
   of judgement or complexity or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 3

changes in accounting policy and disclosures
a new standards amendments and interpretations adopted by the group
   the following standards have been adopted by the group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 january 2014
   and have a material impact on the group

   amendment to ias 32 financial instruments presentation on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities this amendment
   clarifies that the right of setoff must not be contingent on a future event it must also be legally enforceable for all counterparties in
   the normal course of business as well as in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy the amendment also considers settlement
   mechanisms the amendment did not have a significant effect on the group financial statements

2 summary of significant accounting policies continued
a basis of preparation continued
changes in accounting policy and disclosures continued
a new standards amendments and interpretations adopted by the group continued
   amendment to ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement on the novation of derivatives and the continuation of
   hedge accounting this amendment considers legislative changes to overthecounter derivatives and the establishment of central
   counterparties under ias 39 novation of derivatives to central counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting the
   amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified criteria the
   group has applied the amendment and there has been no significant impact on the group financial statements as a result

   ifric 21 levies sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of ias 37 provisions the
   interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognised the group
   is not currently subjected to significant levies so the impact on the group is not material

   other standards amendments and interpretations which are effective for the financial year beginning on 1 january 2014 are not
   material to the group

b new standards amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
   a number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1
   january 2014 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements none of these is expected to have a
   significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group except the following set out below

   ifrs 9 financial instruments addresses the classification measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
   the complete version of ifrs 9 was issued in july 2014 it replaces the guidance in ias 39 that relates to the classification and
   measurement of financial instruments ifrs 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary
   measurement categories for financial assets amortised cost fair value through oci and fair value through pl the basis of
   classification depends on the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset investments
   in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception present
   changes in fair value in oci not recycling there is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment
   model used in ias 39

   for financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit
   risk in other comprehensive income for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss ifrs 9 relaxes the requirements for
   hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests it requires an economic relationship between the hedged
   item and hedging instrument and for the hedged ratio to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management
   purposes
   contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under ias 39 the standard is effective for
   accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018 early adoption is permitted the group is yet to assess ifrs 9s full impact

   ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful
   information to users of financial statements about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
   from an entitys contracts with customers revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has
   the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service the standard replaces ias 18 revenue and ias 11
   construction contracts and related interpretations the standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2017
   and earlier application is permitted the group is assessing the impact of ifrs 15

    there are no other ifrss or ifric interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the
    group
b consolidation
i subsidiaries
   subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the group has control the group controls an entity when the
   group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
   through its power over the entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group they
   are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases

   the group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations the consideration transferred for the acquisition of
   a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity
   interests issued by the group the consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
   consideration arrangement identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
   measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date the group recognises any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree on an
   acquisitionbyacquisition basis either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts
   of acquirees identifiable net assets

   acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred
   if the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in
   the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised
   in profit or loss

   	any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date subsequent changes to
   the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with ias 39 either
   in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured
   and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity

   intercompany transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated unrealised losses
   are also eliminated when necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the groups accounting
   policies

notes to the financial statements continued
2 summary of significant accounting policies continued
b consolidation continued
i subsidiaries continued
     acquisition of entities under common control is accounted for using predecessor accounting
ii changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
     transactions with noncontrolling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions  that is as
     transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners the difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant
     share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains or losses on disposals to noncontrolling
     interests are also recorded in equity
iii disposal of subsidiaries
    when the group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is
    lost with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss the fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of
    subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate joint venture or financial asset in addition any amounts previously
    recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related
    assets or liabilities this may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss
iv associates
   associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control generally accompanying a shareholding of
   between 20 and 50 of the voting rights investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting under
   the equity method the investment is initially recognised at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the
   investors share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition the groups investment in associates includes goodwill
   identified on acquisition

   if the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained only a proportionate share of the amounts
   previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate

   the groups share of postacquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement and its share of postacquisition movements
   in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount
   of the investment when the groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate including any other
   unsecured receivables the group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made
   payments on behalf of the associate

   the group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired
   if this is the case the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate
   and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share of profitloss of associates in the income statement

   profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the group and its associate are recognised in the
   groups financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associates unrealised losses are eliminated

b consolidation continued
iv associates continued
   unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred accounting policies of associates have been changed
   where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group dilution gains and losses arising in investments in
   associates are recognised in the income statement
v joint arrangements
  the group applies ifrs 11 to all joint arrangements under ifrs 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint
  operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor ifrs gaap plc has assessed the nature
  of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method

  under the equity method of accounting interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise
  the groups share of the postacquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income

  when the groups share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures which includes any longterm
  interests that in substance form part of the groups net investment in the joint ventures the group does not recognise further losses
  unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures

   unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the
   joint ventures unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred
   accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
   group
vi separate financial statements
   in the separate financial statements investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for at cost less impairment cost is
   adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments cost also includes direct attributable
   costs of investment

   dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established
c functional currency and translation of foreign currencies
i functional and presentation currency
   items included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
   environment in which the entity operates the functional currency the consolidated financial statements are presented in kenya
   shillings which is the companys functional and presentation currency		
ii transactions and balances
   foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions
   or valuation where items are remeasured foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and
   from the translation at yearend exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in
   the income statement

ii transactions and balances continued
   foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the income statement within finance income or cost all
   other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within other operating income or other expenses

   translation differences related to changes in amortised cost are recognised in the income statement and other changes in carrying
   amount are recognised in other comprehensive income

     translation differences on nonmonetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are
     recognised in the income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss translation differences on nonmonetary financial assets such
     as equities classified as availableforsale financial assets are included in other comprehensive income		
iii group companies
   the results and financial position of all the group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have
   a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows

  i assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting
        period
  ii income and expenses for each income statement amount are translated at average exchange rates unless this average is not
        a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates in which case income and
        expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions and
  iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the currency translation reserve

   on consolidation exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to other
   comprehensive income when a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold exchange differences that are recorded in equity are
   recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale

    goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
    entity and translated at the closing rate
d segment reporting
    operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decisionmaker
    codm the codm who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments has been
    identified as the managing director who makes strategic decisions
e revenue recognition
    revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course
    of the groups activities revenue is shown net of valueadded tax vat returns rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales
    within the group the group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured it is probable that future
    economic benefits will flow to the group and when specific criteria have been met for each of the groups activities as described below

e revenue recognition continued
    the group bases its estimates on historical results taking into consideration the type of customer the type of transaction and the
    specifics of each arrangement
    revenue is recognised as follows
    i sales of goods are recognised in the period in which the group has delivered products to the customer and there is no unfulfilled
          obligation that could affect the customers acceptance of the products delivery does not occur until the products have been
          accepted by the customer
    ii sales of services are recognised in the period in which the services are rendered by reference to completion of the specific
          transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a percentage of the total services to be provided
    iii interest income is recognised using the effective interest method
    iv dividends are recognised as income in the period in which the right to receive payment is established

f property plant and equipment
    all categories of property plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost land and buildings are subsequently shown at fair value
    based on periodic but at least every five year valuations by external independent valuers less subsequent depreciation for buildings
    all other property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation historical cost includes expenditure that is
    directly attributable to the acquisition of the items

   subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable
   that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably all
   other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred

   increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation are credited to a revaluation surplus reserve in equity decreases that offset
   previous increases of the same asset are charged against the revaluation surplus all other decreases are charged to profit or loss each
   year the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset the depreciation charged to profit or loss
   and depreciation based on the assets original cost is transferred from the revaluation surplus to retained earnings

   depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight line method to write down their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values
   over their estimated useful lives as follows

                                                 useful life                                   residual values

f property plant and equipment continued
    on opening of a new unit initial purchases of operating equipment such as crockery and beddings are capitalised at cost and subsequent
    replacements to maintain operating equipment at par stock level are expensed in the year of purchase carrying values are validated
    every three years
   an assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater
   than its estimated recoverable amount
   gains and losses on disposal of property plant and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are included
   in profit or loss on disposal of revalued assets amounts in the revaluation surplus relating to that asset are transferred to retained
   earnings
g intangible assets
    goodwill
    	goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries associates and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration
    transferred over the companys interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
    acquiree and the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree

   for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cgus or groups of
   cgus that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated
   represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes goodwill is
   monitored at the operating segment level

    goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential
    impairment the carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount which is the higher of value in use and the fair
    value less costs to sell any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed
h impairment of nonfinancial assets
    	assets that have an indefinite useful life  for example goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortisation
    and are tested annually for impairment assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognised for the amount
    by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value
    less costs to sell and value in use
   for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
   cashgenerating units nonfinancial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the
   impairment at each reporting date
i financial assets		
i classification
  the group classifies its financial assets under loans and receivables the classification depends on the purpose for which the financial
  assets were acquired management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and reevaluates such
  designation periodically

i financial assets continued
loans and receivables
   loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
   effective interest method they are included in current assets loans and receivables are included in receivables and prepayments in
   the statement of financial position
ii offsetting financial instruments
   financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally
   enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the
   liability simultaneously
iii impairment of financial assets
   assets carried at amortised cost
   the group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
   assets is impaired a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is
   objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event
   and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that
   can be reliably estimated

   	evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty
   default or delinquency in interest or principal payments the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation
   and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows such as changes in arrears
   or economic conditions that correlate with defaults

    for loans and receivables category the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the
    present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial
    assets original effective interest rate the carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit
    or loss if a loan has a variable interest rate the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest
    rate determined under the contract as a practical expedient the group and company may measure impairment on the basis of an
    instruments fair value using an observable market price
j accounting for leases
    leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases
    payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the lease

    the group leases certain property plant and equipment leases of property plant and equipment where the group has substantially
    all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases finance leases are capitalised at the leases commencement at
    the lower of the fair value of the lease property and the present value of the minimum lease payments
k inventories
    inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value cost is determined by the weighted average method and computed
    as the cost of purchase plus any incidental costs incurred in bringing inventory items to their present location net realisable value
    is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business less the costs of completion and selling expenses inventories
    mainly comprise hotel consumables food and beverage items

l receivables
   trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business if
   collection is expected in one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer they are a classified as current
   assets if not they are presented as noncurrent assets

   trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
   method less provision for impairment note i

   receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from financial assets has expired or where the company has
   transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership
m payables
   trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers
   accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the
   business if longer if not they are presented as noncurrent liabilities

    payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method
    payables are derecognised when extinguished
n share capital
    ordinary shares are classified as share capital in equity any premium received over and above the par value of the shares is classified
    as share premium in equity
o cash and cash equivalents
    in the consolidated statement of cash flows cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand deposits held at call with banks other
    shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts bank overdrafts are shown
    within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of financial position
p employee benefits
i retirement benefit obligations
   for unionised employees the group has an unfunded obligation to pay terminal gratuities under its collective bargaining agreement
   with the union employees who resign after serving for periods of between five years and ten years receive eighteen days salary and
   house allowance for each completed year of service at the rate of pay applicable at the date of resigning those who resign after serving
   for more than ten years receive twenty four days salary and house allowance for each completed year of service the defined benefit
   obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method

   the group in kenya operates a defined contribution postemployment benefit scheme for all its permanent employees after their first
   year of employment the assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund which is funded by contributions from
   both the group and the employees the group and all its permanent employees also contribute to the statutory national social security

   funds which are defined contribution schemes the groups contributions to both these defined contribution schemes are charged to
   the income statement in the year in which they fall due the group has no further obligation once the contributions have been paid

   the estimated monetary liability for employees accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date is recognised as an expense
   accrual

p employee benefits continued
ii termination benefits
    termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date or whenever
    an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits the group recognises termination benefits when it
    is demonstrably committed to a termination when the entity has a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current
    employees without possibility of withdrawal in the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy the termination benefits
    are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end
    of the reporting period are discounted to their present value
q current and deferred income tax
    the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
    extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in this case the tax is also recognised
    in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively

   the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date management
   periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to
   interpretation it establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities
   		
   deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
   liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements however if the deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they
   arise from the initial recognition of goodwill deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or
   liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
   profit or loss deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
   reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax liability is settled

   deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
   which the temporary differences can be utilised

   deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the
   timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
   reverse in the foreseeable future

    deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current
    tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on
    either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis
r borrowings
    borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised
    cost using the effective interest method any differences between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is
    recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings

   borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at
   least 12 months after the reporting date

s dividend distribution
    dividend distribution to the companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared dividends
    are declared upon approval at the annual general meeting proposed dividends are disclosed separately within equity until declared
t comparatives
    where necessary comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation in the current year

3 critical accounting estimates and judgements
    	estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including experience of
    future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
i critical accounting estimates and assumptions
   the group and company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future the resulting accounting estimates will by
   definition seldom equal the related actual results the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
   adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below
   impairment of goodwill
   the group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note
   2h the recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units have been determined based on valueinuse calculations these calculations
   require the use of estimates note 20
   income taxes
   the group is subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions significant judgement is required in determining the groups provision
   for income taxes there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the
   ordinary course of business the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional
   taxes will be due where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such
   differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made
   gratuity scheme obligations
   the present value of the gratuity obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number
   of assumptions the assumptions used in determining the net cost income for gratuity include the discount rate and future salary
   increases any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of gratuity obligations

     the group relies on an independent actuary to determine the appropriate discount rate at the end of the year this is the interest rate
     that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension
     obligations
     		
     other key assumptions for gratuity obligations are based in part on current market conditions additional information is disclosed in
     note 16
ii critical judgements in applying the groups accounting policies
   in the process of applying the groups accounting policies management has made judgements in determining
    the classification of financial assets and leases
    whether financial and nonfinancial assets are impaired

4 financial risk management		
   the groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including credit risk and the effects of changes in debt and equity
   market prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the groups overall risk management programme focuses on the
   unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance

     financial risk management is carried out by the board of directors under the guidance of management board of directors identifies
     evaluates and hedges financial risks the board of directors provides guidance on principles for overall risk management covering
     specific areas such as foreign exchange risk interest rate risk credit risk use of derivative and nonderivative financial instruments
     and investment of excess liquidity
     		
market risk
i foreign exchange risk
   the group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with
   respect to the us dollar foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities and net
   investments in foreign operations
   		
   the group aims to minimise volatility arising from fluctuations in exchange rates by adopting natural hedges such as holding cash
   balances in foreign currencies to hedge against any foreign currency denominated amounts payable 		

     the group manages foreign exchange risk by converting its foreign currency collections into local currency on an ongoing basis to
     cater for its operational requirements as a result the group does not hold large amounts of foreign currency deposits in addition the
     group receives its collections in foreign currency and therefore any future foreign currency commercial transactions are settled in the
     same currency to avoid the effect of swinging currency exchange rates
     		
     currency exposure arising from the net assets of foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the
     relevant foreign currencies
     		
     at 31 december 2014 if the shilling had weakenedstrengthened by 5 against the us dollar with all other variables held constant
     consolidated post tax profit for the year would have been shs 7863939 2013 shs 14724043  higherlower mainly as a result of
     us dollar receivables payables and bank balances
ii price risk
     the group does not have any assets subject to price risk as at 31 december 2014 2013 nil
iii cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
   the group has borrowings at variable rates the group does not hedge itself against interest rate risk no limits are placed on the ratio
   of variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing at 31 december 2014 an increasedecrease of 10 on interest rate would have
   resulted in an increasedecrease in consolidated post tax profit of shs 22746492 2013 14774186
credit risk
   credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposures to
   customers including outstanding receivables and committed transactions credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its
   contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group

capital risk management
 the groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
 returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital in order to maintain or adjust the
 capital structure the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders issue new capital or sell assets to reduce debt
 during 2014 the groups strategy which was unchanged from 2013 was to maintain a gearing ratio between 25 and 40 the
 gearing ratios at 31 december 2014 and 2013 as follows
                                                                                                                   2014               2013

discount rate based upon the borrowing rate that directors expect would be available to the group at the balance sheet date
it is impracticable to assign fair values to the groups long term liabilities due to inability to forecast interest rate and foreign exchange
rate changes
none of the above borrowings was in default at any time in the year
