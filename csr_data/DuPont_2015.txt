agriculture  nutrition the science of feeding the world

global perspective enabling a smarter                               one example of a more sustainable approach to food production
more sustainable food system                                          is the concept of smart farming which is gaining traction
grocery stores or markets in the developed world can give the         smart farming uses a growing array of new tools that can
impression that we live in an age of unrivaled abundance but in      assist in enhancing productivity and yields while reducing inputs
reality worldwide food suppliers are under tremendous stress        emissions and resource use data is used to drive precision
access to food for many is a daily struggle and the situation is     farming and the results can be dramatic these tools not only
likely to become much more challenging  even dire  if we dont      help boost productivity but can also extend to help reduce food
take action now                                                      loss and waste elsewhere in the food supply network


by 2050 an estimated 9 billion people will inhabit our planet       food security and sustainable food systems are closely
much of the population growth will occur in developing countries     intertwined the actions we take to enhance the sustainability
many of which are already struggling to meet their current food       of the food supply must also assure better food security and
needs another demographic trend is the rise of the middle class      access to nutritious food for all collaboration and creativity are
worldwide who demand a more diverse and nutritious diet             imperative in this regard but so is transparency people want to
                                                                      understand how their food is grown and how it gets to them
environmental factors add to the food challenge a changing           ultimately our goal is to build an even stronger foundation for
climate leading to more extreme weather events  variable            sustainably meeting one of humankinds most basic needs
precipitation floods and droughts  and higher average
temperatures are all expected to impact crop yields in many parts
of the world

agricultures environmental footprint is significant the food and
agriculture organization of the united nations fao estimates
that agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of all fresh water
withdrawals and that farming and livestock activity could produce
30 percent more greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and it is
estimated that up to 40 of all food grown is lost or wasted

dupont believes that to address a challenge of this scale
 and urgency  we need to work together with all
stakeholders to create a more sustainable food system
that incorporates key principles
                                                                            evalio agrosystems is a free monitoring service for sustainable pest

  integrated and holistic land use water and energy
   efficiency and ecosystems and biodiversity are all interrelated        modern sustainable pest management
   and need to be considered holistically in developing solutions
                                                                           pests can significantly reduce agricultural yields and quality
  focused on local impact solutions must support local
                                                                           most farmers rely on inefficient calendarspraying and other
   communities enhance livelihoods and assure social and
                                                                           preestablished programs that produce mixed results thats
   economic value to those connected to the food system
                                                                           where evalio agrosystems comes in utilizing a network
                                                                           that monitors pest populations and their movements it offers
  collaborative food and agriculture is a system so we need             realtime warnings to farmers resulting in crop protection
   to take a value network approach collaboration among all               measures that are targeted for maximum benefit tested
   stakeholders big and small is essential if we are to bring            against conventional growing methods in italy results
   sustainable scalable solutions to the market                          included improved yield and crop quality economic savings
                                                                           for farmers and a reduction in water consumption and
  innovative product technical process and business model              greenhouse gas emissions
   innovations will all be required to realize a more sustainable

remain in fields after the corn harvest  as a feedstock to produce cellulosic ethanol
cellulosic ethanol is one of the cleanestburning fuels on the planet reducing carbon
emissions by 90 over traditional fossil fuels dupont is producing this renewable
cellulosic ethanol at the companys new biorefinery in nevada iowa completed in
2015 this plant is the worlds largest bioethanol refinery producing 30 million gallons
of cellulosic ethanol per year to learn more visit our website

using enzymes to sustainably improve animal feed
phosphorus is important for animal feed but excessive use of it can harm water
supplies dupont created a new enzyme for feed axtra phy which can increase the
phosphorous uptake by approximately 20 resulting in less phosphorus required in
animal diets and less phosphorous in their waste negative water quality impacts can
be reduced by as much as 30 when manure used as fertilizer is applied to lands not
requiring additional phosphorus



                                                                                                  dupont created a new enzyme for feed axtra

dupont is innovating along the food value chain to reduce global food waste for
example dupont industrial biosciences has developed a range of dupont danisco
enzymes that help reduce food waste from baked goods approximately 30 percent
of bakery products go uneaten often because they are considered to have gone bad
or stale duponts enzymes can extend product freshness the longer an item stays
on the shelf the more likely it is to be eaten the more efficiently we are consuming
the food intended for our tables

advanced materials the science of innovative solutions


  global perspective keeping the world moving  sustainably
  it is estimated that by 2050 more than 2 billion light duty fourwheel vehicles will be on
  roads worldwide more than double the number today how can we mitigate the effect of
  this growth on the environment one approach is to reduce the weight of vehicles reducing
  vehicle weight is directly linked to lower co2 emissions improved fuel economy and
  minimization of tire wear and tear the benefits of even modest vehicle weight reduction are
  significant reducing an automobiles weight by a mere 10 improves fuel economy by 5 to
  7 and our products are a big part of achieving that

  to help drive a future of sustainable mobility we are engineering lighter advanced materials
  that are both strong and durable and collaborating with vehicle makers to replace metal
  components with high performance polymers without sacrificing performance for example
  lightweight dupont hytrel tpcet thermoplastic elastomer has the flexibility of rubber but
  the strength of plastic and is ideal for replacing metal parts in air ducts dupont crastin       dupont advanced materials are helping the aerospace
                                                                                                       industry drive fuel efficiency of the airbus a380
  pbt polyester resin and other dupont performance polymers help automotive engineers                  through lightweighting
  achieve even more vehicle weight reduction

  lightweight structures enable cost efficiency energy savings increased speed and distance
  potential and its application extends beyond the automotive industry to other forms of
  transportation such as bicycles and airplanes our innovations such as dupont nomex
  kevlar tedlar kalrez and vespel are helping the aerospace industry drive fuel efficiency
  through lightweighting for example the airbus a380 the worlds largest passenger jetliner
  carries 40 more passengers than its largest competitor yet uses 15 to 20 less fuel
  flies farther and emits less co2 per passenger all due to lightweight composite materials
  including kevlar and nomex
