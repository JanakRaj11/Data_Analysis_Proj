    i understand that kdhc is very interested in the reduction of co2 emissions and environment and that it systematically copes with such i have
    heard that kdhcs activation of heating cooling and electric power businesses along with the new renewable energy business is very excellent
    because kdhc carries out management considering the environment i think kdhc needs to cement its status and role as a general energy
    company more on the pr dimension through its dynamic businesses so that the company can be heard more by customers communities and
    citizens

 suji sewerage treatment plant suji respia of the 110000 tons dai
 ly average sewerage discharged from the suji sewerage treatment
 plant 30000 tons of discharged water is absorbed by heat pumps
 and heated as heating water this way we produce heat energy that
 can be used by about 1100 households currently 2 of the heat en

     the active communication activities of kdhc which collects various stakeholders opinions and develops by reflecting them on the corporations
     management are evaluated very positively i think kdhcs supply of heat and electric energy at cheap prices to korean people is commendable
     still i believe kdhc needs to enhance its corporate image and credibility through the precise recognition of kdhcs specific businesses and active
     social contribution activities by korean people through more strategic and overall pr activities i expect kdhc to grow and develop further with

the district cooling system does not discharge ozone layerdestroy          improvement for district cooling system dissemination
ing materials such as freon gas since it supplies a cooling system
using heat for the district heating service in other words the district
cooling system is environmentfriendly and is able to reduce power
peak load in summertime when the district cooling system is ad
opted each household does not have to use an air conditioner thus
reducing electricity use considerably                                              excellent and
the district cooling business is a must to cut energy use reduce the                 advanced
peak load boiler and enhance the use rate of chp plants kdhc is                  cooling system
currently expanding its business area from heat and warm water
supply to cooling system
our district cooling system uses a dehumidification cooling mode
supplying cold air using the existing heating pipes thus business
size is forecast to grow we also develop a user system for high
