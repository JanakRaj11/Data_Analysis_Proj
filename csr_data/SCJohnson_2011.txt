the importance of green chemistry
at sc johnson we believe the safety and environmental profile of our products is critical

from sam johnsons decision in 1975 to remove chlorofluorocar         in his speech johnson explained some of the steps that
bons from the companys aerosol products to the 2001 launch           sc johnson is taking to further extend its leadership efforts 
of the companys greenlist process for selecting ingredients         such as disclosing all ingredients in products including fragrance
sc johnson has a long legacy of choosing better greener and           ingredients dyes and preservatives and advocating for reform
more sustainable chemicals                                            of the toxic substances control act tsca

in fact our chairman and ceo fisk johnson believes even more        he also noted the important roles of government and industry
is needed from industry government and consumers alike as            and the need for science to innovate and close knowledge gaps
he shared at the 15th annual green chemistry and engineering           about the safety and toxicological properties of chemicals

                  of our childrens children                         this is a key objective for sc johnson in the years ahead

launching a revolution with windex mini
sc johnson recently took a bold step to help consumers make green choices
with the launch of windex mini concentrated refill pouch

concentrates use less packaging decrease shipping impacts          avoids transporting
and reduce waste that ends up in us landfills yet sales            224 fl oz of water 
data suggests that us consumers prefer the convenience of           nearly 15 pounds by weight
prefilled products this means stores wont stock concentrates
and companies hesitate to create them sc johnson wants            if sc johnson can prove

            transparency in focus
            the challenge of consumer perceptions
  while were always looking for improvements that could offer a positive environmental benefit
  sometimes its a challenge to introduce these products because consumers are hesitant to make the change
  an example is ziploc evolve sandwich and storage bags introduced in 2009 these ultralight bags are made with 25 percent
  less plastic than regular ziploc brand bags theyre also packaged in 100 percent recycled paperboard cartons with a minimum
  of 35 percent postconsumer waste and produced at a factory powered by up to 50 percent renewable wind energy
  yet adoption of ziploc evolve bags has been slow the bags offer the same tight secure ziploc brand seal as our regular
  bags but because they feel thinner many consumers dont trust them to do the job sales have been disappointing and we need
  to continue to look at the economic side of the equation to determine the longterm fate of the product
  still sc johnson is continuing to explore advances we can make in the home storage area of our business through dialogue
  and education with consumers we believe we can and will ultimately find the key to inspiring more green choices
