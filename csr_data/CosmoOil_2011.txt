      fire and explosions at chiba refinery
      updates on the march 11 accident at the chiba refinery have been posted to the cosmo oil website


      accident summary
      on march 11 2011 the great east japan earthquake occurred off the coast of tohoku                                                                        n figure 1 chiba refinery site
      followed by a subsequent quake off the coast of ibaraki prefecture the quakes triggered
      a fire and explosions at the liquefied petroleum gas lpg facilities of the cosmo oil chiba
      refinery in ichihara city chiba prefecture the fire was successfully extinguished on march
      21 but the chiba refinery remained shut down as of september 30 2011 production at
      the yokkaichi refinery and sakaide refinery has been increased since march 15
            in response to the accident cosmo oil assembled the accident investigation committee
      on april 1 2011 which has produced a report on its findings the report details the
      circumstances and causes of the accident as well as measures to prevent future accidents


      the facts surrounding the fire and explosion are as follows in chronological order
        at 246 pm on march 11 2011 the great east japan earthquake occurred in the
        pacific ocean off the coast of tohoku the quake registered a lowerfive in seismic                                                               north bank

        tank no 364 fig 2 and 3 which at the time was not full of lpg but water used to
        purge air from the tank for a regulatory overhaul inspection
        at 315 pm another earthquake occurred off the coast of ibaraki prefecture the
        quake registered a four in seismic intensity in ichihara city
        the second quake buckled the support legs with fractured crossbraces of lpg                                                                                                         layout of chiba

        tank no 364 which caused the tank to collapse this led to the rupture of multiple
        pipes near the tank and the leakage of lpg
         the leaking lpg spread and caught fire leading to a fire near lpg tank no 364 fig 4
         the fire caused an adjacent lpg tank to explode as the fire spread
         the spreading fire caused the explosion of other nearby lpg tanks and the fire
         continued to spread
         after continuous efforts to put out the fire it was completely extinguished at 1010

accident causes and future preventative measures
1 fracture of many lpg tank support crossbraces and buckling and                            n figure 3 fractured support braces of lpg tank no 364
   collapse of tank supports
lpg tank no 364 was designed and built to seismic standards at the time of the
accident the tank was full of water which weighs twice as much as lpg in preparation
for regulatory overhaul inspections the initial quake combined with the added weight
                                                                                                                fractured support braces
caused the support crossbraces to fracture and the subsequent quake caused the
support legs to buckle and the tank to collapse better recognition was needed of the
potential risk from an earthquake occurring when a tank was filled with water
       from now on the company will shorten the period during which the tanks are
filled to capacity with water future lpg tanks will be designed specifically to hold a full
tank of water and existing lpg tanks will be evaluated and reinforced to address the
possibility of a tank collapsing thereby damaging nearby pipelines and equipment the
company will modify its facilities to protect pipelines and equipment and enable the
isolation and separation of pipelines as safeguards against lpg leakage


2 lpg leaks
the evidence indicates that the quakes shook but did not damage the actual lpg
tanks and pipelines the collapse of lpg tank no 364 is what fractured pipelines and
caused the leakage of lpg
     the evidence further suggests that lpg was leaking from three places one of
which was connected to an emergency shutoff valve1 that had been locked in an open             n figure 4 ignition of leaking lgp and fire
position this had been done prior to the quake in order to repair a minor leak in a           refer to fig 2 for the location of the fire in relation to the site

pipeline that supplies air to open and close the valve for the repair the emergency                fire near lpg tank no 364
shutoff valve was locked open to prevent it from closing when the air pressure dropped
during the work
     the emergency protocol calls for workers to manually release the emergency
shutoff valve from the open position in an emergency however workers were unable
to get near the valve during the march 11 accident due to the leaking lpg
     as a preventive measure lpg tanks will be surrounded by flexible pipelines2 to
prevent damage should a tank collapse on the pipelines in addition cosmo oil has
eliminated the practice of locking emergency shutoff valves in an open position


3 cause of ignition resulting explosion and spread of fire
the investigation was unable to determine the exact cause of ignition after the fire
broke out fire crews continuously sprayed water on the surrounding lpg tanks to
keep them cool but the fire near lpg tank no 364 grew in intensity which raised the         1 an emergency shutoff valve is a safety device that is designed
                                                                                                  to safely and immediately shut off if there is an lpg leak
surface temperature of the adjacent lpg tanks this weakened the tanks to the extent          2 the use of flexible piping enables pipelines to better absorb
                                                                                                  impacts and bend under pressure
that they could not contain their internal pressure and the resulting explosions caused
the fire to spread
