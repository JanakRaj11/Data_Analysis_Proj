dear shareholders and readers


the end of 2014 marked not only the conclusion of another challenging and at the same
time successful financial year it was also the last financial year of my term of office which
will end on 31 may 2015 i would therefore like to use this letter to also express my per
sonal thanks for your trust in our company

we the members of the executive board have systematically expanded deutsche börses
business model our efforts have been successful  as was also seen in the past financial year
both our net revenue and our earnings increased substantially compared with 2013 given
these positive developments we propose to keep our dividend stable at 210 per share this
corresponds to a distribution ratio of 58 per cent which is again near the upper end of the
target range of 40 to 60 per cent for our capital management with which you are acquainted
this adequately ensures our ability to invest in important projects for the future which has
been one of my key priorities during my entire period in office



innovative products as growth drivers

innovative products and services continued to be particularly powerful growth drivers in 2014
innovation is our real core business for example we increased the number of derivatives
contracts from 58 to 81 million  39 per cent in the past year with new derivative products
these include our derivatives on italian and french government bonds buoni del tesoro
poliennali btps and obligations assimilables du trésor oats dividend and volatility deriva
tives as well as derivatives on the korea composite stock price index kospi the korean
benchmark index the performance of our commodities business was also excellent trading
in power and gas products climbed 44 per cent in the past year from 1487 to 2138 twh
deutsche börse ag is therefore well positioned to face its international competition



strategic growth projects crowned with success in 2014

we aim to decouple our business performance as far as possible from economic fluctuations
in our market environment to achieve this we increased our growth investments in 2014
for the current year we are planning another slight increase of approximately 20 million

our strategic activities focus on three areas firstly the expansion of our product and service
offering secondly the extension of our data and technology leadership thirdly the geographic
expansion and the acquisition of new customer groups especially in asia

we made further progress in all of these focus areas in 2014 for example we developed
a clearing offering for overthecounter derivatives  eurexotc clear  in preparation for the
implementation of the european market infrastructure regulation emir in the past year
this offering received the european licence needed to operate from the competent supervisory
authorities

moreover stricter capitalisation rules are being phased in for banks as a result of the basel iii
requirements to ensure that the cost of meeting these requirements remains affordable without
compromising on security clearstream has developed the global liquidity hub an offering that
allows costeffective global securities management

in addition we are making progress with our second strategic focus following the successful
rollout of the new t7 trading technology on our derivatives markets we have now completely
and fundamentally modernised our clearing technology by launching c7

our third growth focus our asia initiative received a boost in 2014 from a strategic partner
ship with bank of china and the establishment of a clearing house in singapore in january
2015 the clearing house we plan to establish there specifically to serve the east and south
east asian market received basic regulatory approval in principle from the monetary authority
of singapore



commitment to sustainability

we remain committed to a sustainabilitybased strategy throughout the group underlining this
commitment we are a member of the united nations global compact and support the imple
mentation of its principles in the areas of human rights labour standards the environment and
anticorruption our integrated reporting shows how we put this futureoriented approach into
practice

as you are aware i will hand over to my successor carsten kengeter towards the middle of
this year after roughly a decade at the helm of deutsche börse i would like to wish him all
the best and the continued success this company deserves

finally all that remains for me to do is to thank you first of all my coworkers whose skill
dedication and unwavering customer service have helped day after day to make deutsche börse
the successful company it is today but most particularly i want to thank you our shareholders
for staying with the company all these years i am certain that it will be worth your while in
future too

    deutsche börse ag shares

    the average annual return since the companys initial public
    offering in 2001 has been 116 per cent the transparent infor
    mation policy and close contact with investors are an added
    bonus in 2014 deutsche börse ag was again ranked number
    one for its investor relations activities in a survey conducted
    by a specialist magazine


    global equity markets record uneven development in 2014

    during 2014 the equity markets in europe and the us experienced diverging
    trends whereas the european markets fluctuated within a relatively narrow range
    over the year and ended the year largely unchanged the us markets continued
    their upward trend and reached new highs in some cases germanys bluechip
    dax  index ended the year at 9806 points a slight yearonyear increase of
    3 per cent declining economic growth was one of the key factors behind the trend
    on the european markets combined with the ongoing expansive monetary policy
    pursued by the central banks this resulted in continued market fluctuations the
    ensuing rise in equity market volatility over the year ultimately had a positive
    impact on deutsche börse groups business activities deutsche börse ags
    share price performed accordingly it fluctuated in the course of the year around
    the 55 mark and stabilised towards the end of the year closing at 5922 on
    31 december 31 december 2013 6020 this 2 per cent decline is slightly
    below the share price performance of other exchange organisations as measured
    by the dow jones global exchanges index which rose by 4 per cent in 2014
    the stoxx  europe 600 financials index which serves as the benchmark index
    for the executive boards sharebased remuneration and which reflects the per
    formance of european financial stocks rose by 3 per cent in 2014

must invest more time and money to meet the new demands particularly in the
form of increased capital adequacy requirements and enhanced collateral for riskier
transactions

deutsche börse group has used the past few years to develop new solutions that
on the one hand implement the goal of increased security sought by regulators
while on the other keeping the associated impact on its customers to a minimum
in this respect deutsche börse acts as a link between market participants and
regulators



new solutions

the new products and services resulting from this dual task have been and are
being developed in close cooperation with both customers and with the regulators
and central banks they build on the traditional strengths of the exchange model
migrating these into new markets that had not previously been either collateral
ised or standardised and whose operation had needed a high degree of manual
effort thus system performance and reliability are of key importance in addition
to transparency fairness and liquidity

                                     liquidity management to conserve their own capital and mitigate financial risk
                                     this is why clearstream has developed new solutions to optimise money market
                                     transactions between banks and the corporate customers thus creating addi
                                     tional collateralised alternatives to unsecured money market transactions

                                     in an environment where banks operate globally clearstreams advantage is that
                                     the customers collateral is immediately available anywhere a unique selling point
                                     is that customers assets used as collateral remain in their home markets as part
                                     of clearstreams international partnerships the model poses no systemic risk
                                     and is thus preferred by regulators a further benefit of this innovative system is
                                     that clearstream always adjusts the type quality and valuation of collateral to
                                     the actual requirements to precisely cover exposures collateralisation is therefore
                                     as efficient as possible without creating an unnecessary strain on liquidity

     responsible conduct

     the need to develop new solutions for the capital market also extends to sustain
     ability as the central point of contact between capital market participants
     deutsche börse group sees its responsibility as promoting market transparency
     in particular expanding the availability and quality of environmental social and
     governance esg information and increasing understanding of their relevance
     in doing so deutsche börse enables its market participants and the public to
     obtain an overview of the various transparency initiatives and to exchange infor
     mation and views with others

     against this backdrop deutsche börse joined the united nations sustainable
     stock exchanges initiative sse in early october of 2014 the aim of the initia
     tive founded by the un secretarygeneral in 2009 is to promote international
     dialogue on the sustainability of financial markets among exchange organisations
     deutsche börse group is committed to its professed goals of defining the role of
     capital market infrastructure providers within the sustainability movement and of
     dovetailing the sse with parallel initiatives

     in anticipation of the upcoming eu directive on sustainability reporting deutsche
     börse group has assessed the current state of reporting as well as any planned
     adjustments as part of a market consultation with listed companies and investment

expansion of the product and service offering

the challenge
otc products make the financial markets vulnerable to crisis situations and
knockon effects new regulatory requirements impose new costs on exchange
customers and banks eg through tying up ever more equity as collateral



the solution
clearing houses reduce market participants risks and increasingly in otc
trading as well the global liquidity hub enables banks to mobilise and o ptimally
combine crossborder collateral resulting in cost savings



opportunities
this increases the opportunities for greater systemic stability in the financial
markets with simultaneous room for further growth in the new market order
exchange organisations have the chance to leverage new business opportunities
through an expanded product portfolio and as intermediaries between regulators
and market participants

equity indices are key indicators that aggregate changes in individual stocks
to create an overall picture of the market they reflect changes in selected share
prices documenting trends in markets and sectors investors use indices as
sentiment indicators and as a basis for investment decisions for this reason
they must be compiled and calculated in line with objective rulebased and
transparent criteria deutsche börse has offered a wide range of sustainability
indices for many years which investors can use to select securities for a sus
tainable investment deutsche börses stoxx  global esg leaders indices

     responsible conduct

     deutsche börse is contributing to risk management stability and transparency
     on the markets at a global level through the worldwide establishment of clearing
     houses the provision of efficient it infrastructure and the distribution of market
     data against this international background deutsche börses commitment to
     sustainability is of key significance for new customer groups and investors focused
     on sustainability this is also reflected in the companys positive assessments in
     various ratings deutsche börses shares are included in eleven sustainability indices
     see the sustainability indices section in the combined management report
     this unique selling point attracts the interest of the most varied stakeholder groups
     and ensures a constantly expanding exchange of information and ideas and
     joint projects



     geographic expansion and acquisition of new customer groups

     the challenge
     future growth will be generated in asia and no longer primarily in our traditional
     markets asias exchanges and market participants are constantly increasing their
     share of the global financial market moreover the need for global investors to
     participate in this growth is on the rise



     the solution
     deutsche börses overriding goal is to offer products that are successful on the
     domestic market to an international customer base with the same level of service
     quality so deutsche börse is developing the markets in both directions with
     a simultaneous strengthening of the german and european financial centre with
     the asian markets as the focus deutsche börse is increasingly integrating inter
     national requirements for liquidity security and investments



     opportunities
     new opportunities are arising for european investors in an increasingly global
     environment where trading partners and customers cannot do without customary
     collateral or the necessary transparency and service standards the next steps
     are the connection of chinese investors to the european market and the expansion
     of the renminbi hub in frankfurt deutsche börses focus is on transparent finan
     cial markets and as a consequence it is and remains a solid partner for the real
     economy  worldwide

                                                                             35

     new format for stakeholder survey  focus on internal and external
     stakeholder interests

     against this background deutsche börse group has decided to adopt a new
     fourstep survey format which it implemented for the first time in financial year
     2014 the aim is to further expand and intensify dialogue with the various
     stakeholder groups

     1	the survey first assessed the importance of the above stakeholder groups
         to deutsche börse groups business operations in future the internal
         departments will be surveyed once a year the departments also evaluated
         which action areas are relevant for their respective stakeholder groups
     2	then three focus groups were formed each of which concentrates on one
         stakeholder group and their interests the first group consists of employees
         the second of various market participants and the third comprises representa
          tives from politics and supervisory  regulatory authorities
     3	c ore questions on action areas responsibilities and potential goals
          of deutsche börse group were discussed within these focus groups
          and prioritised from a stakeholder perspective
     4	the results of these stakeholder discussions were evaluated by an external
          market research institution and compared with deutsche börses own
          hypotheses in this way these results are directly incorporated into the
           materiality evaluation process for deutsche börse groups action areas

     the company decided on a targeted qualitative survey for the pilot project in the
     year under review as opposed to a broadbased quantitative survey step two
     saw invitations go out to focus group members these are experts whose profes
     sional activities mean that they are familiar with the capital market in general
     and exchanges in particular no preparation for the discussions was expected
     instead the objective was a spontaneous exchange of views and ideas covering
     various perspectives from the participants everyday professional lives one key
     insight gained from the discussion groups is that society should be made even
     more aware of the significance and diversity of an international exchange organi
     sations tasks overall the new survey format enables more specific differenti
     ated action areas to be developed the process means that stakeholders views
     are directly incorporated into the materiality evaluation process for deutsche
     börse groups action areas

action areas at deutsche börse group

the key criterion used by deutsche börse group in identifying relevant action
areas is materiality ie the significance of an issue in addition deutsche börse
group must be capable in principle of influencing the areas concerned

the table on the next page shows the most important initiatives in the operating
business as well as priority issues that were increasingly addressed by the focus
groups the higher the strategic priority of an action area is the more importance
deutsche börse group attaches to it in its operating business and the more
frequently it was addressed in discussions with various stakeholders for example
both internal and external stakeholders attach great importance to the fact that
the group supports regulatory projects and initiatives to stabilise the financial mar
ket this awareness goes handinhand with increased expectations as regards
promoting transparency and standardisation in the international capital markets
the desire to expand a solutionoriented exchange of knowledge and experience
involving key capital market participants is in line with deutsche börses role as
a neutral conversation platform

alongside the stakeholder survey in the focus groups deutsche börse group
used the following sources to determine its relevant action areas and their
weighting

 information from deutsche börse groups committees and working groups
   whose members include international capital market representatives an
   overview of the committees and working groups is available at
       wwwdeutscheboersecom  cr_e  customer governance
 analysis of customer satisfaction surveys customer visits and submissions


    to deutsche börse groups innovation portal
 internal analyses and assessments of trends and developments in the financial


    services sector eg changes in the regulatory framework
 insights gained from investor conferences roadshows and individual visits


    as well as topics raised at the annual general meeting
 discussions with international financial  business journalists at the global


    media outreach event
 feedback from staff meetings employee events review discussions and the


    2013 employee survey
 strategic focus areas identified at the meetings of the executive and supervisory


    boards and of the individual supervisory board committees

     corporate governance at deutsche börse group

     women in management positions
     deutsche börse ag set itself the goal of nominating at least one female member for the executive board
     by 2015 this was already achieved with the appointment of hauke stars in 2012 as a result women
     accounted for 20 per cent of the executive board as at 31 december 2014 the plan is to continue
     maintaining this proportion in the future at least until 2017 in addition deutsche börse group aims
     to increase the proportion of women in middle and upper management to 20 per cent and in lower
     management to 30 per cent by 2020 as at 31 december 2014 women accounted for 12 per cent of

on the executive board post to be filled it is not only the range and depth of specific experience that
matter but also whether this experience is up to date the flexible upper age limit is designed to
address this issue in particular it has been worded deliberately loosely to allow the supervisory board
to retain full flexibility in its appointment decisions

     dates to the supervisory board for it to propose to the agm has been preparing in depth for the

     seven of these were current members of the supervisory board in selecting these candidates the
     supervisory board had not just ensured that each companyspecific qualification requirement is met by
     at least two of the candidates it also took the length of the candidates membership on the supervi
     sory board into consideration in order to ensure balance between the different terms of office on the
     board due to deutsche börse groups strategic focus on asia the nomination committee also aimed
     to strengthen the supervisory boards asian expertise the committee was supported by an external

the remuneration of the executive board is determined by the entire supervisory board the personnel
committee is responsible for preparing the supervisory boards decision the supervisory board regu
larly reviews the appropriateness of the executive board remuneration in spring 2014 an appropriate
ness review was conducted taking into account the ratio of the executive board compensation for the
remuneration of the senior management and the workforce as a whole as well as in the temporal devel
opment the remuneration system applies equally to all members of the executive board and will also
apply to the new chief executive officer carsten kengeter when he takes office in april 2015 the
   system of the executive board remuneration chart outlines the executive board remuneration system

nonperformancerelated remuneration components
nonperformancerelated remuneration consists of a monthly fixed basic remuneration as well as
ancillary contractual benefits

fixed remuneration
the members of the executive board receive a fixed basic salary in twelve monthly instalments
the basic salary represents approximately 30 per cent of the total target remuneration for one year
it is reviewed by the supervisory board on a regular basis at least every two years

ancillary contractual benefits
in addition to the basic remuneration the members of the executive board receive certain ancillary
contractual benefits these include the provision of an appropriate company car for business and
personal use tax is payable by the executive board members on the pecuniary benefit arising from
private use in addition members of the executive board receive taxable contributions towards private
pensions the company also takes out insurances for them like an accident insurance and a do
insurance the do insurance policy includes a deductible of 10 per cent of the damages arising from
the insured event with the maximum deductible per year set by the supervisory board at 15 times
the fixed annual remuneration of the relevant executive board member

performancerelated remuneration components
the performancerelated remuneration represents approximately 70 per cent of the total target remunera
tion for the year and consists of variable cash components that account for around 40 per cent and
variable share components that account for around 30 per cent starting in the year under review the
reference periods for performance measurement are based on the past three years for the variable cash
component and on the next three years for the variable share component consequently in the year
under review the variable cash component was determined based on performance in 2012 to 2014
and the variable share component was based on the period from 2014 to 2016

variable cash component
the supervisory board establishes the 100 per cent target value of the variable cash component in
euros for every executive board member each year two parameters are used to measure the extent
to which targets have been met

achievement of the groups net income target twothirds of the variable cash component are based
on meeting a specified net income target for the group this measure takes into account the groups
net income for the current financial year and the two preceding years the degree to which the targets
have been achieved is defined for each of the three financial years and can range from a lower limit
of 0 per cent to an upper limit of a maximum of 200 per cent the average level of target achievement
is then used to calculate twothirds of the variable cash component for the current financial year
the supervisory board can take into account exceptional oneoff effects when determining the level
of target achievement

72   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




     achievement of individual targets onethird of the variable cash component is determined based on
     the degree to which each member of the executive board has achieved their individual targets the
     individual targets are set in each case for the current financial year and include specific requirements
     of particular importance for the individual management areas target achievement is determined after
     the year has come to an end by the supervisory board for each executive board member for the target
     achievement for the individual targets and the total variable cash component a range from a lower limit
     of 0 per cent and an upper limit of a maximum 200 per cent is defined

     variable share component
     the supervisory board establishes the 100 per cent target value for the variable share component for
     each executive board member in euros based on this target value a number of phantom deutsche
     börse shares is calculated for each member of the executive board at the beginning of the financial
     year this is done by dividing the euro amount of the target share component by the average share
     price xetra  closing price in the two calendar months before the target value is determined an entitle
     ment to the variable stock bonus only arises at the end of the threeyear performance period vesting
     period and is settled fully in cash the stock bonus is variable in two ways the first variable is the
     number of phantom deutsche börse shares which depends on the relative performance of deutsche
     börses total shareholder return tsr compared to the tsr of the stoxx  europe 600 financials index
     the second variable is the share price at the end of the period

     the number of shares calculated at the end of the vesting period is multiplied by the share price
     applicable on that date average price  xetra closing price of deutsche börses shares in the preceding
     two full calendar months

            goals and strategies

            goals and strategy of deutsche börse group

            restricted pricing

            its business success is founded on the business model with its broadly diversified product and service
            range deutsche börse covers the entire financial market transactions value chain and is in a good posi
            tion to withstand even difficult economic times that gives it a critical advantage over its competitors
            which increasingly imitate deutsche börses business model and are extending their offerings in areas
            such as clearing and data however they have so far failed to achieve the level of diversification that
            deutsche börse group has created over the years see the deutsche börse group offers the full port
            folio chart the business model aims to offer customers reliable services in an efficient and cost effect
            tice manner and is based on the following key principles

             integrating different financial market services such as trading clearing settlement securities custody
              liquidity and collateral management as well as index and market data services
             providing these services for different asset classes such as equities bonds funds commodities fixed

            the fact that the group has generated strong cash flows from its operating activities for many years and
            is one of the most costeffective providers of trading clearing and settlement services is proof of the effi
            ciency of its business model

                                                         fundamental information about the group




deutsche börse group is continuing to pursue the strategy that has enabled it to achieve its leading
position in doing so it focuses primarily on organic growth it aims to achieve this by introducing new
products in existing and new asset classes expanding its business to additional customer groups and
moving into markets in new regions if external growth opportunities appear to be economically attractive
deutsche börse group also takes these into consideration the aim is growth that will add lasting value
 for customers and business partners staff shareholders and the society

deutsche börse group will therefore continue to focus its energies on three strategic directions in the
coming years

 expansion of its product and service range to currently unregulated and uncollateralised markets
  eg overthecounter derivatives trading in response to changes in customer needs as well as the
  regulatory framework
 extension of its technology leadership and expertise in the market data area one measure taken to

  achieve this was among others to bundle the relevant resources within the company in a new seg
  ment it  market data  services as at 1 january 2013
 entry into new geographic growth areas especially in asia and acquisition of new customer groups

  see the report on opportunities

whether deutsche börse group achieves its organic growth targets will depend on the following factors
among others

 development of financial markets in line with general economic conditions eg greater stock market
  volatility typically leads to more trading in the cash and derivatives markets
 regulatory requirements for all market participants if regulatory initiatives eg emir capital re

  quirements directives strengthen the role of exchanges this will also benefit deutsche börse group
 structural changes in the financial markets trading activity increases eg if investment funds make


  greater use of derivatives to implement their trading strategy
 the innovative power of the group will it succeed in continually introducing new products and ser


  vices for which there is demand in the market

deutsche börse group is committed to transparent reliable and liquid financial markets but cannot af
fect the volume drivers of these markets however the group is able to exert an influence on the other
factors to some extent or in full for instance it can lobby for a favourable legal framework for the finan
cial markets or it can develop products and services that support customers in their business in this
way it can also reduce its dependence on factors outside its control

management approach to groupwide sustainability commitment
deutsche börse groups goals and strategies include taking a holistic view of its corporate responsibility
in line with this its management approach comprises three actionbased guiding principles with the
goal of sustainably strengthening and preserving deutsche börse groups benefits to the economy and
to society

   building trust deutsche börse group aims to organise the capital markets in a way that ensures their
    integrity transparency and security the availability of highquality information is a key aspect in this
    process and the company is constantly working to enhance this aspect providing sustainability infor
    mation is as significant in this context as engaging in a constructive dialogue on the future viability of
    the international capital markets not only with customers but with the general public as well

92   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




             leading by example as a listed service provider deutsche börse group aims to perform its own busi
              ness activities responsibly and with a view to the future in addition the group pursues a sustainable
              human resources policy and has committed itself to the environment and thus to conserving resources
              in order to establish itself as a role model in the market deutsche börse group continually develops its
              sustainability commitment and reporting
             sharpen the publics perception the group is part of civil society and as such has responsibilities to


              meet it is committed to fulfilling this role in its international locations as well thereby it systematical
              ly bases its actions on local requirements and as a good corporate citizen takes part in longterm co
              operative initiatives aimed at increasing the structural strength of the nonprofit sector



            internal management

            control systems
            deutsche börse groups internal management system is based on key performance indicators taken from
            the income statement net revenue operating costs ebit consolidated net income for the year as well
            as balance sheet key performance indicators cash flows from operating activities liquidity equity less
            intangible assets furthermore deutsche börse groups internal management system additionally in
            cludes key performance indicators that are derived from the income statement and the balance sheet
            interest coverage ratio interestbearing gross debt  ebitda return on shareholders equity

            net revenue is composed of sales revenue plus net interest income from banking business and other op
            erating income less volumerelated costs sales revenue from external customers is generally dependent
            on the growth factors described above development of the financial markets regulatory and structural
            changes and the groups ability to innovate net interest income from banking business is dependent
            on the development of clearstreams international settlement business on the one hand and the devel
            opment of shortterm interest rates particularly in the euro zone and the usa on the other other oper
            ating income results from exchange rate differences among other things volumerelated costs normally
            correlate with the level of sales revenue in the relevant areas of the company such as fees and commis
            sions from banking business or costs for purchasing price information in addition various licence fees
            eg for index licences contribute to volumerelated costs

            operating costs include staff costs depreciation amortisation and impairment losses as well as other
            operating expenses staff costs consist of wages and salaries as well as social security contributions and
            the cost of retirement benefits they are subject to inflation adjustments and depend partially on the de
            velopment of deutsche börse ags share price as they also include changes in the provisions and pay
            ments for the stock bonus plan for members of the executive board and senior executives that was in
            troduced in 2007 the depreciation amortisation and impairment charges include depreciation and
            amortisation of and impairment losses on intangible assets and property plant and equipment other
            operating expenses mainly consist of the costs of developing and operating the groups technological
            infrastructure office infrastructure costs and marketing costs

around 75 per cent of deutsche börse groups costs are fixed costs excluding special factors the
group can therefore handle higher volumes of business without a significant increase in costs converse
ly a decline in business volumes has a direct impact on the groups profitability approximately 25 per
cent of the groups costs are volumerelated costs

deutsche börse group manages its ebit via net revenue and operating costs at group level deutsche
börse groups net income for the year  that is net profit for the year less noncontrolling interests  also
serves as a performance indicator for internal management

the balance sheet key performance indicators include cash flows from operating activities a predefined
liquidity target and equity less intangible assets liquidity planning aims at providing liquidity correspond
ing to the operating costs for one quarter this liquidity target currently ranges between 150 million and
250 million the groups management of its equity less intangible assets does not aim to reach a par
ticular target but rather to maintain a positive value in general

the interest coverage ratio shows the ratio of ebitda to interest expenses from financing activities un
der its capital management programme the group plans to achieve an interest coverage ratio of at least
16 for deutsche börse group in addition the aim is to achieve a maximum ratio of interestbearing
gross debt to ebitda of 15 at group level in particular the latter performance indicator plays a materi
al role at present in protecting the groups current aa rating the clearstream subgroup aims to main
tain an interest coverage ratio of 25 and to comply with other capital adequacy measures to protect its
current aa rating because clearstream had no financial liabilities from nonbanking business in the
year under review as in the previous year it was not necessary to calculate the interest coverage ratio
for the subgroup

strategic and financial criteria are used and projectspecific risks are taken into account when prioritis
ing and managing projects within the group the strategic attractiveness of projects in this context is
measured primarily on the basis of their expected contribution to reaching the strategic objectives of
deutsche börse group and its business areas the financial assessment looks in particular at key per
formance indicators such as net present value npv the payback period and aftertax returns which
are calculated on the basis of the project or business plans the risks are considered equally at all
levels of project work ie when prioritising and steering the project as well as during ongoing project
management

internal control system
deutsche börse has established a groupwide internal control system ics all business units are as
first lines of defence responsible that groupwide requirements of the ics are met in their respective are
as of responsibility in particular the ics is valid for the financial accounting and controlling fac de
partment ensuring that its accounting processes comply with orderly bookkeeping and accounting prac
tices it guarantees that the presentation of the net assets financial position and results of operations
in the singleentity and consolidated financial statements of deutsche börse ag and its subsidiaries is
correct and complete

94   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




            the fac department is primarily responsible for preparing the accounts at deutsche börse ag and its
            consolidated german subsidiaries in foreign subsidiaries this task is performed by the corresponding
            units the head of the fac department is responsible for the process including effective safeguards
            and controls in order to ensure that risks in the accounting process are identified early on so that reme
            dial action can be taken in good time some ics controls are integrated into the process while others
            are performed independently

            fac uses the following tools to ensure a consistent and continuous accounting process

             a database stores work instructions and descriptions for the material accounting processes including
              the preparation of consolidated financial statements
             ifrs and german gaap hgb accounting manuals and account allocation guidelines ensure a con

              sistent standard of financial reporting throughout the group

            these tools are regularly tested and updated all fac department employees have access to the data
            base as well as the accounting manuals and account allocation guidelines and can thus get information
            on the management judgement and accounting options exercised by deutsche börse group highrisk
            processes are subject to special controls

            moreover deutsche börse group continuously monitors and analyses changes in the accounting envi
            ronment and adjusts its process accordingly this applies in particular to the national and international
            accounting standards the groups accounting function takes also into consideration transactions such
            as the acquisition or sale of companies or shares the fac department may be contacted by all subsid
            iaries if they need help with accounting for these and other complex matters for selected issues such
            as the measurement of pension obligations fac consults external experts

            another important feature of the ics is the principle of functional separation tasks and responsibilities
            are clearly defined and allocated within the organisation incompatible tasks such as modifying master
            data on the one hand and issuing payment instructions on the other are strictly segregated at a func
            tional level an independent control unit grants accounting system access rights to each employee and
            monitors them continuously using an incompatibility matrix transactions are initially recorded in the
            general ledger or corresponding subledgers based on the chart of accounts and the account allocation
            guidelines closing entries are made and the consolidated financial statements are prepared in all cases
            in line with the principle of dual control

            all major subsidiaries of deutsche börse group maintain and consolidate their general ledgers in the
            same system the accounting data of the other companies is uploaded for inclusion in the consolidated
            financial statements liabilities expenses and income for individual transactions are recorded in sepa
            rate accounts under the name of the counterparty concerned any consolidation differences are reviewed
            centrally and sent on to the accounting departments of the companies for clarification

            the processes systems and controls described above aim to provide reasonable assurance that the ac
            counting system complies with the applicable principles and laws serving as further lines of defence
            compliance and internal auditing carry out riskbased processindependent checks to test whether the
            ics is appropriate and effective the executive board and the audit committee established by the super
            visory board receive regular reports on the effectiveness of the ics for the financial reporting process

report on economic position

macroeconomic and sectorspecific environment

the macroeconomic environment had and continues to have a significant impact on the overall eco
nomic environment and on trading activity on the markets the european capital market environment
remained tense for financial services providers and hence for deutsche börse group for a number of
reasons

 the major central banks continuing low interest rate policy and the resulting provision of large
  amounts of liquidity
 low inflation and in some cases deflationary tendencies

 the continued fragile economic situation in the euro zone with high levels of government debt in


  certain european states and a weakening euro against the us dollar
 the unstable political conditions in some eastern european regions and repeated crises in flashpoints


  in the arab world
 regulatory projects and the resulting stricter requirements for capital market participants see the

  following regulatory environment section

despite these factors economic growth improved in many markets in 2014 compared with the previous
year following a 13 per cent increase in real gdp in the oecd countries in 2013 current estimates
reveal a rise of 22 per cent in 2014 estimates by the international monetary fund imf suggest that
the global economy grew by 33 per cent in 2014 2013 increase in real terms of 33 per cent

according to initial estimates growth in german gdp accelerated again in 2014 compared with previ
ous years due to stable global economic growth and an improvement in world trade especially in the
first half of 2014 the imfs january 2015 estimates put growth in german economic output at 15 per
cent in 2014 2013 increase in real terms of 02 per cent

             estimates only three countries  italy cyprus and finland  remained in recession nevertheless the
             european central bank still considers the eus economic situation to be critical and left its key interest
             rate at a historically low level it cut its deposit rate for banks in two steps in 2014 from 0 per cent
             to 020 per cent

             the oecd is forecasting an increase in us economic output of 26 per cent in real terms in 2014  not
             least because of the supportive monetary policy and stronger domestic demand at the same time the
             labour market situation eased this should have a continued positive effect on economic output going
             forward the federal reserve kept the federal funds rate within the target range of zero to 025 per cent
             that it set in december 2008

             the persistently high levels of government debt in individual european states resulting in slower growth
             compared with other economies such as the united states or the uk are continuing to fuel uncertainty
             on the financial markets this was reflected in volatility levels on the cash and derivatives markets falling
             to what were in some cases historic lows in the first nine months in the fourth quarter of 2014 volati
             lity improved significantly resulting in a positive effect on equitybased products in particular in total
             these factors led to a slight decline in trading activity on the groups derivatives markets in the year
             under review while trading activity on the cash markets increased slightly

             according to information from the bank for international settlements bis global issuance of interna
             tional bonds rose significantly in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the prioryear period this
             first positive yearonyear change since 2006 is also mirrored by the comparative increase in the average
             volumes of international bonds held in custody which rose by around 6 per cent compared with 2013
             the aggregate principal amount of the securities held in custody by clearstream reached a new record of
             125 trillion at the end of 2014



             regulatory environment

             one consequence of the global financial market crisis is that work continues to be underway at an inter
             national level on regulatory initiatives with the aim of creating a more transparent more stable and fair
             financial system the main focus is on reorganising the supervisory structure on recovery and resolution
             plans for banks and financial market infrastructures and on new rules for the financial market infra
             structure in the trading and posttrading areas see also the overview of regulatory intiatives and their
             impact on deutsche börse groups business areas table

             regulation of supervisory structures
             the supervisory structures in europe continued to change in 2014 three core elements have been
             adopted or have already entered into force

             1 single supervisory mechanism ssm direct supervision of the european central bank ecb of 120
                significant credit instutions and banking groups indirect supervision of all other credit institutions in
                the euro zone

                for the single resolution fund srf new single resolution board srb of the european union from
                2015 onwards

deutsche börse group companies are affected by these changes in many different ways however at
present no deutsche börse group company falls under the ecbs direct supervision but given the
systemic importance of the institutions belonging to deutsche börse group it is to be expected that
they will feature prominently in the ecbs indirect supervisory activities

central securities depository regulation csdr
with the csdr a uniform european regulatory framework was created for central securities depositories
for the first time in september 2014 the european commission and esma have to specify the require
ments in technical standards these will apply from november 2017 onwards the csdr will harmonise
the securities settlement systems and supervisory rules for central securities depositories throughout
europe this will strengthen clearstreams business model because the provision of integrated banking
services will still be permitted

benchmark regulation
in 2013 iosco responded to the manipulation of certain indices such as libor and euribor by
developing principles for financial benchmarks in addition the european commission submitted a pro
posal in 2013 for a regulation on indices used as benchmarks this regulation is designed to incorporate
the iosco principles into european law the proposal intends to focus on critical benchmarks make the
administration of indices more transparent and defuse potential conflicts of interest

as a neutral index provider deutsche börse group supports the iosco principles it has implemented
them for its subsidiary stoxx ltd groupwide implementation is planned for 2015 it is not possible
at present to gauge the impact of the eu regulation on the groups business activities

other regulatory initiatives with an impact on financial market infrastructures
in june 2014 a revised legislative package on fighting market abuse and insider trading entered into
force market abuse directive and regulation mad and mar the new rules also apply to new market
places and otc transactions and their scope has been extended to include new trading strategies as well
as all financial instruments they will be specified in standards by the european commission and esma

             current developments in banking supervision law
             in 2014 and at the beginning of 2015 the basel committee on banking supervision and the financial
             stability board made proposals to enhance the international framework for banking supervision and pub
             lished amendments to basel iii which will have a farreaching impact key elements of the revision are

              introduction for the first time of international rules to impose a quantitative limit on concentration risk
               large exposure rules
              comprehensive amendments to the rules for standardised approaches to measuring capital require

              further strengthening of the equity base of global systemically important banks gsibs with the aim


               to avoid resolution if at all possible or  if that does not succeed  to ensure that resolution is possible
               in an orderly manner

             from deutsche börse groups perspective the provisions will not have any material effect on the equity
             base of its regulated companies in the short term since the companies belonging to deutsche börse
             group already have comprehensive buffers the additional capital requirements are expected to be rela
             tively moderate independent of the regulatory requirements the group will continuously analyse the
             capitalisation of its regulated entities and will adjust it as necessary to improve risk coverage the regu
             lated companies of deutsche börse group have been designated as other systemically important banks
             by the german and luxembourg supervisory authorities here too the group does not expect any in
             crease in capital to be required in the short term as a result of this designation

             transparency of securities financing transactions
             in january 2014 the european commission issued a proposal for a regulation on the transparency of
             securities financing transactions securities financing transaction regulation sftr which comple
             ments the proposed regulation on the introduction of a segregated banking system ringfencing proprie

             report securities lending and repo transactions to socalled central trade repositories in addition the
             proposal incorporates standardised rules for repledging collateral and for the reporting requirements of
             investment funds providers with securities lending activities it is not possible at present to gauge the

             business development

             in the year under review and especially in the first nine months the capital market environment re
             mained challenging for financial services providers and hence for deutsche börse group political con
             flicts and economic instability interest rates at record lows low volatility in many asset classes and in
             creasing regulation all impacted market activity the business environment for the group only improved
             towards the end of the year driven by significantly higher volatility on the equity markets

                                                         report on economic position




 the economic situation in the euro zone remained tense as did the geopolitical situation in the flash
  points in the ukraine and the middle east political and economic instability are giving rise to uncer
  tainty this may lead to higher trading volumes in the short term but has an inhibiting effect on the
  market participants the longer it continues in addition a lack of investor confidence in the stable
  longterm growth of the euro zone will prompt them to avoid europe as an investment destination
 from a macroeconomic perspective the dominant factor in the year under review was again the ex


  pansionary monetary policy pursued by the main central banks as from 11 june 2014 the european
  central bank levied a negative deposit rate of 010 per cent for the first time ie it demanded a fee
  on the balances that commercial banks hold with the ecb this negative interest rate was reduced fur
  ther to 020 per cent on 10 september as a consequence commercial banks in the euro zone have
  started to charge negative interest rates to their customers the federal reserve bank fed did not re
  verse its low interest rate policy either low interest rates can boost the cash market business because
  they encourage investors to invest more in shares and other securities in the derivatives market how
  ever they primarily hamper the business with longterm interest rate derivatives and reduce net interest
  income from banking business generated in the clearstream segment
 apart from the record low interest rate policies pursued by the central banks low cash market volatility


  influenced trading activity for much of the year under review as a general principle the lower the vola
  tility the lower the trading volume however cash market volatility increased towards the end of the
  third quarter and ended the year up on the previous year
 market participants are having to deal with regulatory projects which are subject to continual changes

  and delays this too has led to caution among some market participants increased capital require
  ments and the decline in proprietary trading have also contributed to limiting trading participants activ
  ity on the derivatives market to sometimes little more than the minimum required for hedging purposes
  on the other hand regulation gives deutsche börse group an opportunity to showcase its liquidity and
  collateral management services which allow banks to deploy their capital as efficiently as possible

deutsche börse groups diversified business model which allows it to draw its income from a broad ba
sis of different products and services proved itself yet again in this challenging market environment the
groups net revenue increased in all business segments rising by 7 per cent in total to 20430 million
in the year under review 2013 19123 million the groups performance was boosted by a strong
fourth quarter of 2014 after a mixed performance in the first nine months higher cash market volatility
led to a significantly improved result in the last quarter especially in the eurex and xetra trading segments

deutsche börse ag again increased investments in strategic projects designed to implement its three
strategic focus areas see the section entitled goals and strategy of deutsche börse group the fact
that operating costs were nevertheless down yearonyear is due to nonrecurring items in financial year
2013 primarily in relation to efficiency programmes and the settlement with the us office of foreign
assets control ofac adjusted for these factors operating costs were up by 10 per cent yearonyear
to 10688 million 2013 9676 million

changes to the basis of consolidation
european energy exchange ag eex and its subsidiaries have been fully consolidated since 1 janu
ary 2014 after deutsche börse group acquired control over eex since then the revenue and costs
generated by eex have been allocated to the eurex and market data  services segments eexs earn
ings are therefore no longer included in the result from equity investments for eurex this means an
increase in net revenue from transaction fees and other net revenue on the one hand and higher operating

             costs on the other for market data  services net revenue from the connectivity business has risen
             conversely revenue from technology services provided to eex which was previously accounted for using
             the equity method has ceased

             likewise impendium systems ltd a provider of cloudbased software solutions located in london
             has been consolidated since 1 january 2014 net revenue and costs are reported in the market data 
             services segment

             clearstream global securities services limited cgss formerly citco global securities services ltd
             a hedge fund custody infrastructure operator was acquired by clearstream and has been consolidated
             since 3 october 2014 while revenue and costs have been allocated to the clearstream segment since
             that date the assets managed by cgss will only be included in clearstreams figures in the course of
             the first quarter of 2015



             results of operations

             the first nine months of the year under review were dominated by extremely low stock market volatility
             volatility increased only from september onwards providing the basis for a very successful last quarter
             however other cyclical factors such as the continuing low interest rate policies pursued by the central
             banks continued to weigh on parts of the business eg the net interest income from banking business
             generated by clearstream or the interest rate derivatives traded on eurex by contrast the interest rates
             had a stimulating effect on the cash market because investors bought more shares or bonds

             deutsche börse groups net revenue rose by 7 per cent in financial year 2014 to 20430 million

the ise by 5 per cent net revenue in the eurex segment rose by 8 per cent to 8026 million
2013 7407 million this is primarily due to the consolidation and growth of eex although
growth in equity index derivatives with higher margins also contributed to this revenue increase

the cash market recorded a doubledigit increase in trading volumes on all trading platforms xetra the

the posttrade services provided by the clearstream segment expanded further in the year under re
view clearstream recorded both increased business volumes and higher net revenue in its three main
business areas  custody settlement and global securities financing this more than offset the decline
in net interest income from banking business which fell by 9 per cent in the year under review due to
persistently low interest rates even though customer cash deposits at clearstream rose further in total

deutsche börse groups result from equity investments amounted to 783 million 2013 93 million
the significant increase is attributable in particular to the following nonrecurring income items firstly
630 million in connection with the merger of direct edge holdings llc direct edge and bats glo
bal markets inc bats at the end of january 2014 the revaluation of the shares in direct edge in
which deutsche börse group held around 32 per cent via its subsidiary ise resulted in a book profit of
464 million in addition the group received a special dividend of 165 million after the transaction
had been completed the group generated another oneoff gain of 106 million because of the retro
spective adjustment of the fair value of the consideration transferred as a result of the acquisition of eex
as at 1 january 2014 adjusted for these special factors the result from equity investments amounted to
86 million as a result of the consolidation of eex and scoach these companies no longer contribute
to the result from equity investments

deutsche börse groups earnings before interest and tax ebit increased by 36 per cent in the year un
der review to 10065 million 2013 7388 million adjusted for the abovementioned exceptional
cost items and nonrecurring items in the result from equity investments the groups ebit amounted to
9828 million a 3 per cent increase yearonyear 2013 9540 million

the groups financial result for the year under review was 431 million 2013 707 million the
improvement mainly resulted from the refinancing of the groups longterm financial liabilities which
was completed in the second quarter of 2013 the successful placement of corporate bonds in march
2013 and in october 2012 allowed deutsche börse to refinance its outstanding noncurrent liabilities
maturing in 2013 on extremely favourable terms 2014 was the first year in which the significant reduc
tion in expenses for financial liabilities had a positive effect for the full year

the effective group tax rate was 181 per cent in 2014 adjusted for nonrecurring items it was
260 per cent as in the previous year the adjustments include firstly the aforementioned special items
in operating costs secondly the group tax rate has been adjusted for a oneoff gain of 849 million
because it was possible for the first time to recognise deferred tax assets in respect of interest expenses
incurred since 2007 as a result of the financing structure established in connection with the acquisition
of ise this gain is partially offset by an expense of 60 million which is mainly attributable to the re
duction in deferred tax assets in respect of a tax loss carryforward

driven by the sharp rise in ebit and the tax effect deutsche börse group also recorded a significant
yearonyear increase in consolidated net income for the period to 7623 million 2013 4784 million

             excluding the special factors described above consolidated net income was up 5 per cent yearonyear

             noncontrolling shareholders shared in profit incurred in the amount of approximately 64 million

             comparison of results of operations with the forecast for 2014
             for 2014 deutsche börse group had forecast net revenue of 19 billion to 21 billion a moderate
             increase in operating costs to 105 billion excluding nonrecurring items and consolidation effects from
             the acquisition of impendium eex cleartrade exchange and cgss ebit of between 085 billion and
             105 billion and net income of 600 million to 750 million this forecast was based on different
             scenarios for the capital market environment and developments on the groups cash and derivatives
             markets

             the conditions described earlier in the section on business development and the continuing challeng
             es posed by the capital market environment were largely in line with the assumptions on which the fore
             cast was based thanks to the improved market environment in the fourth quarter deutsche börse
             group generated net revenue in the top third of the forecast range

             adjusted for special items the groups operating costs rose by 10 per cent in financial year 2014 to
             10688 million driven mainly by consolidation effects as well as by increased investments in growth
             and infrastructure projects this is in line with the groups forecast which had predicted a moderate
             increase in operating costs

             ebit is at the upper end of the forecast range while net profit for the year is in the middle adjusted
             for special factors in both cases moreover since the successful refinancing of the groups longterm
             financial liabilities led to a significant reduction in interest expense the group achieved an adjusted
             interest coverage ratio of 260 thus significantly above the minimum target of 16

             at group level deutsche börse aims to achieve a ratio of interestbearing gross debt to ebitda of no
             more than 15 for 2014 the group had expected the ratio to slightly undershoot this figure despite
             the challenging business environment especially in the first nine months of 2014 the group met this
             target achieving a ratio of 15 after rounding up

eurex segment
the performance of the eurex derivatives segment largely depends on the trading activities of institu
tional investors and proprietary trading by professional market participants the segments revenue is
therefore generated primarily from the combined transaction fees that eurex charges for trading and
clearing derivatives contracts

revenue is primarily driven by the derivatives traded on eurex exchange equity index derivatives ac
counted for 43 per cent of net revenue interest rate derivatives 21 per cent and equity derivatives 4 per
cent us options traded on the international securities exchange ise accounted for 10 per cent of net
revenue the commodities and commodities derivatives traded on the european energy exchange eex
and eurex exchange contributed 8 per cent and trades on eurex repo 5 per cent to the segments net
revenue the other item 9 per cent includes among other things the participation fees paid by ise
market participants

the macroeconomic environment in 2014 posed major challenges for exchange organisations and es
pecially for their trading and clearing businesses key interest rates at record lows the fragile economic
situation in the euro zone low inflation and in some cases deflationary tendencies in addition there
were farreaching regulatory reform projects in the financial services industry that may result in structural
costs for market participants and require adjustments to their business models in some cases increased
capital requirements and a decline in proprietary trading also put a damper on trading activity in the
first nine months of 2014 stock market volatility was again below the prioryear level volatility only
started to increase again from the end of the third quarter driven by among other things the rouble cur
rency crisis and hints by the federal reserve that it could end its loose monetary policy in 2015 this
resulted in higher demand for hedging among market participants for which deutsche börse groups
derivatives exchanges provide suitable instruments consequently business development was rather
sluggish in the first eight months especially for equity index derivatives but picked up significantly from
september onwards

in total 20979 million contracts were traded on deutsche börse groups derivatives exchanges
eurex and ise in 2014 a yearonyear decline of 4 per cent 2013 21919 million this is equiva
lent to a daily average of around 83 million contracts 2013 87 million eurex generated a trading
volume of 14905 million futures and options contracts down 4 per cent on the previous year 2013
15531 million the volume of us options traded on ise declined by 5 per cent to 6074 million
contracts 2013 6388 million by contrast commodities trading flourished recording two and three
digit growth rates for power and gas products while average outstanding volumes in the repo business
decreased slightly to 2146 billion 2013 2226 billion

xetra segment
the xetra segment generates most of its net revenue from trading and clearing cash market securities
the primary sales driver accounting for 62 per cent was net revenue from trading the central counter
party ccp for equities operated by eurex clearing ag contributed 18 per cent to the segments net rev
enue the net revenue of the ccp is determined to a significant extent by trading activities on xetra the
other item 20 per cent of net revenue in total comprises listing fees and the net revenue generated by
eurex bonds listing fees predominantly come from existing company listings and admissions to trading

net revenue in the xetra segment rose by 7 per cent to 1619 million 2013 1517 million operat
ing costs in the xetra segment decreased by 22 per cent special factors  primarily for efficiency pro
grammes which had had a negative impact of 81 million in financial year 2013  only amounted
to 08 million in the year under review as a result ebit increased significantly to 880 million
2013 605 million

the record low interest rates and the relatively good results of operations reported by german companies
had a positive effect on share trading in contrast the fragile economic situation in the euro zone and
the low stock market volatility experienced during much of the year had a negative impact after a strong
first quarter trading activity slowed in the course of the year at the beginning of the fourth quarter vola
tility increased substantially compared with the previous year also driving up trading volumes in the
cash market in the 2014 financial year securities with a total volume of 128 trillion were traded on

settlement flows while the custodian bank partners will handle asset servicing at a domestic market
level bringing with them their local market expertise clearstream will capitalise on the opportunities
presented by t2s by consolidating its icsd and csd holdings in this way clearstream will be able to
offer its clients the security of central bank money settlement for t2s markets via its german csd the

for the year 2933 million was more than offset by the rise in working capital 2841 million other
noncash income 604 million and deferred tax income 509 million

the increase in working capital is due in particular to a payment of us1519 million made in the first
quarter of 2014 in connection with the settlement the group entered into with ofac office of foreign
assets control deutsche börse group had already recognised provisions for this matter in 2013 in ad
dition deutsche börse group additionally made tax payments amounting to 2370 million in financial
year 2014 2013 933 million the yearonyear increase is primarily due to higher contributions to
earnings by the companies in financial year 2014 and tax refunds for prior years 576 million which
affect cash flow in 2013 in addition payments of about 41 million relating to prior years were made

operating leases
deutsche börse group uses operating leases primarily for the office building in eschborn which
the group moved into in the second half of 2010 and for the buildings used by clearstream inter
national sa in luxembourg see note 38 to the consolidated financial statements for details

liquidity management
deutsche börse meets its operating liquidity requirements primarily by means of internal financing
ie by retaining generated funds the aim is to provide liquidity corresponding to the operating costs
for one quarter this liquidity target currently ranges between 150 million and 250 million there is
an intragroup cash pool for pooling surplus cash as far as regulatory and legal provisions allow all of
the groups cash investments are shortterm in order to ensure rapid availability and are largely collate
ralised using liquid bonds from primerated issuers moreover deutsche börse ag has access to external
sources of financing such as bilateral and syndicated credit lines and a commercial paper programme
see note 36 to the consolidated financial statements for details on financial risk management in
the past years deutsche börse ag has leveraged its access to the capital markets in order to meet its
structural financing needs by issuing corporate bonds

capital management
as a rule the group aims to achieve a dividend distribution ratio of 40 to 60 per cent of adjusted con
solidated net income moreover it implements share buybacks in order to distribute to its shareholders
funds not required for the groups operating business and its further development this policy is deter
mined at all times by the companys capital requirements which depend on the legal and supervisory
framework as well as requirements relating to its credit rating economic capital and liquidity

customers expect their financial services provider to have conservative interest coverage and debtequity
ratios and to maintain strong credit ratings deutsche börse group therefore pursues its objective of
achieving an interest coverage ratio ratio of ebitda to interest expenses from financing activities of at
least 16 at group level and aims to achieve a ratio of interestbearing gross debt to ebitda of no more
than 15 at group level in order to meet the rating agencies current requirements for an aa rating for
deutsche börse ag adjusted for merger and acquisition costs and for costs of efficiency programmes
deutsche börse group achieved an interest coverage ratio of 260 in the year under review 2013
201 this figure is based on a relevant interest expense of 425 million and an adjusted ebitda
of 11047 million the significant yearonyear increase in the interest coverage ratio is attributable to
the positive trend in the results of operations as well as the refinancing programme that started in 2012
and was successfully completed in the first quarter of 2013 the outstanding noncurrent liabilities that
matured in 2013 were refinanced on extremely favourable terms leading to a significant reduction in
interest expenses 2014 was the first full year to benefit from this positive effect leading to another
decline in finance costs compared with 2013 in the year under review the group achieved a ratio of
interestbearing gross debt to ebitda of 147 this figure is based on gross debt of 16283 million
and an adjusted ebitda of 11047 million

clearstream banking sas strong aa credit rating must likewise be maintained so as to ensure the
continued success of the clearstream segment which is active in securities custody and settlement
deutsche börse ag also needs to maintain a strong credit profile for the benefit of activities at its eurex
clearing ag subsidiary

128   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




             the interest coverage ratio is calculated using the interest expenses incurred to finance deutsche börse
             group among other factors excluding interest costs relating to group companies that also operate as
             financial institutions these include clearstream banking sa clearstream banking ag and eurex
             clearing ag interest expenses that are not related to group financing are not included in the interest
             coverage ratio

             deutsche börse ag has also publicly declared its intention to comply with certain additional key perfor
             mance indicators that the company believes correspond to an aa rating for example tangible equity
             equity less intangible assets should not fall below 700 million at clearstream international sa or
             400 million at clearstream banking sa in the year under review clearstream international sa has
             met this key performance indicator with an amount of 10343 million and clearstream banking sa
             with an amount of 10005 million for the clearstream subgroup the objective is to maintain an in
             terest coverage ratio of at least 25 insofar as financial liabilities resulting from nonbanking business
             exist in the year under review as in the previous year clearstream had no financial liabilities resulting
             from nonbanking business consequently no interest coverage ratio has been calculated

             dividends and share buybacks
             between 2005 and the end of 2014 deutsche börse group returned a total of around 58 billion to
             its shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends in financial year 2014 it distributed a
             dividend of 3866 million

             of the some 461 million shares repurchased between 2005 and 2012 the company cancelled a total
             of around 306 million shares up to the end of 2014 approximately 53 million shares were issued
             to six group ag in order to settle 50 per cent of the purchase price for the acquisition of the shares of
             eurex zürich ag 14 million shares were acquired by employees under the terms of the group share
             plan see note 39 to the consolidated financial statements as at 31 december 2014 the remaining
             approximately 88 million shares were held by the company as treasury shares

             for financial year 2014 deutsche börse ag is proposing that the annual general meeting resolve to pay
             a dividend of 210 per nopar value share 2013 210 this dividend corresponds to a distribution
             ratio of 58 per cent of consolidated net income adjusted for the special factors described in the results
             of operations 2013 61 per cent also adjusted for special items for 1842 million nopar value shares
             bearing dividend rights this would result in a total dividend of 3868 million 2013 3866 million

130   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




             current assets amounted to 2046409 million as at 31 december 2014 2013 1805130 million
             the increase is attributable to the following factors

              a rise in the financial instruments of the central counterparties item to 1702510 million 2013
               1535468 million
              an increase in receivables and securities from banking business at clearstream to 103071 million


               2013 95440 million
              a growth in restricted bank balances to 222835 million 2013 162217 million this occurred

               primarily because clearing participants provided a greater volume of cash and less securities as collat
               eral for eurex clearing ag in the year under review

             assets were financed by equity in the amount of 37521 million 2013 32680 million
             and liabilities in the amount of 2121560 million 2013 1860419 million the increase in
             equity compared with 31 december 2013 is mainly attributable to the rise in accumulated profit to
             24466 million 2013 20118 million

             noncurrent liabilities rose to 79625 million 2013 60199 million primarily because the
             amount of 40586 million reported under financial instruments of the central counterparties for
             2013 rose to 58858 million for the year under review this liability is matched by an asset in the
             same amount

             interestbearing liabilities declined to 14285 million 2013 15219 million the reason for
             the decline is that bonds of 1398 million maturing in june 2015 were reclassified to other current
             liabilities

             current liabilities amounted to 2041935 million 2013 1800220 million the main changes in
             current liabilities occurred in the following items

              an increase in the financial instruments of the central counterparties item to 1690019 million
               2013 1530468 million
              a growth in liabilities from cash deposits by market participants to 222824 million


               2013 162217 million as a result of higher cash collateral provided by the clearing members
               of eurex clearing ag the amount increased primarily because clearing participants provided
               a relatively greater volume of cash compared to securities as collateral for eurex clearing ag
              a rise in liabilities from banking business at clearstream to 114871 million 2013


               97253 million

             overall assessment of the economic position by the executive board

             deutsche börse groups results of operations in financial year 2014 were within the range expected by
             the executive board despite the continuing difficult economic conditions and market uncertainty the
             groups net revenue increased by 7 per cent in total operating costs were pushed up by special factors
             although these factors were significantly lower than in 2013 the most significant items were efficiency
             programme costs and merger and acquisition costs as expected adjusted operating costs were up on
             the previous year because of consolidation effects and higher investments in growth initiatives the
             groups ebit and net income after the above adjustments also slightly exceeded the prioryear figures

             the executive board believes that deutsche börse groups financial position was extremely sound in the
             year under review as in the previous year the company generated high operating cash flows the slight
             increase in ebit and the significant reduction in interest expenses following the successful refinancing of
             longterm financial liabilities meant that the interest coverage ratio clearly exceeded the target of at least
             16 at group level at 260 in addition deutsche börse aims to achieve a ratio of interestbearing gross
             debt to ebitda of no more than 15 at group level this target was also met

global employee survey provides important inputs
at the end of 2013 deutsche börse group conducted an employee survey in which 816 per cent
of the workforce took part from the employees perspective the groups strengths are customer focus
product and service quality and the working environment at the same time the survey identified areas
for improvement a project group deployed following the survey defined a total of about 400 followup
measures which have been launched at group segment or department level to address the perceived
areas for improvement according to feedback received from managers 80 per cent of the defined
measures had been implemented by the end of the year the issues of the groupwide measures were
concentrated around three areas

 broader base for the companys strategic orientation various communication formats were used to
  improve the flow of information they included staff meetings at which the chief executive officer
  addressed the workforce directly and in smaller groups strategic dialogues between members of the
  executive board and employees the communication of the companys strategic orientation was inten
  sified by video in the intranet and through print materials
 greater horizontal cooperation between segments the solutions the company developed to deal with


  this issue which the survey had highlighted as a key concern include a lunchdating tool which
  brings colleagues from different areas together for a joint lunch in addition the corporate volunteering
  programme was expanded to give employees more opportunities to get involved in charitable activities
  deutsche börse group grants each employee two days of special leave to take part in selected cor
  porate volunteering projects further improvements in it support eg through the introduction of a
  dynamic organisation chart make it easier for employees to communicate across locations
 staff management and development the group also benefited from the results of the survey in the


  area of staff management over a period of three weeks more than 1000 employees visited people
  principles an internal online forum where they discussed guidelines for ethical behaviour among
  colleagues the principles the discussion highlighted as the most important for employees will be
  implemented in the company through workshops and other initiatives from the beginning of 2015
  onwards in order to put them into practice in everyday work staff dialogues will in future lay greater
  emphasis on individual development planning and on encouraging internal mobility eg through
  systematic job rotation

this selection of followup projects shows some examples of the different insights gained from the
employee survey the next survey is planned for the end of 2015

             manage risk and collateral it is therefore even more important for the group to protect itself against risks
             this section of the combined management report shows how the company deals with risks despite the
             continuing tensions in the financial system and regulatory developments which will be briefly described
             in the first section of this risk report the risk profile has remained largely stable in the year under review
             with regard to financial risks and business risks however operational risks have increased this is re
             flected in the regulatory capital requirements as well as in the required economic capital the increase
             in operational risk is driven in particular by the increasingly international reach of the business and the
             greater complexity of the regulatory framework by which the group is bound this increases the risk that
             regulatory requirements will not be met

             management further strengthened risk management in 2014 the second section of this risk report
             explains the enhanced risk management strategy and shows how the group manages its risks

risk management environment

the fallout from the financial crisis has led to increased regulation of financial markets the new regula
tions affect deutsche börse group both directly and indirectly through its clients on the one hand the
changed regulatory environment offers the group opportunities as a marketplace organiser it certainly
contributes significantly to the desired stability integrity and transparency of the capital markets see
the report on opportunities on the other hand the implementation of new regulations such as the
amendment to the european unions mifid regulation and the attempts to introduce a financial trans
action tax mean considerable burdens as well as business risks for the group

in particular the regulatory requirements for the risk management of financial institutions have been ex
tended examples are the mindestanforderungen an das risikomanagement marisk german minimum
requirements for risk management the circular 12552 on central administration internal governance
and risk management issued by the luxembourg financial supervisory authority commission de sur
veillance du secteur financier cssf the european banking recovery and resolution directive brrd
respectively the german gesetz zur abschirmung von risiken und zur planung der sanierung und
abwicklung von kreditinstituten und finanzgruppen riskabschg act on ringfencing and recovery and
resolution planning for credit institutions and financial groups risk management requirements set out
in the european market infrastructure regulation emir the principles for financial market infrastruc
ture of the financial stability board fsb the committee on payments and market infrastructures
cpmi and the international organization of securities commissions iosco and the act implementing
the capital requirements directive crd iv the principles of the fsb the cpmi and iosco in particu
lar place demands on the risk management of financial market infrastructures the crd iv could mean
that regulated financial institutions would have to hold higher equity thanks to measures such as lever

             age ratio put simply a minimum ratio of equity to unweighted total assets plus offbalance sheet risk
             positions which would increase the cost of equity

             these regulatory requirements directly affect the financial institutions of the group clearstream and
             eurex clearing ag this applies in particular to the marisk from the bundesanstalt für finanzdienst
             leistungsaufsicht bafin the german federal financial supervisory authority which was most recently
             revised in december 2012 as well as cssfs circular 12552 on central administration internal gov
             ernance and risk management the socalled pillar ii requirements under basel ii dictate to banks
             how they must organise their risk management system and therefore also apply to clearstream and
             eurex clearing ag they set out the principles governing how much capital a bank must hold for its
             business to cover counterparty default risk market price risk and operational risk and stipulates condi
             tions for outsourcing compliance and internal auditing in addition clearstream and eurex clearing ag
             have prepared recovery plans in accordance with the riskabschg which has been updated by brrd
             as at 1 january 2015 above and beyond this requirement deutsche börse group has also voluntarily
             developed a groupwide recovery plan for the event that this should be necessary at clearstream
             and eurex clearing ag moreover at the request of the national supervisory authorities clearstream and
             eurex clearing ag made a substantial contribution in the course of 2014 to the resolution plans the su
             pervisory authorities have to develop regulatory efforts are currently under way to enhance the re
             quirements for recovery and resolution planning especially with regard to financial market infrastruc
             tures any amendments to the recovery and resolution plans this may necessitate will be implemented
             by deutsche börse group clearstream and eurex clearing ag in addition the brrd introduced mini
             mum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities mrel the minimum requirements are de
             signed to ensure that institutions always hold sufficient liabilities so that they can use the bailin tool if
             there is a threat to their continued existence as a going concern the technical standards of the europe
             an banking authority eba are currently being exposed for consultation

             there are also business risks for deutsche börse group from the new regulatory regime this is be
             cause it changes the structure of the entire financial system for example a law was passed in the
             summer of 2013 in germany requiring banks to outsource proprietary trading to independent companies
             as of 2016 the revised european markets in financial instruments directive mifid ii and the sup
             plementary markets in financial instruments regulation mifir were adopted at the beginning of 2014
             mifid ii is the revised legal framework for customerrelated investment services in securities and for the
             operation of regulated markets and derivatives trading in addition mifir provides new regulations for
             access to clearing institutions and securities trading venues and new trading transparency requirements
             deutsche börse group welcomes regulatory measures that reduce systemic risks with its products and
             services the group contributes significantly to increasing system stability

             in light of the new regulatory requirements deutsche börse group already compiled a comprehensive
             plan in 2013 for enhancing its risk management risk management roadmap in order to continue to
             meet the highest possible standards a large part of the defined measures were already implemented
             in 2014 implementation will continue in 2015 for a more detailed description of the measures see
             the outlook section

bearing capacity and risk appetite it consciously assumes risks in order to satisfy market needs and
maximise business opportunities however it curbs this appetite with a defined upper limit on the
risks it takes

management further strengthened risk management in 2014 the basis for internal risk management is
the groupwide strategy for detecting and managing risks which is focused on what is known as risk
appetite see the business strategy and risk strategy are interlocked chart deutsche börse ags
executive board has overall responsibility and defines the framework for risk management throughout
the group under these groupwide risk management requirements each division and each regulated
company is responsible for managing its own risk among other things this coordinated process en
sures that the group and its companies act just as quickly and effectively in the event that several sys
tems fail simultaneously as if a single system fails this section of the risk report shows how the group
has established risk management as an integral part of company management activities and that it has
established three principles for the risk strategy moreover this section sets out the approaches and
methods used by the group to regularly monitor and manage its riskbearing capacity and risk appetite

implementation in the organisational structure and workflow
the risk strategy applies to the entire deutsche börse group risk management functions processes
and responsibilities are binding for all employees and organisational units of deutsche börse group
to ensure that all employees consciously deal with risks risk management is firmly anchored in the
organisational structure and workflows and is supported by corresponding measures such as risk

regularly checks the current levels of all parameters to ensure they are suitable and as necessary
makes recommendations to the chief risk officer or the executive board if necessary as to what
measures should be used to adjust these parameters

group risk management grm is headed by the chief risk officer cro it prepares the proposals for
the risk levers ie the strategy appetite parameters capital allocation and procedures grm continu
ously analyses and evaluates risks and reports quantitatively and qualitatively five times a year to the
risk committee once a month to the executive board once a quarter to the audit committee and once
a year to the supervisory board in this way the responsible bodies can regularly check whether the risk
limits defined in the strategy are systematically adhered to in addition grm recommends measures to
manage risks

the regulated subsidiaries act in the same way always ensuring that they meet the requirements of the
group in particular they adhere to the framework for risk appetite allocated to them by deutsche börse
group the relevant supervisory boards and their committees are involved as are the executive boards
and risk management functions in the various divisions clearstream and eurex clearing ag the groups
financial institutions implement the risk strategy using their own strategies that they derive from it in
line with this they use parameters and reporting formats that are compatible with the higherlevel group
wide structure at clearstream responsibility lies with the executive board of clearstream holding ag
supervised by the supervisory board as well as the corresponding governing bodies of clearstream
banking sa and clearstream banking ag at eurex clearing ag responsibility again lies with the
executive board which is also monitored by the supervisory board

centrally coordinated risk management in five stages
risk management is implemented in a fivestage process all potential losses should be identified in
good time recorded centrally and evaluated quantitatively as far as possible if necessary management
measures must then be recommended and their implementation monitored see the course of the
fivestage risk management system chart the first stage determines the risks and possible causes of
loss or operational hitches in the second stage the business divisions regularly  and immediately if
urgent  report to grm the risks that they determine and quantify in the third stage grm assesses the
potential for loss while in the fourth stage the business divisions manage the risks by avoiding mitigat
ing or transferring them or by actively taking them the fifth and final stage involves for example mon
itoring different risk metrics and if necessary informing the responsible executive board members and

             management methods and capital resources assessment the report on business activities is also
             made available to the public

             three principles
             deutsche börse groups risk strategy is based on three principles

             1 risk limitation  protecting against liquidation and ensuring continuity of operations
             capital is expected to be exhausted no more than once in 5000 years an operating loss may occur no
             more than once every hundred years accordingly one goal is to ensure that the total capital will not be
             lost within the next twelve months with a probability of 9998 per cent or more another is to ensure
             with a probability of 990 per cent or more that deutsche börse at least breaks even in terms of earnings
             as measured at the ebit level this principle establishes how much risk the group must be able to with
             stand and also the level of risk appetite that it has

             2 supporting growth in the various business divisions
             risk management supports the business divisions in expanding their business by working together to
             comprehensively identify and communicate risks with this principle the group aims to make informed
             strategic decisions within the scope of the risk appetite that it has defined

             3 appropriate riskreturn ratio
             the return on equity should exceed the cost of equity deutsche börse group has set itself the goal that
             risk and return should be reasonably balanced not only for each business division in general but also
             for individual regions products and customers

             risk management approaches and methods
             deutsche börse group uses quantitative and qualitative risk management approaches and methods to
             monitor and manage its risk profile the aim is to provide as complete a picture as possible of its risk
             situation at all times

             deutsche börse group assesses and reports operational financial and business risks using the same
             approach the unregulated units also use value at risk var as a uniform measure this value quantifies
             the risks and represents the upper limit of the cumulative loss that deutsche börse group may incur
             within a specified period of time eg for the next twelve months with a specified probability or level of
             confidence principle 1 above also defines a probability respectively a confidence level for each of the

liquidation and the orderly going concern the regulatory capital requirements for the financial institu
tions are also determined of course furthermore deutsche börse group applies stress tests to analyse
its risks

liquidation principle what risk can the capital cover
in accordance with the first part of principle 1 of the risk strategy deutsche börse group is not expected
to exhaust its riskbearing capacity in more than 002 per cent of all years the group determines the
economic capital that it requires for this required economic capital ec with the help of var it there
fore calculates its ec for the liquidation principle at a confidence level of 9998 per cent so that it can
protect itself financially against extreme events in the following twelve months in line with the principle
of prudence the group assumes a correlation of one between risk types and between the risks at differ
ent group companies when making calculations ie it assumes that all possible risks could occur sim
ultaneously it therefore consciously disregards the fact that diversification would actually reduce the
overall risk deutsche börse group thus uses the most conservative approach requiring the highest ec
the ecs calculated for clearstream and eurex clearing ag also meet the pillar ii requirements under
basel ii

deutsche börse group determines its riskbearing capacity based on the reported equity in accordance
with international financial reporting standards ifrss it adjusts this figure for precautionary reasons
among other things to take into account that it may not be possible to dispose of intangible assets at
their carrying amounts in case of extreme stress clearstream and eurex clearing ag use their regulatory
capital to determine their riskbearing capacity for details see note 20 to the consolidated financial
statements

for management purposes grm regularly determines the ratio of the ec to the riskbearing capacity
this indicator is known as the utilisation of riskbearing capacity in so doing it answers a key risk man
agement question how much risk can the group afford and what risk is it currently exposed to the
level of ec is determined on the basis of operational risk market price and credit risk as well as busi
ness risk the ratio of ec to riskbearing capacity was well within the stipulated maximum risk in the
year under review otherwise the group would use up its entire riskbearing capacity in a worstcase
scenario and would be liquidated the liquidation concept therefore assumes that liquidation of the
group gone concern is avoided

going concern principle what risks can earnings absorb
deutsche börse group has also used an approach that assumes an orderly continuation of the group in
the event of a crisis going concern the group calculates earnings at risk ear as indicator this in
dicator corresponds to the second part of principle 1 of its risk strategy ie that an operating loss may
occur no more than once in a hundred years in other words there should be a probability of 990 per
cent or more that deutsche börse should at least break even net income measured in terms of ebit
the ear determined for the going concern principle is compared with the risk appetite risk appetite is
measured in terms of the projected earnings before interest and tax ebit and allocated to the group
segments as at 31 december 2014 ear were 696 million which would be comparable to the ad
justed ebit 2014 of 990 million

regulatory capital requirements
clearstream and eurex clearing ag must also calculate their capital requirements for various risk types
see the deutsche börse groups risk profile chart according to the pillar i requirements under basel
ii they use a standard approach for analysing and evaluating credit and market price risks in this ap
proach risk weightings are applied in accordance with counterparty ratings

152   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




             for operational risks they proceed differently clearstream has used the significantly more complex
             advanced measurement approach ama for this in all business units since 2008 it thereby complies
             with the regulatory capital requirements for operational risks according to the eu capital requirements
             regulation crr the method which has been approved by and is regularly tested by bafin allows
             regulatory capital to be allocated to regulated units it is particularly suitable because at clearstream
             operational risk accounts for a greater proportion of the overall risk than for a typical bank while the
             proportion attributable to financial risks is smaller for operational risks eurex clearing ag uses the
             basic indicator approach to calculate regulatory capital the basis for calculating the basic indicator is
             known as the relevant indicator which is calculated from certain items in the profit and loss account
             of the eurex segment as a flat rate 15 per cent of the threeyear average of this indicator is required as
             operational risk capital

             stress tests
             clearstream also uses stress tests to analyse its business risks as well as operational and financial risks
             furthermore stress tests for operational and financial risks of eurex clearing ag are performed these
             stress tests simulate the occurrence of extreme losses or an accumulation of major losses within one year
             possible risk scenarios are set out for this the scenarios describe potential loss events the probability
             that they will occur and the estimated loss amount the figures calculated in this way are compared with
             the riskbearing capacity both hypothetical scenarios and extreme market conditions that actually oc
             curred in the past are calculated losses incurred by the group itself in the past are not suitable because
             to date there has been only one case of loss on this scale see the legal disputes and business
             practice section the settlement agreement with ofac to investigate the liquidity risk liquidity stress
             tests and inverse stress tests are also performed these reverse stress tests determine which loss scenar
             ios would have to occur for the riskbearing capacity to be exceeded

tion of the risk profile that differs from most other financial services providers as financial risks play a
significantly smaller role for deutsche börse group

risk profile
deutsche börse group differentiates between the three standard types of risk operational financial and
business risk there are also project risks that the group does not specifically quantify as their impact is
already reflected in the three traditional risk types

low level of typical bank risk
the risks of deutsche börse groups financial institutions differ fundamentally from those of other finan
cial service providers while credit and market price risks for a typical universal bank account for more
than 80 per cent of the regulatory capital requirements credit risks only account for around 18 per cent
for the financial institutions in deutsche börse group clearstream and eurex clearing ag have a struc
turally lower risk in comparison with other banks because they act as intermediaries and therefore do
not themselves trade on the financial markets as a distinct business division for example consequently
deutsche börse groups financial institutions do not have to bear the associated high trade risks on the
contrary they offer market participants services such as collateral and risk management that reduce their
risk from trading activities the groups banking business mainly consists of reliable clearing settlement
and custody activities as well as collateral management

the regulatory capital requirements for clearstream and eurex clearing ag arise primarily from opera
tional risks see the regulatory capital requirements of clearstream and eurex clearing ag chart
information on the additional capital requirements for eurex clearing ag and european commodity
clearing ag under emir is provided in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements

operational risks higher than financial and business risks
the utilisation of riskbearing capacity in the liquidation principle and of risk appetite in the going con
cern principle are used as internal management indicators across the whole deutsche börse group see
the risk management approaches and methods section for an explanation of the terms apart from
the abovementioned financial and operational risks business risks are also identified and assessed
business risks refer in particular to potential threats to revenue such as price pressure or loss in market

             share under the liquidation principle financial risks amount to appr one fifth of the total risk of deutsche
             börse group business risks represent 18 per cent of the groups total for this risk type all the more im
             portant for deutsche börse group is the third typical risk type at 61 per cent operational risks amount
             to more than half of the total risk see the required economic capital of deutsche börse group by
             risk type chart

             a large part of the risk is associated with the clearstream and eurex segments see the required
             economic capital by segment chart in accordance with the size of the business in terms of sales reve
             nue and earnings in the year under review the clearstream proportion was 43 per cent and for eurex
             this figure was 42 per cent the eurex segment also includes the risks arising from the business of eurex
             clearing ag the market data  services segment had a share of 9 per cent and xetra of 6 per cent
             in contrast to the regulatory capital requirements this includes business areas that are not subject to
             banking regulations

             in total deutsche börse group has calculated a required economic capital of 1939 million in accord
             ance with the liquidation principle the required ec compares to a riskbearing capacity of 2591 million

             a similar split may be seen in earnings at risk here also the business segments with the largest propor
             tions of revenues and earnings  clearstream and eurex  show the largest shares of earnings at risk
             see the earnings at risk by segment chart

             deutsche börse group assigns indicators to each risk to estimate how likely it is to occur and what finan
             cial effect it could have it distinguishes four probability levels very low low medium and high as well
             as four financial impact levels low medium substantial and a risk to the company as a going concern
             however none of the assessed risks reach the fourth impact level neither individually nor in total this
             means that none jeopardises the existence of the group as a going concern

             the risk types listed below as examples can be assessed based on these categories the estimated prob
             ability of the risk occurring can be categorised as follows

                very low probability of risk occurring is less than 1 per cent
                low probability of risk occurring is equal to or greater than 1 per cent but less than 10 per cent

   medium probability of risk occurring is equal to or greater than 10 per cent but less than 50 per cent
   high probability of risk occurring is equal to or greater than 50 per cent

the estimated financial effects can be classified into the following four categories

 low financial loss could be up to 10 per cent of ebit
 medium financial loss could be up to 50 per cent of ebit
 substantial financial loss could be up to 100 per cent of ebit

 risk to the business as a going concern financial loss could equal the available riskbearing capacity




in the following the types of risk are first illustrated with specific examples and are explained in detail
afterwards

1 operational risks
 incorrect processing of client instructions eg capital increases
 mishandling of the default of a large customer

 miscalculation of indices

 mishandling of trading instructions

 losses caused by force majeure eg natural disasters terrorism

 loss from ongoing legal disputes

 infringements of sanctions or supranational regulations

 failure of a trading system lasting up to one day




2 financial risks
 default of a credit counterparty
 losses from impairment of fund assets for pension plans

 loss of a customer and an associated liquidity bottleneck




3 business risks
 entry of new competitors on the european trading market
 reinvigoration of the european government debt crisis

 falling prices for tradingrelated services

 sustained period of weak trading activity in the market

 new regulatory requirements




from todays perspective none of these risks can lead to financial loss that is rated as substantial
significant risks could arise only from a combination of extreme events that have a very low probability

 failure of a trading system lasting one week in a highly volatile market environment
 simultaneous failure of several large systemically important banks
 deliberate contraventions of sanction rules




these extreme events that could lead to a loss corresponding to more than 50 per cent of annual ebit
are rated as having a probability of less than 1 per cent such extreme events have not occurred to date
they are also known as tail risks tail risks may become a risk to the continued existence of some sub
sidiaries as going concerns for example if sanction rules are deliberately contravened grm assesses
these risks continuously and reports on its assessment to the executive board of deutsche börse group
on a regular basis

             operational risks
             operational risks for deutsche börse group relate to availability processing material goods as well as
             litigation and business practice see the chart operational risks of deutsche börse group person
             nel risks are not quantified directly but influence the quantification process indirectly via the operational
             risk categories the operational risks amount to 61 per cent of the total group risk

             system availability
             operational resources such as the trading systems xetra and t7 are essential for the services offered
             by deutsche börse group they should never fail in order to ensure that market participants can trade
             securities or derivatives at any time and without delay the group therefore sees the availability of these
             systems as an important risk indicator in line with the groups risk strategy the business areas are
             responsible for monitoring these risk indicators

             the potential loss would be larger the longer one of these systems failed in the past only limited fail
             ures have occurred with both xetra and t7 and its predecessor system in the year under review how
             ever the ise version of the t7 trading system was unavailable for almost one whole day nevertheless
             in practice there has never been a system failure lasting longer than one day deutsche börse group has
             taken various measures to further minimise the risk of failure lasting one day or longer for example
             when introducing new software components ise will in future take special backup measures so that
             the previous software version can be restored faster this supports the view that the probability of a sys
             tem failure lasting longer than a week in an extremely volatile market is very low however the potential
             financial effect of such an event could be significant if claims are justified and asserted

the probability of a longlasting failure for one day or longer of the margin calculation system at the cen
tral counterparty the clearing system at eurex clearing ag or the settlement system at the international
central securities depository and settlement service provider clearstream banking sa is also low in
actual fact no such failure has ever occurred the effects are categorised here as medium

in general availability risk represents the largest operational risk for deutsche börse group the group
therefore subjects it to regular stress tests which check not only what happens when its own systems
fail but also when suppliers fail to deliver

processing
risks can also arise if a service provided to a customer is inadequate and this leads to complaints or le
gal disputes such as in the settlement of securities transactions due to defective products and processes
or erroneous manual entries as a result errors could occur for example in handling the default of a
large clearing customer to date no such errors have occurred the probability is therefore considered to
be very low the potential financial loss is considered to be medium in addition indices such as dax
could be miscalculated such processing errors can occur with a medium probability but have hardly
ever happened to date the possible losses relating to the calculation of indices would be classified as
low to date there have been no client claims in this regard

if a xetra or eurex customer complains to the market supervision department of deutsche börse about
incorrect trading instructions the latter checks immediately whether the notification is justified and then
issues corresponding trading instructions to the market participants the risk here is of a notification be
ing initially incorrectly assessed as unjustified if the client concerned then closes their position them
selves for example they could demand a refund of the additional costs incurred however such errors
have almost never occurred and the probability is therefore considered low to date no significant cus
tomer claims have been brought and the potential financial effects are rated as low

other sources of error may be attributable to suppliers or to defective products or mistakes that may lead
to the loss of client assets the group registers all complaints and formal objections as a key indicator of
processing risk

physical assets
natural disasters accidents terrorism or sabotage are also among the operational risks that could for
example cause the destruction of or severe damage to a data centre or office building examples include
severe storms or floods such as those already seen in new york or prague business continuity man
agement bcm planning aims at averting significant financial damage see the chart of the same
name there is only a low probability of the risk of force majeure materialising and in the event that it
does it should have a low impact

legal disputes and business practice
losses can also result from ongoing legal proceedings deutsche börse judges the probability that this
operational risk will occur to be medium although damage can be substantial as a result grm contin
ually monitors ongoing legal proceedings these can occur if deutsche börse group breaches laws or
requirements enters into inadequate contractual agreements or fails to observe case law to a sufficient
degree legal risks also include losses due to fraud and labour law issues they further include losses as

             a result of insufficient controls to prevent money laundering breaches of competition law regulations
             or of banking secrecy such operational risks can also apply if government sanctions are not observed
             or in the event of breaches of other state or higherorder regulatory provisions

             on 12 november 2012 the chicago board options exchange cboe filed a patent infringement law

             cboe alleges us525 million in damages for infringement of three patents which relate to systems
             and methods for limiting marketmaker risk ise believes that cboes damages claim lacks merit be
             cause it is unsupported by the facts and the law ise intends to vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit
             upon ises motion the case was stayed pending the outcome of certain petitions filed by ise with
             the us patent and trademark office uspto in which ise sought to invalidate the cboe patents on
             2 march 2015 the uspto has partially granted ises petitions and has issued decisions determining
             that all three cboe patents are at least insofar invalid as they constitute unpatentable abstract ideas

measures to mitigate operational risks
deutsche börse group takes targeted measures to reduce deutsche börse groups operational risk the
most important of these are emergency and contingency plans insurance contracts and precautions to
ensure that regulations are observed compliance

emergency and contingency plans
it is essential for deutsche börse group to provide its products and services as reliably as possible it
must maintain its business operations and safeguard against emergencies and disasters if its core pro
cesses and resources are not available there is a substantial risk for the entire group and even a poten
tial systemic risk for the financial markets in general as a result deutsche börse group has set up a
system of emergency and disaster plans covering the entire group business continuity management
bcm this covers all processes that ensure continuing operations in the event of a crisis and significant
ly reduces availability risk these include precautions in relation to all important resources systems
workspaces employees suppliers including the redundant design of essential it systems and the
technical infrastructure as well as emergency measures for the absence of employees or the failure of
workspaces in core functions at all important locations examples of such precautions are listed in the
    business continuity management chart

preparations for emergencies and crises
the group has introduced and tested a management process for emergencies and crises that enables
it to respond quickly and in a coordinated manner this process is intended to minimise the effects on
business processes and on the market and to enable a quick return to regular operations all business
areas have appointed emergency managers to act as central contacts and take responsibility during
emergencies and crises the emergency managers inform the executive board or alert them in the case
of severe incidents in the event of a crisis the responsible executive board member acts as the crisis
manager the emergency and contingency plans are tested regularly by realistically simulating critical
situations such tests are generally carried out unannounced the test results are evaluated based on
the following criteria

 functionally effective the measures must be technically successful
 executable the employees must be familiar with the emergency procedure and be able to execute it
 timely emergency measures must ensure a restart of operations within the intended time period

             information security
             attacks on information security and cybercrime are operational risks that deutsche börse group faces
             cybercrime is increasingly becoming a focus for organised crime and now features high on the list of
             crime statistics year after year it is a threat to all financial services providers credit institutions and to
             deutsche börse group given the increasing danger from cyber criminals it is becoming increasingly
             important for the group to mitigate these specific risks and to intensify information security measures
             for this reason information security is was extended in 2014 and a comprehensive programme was
             launched for the continuous improvement of the existing measures

             in particular in 2014 the group set up a situation centre computer emergency response team cert
             which detects and assesses threats in cooperation with national and international financial intelli
             gence units at an early stage and coordinates risk mitigation measures in cooperation with the business
             areas in addition a process has been established that aims to continually adapt information security at
             deutsche börse group to the growing and constantly changing requirements and to incorporate regula
             tory requirements at an early stage

             insurance contracts
             operational risks that deutsche börse group cannot or does not wish to bear itself are transferred to in
             surance companies if this is possible at a reasonable price for example losses resulting from natural
             disasters are insured all insurance contracts are coordinated centrally so that the entire deutsche börse
             group has at all times consistent insurance cover offering an attractive costbenefit ratio the insurance
             contracts are checked individually and approved by the cfo of deutsche börse ag

throughout the course of 2014 clearstream was in the forefront of industry efforts to raise awareness
of risks as well as risk mitigation opportunities in light of the interdependency of many industry partici
pants with respect to securities custody services a focus was how intermediaries served by a custodian
depository or settlement agent can and should put their provider in a position to comply at all times with
the providers own standards applicable laws and regulations the international securities services as
sociation issa agreed to take on the development of antimoney laundering and compliance principles
for securities custody and settlement group participants remain actively engaged in this industry effort
to develop best practices which continues into 2015 and once adopted deutsche börse group is
committed to implementing and promoting these industry standards

in the light of the sectoral sanctions imposed by the eu united states and other jurisdictions in re
sponse to the crisis in the ukraine in particular with respect to the new types of obligations imposed
on the financial sector deutsche börse group has reached out proactively to other major market partici
pants and regulators the groups efforts sought to better share information develop common under
standings of the risks and practical challenges to further develop appropriate risk mitigation measures
and to understand interdependencies and the approach of other major market participants one example
was through initiating a special meeting among all german stock exchanges and supervisory authorities
to discuss the implications of the sanctions and appropriate compliance measures the commitment
to efforts such as these demonstrate the groups belief that an investment in an efficient and effective
compliance function will further its business activities and thus is in the interest of the group and the
customers and markets it serves

             credit risk
             credit risk describes the danger that a counterparty might not meet its contractual obligations or not in
             full measurement criteria include the degree to which the credit line has been used the deposited col
             lateral as well as concentration risk clearstream and eurex clearing ag often have shortterm claims
             against counterparties totalling several billion euros overall but these are in most cases secured by mar
             gins deposited by the market participants the group tests credit risk coverage by means such as exam
             ining how resilient the group would be if its biggest counterparty were to default eurex clearing ag
             additionally tests its resilience if its two biggest counterparties were to default in addition it regularly
             assesses the reliability of emergency plans for eurex clearing ag in the case of credit default an as
             sessment of the reliability of the emergency plans for clearstream is planned from 2015 onwards

             furthermore clearstream banking sa is exposed to credit risk arising from its strategic securities lend
             ing transactions aslplus only selected banks act as borrowers all borrowing transactions are fully
             collateralised only selected bonds may be used as collateral these must be rated at least a by the
             standard  poors sp rating agency or the equivalent from other agencies in the case of shortterm
             securities without individual ratings the issuers must be rated at least a1

             clearstream grants credits to its customers in order to make settlement more efficient this type of credit
             business is however fundamentally different from the classic lending business firstly credit is extend
             ed solely on a very shortterm basis normally for less than a day secondly it is largely collateralised
             and granted to highly creditworthy clients furthermore the credit lines granted can be revoked at any
             time

             according to its terms and conditions eurex clearing ag only enters into transactions with its clearing
             members clearing mainly relates to defined securities rights derivatives and emission allowances that
             are traded on specific stock exchanges eurex clearing ag also offers this service for some overthe
             counter otc products such as interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements it serves as an inter
             mediary between the parties to the transaction central counterparty in order to reduce its customers
             credit risk by offsetting receivables clearing members deposit collateral with eurex clearing ag to re
             duce their reciprocal default risk

             to date no default by a borrower with a secured credit line has resulted in material financial losses
             deutsche börse group continues to view the probability that one of its borrowers could become insolvent
             and that this could lead to losses for the group as low it considers the impact of such an event to be
             low if the credit line in question is collateralised and medium if it is uncollateralised the probability of
             a counterparty to an uncollateralised credit defaulting is considered to be very low the highestprofile
             defaults in recent years include mf global in 2012 and lehman brothers international europe in
             2008 in both cases the safeguards worked so that neither clearstream nor eurex clearing ag suffered
             a financial loss the following reducing credit risk section outlines how credit risk is reduced

             credit risk can also arise from cash investments the treasury department is responsible here and has
             groupwide authority treasury largely makes collateralised investments of funds belonging to group
             companies as well as clearstream and eurex clearing ag customers to date counterparty default has

not led to any material loss for the group the probability the default of a counterparty to an uncollate
ralised cash investment could lead to a loss is considered to be low although the financial loss itself
could be significant

the financial impact of several large systemically important banks defaulting simultaneously could be
substantial the probability of this scenario occurring is considered to be very low

reducing credit risk
clearstream and eurex clearing ag assess the creditworthiness of potential customers or counterparties
of an investment before entering into business relations the two companies do this in the same way
they determine individual customers credit lines based on regular creditworthiness checks which they
supplement with ad hoc analyses if necessary they define haircuts for securities posted as collateral ac
cording to the risk involved and continually review their appropriateness clearstream includes all rele
vant risk factors when determining haircut and the margin and allows a specific deduction to each the
total haircut is calculated by adding together the individual margins for the relevant risk factors

in order to identify potential concentration risks from individual counterparties clearstream further ana
lyses the var at the level of the clearstream holding group for this purpose a credit risk var is calcu
lated at the level of individual counterparties and compared with the overall credit risk var due to its
business model clearstream focuses almost exclusively on financial sector customers however there is
neither a material concentration of credit risk on any individual counterparty nor on individual countries

given the size and volatility of its clients liabilities eurex clearing ag has developed a leadingedge
collateral management system which is described in detail in the following section

safety for both participants and the clearing house
each clearing member must prove that it has capital equal to at least the amount that eurex clearing ag
has defined for the different markets the amount of capital for which evidence must be provided de
pends on the risk in order to mitigate eurex clearing ags risk that clearing members might default be
fore setting open transactions clearing members are obliged to deposit collateral in the form of cash or
securities margins on a daily basis and if required to meet additional intraday margin calls

eurex clearing ag only permits securities with a high credit quality to be used as collateral it continually
reviews what collateral it will accept and covers market risk using corresponding haircuts with a confi
dence level of at least 999 per cent it applies a further haircut to collateral from issuers in highrisk
countries or excludes them from being furnished as collateral altogether the risk inputs are checked
regularly and the safety margins are calculated daily for each security in addition a minimum safety
margin applies to all securities

the margins are calculated separately for clearing member accounts and client accounts gains and
losses which result from intraday changes to the value of financial instruments are either settled in cash
by the counterparties variation margin or deposited with eurex clearing ag as collateral by the seller
due to the change in the equivalent value of the item premium margin in the case of bond repo or


166   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




             equity transactions the margin is collected from either the buyer or the seller current liquidating margin
             depending on how the purchase price performs compared to the current value of the financial instruments
             the purpose of these margins is to offset gains and losses

             in addition eurex clearing ag protects itself from default by a clearing member against any risk that the
             value of the positions in the latters account will deteriorate in the period before the account is settled by
             obtaining additional collateral this additional collateral is called additional margin in riskbased margin
             ing and initial margin in the prisma method portfoliobased risk management the target confidence
             level here is at least 990 per cent eurex clearing ag checks regularly whether the margins match the
             requested confidence level and currently calculates the margins using both riskbased margining and
             the prisma method the new prisma method is already available for the most important product groups
             equity derivatives equity index derivatives and derivatives on fixedincome products the intention is for
             this method to fully replace riskbased margining until the end of december 2016 it takes into account
             the clearing members entire portfolio and takes historical and stress scenarios into account when cal
             culating the margin requirements the objective is to cover market fluctuations for the entire liquidation
             period until the account is settled

             in addition to the margins for current transactions each clearing member contributes to a clearing fund
             depending on its individual risk profile this fund is jointly liable for the financial consequences of a de
             fault by a clearing member to the extent that this cannot be covered by the members individual margin
             its own contributions to the clearing fund and eurex clearing ags clearing fund contribution eurex
             clearing ag uses regular stress tests to check whether its clearing funds match the risks this involves
             subjecting all current transactions and their collateral to market price fluctuations at a confidence level of
             at least 999 per cent in order to be able to determine potential losses in excess of a clearing members
             individual margins the impact of a potential default on the clearing fund is simulated eurex clearing ag
             has defined limits which when exceeded trigger an immediate adjustment to the scope of the clearing
             fund if necessary the following lines of defence are available in case a clearing member is unable to
             meet its obligations to eurex clearing ag due to delays or defaults

              first the outstanding positions and transactions of the clearing member concerned can be netted
               andor closed from a risk perspective by entering into appropriate backtoback transactions or they
               can be settled in cash
              any potential shortfall that might be incurred in connection with such a closing or cash settlement

               as well as associated costs would be covered in the first instance by the collateral provided by the
               clearing member concerned as at 31 december 2014 collateral amounting to 497847 million
               had been provided for the benefit of eurex clearing ag after haircuts
              after this the relevant clearing members contribution to the clearing fund would be used to cover the


               open amount the contributions range from 1 million to 389 million as at 31 december 2014
              any remaining shortfall would initially be covered by a contribution to the clearing fund by eurex clear

               ing ag eurex clearing ags contribution amounted to 50 million as at 31 december 2014
              only then would the other clearing members contributions to the clearing fund be used proportionately


               as at 31 december 2014 the volume of eurex clearing ags clearing fund stood at 35129 million
               after the contributions have been used in full eurex clearing ag can request additional contributions
               from each clearing member which can be up to twice as high as their original clearing fund contributions

 ultimately a letter of comfort has been issued by deutsche börse ag in it deutsche börse ag states
  that it would provide eurex clearing ag with up to 700 million to cover any remaining losses the
  letter of comfort may only be used for losses from onexchange transactions
 finally in the case of a shortfall eurex clearing ags remaining equity of 240 million would be used

in the event of a clearing members default the default management process dmp is triggered its
purpose is to rebalance the ccp and thus to protect the nondefaulting participants from any negative
consequences resulting from the default every product cleared by eurex clearing ag is clearly assigned
to a so called liquidation group products within one liquidation group share similar risk characteristics
and can be liquidated simultaneously in case of a clearing members default the dmp is conducted on
liquidation group level all positions of the defaulted clearing member which belong to the same liquida
tion group are jointly transferred to other participants via an auction or an independent sale the clearing
fund is segmented along these liquidation groups based on their respective margin requirements should
the cost of a liquidation exceed the defaulters resources eurex clearing ag will always provide its own
contribution to absorb losses bevor using the mutual clearing fund during a liquidation eurex clearing
ag can convene committees of market experts default management committees to advise on and sup
port all liquidation activities

eurex clearing ag has faced three defaults of clearing members to date gontard  metallbank
lehman brothers and mf global in all cases the nondefaulters were fully protected by the ccp as
the open positions were closed without resorting to eurex clearing ags own capital or the mutual funds
to the nondefaulters a substantial portion of the defaulters margin remained unused and was returned
to the estate

deutsche börse group reduces its risk when investing funds belonging to group companies as well
as client funds by distributing investments across multiple counterparties all with a high credit quality
by defining investment limits for each counterparty as well as by investing funds primarily in the short
term and in collateralised form if possible investment limits are established for each counterparty on the
basis of regular credit checks and using ad hoc analyses as necessary since extending its licence as
an investment and credit institution under the kreditwesengesetz kwg german banking act eurex
clearing ag can also use deutsche bundesbanks permanent facilities

stress tests are calculated for clearstream and eurex clearing ag to analyse scenarios such as the default
of their largest client the figures determined in this way are compared with the limits defined as part of
the riskbearing capacity in addition the impact of several clearing counterparties defaulting at the same
time is calculated for eurex clearing ag a special stress test examines clearstream banking sas credit
risk exposure from the settlement procedure with euroclear moreover inverse stress tests are calculated
to determine the number of clients that would have to default for losses to exceed the risk cover amount
the results can lead to further analyses and measures to reduce risk in the 2014 financial year no risks
were identified to clearstream and eurex clearing ag as going concerns in the course of the stress test
calculations

             since the single supervisory mechanism ssm is aimed at traditional banks clearstream has not been
             classified as significant in terms of the ssm regardless of its systemic importance

             generally deutsche börse group records various risk indicators in addition to the risk measures ec
             earnings at risk and the credit stress tests performed these include the extent to which individual
             clients use their credit lines and credit concentrations

             market risk
             market risks in operating business result from interest rate or currency fluctuations deutsche börse
             group measures these risks using earningsbased sensitivity analyses for extreme interest rate or ex
             change rate fluctuations it avoids open currency positions whenever possible additional market risks
             can result from deutsche börse groups ringfenced pension plan assets contractual trust agreement

             the pension fund on the basis of a marketrecognised absolute return approach including a value pre
             servation mechanism the group has reduced the risk of market price fluctuations the probability of a
             significant market risk occurring is low and the group also considers the impact to be low clearstream
             and eurex clearing ag perform regulatory stress tests for market risk however since these market risks
             are not substantial no further stress tests are performed beyond those prescribed by the regulators

             liquidity risk
             liquidity risk applies if a deutsche börse group company is unable to meet its daily payment obligations
             or only in return for increased refinancing costs operational liquidity requirements are met primarily by
             internal financing by retaining funds generated the aim is to retain liquidity in the amount of operating
             costs for one quarter target liquidity currently ranges from 150 to 250 million there is an intra
             group cash pool for pooling surplus cash as far as regulatory and legal provisions allow liquid funds
             are invested exclusively short term in order to ensure that they are available shortterm investments are
             also largely secured by liquid bonds from firstclass issuers deutsche börse ag has access to shortterm
             external sources of financing such as agreed credit lines with individual banks or consortia and a
             commercial paper programme in order to cover its structural financing needs deutsche börse ag has
             used its access to the capital market to issue corporate bonds in recent years

             clearstreams investment strategy aims to be able to repay customer deposits at all times accordingly
             liquidity limits are set carefully in addition extensive sources of financing are available at all times
             such as ongoing access to the liquidity facilities at deutsche bundesbank and banque centrale du
             luxembourg

due to its role as a central counterparty eurex clearing ag has strict internal liquidity guidelines its
investment policy is correspondingly conservative regular analyses ensure the appropriateness of the
liquidity guidelines in addition eurex clearing ag can use deutsche bundesbanks permanent facilities
as mentioned above

the key liquidity risk for deutsche börse group lies in customer default if a clearing member of eurex
clearing ag defaults its member position is liquidated if a clearstream customer defaults the  gener
ally collateralised and intraday  credit line granted to increase settlement efficiency would be called
and the collateral provided by the client could then be liquidated deutsche börse group estimates the
probability of this risk to be low with the possibility of medium financial losses however in this context
the key risk lies not in financial losses but in the danger that the group may not respectively not in a
timely manner be able to meet its obligations

to strengthen the risk management functions relating to this key risk the first fire drill was held at
management level at deutsche börse group in december 2014 this exercise simulated the default of
one of the groups customers the aim was to test the management response information flows and
decision processes within the group in a crisis situation and to implement any improvements identified
as a result it is planned to repeat this fire drill regularly and to enhance it further at clearstream it is
also planned to hold a fire drill once a year from 2015 on at eurex clearing ag a similar fire drill is
already part of risk management it is held once a year in cooperation with the clearing members

in addition the liquidity risk to which clearstream and eurex clearing ag are exposed is subject to regu
lar stress tests both the sources of liquidity and its use are tested based on defined historic and hypo
thetical scenarios in addition inverse stress tests are performed to see which additional scenarios would
have to occur for liquidity to be insufficient clearstream and eurex clearing ag had sufficient liquidity
in the stress tests at all times in 2014

business risks
business risk reflects the fact that the group depends on macroeconomic developments and is influ
enced by other external events such as changes in the competitive environment or regulatory initiatives
it therefore expresses the groups business environment and sector risk it also includes business strate
gy risk ie the impact of risks on the business strategy and possible adjustments to it these business
risks are represented as target actual comparisons for ebit and are monitored constantly by the divi
sions their weighting for the group is of about 18 per cent of the total risk business risks may result
in revenues lagging budget projections or in costs being higher

competitive environment
business risk includes the risk that us competitors such as the derivatives exchanges chicago mercan
tile exchange cme and intercontinentalexchange ice or the nasdaq omx stock exchange might in
crease their presence on the european trading markets both on and offexchange deutsche börse
group classes such market entry as highly probable but estimates its impact to be relatively low

reinvigoration of financial and debt crisis
if a peripheral state were to leave the european currency union or if a state were to become insolvent
this could mean that government bonds would not be redeemed or only would be redeemed in part
currently the group still views the probability of this risk occurring as low and the possible conse
quences as medium

170   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




             regulatory requirements
             the risk arising from new regulatory requirements could significantly reduce trading volumes in the cash
             and derivatives markets this means that the revision of the markets in financial instruments directive
             mifid ii and the markets in financial instruments regulation mifir could increase the groups busi
             ness risks facilitating access to european trading centres and clearing houses could lead to a greater
             competition and have a negative effect on revenue in the eurex and xetra segments

             moreover increased transparency requirements as well as new rules on licensing indices used as
             benchmarks laid down in mifid ii and mifir could negatively impact the revenue of the market data 
             services segment as well as the eurex trading venue the introduction of a financial transaction tax
             which continues to be supported by ten european states could significantly reduce trading activities for
             both eurex and xetra this would go hand in hand with lower revenue not only for the marketplaces but
             also for all posttrading businesses and hence for the entire group

             deutsche börse group assumes a medium probability of occurrence for risks from new regulatory
             requirements the possible financial consequences of these risks are currently classed as medium

             economic environment
             a sustained period of weak trading activity in the market also presents a risk for the group the group
             views the probability of this risk occurring as well as the possible financial loss as medium

             deutsche börse group simulates different scenarios in stress tests the scenarios simulate the simulta
             neous occurrence of different business risks such as the negative effects of stronger competition along
             side reduced business due to new regulations

             project risks
             project risks can result from the implementation of ongoing projects such as the launch of new products
             processes or systems which could have a material impact on one or more of the three other risk cate
             gories operational financial and business risk project risks are not broken down further they are
             evaluated by grm and already considered in the initial phase of substantial projects currently further
             expansion of deutsche börse groups business in asia for example is one of the key elements of
             its strategic orientation in addition the implementation of the target2securities settlement system
             is currently an important project for clearstream clear is another key deutsche börse group project
             its goal is to develop an even more powerful platform for eurex clearing ags clearing system

             ongoing monitoring and controls ensure that project risks are continually analysed and evaluated ulti
             mately project risks figure as operational financial and business risks which is why they are quantified
             within these risk types

overall assessment by the executive board on the risk situation

deutsche börse ags executive board is responsible for risk management throughout the group and
regularly reviews the entire groups risk situation its summary of the situation in 2014 is given here
along with a final brief look at the coming financial year

summary
the past financial year saw additional external risk factors emerge for deutsche börse groups business
a further increase in deutsche börse groups operational was identified mainly due to the groups busi
ness becoming more international and as a consequence the higher complexity of regulatory framework
the group has to comply with in addition availability risks have increased the group identified these
factors early on and took appropriate countermeasures due to these measures deutsche börse groups
risk profile remained broadly stable in the year under review deutsche börse groups risks were always
covered by sufficient riskbearing capacity ie the allocated risk appetite limits were met

as at 31 december 2014 the groups ec amounted to 1939 million a 19 per cent increase year
onyear 31 december 2013 1630 million available risk coverage also increased by 8 per cent
to 2591 million yearonyear 31 december 2013 2395 million the earnings at risk as at
31 december 2014 were 696 million while risk appetite was 990 million based on adjusted ebit
in 2014

the executive board of deutsche börse ag is convinced that the risk management system is effective
the board strengthened the system in the past two years and reorganised the control function responsi
ble for it the groupwide strategy to capture and manage risks which now focuses more strongly on
risk appetite forms the basis for internal risk management it is codified in the three principles described
in this report

outlook
the group continually assesses its risk situation based on stress tests the calculated ec as well as the
risk management system the executive board of deutsche börse ag concludes that the available risk
bearing capacity is sufficient furthermore it cannot identify any risk that could endanger the groups
existence as a going concern

in 2015 the group intends to further strengthen its groupwide risk management for instance it
plans to enhance the default management process currently in place for eurex clearing ag not only at
clearstream but in the entire group this will result in a harmonised process for the groups financial
institutions taking into account the potential reciprocal effects of a counterparty default

in addition deutsche börse groups risk culture will be strengthened further by clearly assigning the re
sponsibilities for risks in the business areas in particular operational risk management will be extended
further by introducing or reinforcing the role of the oprisk representative in each business area this
will further strengthen the identification and analysis of operational risks as well as the action taken to
manage these risks

             report on opportunities

             organisation of opportunities management

             deutsche börse groups management of opportunities aims to identify evaluate and assess opportuni
             ties as early as possible and to take appropriate measures in order to transform opportunities into busi
             ness success

             deutsche börse group evaluates organic growth opportunities both on an ongoing basis over the year
             in the individual business areas and systematically at group level as part of its annual budget planning
             process suggestions from the groups business areas for new products services or technologies serve
             as the starting point the process begins with a careful analysis of the market environment as well as
             customer wishes it also considers factors such as market developments competitors and regulatory
             changes this draws on a range of opportunity development tools such as a strengths and weaknesses
             analysis or insideout and outsidein approaches

             the ideas for growth initiatives are fleshed out using uniform groupwide templates and subjected to a
             profitability analysis qualitative aspects are documented in the form of a business plan and expenses
             and revenues are projected in detail for several years the business plan includes for example information
             about the product or service that is to be offered as well as about target customers and competitors
             market size barriers to market entry and the positioning of the product or service on the market it
             also outlines the resources required and the implementation approach  including a marketingsales
             strategy  and highlights potential risks the profitability analysis is based on absorption costing a dis
             tinction is made between expense and expenditurerelated variables thus indicating the effect on both
             the companys income statement and its cash flow statement

             once the business plan and profitability analysis have been prepared for the individual growth initiatives
             a decision is made as to their implementation this is made by the executive board of deutsche börse ag
             as part of the annual budget planning process the executive board starts by setting the budget availa
             ble for growth initiatives which depends on general business performance this budget is then allocated
             to the individual business areas on the basis of various factors such as a business areas contribution to
             group ebit the relevant growth initiatives within the business areas are then prioritised prioritisation
             is based on the profitability analysis it also takes risks into account and assesses the contribution of in
             dividual growth initiatives to the business areas and group strategy economies of scope ie the bene
             fits offered to several business areas also play a role in the prioritisation of growth initiatives the initia
             tives that taking into consideration the corresponding risks make the highest value contribution and
             that can be financed within the scope of the budget allocated to the business area are selected by the
             executive board and incorporated into the budget

             budgeting for growth initiatives involves reserving a fullyear budget in the form of expenditures and ex
             penses for each selected growth initiative included in the investment portfolio the budget is approved
             by the executive board of deutsche börse ag in the course of the year and is broken down into project
             phases this ensures that funding approval is linked to project progress and that projects are reviewed
             regularly it also gives the executive board the opportunity to adjust the deployment of the funds re
             served for the year as a whole and to react to general business performance  if required new growth
             initiatives can be approved in the course of the year for example

monitoring of growth initiatives during the intraperiod budget approval process is facilitated by regular
reporting deutsche börse ags executive board receives a monthly report on the status and progress
of initiatives currently being implemented the report is coordinated by central functions in cooperation
with the individual projects from the business areas and compares planned costs and revenues with
actual budget utilisation and the revenues actually generated in addition financial planning is adjusted
forecasts are updated and changes to the scope of the project are made transparent furthermore
checks are used to establish whether milestones have been reached and projectspecific risks and the
countermeasures taken are described project management and the supporting central functions com
ment on the status of the project for the executive board



organic growth opportunities

in terms of organic growth opportunities deutsche börse group makes a basic distinction between
structural and cyclical opportunities structural opportunities arise for example as a result of regulatory
changes or new customer requirements and can be influenced directly by the company cyclical oppor
tunities which are driven by macroeconomic changes cannot be influenced directly by the company

structural growth opportunities
deutsche börse group is currently focusing on structural growth opportunities relating firstly to otc de
rivatives clearing collateral and liquidity management secondly to further expansion in asia and thirdly
to market data and it

clearing of otc derivatives
the liquidity problems experienced by major market participants during the financial crisis were triggered
by the nonsettlement of bilateral overthecounter otc transactions that were mainly entered into on
an unsecured basis in light of this the leading industrialised nations g20 agreed to create an effective
regulatory environment to make offexchange derivatives transactions more transparent and more secure
in response the european union has developed the european market infrastructure regulation emir
which is aimed at regulating otc trading with derivatives emir includes the following regulatory requi
rements

 an obligation to clear standardised otc derivatives transactions using a central counterparty
 special risk management requirements for transactions in nonstandardised derivatives
 an obligation to report the transactions to a trade repository




emir entered into force on 16 august 2012 and is currently being implemented to help market par
ticipants meet its requirements eurex clearing has developed a central counterparty for clearing otc
derivatives transactions this is known as eurexotc clear and has been available to the market since
13 november 2012 on 10 april 2014 eurex clearing received a clearing house licence in accordance
with emir the granting of the licence confirms full compliance of eurex clearings clearing services
with the emir rules eurex clearing can therefore already provide its members with services needed to
meet the upcoming clearing obligation for derivatives in europe the offering which may later be ex
tended to other asset classes is aimed primarily at institutional customers and their interest rate de
rivatives transactions interest rate swaps it focuses in particular on security and efficiency allowing

             customers to gain the full benefit of eurex clearings risk and collateral management services for their
             otc transactions as well by the end of 2014 the offering had 39 clearing participants and over 59
             registered clients such as fund management companies banks or insurance companies several delays

             in addition to growth in otc and unsecured markets the group is focusing on expanding its business in
             growth regions a particular emphasis is on asia where the group is already successfully represented by
             clearstream subsidiaries in particular among other things clearstream has operated a permanent estab
             lishment in singapore since 2009 which has its own banking licence the company expects further
             growth in the asiapacific region in areas such as collateral and liquidity management the group has
             already achieved initial successes in this area by connecting the australian stock exchange to the global
             liquidity hub and by signing a corresponding agreement with the singapore exchange sgx

             after successfully positioning clearstream in asia it is the groups declared aim to clearly increase the
             proportion of asian products and customers in other business areas as well in the medium term in the
             eurex segment the focus to date has been on product alliances and on connecting participants to the
             global network one example is the successful partnership eurex entered into with the korea exchange
             krx products based on south koreas benchmark kospi index have been traded on eurex since 2010
             the alliance launched with taifex the taiwan futures exchange in 2014 follows this example eurex
             acquired a 5 per cent interest in taifex in order to strengthen this strategic product partnership the
             eurextaifex link went live on 15 may 2014 the alliance allows eurex participants to trade and clear

china signed in march opened up new perspectives for the expansion of the china business the two
companies will develop the financial infrastructure needed to underpin further bilateral economic coop
eration and to support the internationalisation of the renminbi by promoting frankfurtmain as the euro
pean offshore centre for the chinese currency

as a major milestone in its asia strategy the group also plans to build a local clearing infrastructure for
the derivatives area in order to support the growth within the asian region in january 2015 deutsche
börse group received inprinciple regulatory clearance from the local financial supervisory authority to
set up a clearing house in singapore with the launch of the clearing house in asia which is planned for
2016 the trading hours at eurex zürich will be extended to allow trading participants in the asian time
zones to trade and clear derivatives via deutsche börse group in addition through its subsidiary eex
deutsche börse group acquired a majority interest in cleartrade exchange pte limited a singapore
based futures exchange at the beginning of 2014

market data and it
asia also offers growth opportunities for the market data  services segment the group is planning
further growth from distributing capital market data indices and technology solutions

shanghai stock exchange has been designated as the exclusive distributor and licensor for deutsche
börse market data products in mainland china while deutsche börse acts as the exclusive global licen
sor for the abovementioned cleartrade exchange moreover in august 2014 deutsche börse and phil

in europe a more global reach so that other indices can be developed and marketed worldwide along
side the dax and stoxx index families diversifying the range of indices aims to tap into new cus
tomer groups both within europe as well as in asia and america for this reason it has systematically
expanded its offering of indices on asian underlyings such as the stoxx china total market indices
and won further customers for its broad range of index products among other things stoxx expanded
its offering for chinese investors in 2014 july saw the launch of the huaan germany dax 30 etf the
first etf available in china to use a european index as its underlying

             in addition to these initiatives the group has identified a number of other structural factors that should
             have a positive impact on business success

              within the framework of the target2securities t2s project the european central bank ecb is
               planning the harmonisation of crossborder securities settlement in central bank money in europe for
               2015 clearstream took part in this initiative since an early stage and made considerable investments
               in the adaption of its systems to the new settlement structure clearstream will migrate to t2s in sep
               tember 2016 for clearstream t2s is an opportunity to expand its business with existing and new
               customers and consolidate its position as a leading provider of posttrade services in europe
              in january 2014 agreement was reached at a european level on the mifid ii directive among other


               things otc derivatives transactions will in future have to be settled via organised trading facilities a
               requirement that is expected to benefit eurex in addition it was resolved to limit the volume of equities

              risk management is becoming more important as a consequence of the financial crisis the company


               expects market participants to make greater use of eurex clearings clearing services to net out transac
               tions in different asset classes and hence to eliminate counterparty risk

              for clearstreams posttrade activities the company anticipates that in the long term companies will


               increasingly raise capital through equity and debt financing on the capital markets this is related to
               the higher capital and liquidity requirements for banks and the resulting negative impact on the total
               volume of available credit for clearstream this could have a positive effect on custody volumes

                                                         report on opportunities




    especially in the international bond segment in addition given the growing internationalisation of the
    capital markets the company is continuing to expect a sharper rise in the volume issued internationally
    compared with national bond issues

cyclical opportunities
in addition to structural growth opportunities deutsche börse group has cyclical opportunities for
instance as a result of positive macroeconomic development for example since the end of the third
quarter of 2014 there has been growing uncertainty regarding global economic performance as well
as another interest rate cut by the ecb as a result volatility on the stock and interest rate markets
has increased this resulted in a higher demand for hedging and in a significant increase in trading
volumes on regulated markets at the beginning of the fourth quarter although the company cannot
influence these cyclical opportunities directly they could lift deutsche börse groups net revenue and
consolidated net income significantly in the medium term

 in the cash and derivatives market segments xetra and eurex sustained positive economic develop
  ment an improvement in the situation of the southern eu member states a lasting rise in investor
  confidence in the capital markets and as a result a renewed rise in risk appetite among market partic
  ipants as well as a sustained increase in stock market volatility could stimulate trading activity by
  market participants and boost trading volumes for the year as a whole comparable to what occurred
  in the fourth quarter of 2014
 the volumes of interest rate derivatives traded on the groups derivatives markets could rise as a


  result of increasing speculation about trends in longterm interest rates for german and other euro
  pean government bonds if key interest rates actually rise and if the spread between the various
  european government bonds continues to narrow
 while the company does not expect the ecb to change its low interest rate policy during the forecast

  period the us federal reserve could start to incrementally raise interest rates in the second half of
  2015 this would among other things positively impact clearstreams net interest income as some
  40 per cent of its daily cash balances are denominated in us dollar considering all customer cash
  deposits raising key interest rates by one basis point could lead to an increase of income of some
  100 million
 in the posttrade segment clearstream a reduction in the liquidity supplied by the central banks could

  encourage bond issuance and lead to an increase in custody volumes moreover this could increase
  demand for clearstreams range of collateral and liquidity management services
 in the market data business an increase in the number of employees at companies active on the

  financial markets could lead to growing demand for data packages



external growth opportunities

in addition the company regularly explores external growth opportunities which are subjected to the
same kind of stringent analysis as its organic growth initiatives for this reason only a small number of
the opportunities analysed are ultimately realised examples of external growth in the past few years in
clude the takeover of the londonbased cloud services provider impendium systems ltd at the beginning
of 2014 and of citcos hedge fund business the acquisition of all the shares of eurex from six group ag
and of a majority interest in eex and powernext as well as the increased stake in the index provider
stoxx ltd deutsche börse group is also open to alliances and equity investments in asia  examples

178   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




             can be found in the eurex segment and clearstream segment sections in general however given
             that the company already offers a very comprehensive range of products and services along the entire
             value chain its focus is squarely on leveraging organic growth opportunities



             report on expected developments

             the report on expected developments describes how deutsche börse group is expected to perform in
             financial year 2015 it contains statements and information on events in the future and is based on
             the companys expectations and assumptions at the time of publication of this report in turn these are
             subject to known and unknown opportunities risks and uncertainties numerous factors influence the
             groups success its business strategy and financial results many of these factors are outside the com
             panys control should opportunities risks or uncertainties materialise or one of the assumptions made
             turn out to be incorrect the actual development of the group could deviate either positively or negatively
             from the expectations and assumptions contained in the forwardlooking statements and information
             contained in this report on expected developments



             development of the operating environment

             macroeconomic environment
             deutsche börse group anticipates that the global economy will grow moderately during the forecast period
             in the case of the emerging markets the group expects that countries with a current account surplus
             will expand at an aboveaverage rate moreover the group expects that economic growth in the indus
             trialised nations will also pick up again following a number of difficult years in the wake of the financial
             crisis in the usa there were already signs of a recovery in 2014 and this is expected to continue in
             2015 with respect to europe the group is also forecasting a slight improvement in the economic situa
             tion in particular because southern european countries such as italy or spain have returned to more
             significant growth or will no longer be in recession in 2015 in view of this essentially positive situation
             the company expects market participants to regain confidence in the capital markets however currently
             uncertain factors such as geopolitical crises or uncertainty about the credit quality and liquidity of indi
             vidual euro zone states for example greece as well as the monetary policy adopted by the central bank
             or a crisis of confidence in the currencies of certain emerging market countries could unsettle the mar
             kets again as regards interest rate trends the group does not expect to see any fundamental departure
             from the current low interest rate policy in europe moreover the ecb announced an extended bond
             buying programme in january 2015 to counter deflation risks in the euro zone this additional liquidity
             for the capital markets will cause interest rates to fall further or stabilise at a historically low level the
             additional liquidity should have a positive effect on the trading volumes on the cash and derivatives
             markets in contrast to europe market participants are expecting a reversal of interest rate policy to
             occur sooner in the usa this would in part benefit the net interest income from banking business
             generated by clearstream

             in its forecast of economic development for 2015 published in january 2015 the international mone
             tary fund imf predicts an increase of around 12 per cent in the euro zone and growth of around
             13 per cent in germany the insignificant difference between the euro zone and germany is a result of
             substantially stronger growth than in previous years in countries such as france italy and spain expec
             tations for the united kingdom and the united states are significantly higher than for the euro zone in

                                                         report on expected developments




2015 the economy is forecast to grow by around 27 per cent in the uk and by around 36 per cent in
the us the highest growth by far in 2015  approximately 64 per cent  is again expected in asian
countries and especially china in anticipation of high domestic demand given the extremely varied es
timates for the different economic regions global economic growth is projected to be around 35 per cent
in 2015

regulatory environment
governments and central banks are currently working on strengthening regulation of the financial
markets to further stabilise the financial sector and prevent future crises of the experienced degree of
severity the measures envisioned and in some cases already initiated range from revising the legal
framework for banking business and capital requirements through rules for clearing otc derivatives
transactions to improving financial market supervision for more information please see the regula
tory environment section of the report on the economic position for deutsche börse groups custom
ers the ultimate impact of these farreaching regulatory reform projects on market structures and busi
ness models is difficult to gauge accurately at present deutsche börse anticipates that this uncertainty
will continue to weigh on the business activities of market participants during the forecast period for the
group itself the different regulatory projects will have both positive and negative consequences overall
however the group sees the changing regulatory environment as an opportunity to expand its business
further see the report on opportunities for further details

in addition to the structural opportunities arising from regulation the group expects further debate in the
forecast period on the potential introduction of a financial transaction tax as well as on capital require
ments especially for clearing houses

the introduction of a financial transaction tax will continue to be pursued in 2015 by some member
states of the european union which have formed an alliance to achieve greater cooperation the intro
duction of such a tax would negatively impact deutsche börse groups business development since the
eleven participating member states have been unable to date to reach agreement on the tax base tax
rates and technical collection and remittance methods it is not possible to gauge the concrete impact on
the groups business

moreover from deutsche börse groups perspective the current debate on strengthening the equity base
of global systemically important banks and on adequate capital resources for clearing houses will not
have any material effect on the equity base of its regulated companies in the short term the companies
belonging to deutsche börse group already have comprehensive internally defined buffers and are plan
ning to address possible additional capital requirements resulting from the phased introduction of mod
erate new capital buffers



future development of results of operations

given its diversified business model and multiple sources of revenue deutsche börse group continues to
consider itself very well positioned and expects to see a positive trend in its results of operations in a me
dium and long term perspective this expectation is based on among other things the growth opportuni
ties that the company intends to exploit in the medium to long term see the report on opportunities
for further details the group expects net revenue to increase further in the forecast period this assump
tion is primarily based on three factors firstly cyclical conditions especially stock market volatility have
improved significantly since the end of the third quarter of 2014 and are having a positive effect on trad
ing volumes in equities and equity index derivatives secondly this assumption reflects an increase in

180   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




             net revenue of around 80 million as a result of the consolidation of citco global securities services ltd
             as at 3 october 2014 and of powernext sa as at 1 january 2015 and thirdly the group expects the
             contribution from its structural growth initiatives to rise further depending on the development of
             the operating environment the impact of both cyclical and structural growth drivers and the success
             of new products and functionality deutsche börse group expects net revenue to increase by approxi
             mately 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the medium term for 2015 net revenue is expected to increase
             to between 2100 million and 2300 million

             if contrary to expectations general conditions turn out to be worse than as described above or if cau
             tion persists among its customers especially those of the groups business areas that depend on trading
             the company believes it is nevertheless in a position to continue to do business profitably due to its suc
             cessful business model and its rigorous cost discipline

             the group will compensate for the expected inflationlinked cost increases after the forecast period
             thanks to the additional annual savings of 70 million until 2016 that were resolved in 2013 at the
             same time these provide the group with the freedom needed to continue its growth and infrastructure
             initiatives which it intends to use to take advantage of opportunities presented by the structural and
             regulatory changes on the financial markets and to harness the potential offered by growth markets such
             as asia the groups operating costs have been rising since 2011 primarily as a result of the increased
             level of investments as well as consolidation effects for 2015 the company expects additional operat
             ing costs of approximately 110 million this increase will primarily be driven by consolidation effects
             see above amounting to around 70 million but they will be offset by additional net revenue of
             80 million in addition there will be currency effects amounting to approximately 20 million because
             of the euros significant weakening against the us dollar and the swiss franc these currency effects are
             likewise offset by additional net revenue moreover the group continues to invest in structural growth
             and infrastructure aimed at among other things advancing the extension of collateral and liquidity
             management services the connection to target2securities and expansion in asia here the company
             anticipates an increase of about 20 million attributable firstly to higher investments and secondly to a
             yearonyear rise in depreciation and amortisation expenses due to initiatives already completed in total
             the company therefore expects operating costs of 1180 million in 2015 adjusted for special factors
             such as efficiency programmes as at the publication date of this combined management report the
             company is expecting that operating costs will be affected by special factors of some 30 million espe
             cially relating to costs for efficiency measures as well as mergers and acquisitions

             the expected increase in net revenue by approximately 5 per cent to 10 per cent and the planned in
             crease in operating costs would result in ebit adjusted for special factors of approximately 925 million
             to 1125 million the group anticipates an unchanged tax rate of approximately 26 per cent for the
             forecast period adjusted for any special factors consequently consolidated net income for the period
             would amount to approximately 625 million to 775 million adjusted for special factors in both cases

             the parent company deutsche börse ag has also considered in its planning the cyclical market envi
             ronment and structural growth opportunities which were described above for deutsche börse group
             for 2015 the company expects net revenue to be above the level of 2014 depending on how the fac
             tors described above will develop net revenue could amount to between 10 billion and 12 billion

taking into consideration this scope stable costs and growing dividend income the company expects
net profit for the year to reach approx 04 billion adjusted for exceptional items

eurex segment
in the past year the cyclical factors see the results of operations section for details led to an over
all decrease in derivatives trading volumes the sharp increase in stock market volatility since the end
of the third quarter resulted in a significant rise in trading volumes especially in equity index derivatives
in the fourth quarter of 2014 deutsche börse group believes that structural growth factors will remain
dominant over the long term and that they will positively influence trading volumes in all product seg
ments see the report on opportunities for further details but that in the short term the cyclically
positive business environment will also lead to an increase in trading volumes especially in the area
of equity index derivatives

eurex will continue to invest systematically in implementing its technology roadmap and expanding its
product offering in the forecast period the investment focus will still be on expanding risk management
for example the segment is planning a further expansion of its portfoliobased risk management activi
ties and of the functions used to segregate customer positions the product offering will also be extended
by providing clearing services for the securities lending market among other things these new features
are being implemented so as to further enhance the attractiveness of clearing services for otc deriva
tives trading from the customer perspective in the medium to long term the company expects this ini
tiative to deliver significant additional net revenue moreover the eurex segment is planning to establish
a new clearing house in singapore to give local market participants access to selected european bench
mark derivatives listed on eurex exchange during trading hours in asia since the regulatory require
ments to settle otc derivatives transactions via a central counterparty are only expected to finally enter
into force in the course of 2015 and the clearing house in asia is still in the setup phase the group
does not anticipate any material additional contribution to net revenue for 2015 from these investments
as for the cyclical business drivers in the eurex segment persistently high stock market volatility could
continue to have a positive effect on business activity stock market volatility at the level of the last
months before the publication of this report would have a significantly positive impact on trading in in
dex derivatives at the same time the extended programme of the ecb for purchasing government and
corporate bonds could have a negative effect on volatility on the interest rate market which could in
turn lead to a further decline in trading volumes in interest rate derivatives following the positive devel
opment of volumes traded on eex in the year under review and given the continuing positive market
environment for trading in power and gas products the group expects business activity to revive further
during the forecast period

xetra segment
as in the past net revenue in the xetra cash market segment will continue to depend on equity mar
ket trends and equity market volatility in the future but also on structural and cyclical changes in
trading activity similar to the previous year the first nine months of 2014 saw a significant level of cau
tion on the part of market participants but stock market volatility increased significantly at the end of
the third quarter which also pushed up trading volumes in the cash market in some cases significantly
so at the time of preparing this management report the company expects average stock market volatili
ty to be higher in 2015 than in the previous year in light of this a further yearonyear increase in net
revenue can be assumed for 2015 sustainable growth would in addition require a further improve
ment in investor confidence

             in addition to enhancing its cash market the company will continue to maintain a close watch on
             changes in the competitive environment for the european cash markets as in the past it considers it
             self well positioned to retain its status as the market leader for trading german blue chips and to offer
             its customers across the globe an attractive range of products and services for cash trading in german
             and european equities as well as equities clearing however due to the stronger competition in the
             cash market further shifts in the market shares of all competitors cannot be ruled out

             clearstream segment
             the clearstream segment generates its net revenue primarily from the settlement and custody of interna
             tional bonds  a business that is much more stable and only less subject to fluctuations on the capital
             markets than the trading business in light of regulatory requirements and the loss of confidence among
             market participants the group anticipates a structurally driven increase in demand for collateral and
             liquidity management services for this reason clearstream is systematically expanding its international
             global liquidity hub offering following the four central securities depositories and three custodian
             banks that had already connected to the global liquidity hub by the end of 2014 further connections
             are planned for the forecast period furthermore during the forecast period clearstream will make prepa
             rations for target2securities t2s the european central banks future central settlement platform in
             the medium to long term clearstream expects its attractive collateral and liquidity management and its
             strong position in the t2s network to result in increased business activity and consequently significant
             additional net revenue however since the new partners can only be connected consecutively and clear
             stream itself will only be connected to t2s in 2016 the group anticipates only a moderate contribution
             to net revenue for 2015 the monetary policy pursued by central banks in the forecast period will also
             have an impact on clearstreams business due to the extended programme for purchasing government
             and corporate bonds announced by the ecb in january 2015 transaction activity is expected to in
             crease in the medium term at the same time however this could have a dampening effect on securities
             issuance and liquidity management if contrary to expectations monetary policy becomes more restric
             tive this would have positive consequences for securities issuance the use of collateral and liquidity
             management services and net interest income in the banking business should the federal reserve
             initiate a reversal of interest rate policy in the usa in 2015 as expected by the capital markets this
             would already have a positive effect on net interest income in 2015 because a significant proportion of
             customer balances is denominated in us dollars

             with regard to its customer structure the company continues to expect that consolidation in the financial
             sector will persist and that customers in clearstreams domestic and international business will merge
             these larger customers would benefit from greater discounts which would lead to a decline in average
             fees although deutsche börse faces especially intense competition in the areas of the settlement and
             custody of international bonds the company does not expect this to have a major impact on its net rev
             enue or to result in a loss of market share during the forecast period

             market data  services segment
             the aim of the segment is to accelerate the expansion of deutsche börses technology leadership and
             expertise in the area of market data by pooling all the companys relevant resources in a dedicated mar
             ketdriven business unit this shall open up untapped growth opportunities in the medium to long term

                                                         report on expected developments




during the forecast period the company anticipates a slight increase in net revenue in the market data
 services segment this expectation is based on the continuous expansion of the product range in all
areas and greater marketing of these products in growth regions such a development should benefit the
groups index business in particular moreover given the significant structural growth in the market for
passively managed assets the group has identified an additional growth driver that is expected to fur
ther strengthen demand for index licences for exchangetraded funds in addition to the distribution of
index licences the group also participates in the growing investment volumes in these products in light
of this the group believes it is well placed to position its globally focused range of indices to an increas
ing extent in the asian market as well

development of pricing models
deutsche börse anticipates sustained price pressure in some of its business areas during the forecast
period the companys objective is to mitigate this price pressure by continually improving its products
and services and offering selective incentives for priceelastic business

over the long term the average net revenue per unit concerned eg trading or clearing fees per trans
action fees for custody services is expected to decline slightly in all areas of the group this is a result
of the laddered pricing models that lead to a decline in income per unit as customers business activities
increase



development of nonfinancial performance indicators

initiatives to promote the transparency and security of the markets will be a focus during the forecast
period ensuring deutsche börse groups value contribution to society to live up to this goal deutsche
börse will continue to expand its groupwide product and service offering in the area of market transpar
ency for example by adding indices developed and calculated by the group moreover the investments
in the trading and clearing infrastructure already made in 2014 as well as those planned for 2015 will
ensure that the systems meet global customer and market requirements against this background the
company anticipates that the availability of the different systems will be maintained at the very high level
of previous years throughout the forecast period

responsible management with a focus on longterm value creation is of considerable importance for
deutsche börse group as a service company in particular in view of demographic change and the
resulting shortage of specialist staff the company aims to continue to position itself adequately and
therefore intends among other things to increase the number of women in management positions the
german federal cabinet has adopted a draft act on the equal participation of women and men in
leadership positions in the private and public sectors which is expected to be passed into law shortly
the intention is that companies that are listed but not fully subject to codetermination such as
deutsche börse ag should set targets to increase the proportion of women on the supervisory board
the executive board and the two management levels below the executive board deutsche börse ag had
already set itself targets for increased participation of women in management positions in the past they
are published in the corporate governance report once the act has entered into force deutsche börse
ag will again address the issue of increasing the proportion of women and define targets in accordance
with the new legal requirements

             future development of the groups financial position

             the company expects operating cash flow which is deutsche börse groups primary funding instrument
             to remain clearly positive in the forecast period with regard to liquidity the group expects two signifi
             cant factors to influence its development firstly the company plans to invest 150 million per year in
             intangible assets and property plant and equipment on group level during the forecast period on a con
             solidated basis the investments will be reported as cash flows from investing activities and will serve
             primarily to develop new products and services in the eurex and clearstream segments and enhance ex
             isting ones the total mainly comprises investments in the trading infrastructure and risk management
             functionalities secondly the executive board and supervisory board of deutsche börse ag will propose
             to the annual general meeting to be held in may 2015 that a dividend of 210 per share should be
             paid this would correspond to a liquidity outflow of 3868 million apart from the above no further
             material factors were expected to impact on the groups liquidity at the time the management report was
             prepared as in previous years the group assumes a solid liquidity basis due to its positive cash flow
             adequate credit lines see note 36 to the consolidated financial statements for details as well as flexi
             ble management and planning systems

             under its capital management programme deutsche börse will react flexibly to a changing market
             environment in the forecast period both the general target dividend distribution ratio of 40 to 60 per
             cent of consolidated net income for the year and any share buybacks in addition are subject to capi
             tal requirements investment needs and general liquidity considerations

             to maintain its strong credit ratings at group level the company aims to achieve a ratio of interest
             bearing gross debt to ebitda of no more than 15 for 2015 the group expects a ratio of 15 or
             slightly less to be reached depending on how net revenue develops

             the parent company deutsche börse ag plans to invest some 50 million in intangible assets and
             property plant and equipment during the forecast period



             overall assessment by the executive board

             the executive board of deutsche börse ag believes that thanks to its comprehensive offering along
             the securities trading value chain and its innovative power the company remains in a very good position
             compared with the international competition and expects against this background to see a positive
             trend in its results of operations in the long term however for the forecast period the uncertainty about
             the behaviour of capital market participants in relation to economic and regulatory conditions and the
             announcement of an extended programme for purchasing government and corporate bonds make it diffi
             cult for the executive board to make a specific forecast by taking the additional efficiency measures re
             solved in 2013 the executive board has prepared the company at an early stage for the changing mar
             ket and will be able to compensate for the expected inflationlinked cost increases above and beyond the
             forecast period at the same time this means the executive board has provided the flexibility needed to
             continue the groups growth and infrastructure investments which it intends to use to take advantage of
             opportunities presented by the structural and regulatory changes on the financial markets and to harness
             the potential offered by growth markets such as asia primarily as a result of consolidation effects and
             investments the executive board expects operating costs after adjustments to increase in the forecast

period overall the executive board assumes on this basis that cash flow from operating activities will
be clearly positive and that as in previous years the liquidity basis will be solid the overall assessment
by the executive board is valid as of the time of publication of this combined management report



deutsche börse ag disclosures based on the hgb

in contrast to the consolidated financial statements the singleentity financial statements of deutsche
börse ag are not prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs but
in accordance with the handelsgesetzbuch hgb german commercial code and the supplementary
provisions of the aktiengesetz aktg german stock corporation act

since the exchange licences mentioned above have no time restricted validity and in addition there is
the intention to maintain the licences within the general business strategies an indefinite useful life is
assumed moreover it is assumed that the trade name of stoxx as well as certain registered trade
names of eex group have also an indefinite useful life these umbrella brands have a markedly degree
of recognition and are used within the operative business therefore there are no indications to a limited
useful life

repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred

if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with an item of property plant and equip
ment will flow to the group and the cost of the respective asset can be reliably determined expenditure
subsequent to acquisition is added to the carrying amount of the asset as incurred the carrying amounts
of the parts of the asset that have been replaced are derecognised



impairment losses on property plant and equipment and intangible assets

specific noncurrent nonfinancial assets are tested for impairment at each balance sheet date the group
assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired in this case the carrying
amount is compared with the recoverable amount the higher of value in use and fair value less costs
of disposal to determine the amount of any potential impairment

218   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




      the value in use is estimated on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows from contin
      uing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal before taxes for this purpose discount rates are es
      timated based on the prevailing pretax weighted average cost of capital if no recoverable amount can
      be determined for an asset it is allocated to a cashgenerating unit for which the recoverable amount is
      calculated

      irrespective of any indications of impairment intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible
      assets not yet available for use must be tested for impairment annually at least impairment tests are
      performed where there are indications of impairment if the estimated recoverable amount is lower than
      the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised and the net carrying amount of the asset is re
      duced to its estimated recoverable amount

      goodwill is allocated to identifiable groups of assets cashgenerating units or groups of cashgenerating
      units that create synergies from the respective acquisition this corresponds to the lowest level at which
      deutsche börse group monitors goodwill an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the
      cashgenerating unit to which goodwill is allocated including the carrying amount of this goodwill is
      higher than the recoverable amount of this group of assets the impairment loss is first allocated to the
      goodwill then to the other assets in proportion to their carrying amounts

      a review is conducted at every balance sheet date to see whether there is any indication that an impair
      ment loss recognised on noncurrent assets excluding goodwill in the previous years no longer applies
      if this is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased and the difference is recognised in profit
      or loss the maximum amount of this reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have resulted
      if no impairment loss had been recognised in previous periods impairment losses on goodwill are not
      reversed



      fair value measurement

      the fair value of a financial instrument is measured using quoted market prices if available if no quoted
      market prices are available observable market prices for example for interest rates or foreign exchange
      rates are used these observable market parameters are then used as inputs for financial valuation
      techniques eg option pricing models or discounted cash flow models in isolated instances fair value
      is determined exclusively on the basis of internal measurement models



      financial investments

      financial investments comprise investments in associates and joint ventures as well as financial assets

      investments in associates and joint ventures are measured at cost on initial recognition and accounted
      for using the equity method upon subsequent measurement

financial assets

for deutsche börse group financial assets are in particular other equity investments receivables and
securities from banking business other financial instruments and other loans financial instruments of
the central counterparties receivables and other assets as well as bank balances

recognition of financial assets
financial assets are recognised when a group company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument they are generally recognised at the trade date loans and receivables from banking
business availableforsale financial assets from banking business as well as purchases and sales of
equities via the central counterparty ie eurex clearing ag are recognised at the settlement date

financial assets are initially measured at fair value in the case of a financial asset that is not measured
at fair value through profit or loss in subsequent periods this includes transaction costs if they are set
tled within one year they are allocated to current assets all other financial assets are allocated to non
current assets

subsequent measurement of financial assets
subsequent measurement of financial instruments follows the categories which are described below as
in previous years deutsche börse group did not take advantage of the option to allocate financial assets
to the heldtomaturity investments category in the year under review in addition the group waived
the possibility to designate financial assets at fair value through profit and loss fair value option the
financial assets are allocated to the respective categories at initial recognition

assets held for trading
derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments as well as financial instruments of the
central counterparties are measured at fair value through profit or loss

if resulting from banking business realised and unrealised gains and losses are immediately recog
nised in the consolidated income statement as other operating income net interest income from
banking business and other operating expenses or if incurred outside the banking business as
financial income and financial expenses

loans and receivables
loans and receivables comprise in particular current and noncurrent receivables from banking business
trade receivables as well as other current receivables they are recognised at amortised cost taking into
account any potential impairment losses if applicable premiums and discounts are included in the
amortised cost of the instrument concerned and are amortised using the effective interest method they
are contained in net interest income from banking business if they relate to banking business or in
financial income and financial expense

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits as well as financial assets that
are readily convertible into cash they are subject to only minor changes in value cash and cash equiva
lents are measured at amortised cost

220   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




      restricted bank balances mainly include cash deposits by market participants which are invested largely
      overnight mainly in the form of reverse repurchase agreements with banks

      availableforsale financial assets
      nonderivative financial assets are classified as availableforsale financial assets if they cannot be
      allocated to the loans and receivables and assets held for trading categories these assets comprise
      debt and equity investments recognised in the other equity investments and other financial instruments
      items as well as debt instruments recognised in the current and noncurrent receivables and securities
      from banking business items

      availableforsale financial assets are generally measured at the fair value observable in an active market
      unrealised gains and losses are recognised directly in equity in the revaluation surplus impairment and
      effects of exchange rates on monetary items are excluded from this general rule they are recognised in
      profit or loss

      equity instruments for which no active market exists are measured on the basis of current comparable
      market transactions if these are available if an equity instrument is not traded in an active market and
      alternative valuation methods cannot be applied to that equity instrument it is measured at cost subject
      to an impairment test

      realised gains and losses are generally recognised under financial income or financial expense interest
      income in connection with debt instruments in the banking business is recognised in the consolidated
      income statement in net interest income from banking business based on the effective interest rate method
      other realised gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement in other operating
      income and other operating expenses

      if debt instruments in the banking business are hedged items in fair value hedges the changes in fair
      value resulting from the hedged risk are recognised in profit or loss

      derecognition of financial assets
      financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or when substan
      tially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred

      clearstream banking sa acts as principal in securities borrowing and lending transactions in the context
      of the aslplus securities lending system legally it operates between the lender and the borrower with
      out being an economic contracting partner transitory items in these transactions the securities borrowed
      and lent match each other consequently these transactions are not recognised in the consolidated bal
      ance sheet

      impairment of financial assets
      financial assets that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss are reviewed at each balance
      sheet date to establish whether there is any indication of impairment

      deutsche börse group has laid down criteria for assessing whether there is evidence of impairment
      these criteria primarily include significant financial difficulties on the part of the debtor and breaches of
      contract for equity instruments the assessment also takes into account the duration and the amount of

shares   services   2014   responsibility   governance   management report   financial statements   notes                  221
                                                                                                    basis of preparation




the impairment compared with cost if the decline in value amounts to at least 20 per cent of cost and
lasts for at least nine months or if the decline is at least 15 per cent of cost and lasts for at least six
months deutsche börse group takes this to be evidence of impairment an impairment might be trig
gered for debt instruments in case of a significant decline in the issuers credit worthiness

the amount of an impairment loss for a financial asset measured at amortised cost is the difference
between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the
original effective interest rate a subsequent reversal is recognised at a maximum at the carrying amount
that would have resulted if no impairment loss had been recognised

the amount of an impairment loss for a financial asset measured at cost nonlisted equity instruments
is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows
discounted at a current market interest rate subsequent reversal is not permitted

in the case of availableforsale financial assets the impairment loss is calculated as the difference be
tween cost and fair value any reduction in fair value already recognised in equity is reclassified to
profit or loss upon determination of the impairment loss a subsequent reversal may only be recognised
for debt instruments if the reason for the original impairment loss no longer applies



financial liabilities

financial liabilities relate primarily to interestbearing liabilities other liabilities liabilities from banking
business financial instruments of the central counterparties cash deposits by market participants as
well as trade payables they are recognised when a group company becomes a contracting party to the
instrument

they are generally recognised at the trade date purchases and sales of equities via the central counter
party eurex clearing ag are recognised at the settlement date

netting of financial assets and liabilities
financial assets and liabilities are offset and only the net amount is presented in the consolidated balance
sheet when a group company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts
and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously

financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit and loss
financial liabilities not held for trading are carried at amortised cost these liabilities comprise issued
bonds and private placements the borrowing costs associated with the placement of financial liabilities
are included in the carrying amount within the framework of the effective interest method if they are
directly attributable discounts reduce the carrying amount of liabilities and are amortised over the term
of the liabilities

financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss
a forward transaction with a noncontrolling shareholder for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests
that is settled in cash or by delivering other financial assets is a financial liability recognised at fair value

222   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




      it is subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss the equity interest attributable to a
      noncontrolling shareholder underlying the transaction is accounted for as if it had already been acquired
      at the time of the transaction



      derivatives and hedges

      derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk all derivatives are carried at their
      fair values

      hedge accounting is used for derivatives that are part of a hedging relationship determined to be highly
      effective and for which certain conditions are met this relates in particular to the documentation of the
      hedging relationship and the risk strategy and to how reliably the effectiveness can be measured

      cash flow hedges
      the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument determined to be highly effective is recognised
      directly in equity this gain or loss ultimately adjusts the value of the hedged cash flow ie the gain or
      loss from the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss when the hedged item is recognised in
      the balance sheet or in profit or loss the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately
      in the consolidated income statement

      fair value hedges
      the gain or loss on the hedging instrument together with the gain or loss on the hedged item underlying
      attributable to the hedged risk is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement any
      gain or loss on the hedged item adjusts its carrying amount

      hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
      the effective portion of the gain or loss from a hedging transaction that is designated as a highly effec
      tive hedge is recognised directly in equity it is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation is
      sold the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
      statement

      derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship
      gains or losses on derivative instruments that are not part of a highly effective hedging relationship are
      recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement



      financial instruments of the central counterparties

      european commodity clearing ag or eurex clearing ag act as the central counterparty in each case

       european commodity clearing ag guarantees the settlement of spot and derivatives transactions on
        european energy exchange ag and powernext sa
       eurex clearing ag guarantees the settlement of all transactions involving futures and options on the

        eurex exchanges eurex deutschland and eurex zürich ag it also guarantees the settlement of all

 and certain cash market transactions on the irish stock exchange eurex clearing ag also guarantees
 the settlement of offorder book trades entered for clearing in the trading systems of the eurex ex
 changes eurex bonds eurex repo the frankfurt stock exchange and the irish stock exchange in
 addition eurex clearing ag clears otc interest rate derivatives and securities lending transactions
 where these meet the specified novation criteria

these transactions of the two clearing houses are only executed between eurex clearing ag or european
commodity clearing ag and a clearing member

in accordance with ias 39 purchases and sales of equities and bonds via the central counterparty of
the eurex clearing ag are recognised and simultaneously derecognised at the settlement date

for products that are marked to market futures options on futures as well as otc interestrate deriva
tives the clearing houses recognise gains and losses on open positions of clearing members on each
exchange day by means of the variation margin profits and losses on open positions resulting from
market price fluctuations are settled on a daily basis the difference between this and other margin
types is that the variation margin does not comprise collateral but is a daily offsetting of profits and
losses in cash in accordance with ias 39 futures and otc interest rate derivatives are therefore not
reported in the consolidated balance sheet for futurestyle options the option premium is not required
to be paid in full until the end of the term or upon exercise option premiums are carried in the consoli
dated balance sheet as receivables and liabilities at their fair value on the trade date

traditional options for which the buyer must pay the option premium in full upon purchase are carried
in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value fixedincome bond forwards are recognised as deriva
tives and carried at fair value until the settlement date receivables and liabilities from repo transac
tions and from cashcollateralised securities lending transactions are classified as held for trading and
carried at fair value receivables and liabilities from variation margins and cash collateral that is deter
mined on the reporting date and only paid on the following day are carried at their nominal amount

the financial instruments of the central counterparties are reported as noncurrent if the remaining
maturity of the underlying transactions exceeds twelve months at the reporting date

the fair values recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are based on daily settlement prices
these are calculated and published by eurex clearing ag and european commoditiy clearing ag
in accordance with the rules set out in the contract specifications see also the clearing conditions
of eurex clearing ag and the clearing conditions of european commoditiy clearing ag



cash or securities collateral of the central counterparties

as eurex clearing ag and european commodity clearing ag guarantee the settlement of all traded con
tracts they have established multilevel collateral systems the central pillar of the collateral systems is
the determination of the overall risk per clearing member margin to be covered by cash or securities
collateral losses calculated on the basis of current prices and potential future price risks are covered up
to the date of the next collateral payment

224   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




      in addition to these daily collateral payments each clearing member must make contributions to the
      respective clearing fund for further details see the risk report in the combined management report
      cash collateral is reported in the consolidated balance sheet under cash deposits by market participants
      and the corresponding amounts under restricted bank balances

      in accordance with ias 3920 b in conjunction with ias 3937 securities collateral is not de
      recognised by the clearing member providing the collateral as the transfer of securities does not
      meet the conditions for derecognition



      treasury shares

      the treasury shares held by deutsche börse ag at the reporting date are deducted directly from share
      holders equity gains or losses on treasury shares are taken directly to equity the transaction costs
      directly attributable to the acquisition of treasury shares are accounted for as a deduction from share
      holders equity net of any related income tax benefit



      other current assets

      receivables and other assets are carried at their nominal amount adequate valuation allowances take
      account of identifiable risks



      noncurrent assets heldforsale

      noncurrent assets that are available for immediate sale in their present condition and whose sale is
      highly probable within a reasonable period of time are classified as noncurrent assets held for sale
      a transaction is highly probable if measures for the sale have already been initiated and the relevant
      bodies have adopted the corresponding resolutions



      pensions and other employee benefits

      pensions and other employee benefits relate to defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans

      defined contribution pension plans
      there are defined contribution plans as part of the occupational pension system via pension funds and
      similar pension institutions as well as on the basis of 401k plans in addition contributions are paid
      to the statutory pension insurance scheme the level of contributions is normally determined in relation
      to income on principle no provisions are recognised for defined contribution plans the contributions
      paid are reported as pension expenses in the year of payment

      there are defined contribution pension plans for employees working in germany luxembourg the
      czech republic the uk and the usa in addition the employer pays contributions to employees
      private pension funds

defined benefit plans
provisions for pension obligations are measured separately for each pension plan using the projected
unit credit method on the basis of actuarial reports the fair value of plan assets taking into account
the asset ceiling rules if there are any surplus plan assets is deducted from the present value of pension
obligations this results in the net defined benefit liability or asset net interest expense for the financial
year is calculated by applying the discount rate determined at the beginning of the financial year to the
net defined benefit liability determined as at that date

the relevant discount rate is determined by reference to the return on longterm corporate bonds with a
rating of at least aa moodys investors service standard  poors fitch ratings and dominion bond
rating service on the basis of the information provided by bloomberg and a maturity that corresponds
approximately to the maturity of the pension obligations moreover the bonds must be denominated
in the same currency as the underlying pension obligation measurement of the pension obligations in
euros is based on a discount rate of 215 per cent which is determined according to the towers watson
globalratelink methodology updated in line with the current market trend

actuarial gains or losses resulting from changes in expectations with regard to life expectancy pension
trends salary trends and the discount rate as compared with the estimate at the beginning of the period
or compared with the actual development during the period are recognised directly in other comprehen
sive income actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income may not be reclassi
fied to profit or loss in subsequent periods similarly differences between the interest income on plan
assets determined at the beginning of the period and the return on plan assets actually recorded at the
end of the period are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income the actuarial gains or
losses and the difference between the expected and the actual return or loss on plan assets are recog
nised as revaluation surplus

other longterm benefits for employees and members of executive boards total disability pension
transitional payments and surviving dependents pensions are also measured using the projected unit
credit method actuarial gains and losses and past service cost are recognised immediately and in full
through profit or loss



other provisions

provisions are recognised if the group has a present obligation from an event in the past an outflow of
resources with economic benefit to settle the obligation is probable and it is possible to reliably estimate
the amount of this obligation the amount of the provision corresponds to the best possible estimate of
the expense which is necessary to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date

a provision for restructuring is only recognised when an entity has a detailed formal plan for the re
structuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that the restructuring measures will be
implemented for example by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those
affected by it

contingent liabilities are not recognised but disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits is not remote

      sharebased payment

      deutsche börse group operates the group share plan the stock bonus plan sbp and the longterm
      sustainable instrument lsi which provide sharebased payment components for employees senior
      executives and executive board members

      group share plan
      under the group share plan shares are granted at a discount to the market price the expense of this
      discount is recognised in the income statement at the grant date

      stock bonus plan sbp
      the sbp shares are generally accounted for as sharebased payments for which deutsche börse ag has
      a choice of settlement in cash and equity instruments in the previous years a standard contract was
      drafted to settle the tranche due in the following year in cash under these circumstances there is at
      present a presumption in accordance with ifrs 2 that all sbp shares will be settled in cash accordingly
      deutsche börse group has measured the sbp shares as cashsettled sharebased payment transactions
      the cost of the options is estimated using an option pricing model fair value measurement and recog
      nised in staff costs in the consolidated income statement any right to payment of a stock bonus only vests
      after the expiration of the service or performance period of three or four years on which the plan is based

      a separate variable sharebased payment has been agreed for deutsche börse ags executive board
      since financial year 2010 the number of virtual shares for each executive board member is calculated
      on the basis of deutsche börse ags average share price in the two months preceding the point in time

      deferred tax assets and liabilities

      deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the balance sheet approach the deferred tax
      calculation is based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the tax accounts and
      the carrying amounts in the ifrs financial statements that lead to a future tax liability or benefit when
      assets are used or sold or liabilities are settled

      the deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are currently expected to apply
      when the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively

enacted by the reporting date deferred tax assets are recognised for the carryforward of unused tax
losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available deferred tax assets
and deferred tax liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities exists and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority



leases

leases are classified as operating leases or finance leases a lease is classified as a finance lease if it
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset from the lessor to the
lessee all other leases are classified as operating leases

leased assets and the associated liabilities are recognised at the lower of fair value and present value
of the minimum lease payments if the criteria for classification as a finance lease are met the leased
asset is depreciated or amortised using the straightline method over its useful life or the lease term if
shorter in subsequent periods the liability is measured using the effective interest method

expenses incurred in connection with operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straightline
basis over the lease term

ed in the consolidated financial statements deutsche börse group controls a company if it is exposed to
variable returns resulting from its involvement with the company in question or has rights to such returns

      currency translation

      transactions denominated in a currency other than a companys functional currency are translated into
      the functional currency at the spot exchange rate applicable at the transaction date at the balance sheet
      date monetary balance sheet items in foreign currency are measured at the exchange rate at the bal
      ance sheet date while nonmonetary balance sheet items recognised at historical cost are measured at
      the exchange rate on the transaction date nonmonetary balance sheet items measured at fair value
      are translated at the closing rate on the valuation date exchange rate differences are recorded as other
      operating income or expense in the period in which they arise unless the underlying transactions are
      hedged gains and losses from a monetary item that forms part of a net investment in a foreign opera
      tion are recognised directly in accumulated profit

      the annual financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated
      into the reporting currency as follows assets and liabilities are translated into euros at the closing rate
      the items in the consolidated income statement are translated at the average exchange rates for the
      period under review resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in accumulated profit
      when the relevant subsidiary is sold these exchange rate differences are recognised in consolidated
      profit for the period in which the deconsolidation gain or loss is realised

      any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carry
      ing amounts of assets and liabilities arising from initial consolidation are reported in the functional
      currency of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate



      key sources of estimation uncertainty and management judgements

      the application of accounting policies presentation of assets and liabilities and recognition of income
      and expenses requires the executive board to make certain judgements and estimates adjustments in
      this context are taken into account in the period the change was made as well as in subsequent periods
      where necessary

      impairment
      deutsche börse group tests goodwill as well as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment
      and intangible assets not yet available for use at least once a year certain assumptions have to be made

to determine the recoverable amount which is calculated regularly using discounted cash flow models
this is based on the relevant business plans with a time horizon of normally three to five years these
plans in turn contain projections of the future financial performance of the assets and cashgenerating
units if their actual financial performance fails to meet these expectations corresponding adjustments
may be necessary for further information on the effects of changes in the discount rate and further
assumptions please see note 11

pensions and other employee benefits
pensions and other employee benefits are measured using the projected unit credit method which
calculates the actuarial present value of the accumulated benefit obligation calculating the present
value requires certain actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate staff turnover rate salary and
pension trends to be made the current service cost and the net interest expense or income for the
subsequent period are calculated on the basis of these assumptions any departures from these as
sumptions for example because of changes in the macroeconomic environment are recognised in
other comprehensive income in the following financial year a sensitivity analysis of the key factors
is presented in note 22

income taxes
deutsche börse group is subject to the tax laws of those countries in which it operates and generates
income considerable management judgement has to be exercised in determining the tax provisions
for a large number of transactions and calculations no definitive taxrelevant information is available
at the time these figures are determined deutsche börse group recognises corresponding provisions
for risks expected from external tax audits if the final results of these external audits differ from the
estimates the resulting effects on current and deferred taxes are recognised in the period in which
they become known

legal risks
the companies of deutsche börse group are subject to litigation such litigation may lead to orders to
pay against the entities of the group if it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will occur a
provision will be recognised based on an estimate of the most probable amount necessary to settle the
obligation if such amount is reasonably estimable management judgement includes the determination
whether there is a possible obligation from past events the evaluation of the probability that an out
flow will occur and the estimation of the potential amount as the outcome of litigation is usually uncer
tain the judgement is reviewed continuously for further information on other risks please see note 37

group share plan stock bonus plan and longterm sustainable instrument
   note 39 contains disclosures on the valuation model used for the stock options where the estimates
of the valuation parameters originally applied differ from the actual values available when the options are
exercised adjustments are necessary such adjustments are recognised in the consolidated income
statement for the period if they relate to cashsettled sharebased payment transactions

provisions
in addition the probable utilisation applied when establishing provisions for expected losses from rental
agreements is estimated see note 24 in the creation of personnelrelated restructuring provisions
certain assumptions were made with regard to for example fluctuation rate discount rate and salary
trends should the actual values deviate from these assumptions adjustments may be necessary

      goodwill are intangible assets with an indefinite useful life the recoverable amounts of the cgus with
      allocated goodwill are based either on their values in use or on their fair value less costs of disposal
      depending on the respective unit only in cases in which one of these values value in use or fair value
      less costs of disposal does not exceed the carrying amount the respective other value is calculated
      since there is no active market for the cgus the discounted cash flow method is used to calculate both
      value in use and fair value less costs of disposal input factors are always such of level 3

      pricing trading volumes assets under custody market share assumptions or general business develop
      ment assumptions are based on past experience or market research other key assumptions are mainly
      based on external factors and generally correspond with internal management planning significant
      macroeconomic indicators include for instance equity index levels volatility of equity indices as well
      as interest rates exchange rates gdp growth unemployment levels and government debt when calcu
      lating value in use the projections are adjusted for the effects of future restructurings and expansion
      investments if appropriate

      the discount rate is based on a riskfree interest rate between 12 and 17 per cent 2013 25 and
      26 per cent and a market risk premium of 65 per cent 2013 65 per cent it is used to calculate
      individual discount rates for each cgu that reflect beta factors cost of debt and capital structure of the
      peer groups concerned

      each calculation of the sensitivities stated below is based on the adaption of a parameter discount rate
      the compound annual growth rate  cagr  of net revenue and operating costs and growth rate of a
      perpetual annuity by assuming that all other parameters in the evaluation model remain unchanged

following the authorisation of both eurex clearing ag 10 april 2014 and european commodity clear
ing ag 12 june 2014 as central counterparties under the provisions of regulation eu no 6482012
emir these companies are now also subject to the capital requirements under article 16 of emir
due to further authorisations in accordance with the kreditwesengesetz kwg german banking act
these requirements apply to eurex clearing ag in addition to the existing regulations for own funds re
quirements and the higher requirement has to be met in each case for european commodity clearing
ag on the other hand the emir requirements replace the existing requirements however since the
emir authorisation applies throughout the eu eurex clearing ag lost its status as a recognised over
seas clearing house roch in the united kingdom and the associated capital requirement ceased
to apply

the emir capital requirements for central counterparties are in large part based on the eu own funds
requirements for credit institutions see below but the detail differs both in relation to the capital com
ponents and the capital requirement components and capital deduction items moreover emir does
not specify any capital buffers such as those introduced by crd ivcrr for banks

since 1 january 2014 the capital requirements for credit institutions have been primarily subject to
the euwide requirements of regulation eu no 5752013 capital requirements regulation crr
as well as the supplementary national regulations implementing the eu capital requirements direc
tive 201336eu crd iv which implemented the socalled basel iii regulations into european law

260   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




      article 4 3 of the crr provides that in principle these requirements also apply to certain investment
      firms the way these provisions are formulated means that in principle the groups operators of a mul
      tilateral trading system  eurex repo gmbh and eurex bonds gmbh  are as investment firms also
      subject to the limited application of the crr however because of their business and the scope of the
      authorisation only certain requirements apply to them in germany yet the kwg prohibited the appli
      cation of these requirements until the finanzmarktanpassungsgesetz german financial market legisla
      tion amendments act entered into force since 1 august 2014 the abovementioned companies have
      been subject to the limited and specific capital adequacy requirements in accordance with article 95
      of the crr

      all companies that are subject to the crr capital requirements are nontradingbook institutions market
      price risk positions consist only of a relatively small open foreign currency position the companies con
      cerned uniformly apply the standardised approach for credit risk as a result of the specific business of
      the credit institutions belonging to the group their recognised assets are subject to sharp fluctuations
      this leads to correspondingly volatile solvency ratios at the clearstream companies the volatility of the
      ratio is subject to major fluctuations on a daytoday basis in the course of the year due to a high de
      gree of collateralised or zeroweighted cash investments the capital requirements for credit and market
      price risks of eurex clearing ag and european commodity clearing ag are relatively stable despite vola
      tile total assets in the course of the year the changes in the regulatory framework for banks basel iii
      doddfrank act emir led to a significant increase in the cash collateral deposited by clearing partici
      pants of eurex clearing ag in 2014 amid sharp fluctuations in combination with volatile markets and
      the regulationinduced segregation of client collateral from the clearing participants own collateral this
      led to greater fluctuation in capital requirements for credit risk at eurex clearing ag

      to calculate the operational risk charge eurex clearing ag and european commodity clearing ag
      use the basic indicator approach while the clearstream companies apply the advanced measurement
      approach ama

      due to the specific arrangements for the two investment firms eurex repo gmbh and eurex bonds
      gmbh no explicit own funds requirements for operational risk are determined in accordance with
      article 95 of the crr instead the total own funds requirement is determined on the basis of the
      higher capital requirement amount for credit and market price risk on the one hand and 25 per cent
      of fixed overheads on the other since the credit and market price risks are low the relevant criterion
      for both companies is the capital requirement on the basis of fixed costs

      since the profit participation rights issued by clearstream banking sa in the past were converted into
      share capital and reserves in 2014 none of the group companies subject to solvency supervision has
      material tier 2 regulatory capital

      a minimum solvency ratio of 8 per cent applies in principle to the credit institutions subject to the
      crr all credit institutions and groups currently regulated under the crr clearstream banking sa
      clearstream banking ag the clearstream holding group and eurex clearing ag have been designated
      as systemically important as a result cssf increased the minimum own funds requirements for
      clearstream banking sa to a core tier 1 ratio of 9 per cent in 2013 since 2014 cssf has imposed
      a standard capital conservation buffer of 25 per cent of common equity on all luxembourgian credit
      institutions this arrangement represents a departure from the transitional provisions of crd iv this
      means that the minimum solvency ratio is 105 per cent in return the previous higher core tier 1 ratio
      no longer applies to clearstream banking sa crd iv introduced various capital buffers which the
      supervised credit institutions generally have to meet over and above the minimum solvency ratio of

8 per cent although they may temporarily fall below these levels these buffers are being introduced in
stages depending on the economic environment and systemic risk components apart from the buffer
imposed by cssf on all luxembourgian credit institutions the groups regulated companies were not
subject to any crd iv capital buffers in 2014

the individual companies capital resources sufficiently reflect the fluctuation in riskweighted assets
stress considerations are used to determine the capital required for expected peaks and additional re
serves for unexpected events are added in addition buffers are taken into account that cover the recov
ery indicators specified in the recovery plans and thus prevent recovery scenarios from being triggered
even for peak own funds and capital requirements the own funds and capital requirements determined
in this way will be met on the basis of mediumterm capital planning as the actual own funds and
capital requirements are below the expected peaks  significantly so under normal circumstances  this
may lead to a very high solvency ratio or emir capital cover especially at the closing date

the capital requirements of the clearstream companies rose slightly in the year under review this was
mainly driven by further increases in capital requirements for operational risk combined with simultane
ously lowered capital requirements for credit and market price risk the increased capital requirements
for operational risk are in turn largely the result of annually updated risk scenarios and in particular
further refinements of the risk scenarios for legal and compliance risks which reflect the increased expo
sure in this area in the banking sector moreover the updated risk allocation led to increased capital
requirements for operational risk at clearstream banking ag while the corresponding capital charge at
clearstream banking sa has declined slightly as a result of regulatory changes introduction of the
liquidity coverage ratio as well as amended large exposure rules clearstream banking ags euro and
us dollardenominated cash investment receivables from clearstream banking sa are largely invested
on a collateralised basis this has led to a significant reduction in capital requirements for credit risk at
clearstream banking ag due to closing date effects customer balances especially those denominated
in us dollars and euros declined significantly compared with the end of 2012 resulting in lower bal
ances on the nostro accounts and consequently lower capital requirements for credit risk

the clearstream holding group already responded to the increased own funds requirements in the past
by launching a programme to strengthen its capital base this programme continued in 2014 further
measures are planned for the coming years in the context of mediumterm capital planning in 2014
the groups capital base was boosted by retaining profits especially at clearstream banking sa and
clearstream international sa the capital base of clearstream banking sa was strengthened by con
verting the existing profit participation capital into share capital and reserves and by making further
additional contributions to reserves in 2014 the acquisition of citcos hedge fund settlement business
had a negative impact on the capital base of both the group and clearstream banking sa because large
amounts of intangible assets were acquired in the process the capital base of clearstream banking ag
was increased through contributions to reserves in spite of the increased capital requirements these
capitalisation measures currently ensure solvency ratios of more than 20 per cent

in the medium to long term the clearstream holding group expects a moderate increase in own funds
requirements to arise at supervisory group level from the crd iv capital buffers which are being in
creased in stages the designation as systemically important institutions and the future csd regulation
the following factors may lead to additional capital requirements in the future

      eurex clearing ags own funds requirements rose only slightly compared with the previous year mainly
      as a result of a slight structural increase in own funds requirements for credit and market price risk and
      a slight reduction in own funds requirements in relation to operational risk

      eurex clearing ags internal risk model assumes higher capital requirements for operational risk than
      does the accountingbased basic indicator approach in accordance with regulatory requirements for this
      reason eurex clearing ag has always maintained a capital buffer for these types of risk over and above
      the minimum regulatory requirements in light of this the banking supervisory authorities encouraged
      eurex clearing ag in 2011 to expand the basis for calculating its regulatory capital requirements to
      include an adequate clearing portion of the fees collected for the account of the operating companies
      the capital requirements for operational risk are calculated once a year on the basis of a threeyear
      average of historical income including the assumed clearing fees and are therefore not subject to daily
      fluctuations compliance with the minimum supervisory ratio is maintained at all times due to the suffi
      cient capital buffer for uncollateralised cash investments

      eurex clearing ag increased its capital base significantly in 20132014 in anticipation of the emir
      authorisation and added another 40 million after the authorisation had been granted for this reason
      eurex clearing ag does not currently expect the crd iv capital buffers to have any material impact on
      its capital requirements independently of this the capital resources of eurex clearing ag are reviewed
      on an ongoing basis and monitored as part of mediumterm capital planning further gradual contribu
      tions to capital are planned for the coming years

the capital requirements under article 16 of emir do not stipulate a specific ratio instead the total
amount of share capital retained earnings and reserves less certain items including the central coun
terpartys own contribution to the default fund is compared with the capital requirements this total
has to be at least equal to these requirements in other words emir requires a capital cover of at least
100 per cent a reporting requirement to the competent authority  in this case bafin  is triggered
when this ratio falls below 110 per cent

the capital resources of european commodity clearing ag are currently well above the regulatory re
quirements similar to the other companies its capital resources are reviewed on an ongoing basis
depending on future business performance and in particular on changes in the regulatory framework
the capital resources may be adjusted although there are no plans for this at present

the capital requirements for deutsche börse groups two investment firms first entered into force in 2014

the capitalisation of eurex bonds gmbh significantly exceeded the crr requirements due to the profits
expected to be retained in future the capital resources of eurex bonds gmbh will increase gradually in

264   deutsche börse group corporate report 2014




      the coming years however if costs remain more or less stable and the capital requirements for credit
      and market price risk are low the capital requirements are expected to remain virtually unchanged

      since eurex repo gmbh transfers its earnings to eurex frankfurt ag under a profit and loss transfer
      agreement there was no need in the past to maintain a strong capital base the implementation of the
      crr requirements for eurex repo gmbh therefore required a contribution to the share premium account

      as at 31 december 2014 plan assets included no financial instruments of the group 2013
      01 million they did not include any property occupied or other assets used by the group

      risks
      in addition to the general actuarial risks the risks associated with the defined benefit obligations relate
      especially to financial risks in connection with the plan assets including in particular counterparty credit
      and market price risks



      market price risk
      the return on plan assets is assumed to be the discount rate determined on the basis of corporate bonds
      with an aa rating if the actual rate of return on plan assets is lower than the discount rate used the net
      defined benefit liability increases accordingly at a lower volatility the actual return is further expected to
      exceed the return on corporate bonds with a good credit in the medium to long term

deutsche börse group considers the share price risk resulting from the equity ratio of the plan assets
to be appropriate the company bases its assessment on the expectation that the overall volume of pay
ments from the pension plans will be manageable in the next few years that the total amount of the
obligations will also be manageable and that it will be able to meet these payments in full from operating
cash flows any amendments to the investment policy take into account the duration of the pension
obligation as well as the expected payments over a period of ten years

moreover the level of the net liability is influenced by the discount rates in particular whereby the cur
rent low interest rates contribute to a relatively high net liability a continued decline in returns on corpo
rate bonds will lead to a further increase in defined benefit obligations which can be only partially offset
by the positive development of the fair values of the corporate bonds included in the plan assets

inflation risk
possible inflation risks that could lead to an increase in defined benefit obligations exist because some
pension plans or the annual capital components are directly related to the salaries ie a significant
increase in salaries would lead to an increase in the benefit obligation from the plans in germany
however there are no contractual arrangements with regard to inflation risk for these pension plans
an interest rate of 6 per cent pa has been agreed for the employeefinanced deferred compensation
plan the plan does not include any arrangements for inflation so that it has to be assumed that there
will be little incentive for employees to contribute to the deferred compensation plan in times of rising
inflation

in luxembourg salaries are adjusted for the effects of inflation on the basis of a consumer price index
no more than once a year this adjustment leads to a corresponding increase in the benefit obligation
from the pension plan since the obligation will be met in the form of a capital payment there will be
no inflationlinked effects once the beneficiary reaches retirement age

in switzerland the benefit plans at axa stiftung berufliche vorsorge and prevas sammelstiftung include
the provision that the board of the foundation decides annually whether the retirement pensions will
be adjusted to price trends the decision takes into account in particular the financial capability of the
foundation there are no arrangements for automatic adjustments to price increases over and above
the legal requirements that apply to certain surviving dependants and disability pensions

      in the course of 2014 transfers were made between levels 2 and 3 in the other equity investments
      item since no inputs for level 2 were directly or indirectly observable as at the balance sheet date these
      equity investments had a carrying amount of 56 million

      the value of the equity investments listed in level 3 is subjected to an annual review by the issuer
      and transactions initiated by the issuer may ensue in this process in the reporting period such trans
      actions provided information on the fair values of the equity instruments leading to unrealised gains of
      10 million they are reported in the revaluation surplus

      the fair value of the contingent purchase price components reported under other noncurrent liabilities
      is firstly attributable to the acquisition of impendium systems ltd the fair value of the purchase price
      component amounted to 66 million as at the acquisition date in the course of 2014 expenses
      of 07 million were recognised in the financial result secondly the fair value includes a revenue
      dependent purchase price component from the acquisition of cleartrade exchange uk limited in the
      amount of 18 million the measurement of this component in the course of the financial year did
      not lead to any material effects being recognised in profit or loss these two purchase price components
      are measured on the basis of internal discounted cash flow models which discount the expected future
      payment obligations to the measurement date using interest rates that are appropriate to the risk

additionally derivatives from an incentive programme with a carrying amount of 61 million were
allocated to level 3 as at the beginning of the year under review at the end of the financial year these
derivatives had a carrying value of 59 million the financial instruments were regularly measured at
fair value through profit and loss using an internal model as at the quarterly balance sheet dates in the
course of the reporting period the subsequent measurement of these financial instruments led to gains
of 04 million and expenses of 02 million these amounts are reported under other operating income
and other operating expenses the model takes into account the criteria underlying the conditional repay
ment of the grant made by eurex clearing ag the criteria include in particular nonfinancial indicators
such as the expected number of customers in a specific market segment as well as expected trading
volumes they are continuously monitored while taking into account possible adjustments in order to
do this customer information is also used since this is an internal model the parameters can differ
from those of the settlement date however the derivative financial instrument will not exceed an
amount of 70 million this amount arises if the beneficiaries of the incentive programme fulfil the
conditions and a repayment of the contribution is not taken into consideration

the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value is determined as follows

the euro and us dollar bonds issued by deutsche börse group have a fair value of 16884 million
31 december 2013 15518 million and are reported under interestbearing as well as current
liabilities the fair value of the euro bonds in the amount of 12849 million is calculated on the
basis of the quoted values of the bonds and the fair value of the us dollar bonds in the amount of
4035 million represents the present value of the cash flows relating to the private placements on
the basis of market inputs consequently the euro bonds are allocated to level 2 and the us dollar
bonds to level 3

  basis and which are reported under the financial assets item these are carried at cost less any im

      in contrast to the riskoriented net analysis of the transactions via the central counterparties the gross
      amounts are reported in the balance sheet as the offsetting rules defined in ias 32 cannot be met for
      a detailed explanation of this balance sheet item see financial instruments of the central counter
      parties section in note 3 or note 15 for an analysis of the carrying amount see note 15

      credit risk concentrations
      deutsche börse groups business model and the resulting business relationships with a large part of
      the financial sector mean that as a rule credit risk is concentrated on the financial services sector
      potential concentrations of credit risk on individual counterparties are limited by application of counter
      party credit limits

      the regulatory requirements on concentration risks and so called large exposures such as those arising
      from articles 387410 of regulation eu 5752013 crr and article 47 paragraph 8 of regulation
      eu 6482012 emir are in general complied with

      see also     note 20 for an explanation of regulatory capital requirements

      deutsche börse group carries out var calculations in order to detect credit concentration risks in 2014
      no significant credit concentrations were assessed

      the required economic capital for credit risk is calculated for each business day and amounted to
      374 million as at 31 december 2014 2013 311 million



      market price risk

      as part of the annual planning the treasury policy of deutsche börse group requires that any net earn
      ings exposure from currencies be hedged through foreign exchange transactions if the unhedged expo
      sure of an individual currency exceeds 10 per cent of consolidated ebit foreign exchange exposures
      below 10 per cent of consolidated ebit may also be hedged

      during the year the above matter is being monitored against the latest ebit forecast

      in addition the policy stipulates that intraperiod open net foreign exchange positions are closed when
      they exceed 150 million this policy was complied with as in the previous year as at 31 decem
      ber 2014 there were no significant net foreign exchange positions

      currency risks in the group arise mainly from the operating results and balance sheet items of ise
      which are denominated in us dollars plus that part of clearstreams sales revenue and interest income
      less expenses which is directly or indirectly generated in us dollars as at 31 december 2014 ise
      accounted for 25 per cent of the eurex segments sales revenue 2013 26 per cent in addition the
      clearstream segment generated 9 per cent of its sales revenue and interest income 2013 9 per cent
      directly or indirectly in us dollars

acquisitions where payment of the purchase price results in material currency risk are generally hedged

the group has partially hedged its investment in ise against foreign currency risks by issuing fixed
income us dollar debt securities the investment in ise hedged item constitutes a net investment in
a foreign operation the us dollar securities designated as hedging instruments for the net investment
hedge were issued in a nominal amount of us4600 million

interest rate risks arise further from debt financing of acquisitions the acquisition of ise was financed
through senior and hybrid debt that matured or has been called in 2013

to refinance 2013 debt maturities deutsche börse ag in october 2012 and march 2013 successfully
issued senior bonds in an amount of 600 million each

equity price risks arise from contractual trust arrangements ctas and from the clearstream pension
fund in luxembourg in addition there are equity price risks arising from strategic equity investments
in other exchange operators

economic capital is calculated at the end of each month for market price risks that can arise in connec
tion with cash investments or borrowing as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange
rates as well as through fluctuations of the asset value of the cta and the clearstream pension fund in
luxembourg on 31 december 2014 the economic capital for market price risk was 37 million 2013
77 million the decrease is mainly driven by the adjusted concept in the cta the group has decided
to let the cta fund be conducted on an established capital protection concept in order to reduce the
market price risk

in financial year 2014 impairment losses amounting to 39 million 2013 16 million were recog
nised in profit and loss for strategic investments that are not included in the var for market price risk



liquidity risk

for the group liquidity risk may arise from potential difficulties in renewing maturing financing such
as commercial paper and bilateral and syndicated credit facilities in addition required financing for
unexpected events may result in a liquidity risk most of the groups cash investments are shortterm
to ensure that liquidity is available should such a financing need arise eurex clearing ag remains
almost perfectly matched with respect to the durations of received customer cash margins and invest
ments which in only limited amounts may have tenors of up to one month while the clearstream sub
group may invest customer balances up to a maximum of one year under strict control of mismatch
and interest rate limits see note 31 for an overview of the maturity structure term investments can
be transacted via reverse repurchase agreements against highly liquid collateral that can be deposited
with the central bank and can be used as a liquidity buffer in case of need

other litigation and liability risks

contingent liabilities may result from present obligations and from possible obligations from events in the
past deutsche börse group recognises provisions for the possible incurrence of losses only if there is a
present obligation from an event in the past which is likely to cause an outflow of resources and if it is
possible to reliably estimate the amount of such obligation see also note 3 in order to determine for
which proceedings the possibility of incurring a loss is more than unlikely as well as how the possible
loss is estimated deutsche börse group takes into account a multitude of factors including the nature
of the claim and the facts on which it is based the jurisdiction and course of the individual proceedings
the experience of deutsche börse group prior settlement talks as far as have already taken place as
well as reports and evaluations of legal advisors however it is possible that a reliable estimate for a
given proceedings could not be determined before the release of the consolidated financial statements
and that  as a result  no provisions are recognised

      recognises provisions for litigation and regulatory matters when it has a present obligation from an event
      in the past an outflow of resources with economic benefit to settle the obligation is probable and it is

      a litigation or regulatory matter develops deutsche börse group evaluates on an ongoing basis whether

      stock bonus plan sbp

      in the year under review the company established an additional tranche of the sbp in order to partici
      pate in the sbp a beneficiary must have earned a bonus the number of stock options for senior execu
      tives is determined by the amount of the individual and performancebased sbp bonus for the financial
      year divided by the average share price xetra closing price of deutsche börse ags shares in the
      fourth quarter of the financial year in question neither the converted sbp bonus nor the stock options will
      be paid at the time the bonus is determined rather the entitlement is generally received two or three
      years after having been granted socalled waiting period within this period beneficiaries cannot assert
      shareholder rights in particular the right to receive dividends and attend the annual general meeting
      once they have met the condition of service the beneficiaries claims resulting from the sbp are cal
      culated on the first trading day following the last day of the waiting period the current market price
      at that date closing auction price of deutsche börse share in electronic trading on the frankfurt stock
      exchange is multiplied by the number of sbp shares

      a new sbp programme was launched in april 2013 for members of the executive board of eurex
      clearing ag this programme has a threeyear waiting period from the grant date this sbp tranche
      is measured using the same parameters as the share bonus plan for senior executives

      for the stock bonus of senior executives under the 2012 to 2014 tranches deutsche börse ag has an
      option whether to settle a beneficiarys claim in cash or shares the company settled the 2012 tranche
      claims in cash in february 2015 a cash settlement obligation exists for claims relating to the stock
      bonus of the executive board since the 2010 tranche and the stock plan for the executive board mem
      bers of the clearstream companies since the 2011 tranche

      since 1 january 2010 a different method has been applied to calculate the number of stock options for
      members of the executive board of deutsche börse ag the method is described below

      to calculate the number of stock options for executive board members under a sbp tranche the super
      visory board defines the 100 per cent stock bonus target in euros for each executive board member

at the beginning of each financial year based on the 100 per cent stock bonus target defined by the
supervisory board at the beginning of each financial year the corresponding number of virtual shares
for each executive board member is calculated by dividing the stock bonus target by the average
share price xetra closing price of deutsche börse ags shares in the two calendar months preceding
the month in which the supervisory board adopts the resolution on the stock bonus target any right
to payment of a stock bonus vests only after a performance period of three years the year in which
the 100 per cent stock bonus target is defined is taken to be the first performance year

the calculation of the subsequent payout amount of the stock bonus for the executive board depends
on the development of two performance factors during the performance period firstly on the relative
performance of the total shareholder return tsr on deutsche börse ags shares compared with the
total shareholder return of the stoxx europe 600 financials index as the peer group and secondly on
the performance of deutsche börse ags share price this is multiplied by the number of virtual shares
at the end of the performance period to determine the stock bonus the share price used to calculate
the cash payment claims of executive board members from the stock bonus is calculated as the average
price of deutsche börse ags shares xetra closing price in the two full calendar months preceding the
end of the performance period



stock plan

on 20 april 2009 the luxembourgian commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf pub
lished a circular on remuneration policies in the banking sector that addresses key aspects of remunera
tion practices for sustainable corporate governance and supports their implementation in banking institu
tions daytoday operations according to this circular every banking institution is required to introduce
a remuneration policy that is in harmony with its business strategy and corporate goals and values as
well as the longterm interests of the financial enterprise its customers and investors and which mini
mises the institutions risk position clearstream companies in luxembourg have therefore revised their
remuneration system for executive boards in line with the circular and introduced a socalled stock plan
the stock plan stipulates the allocation of a stock bonus at the end of each financial year which will be
paid in three tranches of equal size with maturities of one two or three years after the grant date claims
under the stock plan have to be cashsettled if the performance targets already agreed in the year in
which the targets were specified are met irrespective of any condition of service

the number of stock options under the stock plan is determined by the amount of the individual per
formancebased bonus established for each executive board member divided by the average market
price xetra closing price for deutsche börse ag shares in the fourth quarter of the financial year in
question as the contracts require the stock bonus to be exercised gradually it is divided into three sepa
rate tranches which are measured according to their respective residual term using the corresponding
parameters of the stock bonus plan for senior executives this programme ended with the financial
year 2013

longterm sustainable instrument lsi

as at 1 january 2014 deutsche börse group has introduced another sharebased payment programme
the programme meets the requirements of regulation eu no 5752013 of the european parliament
and of the council of 26 june 2013 this regulation had been implemented through the amendments
to the supervisory requirements for the remuneration systems of institutions laid down in the institutsver
gütungsverordnung institutsvergv german remuneration regulation for institutions effective 16 de
cember 2013 and translated into german law with the kreditwesengesetz kwg german banking act
the aim of this regulation is to align the corporate goals even more closely with remuneration especially
in the banking sector and thus to ensure the goals are more sustainable

the remuneration model requires that at least half of the variable remuneration is settled in cash and
half in shares of deutsche börse ag lsi shares a portion of the variable remuneration is paid in the
subsequent year and another portion over a further period of three or four years

the number of lsi shares is calculated by dividing the proportionate lsi bonus of the respective year by
the average closing price of deutsche börse ag shares in the last month of a financial year this results
in individual lsi tranches for the lsi bonus which have maturities of between one and up to five years
payment of each tranche is made after a vesting period of one year the remuneration system does not
stipulate any condition of service following the expiry of the vesting period the lsi shares are meas
ured on the basis of the average closing price of deutsche börse ag shares in the last month preceding
the end of the vesting period settlement is generally made in cash although the employer has the right
to settle by delivering deutsche börse ag shares

in accordance with ifrs 2 the company uses an adjusted blackscholes model merton model to
calculate the fair value of the lsi shares
