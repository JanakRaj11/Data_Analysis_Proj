                   letter from the regional vice president canada

                   our sustainability program continued its growth in 2015 building on the
                   foundation that was developed in previous years we achieved great progress
                   in all aspects of our business and sustainability continues to be an important
                   part of our overall growth strategy

                   this year we proudly introduced the industryleading green product
                   classification system in canada the shades of green were developed
                   by our parent corporation office depot inc and adopted by grand  toy
                   we launched a dedicated go green product search page on the
                   grand  toy website in addition to the new greenerofficetm page
                   that addresses environmentally conscious purchasing practices

                   we also launched an employee volunteer program called pause and affect
                   that provides the opportunity for our associates to dedicate eight hours each
                   year to the community initiative of their choice with over 500 volunteer hours
                   recorded in 2015 i believe that we have made a real difference in our communities

                   to improve our waste and recycling practices we expanded our partnership with
                   terracycle canada from a pilot project to a national program with the addition of
                   new recycling options for other categories office supplies personal protective
                   equipment and breakroom supplies

                   it is my intention to keep expanding our program and to continue to improve our
                   environmental and social practices in the years to follow we will maintain focus on
                   our existing initiatives and introduce new innovative solutions addressing important
                   areas of sustainability such as packaging transportation and energy conservation
