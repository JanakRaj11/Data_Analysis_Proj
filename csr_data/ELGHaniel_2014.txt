          dear reader


          not long ago elg celebrated its 50th anniversary as we
     deemed appropriate we held the celebrations near our corporate
     roots in the heart of the ruhr area in duisburg germany we wel
     comed as participants not only our employees but also representa
     tives of several of our valued customers and suppliers colleagues
     from our shareholder haniel and delegates from many of our
     other trusted business partners
          when i initiated the compilation of this sustainability report
     and learned of the methods the report was going to be designed by
     i was pleased to note that at the core of it stands the stakeholder
     dialogue as our understanding of success is based on continuity
     and relationship building we are constantly engaged in a dialogue
     with the partners we have achieved success with and may do in the
     future this is not only because many of them have recently been
     our guests at the anniversary celebrations instead it is our experi
     ence that longterm business success can only grow further with
     solid relationships on the one hand and communication channels
     that are as lively and open as possible on the other

     in the course of the development of this report we added to
this principle and conducted a formalized dialogue on sustainability
to learn more about the expectations of our stakeholders in this
regard it provided great insight into how congruent our own focus
in this respect is with the perception of elg by our shareholder our
customers our suppliers and our financial partners in particular the
views and input of our employees served as a valuable indicator as
to where we stand and what issues we may put even more focus on
     we at elg have always strived to improve constantly in many
aspects of our business in this endeavor the following report marks
the beginning of an intensified exchange on how sustainability at
elg is being practiced it has already proven to be a reminder for
us to regularly question explain and discuss what we sometimes
take for granted in order to continuously evolve further
     i invite you to read and comprehend our view on sustain
ability and to feed back to us what you have to add to this
understanding
