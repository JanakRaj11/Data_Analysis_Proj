ensuring consistency in quality and performance




technical innovation presents a constant challenge in the engineering field metitos board
of directors in uae and overseas stress on the assurance of consistency in quality and
performance with a focus on continuously meeting and exceeding customer expectations
through weekly sales and operations meetings monthly gms meetings and board meetings
four times a year only by keeping abreast of current literature attending courses and
carrying out inhouse training seminars and workshops are metitos engineers able to keep
up with the latest changes in technologies so as to utilize them in presenting our clients
with the most advanced treatment systems to suit the various special applications




wwwmetitocom                                                                           12

risk management

from time to time the water industry is faced with unexpected issues such as

    payment risk
    construction risk
    operating risk
    market risk
    political risk
    financial risk
    legal risk
    structural risk

   in any of these cases metito acts swiftly to take action as risks are very well analyzed
   and allocated to the party best able to manage them




                             our risk analysis chart


 carries the concept of reducing risk to alarp  as low as
 reasonably possible level




   unacceptable region                                  risk cannot be justified except in
                                                        extraordinary circumstances


    the alarp or                                        tolerable only if further risk reduction is
                                                        impracticable or if its cost is grossly
    tolerable region                                    disproportionate to the improvement gained



                                                        as the risk is reduced the less proportionately
                                                        it is necessary to spend to reduce it further the
      risk is taken only if a                           concept of diminishing proportion is shown by
      benefit is desired                                the triangle


   broadly acceptable region                            necessary to maintain assurance that risk
   no need for detailed working to                     remains at this level
   demonstrate alarp



                                      negligible risk




wwwmetitocom                                                                                               13

          b environmental and social responsibility




water conservation

water scarcity is a major issue we are facing in at the present time and the worlds
demand for water is constantly escalating most of the water on earth is not easily
available knowing that only 3 percent of the water on earth is fresh water and only 79
percent is trapped in glaciers metito takes action to conserve water in every aspect of its
business and maintain its quality for today and the future




wwwmetitocom                                                                                 14

we relentlessly strive to conserve water in all our business practices therefore we have
applied techniques and new systems at our office and factory sites which include the
following processes outcomes

      water efficient landscaping greater than 50 water savings species selection and
       microclimate factors efficient drip technology and treated water usage
      innovative waste water technologies 100 water recycling via onsite black water
       treatment facility
      water use reduction usage of highefficiency plumbing and water reuse reduce
       potable water demand by over 74



paper recycling

paper and packaging make up huge proportions of most municipal and commercial waste
streams and as a result millions of tons of paper are produced each year
recycling has always been a critical part of our vision for a healthy global environment and
substantial economic development benefits consequently we have implemented the
following
 eliminating reducing and reusing paper in all our office applications
 installing recyclable containers in all our offices to dispose our waste paper for recycling
 designing our business cards using recycled paper




since the beginning of 2008 we have collected over 3600 tons of paper to be recycled
from our offices in uae qatar and indonesia


wwwmetitocom                                                                                15

plastic reuse

plastic is made from oil a fossil fuel that will eventually run out it is essential to make use
of materials like plastics that can be recycled and reused rather than continuously
exploiting the fossil fuels used to make them in the first place

at metito we consume 200 to 300 plastic  high density polyethylene hdpe  containers
of 1 m3 capacity for all our chemical production as a result we ensure continuously reusing
the containers for the same purpose rather than disposing them

community awareness

student education activities

the future of our natural environment is in the hands of our youth the overwhelming value
to educate students on the importance of our natural resources and how to take care of
them is quite vital and will definitely have an impact on societies

at metito we strive to implement student education activities which involve organizing site
visits to our plants explaining the process of recycling in an abstract way and the
importance of conserving water as it is a scarce resource




wwwmetitocom                                                                                 16

reducing ewastes

 many types of electronic products used in the workplace and residences contain hazardous
substances like lead and mercury in general hazardous wastes may not be discarded in
the regular trash instead it must be sent to a facility that has a permit for treatment
including recycling storage or disposal therefore we have managed reducing ewastes
as part of our environmentally friendly activities and are continuously involved in donating
our damaged and used computers to the pc refurbished center built by the dubai
municipality this year we have managed to collect and donate a total of 35 oldused
electronics which will be aimed for spreading the culture of technology training unemployed
uae nationals and those who want to upgrade their computer skills protecting the
environment and different segments of the society and helping all government and non
government institutions to have a sufficient number of personal computers for their various
uses

climate change

the future of our planet is threatened by the potential disruptive changes in the earths
climate which is caused by global warming one of the attributes to global warming is the
emission of gases such as co2 which forms a blanket over the earth and traps the heat that
would normally escape into the atmosphere

energy efficiency

through the use of the national standards provided by the leed we have an aim to
improve occupant wellbeing environmental performance economic returns of buildings
using established and innovative practices standards and technologies we have
successfully achieved those standards and largely helped raise the profile of metito as an
environmental company in all its activities and operations such standards include



wwwmetitocom                                                                               17

   1 optimized energy performance a design whereby 37 more efficient energy than
      901  1999 contributes towards sustainability reduced operating costs and carbon
      footprint this is achieved by the selection of passive cooling features such as
      building orientation massing glazing thermal insulation and day lighting coupled
      with energy efficient lighting fixtures energy efficient hvac system and smart
      controls
   2 ozone protection hcfc free and hvacr and fire fighting
   3 reduced site disturbance ample vegetated open space encompassing 880 different
      plants making up an area of 16096 sqm consequently we have joined the emirates
      environmental group in pledging to plant 1 million trees in the uae in support of the
      uneps 1 billion tree campaign
   4 indoor environmental quality selection of low voc containing compounds
      construction process iaq management and co2 monitoring

humanitarian support

blood donation




with natural disasters accidents new medical procedures and operations on the rise the
reliance on blood donation is dramatically increasing
we at metito believe that initiatives like ours can greatly impact a service that can affect
everyone thus we annually arrange for a blood donation vehicle to set up its services
within the car park of our office buildings providing the opportunity for our staff as well as
others to give blood over124 staff members donated blood this year in the blood donation
campaign we organized at our offices in indonesia and uae

communication and employee recognition




   we at metito believe that communication is a vital element of the people strategy
   thus we encourage regular open communications on performance between individuals
   with clear objectives whereby all staff members will be expected to speak with their
   respective line managers on at least a weekly basis through a performance appraisal
   system where communication between the employee and manager stresses to

      review work performance
      identify area requiring improvement
      explore strengths weaknesses and career aspirations
