measures to save electricity                                          at large through vending machines besides power saving mr
    the catalyst was the power shortage resulting from the             tabata adds the cocacola system has already incorporated a
great east japan earthquake and associated accident at the             wide range of initiatives including showing information on digital
fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant following a request            displays in times of disaster offering beverages inside vending
from the japanese government the area serviced by the tokyo           machines covered by disaster relief pacts for free in the event
electric power company tepco went into full powersaving             of a major earthquake and affixing address labels to vending
mode vending machines were up against the tide of public             machines with the help of the police to allow identification of a
opinion at the time some customers who had installed our             place if an incident or accident occurs vending machines are
vending machines were asking us to turn off the machines out of        no longer just machines for buying a beverage now they are
consideration for consumers                                          also tools providing information and safety we are extremely
    the cocacola system had been working to enhance the               pleased about this too
environmental friendliness of vending machines even prior to
the disaster for example by introducing a peaktime energy
reduction function that shut cooling off during hours of peak
power usage and through improvements to the properties of              as leading soft drink manufacturer the
machine materials but given the circumstances bottling partners      cocacola system must propose
advanced an additional measurerolling suspension of vending
machine cooling functions between 9 am to 8 pmto reduce           energyefficient selling methods and
power consumption over the summer period when power usage             possess a mindset of contributing to

people within the cocacola system did not fully understand the          everyone understood that wasteful use of electricity wasnt
difference between electric power the amount of electricity and       acceptable as environmental concerns have been voiced
the cost of electricity to be able to explain to customers and       over many years but the experience of the great east japan
have them cooperate with rolling suspension of cooling unified        earthquake really brought it home more than two years on
knowledge and information was required inhouse                       from the disaster it might be expected that such awareness
    cocacola central japan serves a broad area encompassing           would wane but japan as a nation is starting to take the view
kanagawa shizuoka yamanashi aichi gifu and mie prefectures         that powersaving efforts are required as a matter of course
and the initial reception to powersaving efforts was very different   and that means we will be called upon to put forward selling
in areas serviced by tepco and those that were not cross to          methods that do not waste electricity
the other side of the oi river and the response was completely            mr tabata closes by saying it is important to continue using
different ours was a companywide effort and we proposed rolling      a variety of opportunities to raise awareness in society the
suspension of cooling for all areas                                  cocacola system is japans leading soft drink manufacturer
    as a result rolling suspension of cooling for some 55000         and operates the most vending machines and because of that
vending machines in the sales territories of cocacola central         we need to act based on a mindset of contributing to the local
japan began on july 1 2011 in kanagawa and yamanashi                 community and society at large not just selling beverages i
prefectures customer cooperation was almost 100                     believe this is the approach of the entire cocacola system the
    with only about a months preparation we wouldnt have           crucial element here is continuity

customers and the cohesion of the cocacola system i believe

   as a mediumterm target the cocacola system aims to
achieve by 2015 a 5 reduction in co2 emissions from 2004             our mission
in distribution and transportation measures include improving             in order to contribute to the establishment of a recycling
efficiency in distribution for procurement and sales through            oriented society the cocacola system maintains a waste
consolidation of distribution points and revision of distribution       management policy by which it minimizes the use of ingredients
routes modal shift promotion of ecodriving practices through the     throughout its business reuses materials wherever possible
use of digital tachographs and drive recorders and driving courses     and recycles postconsumer containers into resources with the

vehicles were being used across the cocacola system                   by our business activities to comply with laws and regulations
   as a result of these initiatives co2 emissions at the end of 2012   as well as the cocacola systems kore management system
were 230000 tons a 276 reduction from 2004                         requirements

   in addition to a mediumterm target to reduce co2 emissions             the cocacola system in japan has continually worked to
from sales operations 455 by 2015 compared to 2004 the               recycle solid waste produced by our plants in order to achieve
cocacola system in japan has set a goal of making all vending          a zero waste goal for plants in particular coffee grounds and

   as part of those efforts all new can and pet bottle vending         are 100 recycled for uses such as livestock feed and agricultural
