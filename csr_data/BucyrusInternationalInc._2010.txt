q  a with executive sponsor



what prompted bucyrus to publish this inaugural gribased sustainability report

in my role as a senior executive at bucyrus i spend a lot of time with many of our stakeholders specifically
our customers who have operations throughout the southern hemisphere through these interactions
it has become clear that taking an active role in sustainable development is critical to bucyrus and to
the communities around us as the largest supplier of equipment to the mining industry i realize the
time has come to take a hard look at the many initiatives we have underway and to formally commit to
a systematic approach to sustainability at bucyrus

being a dependable partner is about relationships that require not just meeting stakeholder expectations
but exceeding them it is clear we have work to do it is also apparent that if one of our key stakeholders
holds this expectation of bucyrus and our commitment to sustainability there would be others with the
same concern both inside and outside the organization with the firm support of our ceo tim sullivan
we have taken our first step and adopted the gri framework to guide us as we move forward

describe the primary goals of bucyrus sustainable development program

our overarching goal is to incorporate sustainability into the daytoday operations at bucyrus it is not a
project or a shortterm commitment sustainable development is one voice one attitude toward doing
what it takes to have a positive lasting effect on our world

safety comes first and one of our primary goals is to ensure a zero harm work environment for all
our employees whether they work at bucyrus facilities or at customers sites bucyrus embraces its
responsibility to provide a safe workplace and teach safe behaviors and we expect our employees to do
their part to protect themselves and their coworkers

combined with safety is our continued commitment to do business as good environmental stewards
we cant just think about what is happening today and its impact today we have to always be
thinking about what we are doing today and how it will impact today tomorrow and the day after this
requires modifying behaviors at all levels of the organization we are constantly looking for ways to
reduce waste and we realize there is more we can do

finally bucyrus is committed to supporting the communities where we do business this is an area where
we are extending our client partnerships beyond business to include community development and
educational initiatives together we have a much greater impact we can do more though and we will
implementing a comprehensive sustainability program will help us do that

how has the commitment to economic environmental and social sustainability aﬀected bucyrus
business model

our commitment to sustainable development has challenged us to look at our business from a
different perspective we have always done our work with integrity and while we have incorporated
elements of sustainability along the way we were not systematic in measuring or reporting our
impact with the implementation of the gri reporting framework we are addressing this shortfall

it is clear to us that the path to growth is through investing in and focusing on sustainability today you
cannot have one without the other our experience has shown us the return on efforts to safeguard
the environment give back to local communities and invest in our workforce has been overwhelmingly
positive reinforcing the value of building sustainability into our corporate strategy

as you look to the future what do you consider are the main challenges facing bucyrus sustainable
development program

bucyrus operates across the globe we recently acquired a major mining equipment manufacturer that
has added to our reach our main challenge regarding sustainability is to unify the distinct efforts of our
operations under one umbrella and then drive internal commitment across all segments

committing to sustainable practices and reporting on them may seem like a daunting task
what advice would you share with your peers who are contemplating taking this important step

sustainability reporting is about transparencyputting yourself out there and making the
commitment to get better one step at a time my advice is to think about what you can do to move
from good to great ask the questions set benchmarks and commit to changing attitudes



collectively the future depends on our ability to do the right thing todaythe right thing for the people
the planet and the economic prosperity around the world this is our responsibility and bucyrus
will deliver

               11     statement from the most senior decisionmaker of the organization about the
                       relevance of sustainability to the organization and its strategy


               at bucyrus sustainability is about developing and implementing a business model that creates
               economic prosperity and longterm growth while having a positive impact on the environment
               deploying this model through our employees and business partners drives sustainability beyond
               bucyrus and into the communities in which we live and operate see page 5 for a complete statement
               from our ceo

               12     description of key impacts risks and opportunities


              over the last five years bucyrus has continued to grow as an organization generating record revenue
               and steady employment levels around the world this growth is expected to continue as we have
                    committed to strategically align ourselves to become the premier equipment supplier to the
                       mining industry with this growth comes responsibility the commitment to grow has a direct
                           impact on economic prosperity through employment workforce development and the
the commitment to              funding that goes back into the communities in which we live and operate
grow has a direct impact
on economic prosperity              the primary risk of this economic impact is growing faster internally than the market
through employment                   demands as exciting as it is to generate new jobs and provide opportunities for
workforce development and              employment the devastation of job elimination far outweighs the excitement
the funding that goes back into           it is our responsibility to effectively manage our business to maximize our
the communities in which we live            ability to serve our customers while keeping our costs in line with demand
and operate                                 generating the greatest return for our stakeholders

                                   on february 19 2010 bucyrus completed the acquisition of the mining business
                          of terex corporation broadening the product portfolio to include hydraulic excavators off
               highway haul trucks highwall miners and drills which are complementary to bucyrus existing
               product lines in addition to significantly expanding its product portfolio the results
               of the acquisition include several potential risks including those inherent to              we view the synergy
               integrating an extant business the financial considerations relating to the merger     of the two events as a
               and the potential of unknown liabilities additional compliance and employment          unique opportunity to
               obligations                                                                              launch a new chapter
                                                                                                        at bucyrus
               while the growth bucyrus has experienced recently brings risks it also brings
               opportunities in the form of enhanced economic performance that will ultimately
               permit for larger investments in corporatewide sustainable development in fact
               we view the synergy of the two events  the acquisition of additional facilities and the
               adoption of the gribased sustainability reporting framework  as a unique opportunity to
               launch a new chapter at bucyrus one that commits to social environmental and economic
               sustainability

bucyrus sustainability vision is to have a positive lasting effect on our world we will achieve this
through supporting the communities in which we live and operate improving environmental and safety
performance and creating longterm sustainable economic growth

in developing bucyrus sustainability strategy materiality was divided into three areas people planet
and prosperity see profile disclosure 48 for further definitions of each area when prioritizing our
focus on sustainability we start with people it is through people that change takes place and best
practices are identified developed and modeled when narrowing the focus even further our top
priority is the safety of our employees both on the job and off if we are unable to provide a safe work
environment and promote safe practices within our daily responsibilities our ability to change things for
the better is greatly impacted by placing the human element of our organization first we drive the right
behaviors that leave a positive impact on our planet and generate prosperity for generations to come

the process for creating the 2009 sustainability report began as an initiative chaired by shelley
hickman director of global communications with executive sponsorship provided by marcus berto

36      boundary of the report

bucyrus has made a concerted effort to report on the social environmental and economic impact of
its global operations including all divisions subsidiaries and countries in which it operates please see
profile disclosures 25 and 26 for more information on our facilities and subsidiaries


37      state any specific limitations on the scope or boundary of the report


during the information gathering phase for this inaugural report it became clear that there was
considerable variation in quality and completeness of the environmental data that was submitted by
our subsidiaries around the world when addressing manufacturing facilities as compared to repair
centers as compared to sales and service centers thus a decision was made to report environmental
performance indicators for our manufacturing facilities and the majority of our repair centers since
these were considered to be the most material and they were the sites that had the most accurate
data regarding environmental indicators all other indicators reflect our global operations and any
limitations to the dataset are clearly indicated


38      basis for reporting on joint ventures subsidiaries leased facilities
         outsourced operations and other entities

given the acquisition of the mining business of terex corporation in early 2010 bucyrus anticipates
that our next sustainability report will include additional facilities and approximately 2000 additional
employees which will undoubtedly impact the comparability of the current and future reports


39      data measurement techniques and the bases of calculations

data for this report was compiled from various bucyrus departments specific to the performance
indicator

                                    the exalon idler roll is produced in daphne alabama exalon rolls are made from a proprietary
             on sustainability

                                    to produce the exalon roll bucyrus relies on a lean manufacturing system that reduces waste throughout
                                    the production process in 2009 the daphne plant produced over 300000 pounds of exalon of
                                    this approximately 9 was not immediately used in ﬁnished rolls eg drop trimmings etc part
                                    of this material was available for reuse by regrinding and reblending for future production of
                                    nonconductive exalon rolls of the 28000 pounds dropped 53 was used to manufacture rolls that
                                    conformed to the highest standards of quality and performance
                                    by adopting this manufacturing method bucyrus conserves the energy that would have been used
                                    to produce more raw material in addition to decreasing the amount of wasted raw materials

the experience of compiling this inaugural sustainability report has been an enlightening
one for bucyrus it has provided us with an opportunity to systematically evaluate our
attitudes and actions related to sustainability and while we feel we are moving in the
right direction as a company we recognize that we have a series of challenges facing us
including incorporating further sustainable principles into the core of our business model
such as embracing stakeholder engagement and enhancing manufacturing efficiencies

the next step is to define and then use a set of measurable goals that will move us closer
to where we want to be as a company regarding sustainability we intend to dedicate
staff time and company leadership toward this end and we look forward to reporting on
our progress in our next sustainability report

bucyrus began a systematic approach to addressing the environmental impacts of
its global operations and in particular the activities of its manufacturing and repair
facilities this inaugural sustainability report is part of that effort a global
environmental health and safety system is currently in place to track and monitor
variables related to energy and water use as well as waste production and disposal
at manufacturing sites our goal is to expand our environmental reporting to all
bucyrus facilities and to include additional factors such as green building standards and
recycling efforts

we recognize that environmental conservation is directly impacted good and bad
by the decisions we make every day we are at the beginning of a long journey as a
company to effectively implement change that will have a lasting positive impact on the
environment around us

en28       monetary value of significant fines and total number of nonmonetary sanctions for
           noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations


       bucyrus operations and properties are subject to a broad range of federal state local and foreign laws and
       regulations relating to environmental matters including laws and regulations governing discharges into the
       air and water the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes and the remediation
       of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at the companys facilities and at offsite
       disposal locations these laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent
       over time

       certain environmental laws such as the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation
       and liability act cercla provide for strict joint and severe liability for investigation and remediation of
       spills and other releases of hazardous substances such laws may apply to conditions at properties currently
       or formerly owned or operated by an entity or its predecessors as well as to conditions at properties at which
       wastes or other contamination attributable to an entity or its predecessors come to be located

       bucyrus has previously been named as a potentially responsible party under cercla and analogous state
       laws at sites throughout the united states the company believes it has determined its remediation liabilities
       with respect to the sites discussed above and does not believe that such remaining liabilities if any either
       individually or in the aggregate are significant andor material at this time

       environmental problems have not interfered in any material respect with bucyrus manufacturing operations
       to date the company has an ongoing program to address potential environmental problems and over the
       past three years expenditures for ongoing compliance remediation monitoring and cleanup have been
       immaterial

what we looked at scope of our work
bucyrus international inc has engaged isos group to give assurance on the quality and extent of profile disclosures disclosures of
management approach and performance indicators noted in their inaugural report this assurance applies to the report based on
the 2009 calendar year made public in july of 2010 the verification statement will be made public and submitted to the global
reporting initiative in october 2010 it does not extend to events occurring prior to or after the 2009 reporting cycle

the scope of the assurance covers the economic social and environmental performance data both quantitatively and qualitatively
expressed on behalf of bucyrus internationals headquarters and subsidiaries this assurance exercise has been conducted by
verifying report content and supporting documentation made available during the external assurance period september 20 
october 20 2010 the scope of the assurance does not include observational analysis as a component of onsite visits but rather a
strict emphasis on the reliability and quality of report content in addition to verification of data sources and collection processes

the external assurance statement the associated assessment and this summary are to be used at the discretion of the company it is
the companys decision to implement suggestions made by isos group in future reporting cycles

our methodology basis of our work and level of assurance
isos group administered the assurance process for bucyrus international through its experts who followed the g3 framework
established by the global reporting initiatives g3 guidelines and principles for defining report content and ensuring the quality of
the reported information while integrating independently developed tools for verification and elements from the global compact
dow jones sustainability index and the iso 14000 series

this external assurance exercise consists of four main tasks and one supplemental performance results are determined by isos
groups evaluation of reported information corporate policies driving organizational change data justifications supplied by key
personnel stakeholder feedback and controversies reported by external parties which are all weighted and scored

an acceptable score indicated by a 50 threshold is needed from the four main tasks in order to issue a  level although only
twenty material indicators are required for a gri b level report this external assurance statement is based on the results of a
comprehensive verification of all reported indicators

what we did key assurance procedures
isos group administered the assurance process for bucyrus international through its experts who followed the g3 framework
established by the global reporting initiatives g3 guidelines and principles for defining report content and ensuring the quality of
the reported information while integrating independently developed tools for verification and elements from the global compact
dow jones sustainability index and the iso 14000 series

our findings were supported by conducting

     an inspection of the documentation used for gathering analyzing and aggregating the material quantitative data
     investigation of procedures for determining material inclusiveness via random sampling and interviews and
     inquiries of the central unit responsible for preparing the report as well as a select group of internal and external stakeholders

what we found our assurance opinion
in isos groups opinion the bucyrus 2009 sustainability report is a fair representation of the companys sustainabilityrelated
strategies management systems and performance the report along with referenced material in the 10k information posted on the
company website and supplemental documentation supplied to isos meet the general content and quality requirements of the gri
g3 framework
                                        2009 bucyrus sustainability report         page 63

we have evaluated the reports ability to address specific criteria within the following main tasks on a scale of good acceptable
fair and needs improvement
   content alignment  credibility check good bucyrus international has accurately referenced the reported indicators in the
       gri content index it is also apparent that the companys organizational structure fully supports sustainability related
       activities just as the mission and vision have secured the foundation needed for the sustainability reporting process
       statements from the ceo and the executive sponsor validate the companys understood risks and opportunities to integrate
       sound strategies for sustainable development into business ethics at all locations continuing to reach out to communities and
       formalizing interaction will further strengthen the materiality of issues reported by the company in the future

     quantitative review acceptable 20 sample indicators we believe that all data included in the report is accurate and that
      the company has structured internal policies that will foster more effective data tracking systems suitable for expanding the
      sustainability program our opinion is based upon careful analysis and verification of supplemental documentation requested
      by isos this task could have resulted in a better reflection of the companys activities if material issues related to goals and
      unforeseen impacts would have correlated with year to year regional andor industry averages as points of comparison the
      environment plays a critical role in sustainability and within the context of bucyrus internationals industry therefore the
      company could become a leader in this arena through incremental steps made towards further expansion into this dimension
      of sustainability

     qualitative review good when considering the reporting boundary and material issues identified by bucyrus international
      we do not believe that the report misrepresents significant economic environmental and social impacts or omits relevant
      information that would influence stakeholder decisions as a firsttime reporter the company should be commended for their
      efforts to apply gris content and quality principles improvements to future reporting cycles can be made by highlighting
      measurement techniques and illustrating points of comparison in order to showcase true performance on an annual basis

     sustainability balance acceptable the company was found to be consistent with their management approach responsive
      to priority issues expressed by supply chain partners and aware of their current sustainability context the companys ultimate
      commitment to people whether employees customers or others within the communities they operate in is evident
      ensuring social codes related to human rights have proven successful in minimizing risks to the company a supportive
      governance structure has elevated the companys strategic objectives to include a wide range of sustainability issues further
      demonstrating environmental protection policies will only work to benefit the company and those that are influenced by it
