shareholders letter


2013 was a year of transition for leoni in 2013  after three years of growth in succession  we again gen
erated a sales increase of nearly 3 percent to  392 billion thereby exceeding our original expectations by
contrast operating profit was at a total of  163 million noticeably below the targeted figure of  170 million
given the difficult economic conditions in europe and the large number of forwardlooking measures that
leoni launched in 2013 it is nevertheless reasonable to describe this as satisfactory performance
     thanks to good automotive business in china and north america from which the exportheavyweight
german manufacturers also benefited worldwide demand from the car industry increased further despite                 dr klaus probst

weak business in europe this more than compensated for the sales decline in our industrial business which is
still mostly based in europe
     at the same time we invested in leonis future during this transition year the wiring systems division
prepared for a large number of new product startups and model changeovers which consequently incurred
substantial preproduction spending on development and capacity expansion in the wire  cable solutions
division we forged ahead further with the internationalisation of our business and initiated a range of impor
tant efficiency enhancement measures in addition there were necessary restructuring measures at facilities
of both divisions within and outside germany which also weighed on our earnings we were nonetheless able
to report a solid consolidated net profit of  106 million in keeping with the dividend policy that we have ap
plied over many years namely of paying out about one third the management board and supervisory board
will propose a dividend of  100 per share to shareholders at the annual general meeting
     the unfavourable economic setting in europe just as the extensive preproduction spending and measures
for future growth confronted our staff with major challenges that they again mastered with flying colours in
2013 leoni employed about 62000 people worldwide at the end of the year on behalf of the management
board i thank all staff for their strong performance and their great commitment
     alongside our daytoday business we also in the past year launched numerous strategic projects to
enhance our global position capacity to innovate systems expertise and efficiency which will underpin our
success in the years ahead

   for instance in line with our objective to globalise further the wire  cable solutions division in 2013
     opened its first production facility in india from which it will initially supply the automotive and petro
     chemical industries in this region with cables and conductors capacity to produce automotive cables in
     china and mexico was also extended further the wiring systems division boosted its global production
     network with a new plant in northern china as well as with targeted expansion of facilities in mexico and in
     the significant production region of eastern europe we furthermore successfully completed the turna
     round of our subsidiary lws korea

                         we also proved our ability to innovate in 2013  above all with optimised wiring system architectures as
                           well as new insulation and conductor materials for automotive and industrial cables which take into ac
                           count not only cost factors but increasingly also environmental aspects the number of patents and utility
                           models registered in the past year was up by more than 60 percent on the previous year

                         with the revised organisational structure of the wiring systems division which focuses the wiring systems
                           business even more sharply on our customers we improved our position for future growth

                         in both of our divisions as well as in the group holding company we are currently working on several
                           projects to further enhance our efficiency for example optimising business processes and it systems in the
                           wire  cable solutions division as well as standardising our most important hr processes worldwide


                      solid financial foundations underpin the leoni groups preparations for future growth leoni secured the
                      refinancing due in 2013 as early as 2012 on favourable terms as a result of which interest expense was down
                      from the previous year at about  257 million net financial liabilities were up slightly on previous year the
                      equity ratio rose to about 35 percent
                           having taken all these measures we regard ourselves as being wellequipped for the upcoming phase of
                      strong growth for fiscal 2014 we project an initially moderate increase in consolidated sales to approx
                       41 billion together with a significant rise in earnings to more than  200 million this will be accompanied by
                      a further rise in the number of new product startups and model changeovers in the wiring systems division
                      which will not reach their full impact on sales and earnings until the subsequent years in the wire  cable
                      solutions division we expect to see solid growth for both the automotive cables business and the industrial
                      sectors especially so in america and in the bric countries
                           our mediumterm target remains the same namely leoni plans to reach consolidated sales of  5 billion
                      and a 7 percent ebit margin by 2016 thanks to the dynamic trend in the automotive sector we are aiming
                      for strong worldwide expansion of our business involving cables cable harnesses and wiring systems for the
                      automotive and component supply industries as the core activity of both our divisions the industrial business
                      represents the  likewise expanding  second mainstay with its focus on the capital goods medical technol
                      ogy communications and infrastructure markets across all of its business segments leoni will be growing
                      above all in asia and america in order to achieve an even distribution of sales in the worlds three strongest
                      economic regions over the long term

                                                                                                                 shareholders letter      5

supervisory board report


leoni ags supervisory board again in fiscal 2013 dealt in depth with the situation and performance of the
group of companies during the past financial year it conscientiously and diligently fulfilled its duties in
accordance with statutory requirements the provisions of the companys articles of association and its rules
of procedure at all times standing at the management boards side providing advice as well as assisting and
monitoring its work


constructive collaboration                                                                                                   dr werner rupp

the deliberations between the management board and the supervisory board were at all times construc
tive open and characterised by mutual trust a key foundation for this was the fact that the management
board regularly promptly and comprehensively informed the supervisory board about all matters pertinent
to leoni concerning strategy and planning as well as the groups operating performance including its risk
situation risk management and compliance deviation in business performance from the prepared planning
and targets was explained in detail the management board also at all times involved the supervisory board
immediately and early in decisions of material importance
 to fulfil its duties the supervisory board was provided with detailed written management board reports
in advance of its meetings all topics especially transactions requiring consent were thoroughly discussed
during the supervisory boards meetings the management board and supervisory board also at all times
kept in close touch outside their scheduled meetings among other activity for instance the chairmen of the
management board and the supervisory board consulted on matters requiring agreement at short notice
both regularly on a fixed day every month and also as warranted by events the entire supervisory board was
comprehensively informed of the content of these discussions during its next meeting at the latest there
were no conflicts of interest involving supervisory board members in relation to exercise of their office during
the period under report


main topics of discussion on the supervisory board
the supervisory board held five regular meetings during the 2013 financial year specifically on 19 march
30 april 18 july 19 september and 5 december the september meeting was held in sousse tunisia to give
the members of the supervisory board deeper insight into the production of wiring systems and to provide
the opportunity to familiarise themselves with another facility of the leoni group the supervisory board
had a quorum on each occasion at three meetings one different member on each occasion had excused their
absence all members of the management board attended each of the meetings so far as these did not cover
topics requiring that they absent themselves
 the topics that were regularly discussed during the meetings in 2013 included current trends in the econo
my and the business which was marked on the one hand by the recession in the eurozone and above all by
weak demand from the capital good industry in the first half of the year on the other hand the international
automotive industry performed significantly better than expected especially so in north america and china
in addition the effectiveness of risk management financial capital investment and human resource planning
as well as the operating targets were key agenda items during all of the meetings during its meetings in
april july and september the supervisory board also discussed the respectively pending quarterly and half

corporate governance and declaration of conformity
as has already been illustrated by the description of the boards principal topics of discussion the supervisory
board again in 2013 thoroughly examined corporate governance at leoni the guideline in this respect was
the german corporate governance code the amendments to which and their impact on the leoni group the
supervisory board considered in detail the declaration of conformity pursuant to article 161 of the german
public companies act was adapted
 with one exception leoni fulfilled all the recommendations and suggestions of the corporate governance
code in its current version the exception involves the new stipulation for management board compensation
which recommends among other things that when determining the compensation for management board
members the level of compensation relative to that for senior management and the workforce as a whole
also over time should be taken into consideration however leonis supervisory board does not deem a
rigidly prescribed proportionality based on fixed reference amounts to be expedient details concerning this
decision are contained in the current declaration of conformity                                                           declaration of

cables for infrastructure applications




medium voltage cables are used to supply
power in tunnels for example for the opera
tions centres ventilation and lighting inside
a tunnel but also for the power supply to the
locomotive via the overhead lines


control cables transmit signals for points
light signals and signal boxes they are used
both inside tunnels and also along above
ground tracks


safety cables are archetypal infrastructure
cables for emergency services they ensure
for instance in the event of a fire that the
emergency lighting works and they are
therefore especially robust and fireproof




betajet deltaflex cables are patented 400 hz
cables that are highly flexible and resistant to
abrasion this cable type is capable even at high
ambient temperatures of 55 c of still constant
ly transmitting the full electric charge of 260
amperes per phase and is therefore beneficially
deployed at airports in arab and gulf countries

                                    clared in december 2012 was removed as a result of a change to supervisory board compensation adopted by

                                    of the supervisory board now receive fixed compensation to which the recommendation in the code does
                                    not apply instead of performancerelated compensation

                                    benchmarks which also include the proportionality among various compensation groups however the
                                    supervisory board does not deem a rigidly prescribed proportionality based on fixed reference amounts to be
                                    helpful for individual appropriate determination of compensation for members of the management board

   benchmarks for comparison only make sense when they are realistic provide guidance and leave ample
   scope for consideration of individual cases these conditions do not fulfil the code recommendations
   under section 422 2 sentence 3 the supervisory board does not regard a rigidly prescribed proportion
   ality based on fixed reference amounts involving the workforce or parts of the workforce that can be ma
   nipulated at will as providing any help in determining the compensation for members of the management
   board which must be both fair in individual cases and always appropriate relative also to many other and
   more significant parameters nor does rigid comparison of the performance of the various compensation
   groups over time provide any assistance in this respect
      this applies especially to leoni as a company with an overwhelming proportion of its workforce em
   ployed in countries outside europe any form of comparison based on the wage groups of the part of the
   workforce outside germany which is de facto very relevant would merely lead to arbitrary outcomes and
   therefore to comparison benchmarks that no longer make any sense the supervisory board consequently
   does not consider it acceptable to draw on acrosstheboard parameters that make sense only in notional
   terms but which beyond that are not meaningful


iii the management board and supervisory board furthermore declare that they intend with the exception
   of the recommendations under section 422 2 sentence 3 in the future to conform to all the other rec
   ommendations of the government commission on the german corporate governance code in its version
   of 13 may 2013

markets of the industrialised countries well up
the equity markets of the large industrialised countries increasingly gained momentum over the course of
2013 mostly posting significant gains for the year as a whole impetus stemmed above all from the central
banks still generous supply of liquidity to the financial markets in addition the economic prospects gradu
ally picked up in parts of europe and the united states the declining economic momentum in the emerging
countries which caused some share prices to drop significantly on these markets put only a temporary
damper on the industrialised countries markets some share indices posted new record levels against this
backdrop also among these was germanys leading dax index which continued its uptrend of the preceding
years unabated and in december rose to 9589 points  based on closing prices the years final level was
only just below that at 9552 points the dax thus appreciated by nearly 26 percent the mdax generated an
increase of about 39 percent


leoni share a strong outperformer
the shares of the automotive and component supply sector also benefited from the favourable market
setting which with the tailwind from the very good performance of the car markets in the united states and
china generated aboveaverage gains the dax automobile sector rose by about 43 percent in the past year
while the subindex for the automotive component suppliers even rose by nearly 82 percent
 leonis share performed even better in 2013 by almost doubling in value with a 90 percent increase to
 5433 this is an expression of investors confidence in leonis earningsoriented growth strategy during
this upward trajectory the leoni share set a new alltime record with a high of  5508 the share posted its
lowest 2013 price of  2897 right at the beginning of the year
 the market capitalisation of the roughly 327 million leoni shares stood at about  1775 million on

trading volumes
a total of 573 million leoni shares changed hands on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the xetra electro
nic trading system in 2013 down from 723 million in 2012 an average of 226364 shares thus changed hands

total of  2212 million previous year  2307 million leoni therefore assumed 21st place in deutsche börses
mdax ranking of trading volumes down from 17th in the previous year

are in free float about two thirds of the roughly 327 million leoni shares were held by institutional investors

to take the globalisation of its business forward leoni is setting up not only sales offices but increasingly
also additional production facilities in key markets this enables us to offer customers based in these locations
local value creation and a high level of delivery flexibility the focal areas of this growth are the bric countries
including south korea where we aim to increase our sales from the current  7007 million to about  1 billion
by 2016 as well as north america
 to strengthen our power of innovation we are enhancing and improving our own expertise as well as
technologies and our position in innovationdriven growth markets in so doing we are geared primarily to
the global megatrends such as the growing demand for environmentally friendly technologies the intention
is to further increase sales of new types of products and solutions and to make leoni the leading and most
innovative manufacturer of cables for green technologies
 leoni rates the system business and extension of the value chain as key growth drivers that is why we
intend to develop towards being a system supplier to additional fields of work and to offer more highend
services in such areas as engineering the objective is to further increase the profitable sales in this business
 efficiency constitutes a key success criterion for leonis competitiveness we are raising this by realising
synergies rationalising as well as optimising our business processes and production networks these meas
ures will achieve annual efficiency gains in order thereby to offset increases in staff and material costs

macroeconomic trend
the international monetary fund imf calculates that the global economy again in 2013 grew no more than
moderately at a rate of 30 percent the good news was however that momentum picked up significantly in
the second half of the year and alleviated the consequences of the very subdued trend of the first few months
unlike in the preceding years particularly the industrialised countries whose overall economic output was up
by 13 percent and thus more strongly than originally projected contributed to this turnaround by contrast
the developing and emerging countries lost a little pace with 47 percent growth
  although the eurozone was again down with 04 percent contraction this was less than in the previous
year thanks to the trends of recovery in some countries the german economy once more provided support
according to the german federal office of statistics it again put on a solid performance with slight growth of
04 percent even though the balance of imports and exports was actually negative because of the persisting
weakness of demand in some areas of europe

the commercial vehicle sector again registered heavy demand in 2013 alongside the favourable economic
trends in china and the united states this also reflected bringingforward effects in europe these were due to
introduction of the stricter emission regulations euro 6 standard from january 2014 ihs global insight says
that worldwide about 6 percent more heavy goods vehicles were manufactured in 2013 than in 2012
     the global market for electrical and electronic products also grew in 2013 according to the german elec
trical and electronic manufacturers association zvei this market grew at an overall rate of 4 percent with
asia up 6 percent and the americas up 4 percent as the driving forces by contrast the market in europe was
flat in germany the sectors sales and output were down by about 2 and 3 percent respectively in the past
year on the other hand the order receipts of the german electrical and electronic goods manufacturers rose
by about 3 percent the manufacturers of automatic processing machines and measurement technology did
especially well
     the german engineering federation vdma says that the global mechanical engineering sector grew
by about 1 percent in 2013 however among the major manufacturing countries only china and the united
states generated sales increases while volumes were down in germany japan and italy the german mechan
ical engineering companies registered a sales decrease of about 1 percent during the year under report their
orders were down by 2 percent
     the worldwide sales of products and services of the information and communication technology ict
industry also rose in the past year the german association for information technology telecommunications
and new media bitkom estimates a global increase of about 4 percent underpinned above all by the emerg
ing countries bitkom says that in germany sales of information technology telecommunications equipment
and consumer electronics remained steady at the previous years high level
     in the german medical technology sector sales during the period under report are likely according to esti
mates of the spectaris trade association to have increased by about 3 percent thanks mainly to rising exports
to emerging countries
     from leonis perspective the 2013 trend in worldwide car production and thus in the demand for cables
cable harnesses and wiring systems was on the whole somewhat better than expected this involved demand
in china and the united states exceeding our projections whereas it fell short in the european massmarket
business the industrial business in europe was also weaker than anticipated here the cable industry was still
subject to heavy pressure on margins at the same time the trend towards the use of alternative conductor
materials and reduced cable crosssections where leoni is a key driver continued during the year under
report



other factors
alongside the macroeconomic and sectorspecific conditions there are a number of other factors that play a
key role with respect to leonis business performance

   the prices of commodities especially of copper exert a considerable influence on the size of our business              procurement
                                                                                                                                page 78
     we largely pass the fluctuation in the price of copper on to our customers based on contractual agreements
     to this effect albeit normally after a time lag a change in the price of copper will therefore normally result
     initially in a corresponding effect on leonis sales without notable impact on earnings on the reporting
     dates there may  depending on the change in the price of copper  be writedowns on inventory or provi
     sions to cover contingent losses on partial quantities of inventory the same applies to the raw material of
     silver which is used primarily in the refining of wire products

                                              groupwide the trend in energy prices does not have any major impact on leoni however the com
                                                paratively high level of energy costs in germany continued to weigh on our domestic production facilities
                                                during the year under report

                                              another significant factor involves personnel costs in the countries where we produce they are considered
                                                in our decisions on choices of location as are reliable legal and political conditions as well as favourable

                                                moderately so in eastern europe

                                              we continue to watch the unstable political situation in north africa and the ukraine very closely it has so

                                                in these countries to be competitive and will keep our capacity in place accordingly

                                              alongside the respective national legislation of the countries where we are present the legal factors that
                                                affect leoni also include international laws the stricter co2 emission limits in europe for example exert

                                                wiring systems that are especially lightweight or suited to alternative drive technologies new emission
                                                standards for trucks such as the euro 6 standard in europe and a similar regulation in the united states
                                                which apply from 2014 are also likely to exert a beneficial effect on demand for cable harnesses because of
                                                the more complex engine technology involved

new organisational structure enhances systems expertise                with our newly established business
group systems  components we have boosted our starting position for broadening systems expertise in the
areas of electromechanical components connector systems and electromobility the corresponding produc
tion capacity is pooled at our existing facility in slovakia where we set up a new injection moulding line in
2013 by the end of the year the first production projects were already underway involving for example the
main fuse boxes for a large model of a german premium carmaker


facility optimisation to ensure our great cost efficiency            during the period under report we not
only expanded our production network but also restructured it with respect to efficiency at the centre of this
stood realignment of our wiring systems production in morocco where in 2013 we closed a plant and began
setting up stateoftheart capacity at a new location there were also relocations in eastern europe for cost
reasons among them from poland to the ukraine production capacity in serbia is likewise undergoing further
expansion in addition a new organisational structure involving the settingup of pandivisional competence
centers and pooling of business units into business groups will entail efficiency benefits and synergies

new contracts ensuring future growth                           all five business groups booked new contracts in 2013 which
underpin our mediumgrowth targets they stem from premium and massmarket carmakers in germany
europe asia and the united states as well as from the international commercial vehicle industry agricultural
machinery producers and the component supply industry we also obtained several projects involving com
ponents and cable harnesses for vehicles with alternative drive systems the wiring systems division thus had

tion networks and supply chains are continually optimised to make the best possible use of available capacity
and to reduce the complexity of structures in 2013 for instance we further concentrated our european pro
duction of household appliance cables in eastern europe in serbia we are making joint use with the wiring
systems division of a plant for these products


competitive situation and advantages
the wire  cable solutions division which is the thirdlargest cable business in europe is the technology and
market leader in many of its target areas in some product segments such as automotive cables for the car
industry and cable systems for robotic engineering we are global market leaders we also command leading
positions in the market for cables for particular industrial applications for example in mechanical engineer
ing measurement and control technology as well as medical technology
 our crucial competitive advantages include a vertically strongly integrated value chain core skills developed
over decades such as a broad understanding of raw materials and knowhow concerning input materials
engineering and applications as well as command of technologically sophisticated manufacturing processes
across all the links in the value chain our increasing systems expertise also enhances our opportunities in the
market


2013 strategic projects
the wire  cable solutions division is applying the group strategy in the context of its wcs 4ward strategy
programme with its four levers of internationalisation innovation systems business and efficiency the pro
portions of sales generated in asia and the americas were further increased as planned in 2013 the amount
of business in asia has risen by 50 percent since 2008 and in the americas it was doubled that reduced the
proportion of sales the division generates in europe from 82 percent to 66 percent enhancing efficiency
was another focal area with respect to these two levers we launched and executed the following strategic
projects


new facility in india     the wcs division opened its first cables plant in pune india in 2013 on production
space of about 15000 m2 we are initially making automotive cables as well as instrumentation cables for the
petrochemical industry here initial customer orders from the region were already fulfilled during the year un
der report the next step is to also include manufacture of products for the local railway and solar industries


capacity expansion in asia and the americas          based on the consistently good growth opportunities in
these continents we enlarged our capacity to produce automotive cables in china and the americas in 2013                capital expenditure

cables business in europe remained fairly steady despite absence of market impetus overall the heavy
demand for automotive cables compensated for the declining demand in our industrial businesses which are
still very much focused on the european market with its currently weak economy in addition adverse changes
in the prices of metals affected business group conductors  copper solutions while the weak spell involving
the chinese household appliance industry was reflected in bg electrical appliance assemblies business group
communication  infrastructure suffered from very weak business with the petrochemical industry as well as
a downturn in demand for data cables bg industry  healthcare also registered less demand in the first half of
the year but it gradually stabilised in the second half

earnings well below previous years level           the wcs divisions ebit amounted to  471 million in
2013 and was thus as expected substantially below the 2012 figure of  1013 million which included a large
item of nonrecurring income of  283 million from having sold the operations of leoni studer hard that
were deemed not to fit with core business the decline was furthermore attributable to considerable sales
decreases in the industrial businesses and the correspondingly weaker capacity utilisation as well as to a less
favourable mix of automotive cable products in addition there were restructuring expenses amounting to
 89 million previous year  09 million these were incurred primarily in connection with the necessary ad
justment of capacity and realignment of the facility in stolberg to boost its competitiveness on a lasting basis
the facility had recently suffered considerably from the cancellation of cable shipments for the petrochemical
industry in iran due to the temporarily tightened international embargo conditions

order receipts exceed amount of sales          the wire  cable solutions division obtained new orders worth
 16425 million in 2013 this took the amount of orders above both the 2012 likeforlike figure of  15695
million and the total sales of the year under report promising new projects were obtained above all in bg
automotive cables an international component supplier commissioned us to produce special abs cables that
will be fitted to new vehicles of a japanese manufacturer for the chinese and american car markets leoni
thus received its first large order from the japanese car industry there was also an order from the component
supply sector for highspeed data transfer cables to connect cameras in vehicles which are being made at our
facilities in china mexico and europe environmentally friendly applications are also playing an increasingly
important role for instance an electric cars specialist placed an order with leoni to supply charging cables
for its next generation of vehicles a wellknown automotive component supplier ordered rapid charging
cables for the new electric car of a german car manufacturer and a further component supplier ordered cables
for emission measurement equipment


business group communication  infrastructure won a pilot project of a multinational railway manufacturer
with a view to award the contract to make cable harnesses for fixed installation inside trains there is major
market potential in this segment because the majority of these manufacturers still make these cable harnesses
themselves via our sales office in the united arab emirates we were also commissioned to supply the king

                       leonis performance was in the management boards view on the whole satisfactory in 2013 in particular
                       this involved encouraging sales performance leonis consolidated sales increased by about 3 percent year
                       on year to the new record level of  39 billion this was based on the betterthanexpected demand from the
                       international automotive industry which was underpinned by strong car sales in north america and asia not
                       only did this more than compensate for the weaker business on the european motor vehicle market and the
                       industrial sectors it also exceeded our sales forecast at the beginning of the year leoni had estimated con
                       solidated sales of about  37 billion and in the middle of the year raised this target to around  38 billion the
                       growth stemmed from the wiring systems division which increased its external sales by about 5 percent to
                        23 billion and thereby topped the originally projected figure of  21 billion as indicated the wire  cable
                       solutions division generated external sales of  16 billion a total virtually unchanged from the previous year
                           consolidated ebit earnings before interest and taxes amounted to  1631 million in 2013 and was thus as
                       expected well below the previous years figure of  2379 million which included a large amount of nonre

                       the industrial business as well as substantial restructuring costs the latter item turned out significantly larger
                       than estimated which is why the originally projected ebit figure of  170 million was not quite matched the

after taxes leoni reported consolidated net income of  1059 million previous year  1570 million in
keeping with our dividend policy in principle to pay out about one third of consolidated net income to share
holders we will propose to shareholders at the annual general meeting to pay a dividend of  100 per leoni
share for fiscal 2013 previous year  150
 the leoni groups financial and asset situation remained solid in 2013 and was with a slightly improved
equity ratio of 345 percent a minor increase in net financial liabilities of about  2570 million and free cash
flow of  367 million mostly in line with expectations
 the good trend of business in the automotive sector continued in early 2014 leoni ags management board

group sales and earnings
record sales thanks to strong automotive business
leoni ag increased its consolidated sales by about 3 percent to  39179 million in 2013 this growth
stemmed above all from the still good business with the international automotive industry which in turn ben
efited from the heavy demand for vehicles in north america and asia thanks to the associated momentum
we more than compensated for the weak demand for cars in europe as well as decreases in other industry
sectors
 the additional sales in 2013 were generated exclusively from our own resources changes in exchange rates
had a negative effect of  339 million and curtailed the growth by 09 of a percentage point the price of
copper on the whole had virtually no impact during the year under report with an adverse effect of 02 of a
percentage point the scope of consolidation remained largely the same
 the widely diverging economic conditions around the world were reflected in the regional breakdown of
leonis sales we generated by far the strongest growth in the bric countries including south korea with an
increase of 19 percent to  7007 million thanks to the good business in north america we held our sales
in the nafta countries steady at roughly the previous years level of  5219 million with a figure of  5161
million in germany sales rose by about 6 percent to  10890 million in the rest of europe on the other
hand we had to cope with a decrease of more than 3 percent to  14813 million because of the partially very
difficult economic situation of some countries sales generated in the other regions outside europe dipped by
approx 7 percent to  1308 million

                       new product startups and restructuring expenses weigh on earnings
                       overall the cost of sales rose by just over 3 percent to  32401 million and thus by a little more than consoli
                       dated sales this slightly disproportionate increase was above all a consequence of the numerous new product
                       startups in the wiring systems division which required substantial preproduction spending on personnel
                       and materials another factor exerting an adverse effect on earnings involved the smaller contributions to
                       profit of the capital goods business in the wire  cable solutions division which reported less utilisation of
                       capacity because of the weak demand in europe while the overall consolidated gross profit figure of  6778
                       million was slightly above the previous years  6759 million the gross margin contracted from 177 percent
                       to 173 percent
                        despite high special freight costs which were incurred mainly in the first few months of 2013 selling
                       expenses rose at only a moderate rate of about 2 percent to  1964 million structural improvements which

                       developments costs which are mostly incurred on a projectrelated basis rose by more than 14 percent to
                        1061 million because of the numerous new product startups in the wiring systems division

other operating income dropped considerably from  489 million to  104 million the previous years figure
did include substantial nonrecurring amounts this involved the proceeds of  283 million from the sale of
leoni studer hard ag which was deemed no longer to fit core business as well as income of  50 million
related to consolidating businesses for the first time by contrast other operating expenses rose significantly
from  170 million to  313 million this reflected primarily the more substantial restructuring costs which
were incurred due among other things to measures to optimise the structure of our production in north
africa and of our facility in stolberg germany in addition there was a fine of  14 million resulting from the
eu competition proceedings concluded in the middle of the year
     on the bottom line consolidated earnings before interest and taxes ebit dropped from  2379 million
in 2012 to  1631 million in 2013 ebit adjusted for exceptional proceeds from sales restructuring costs and
other items decreased from  2275 million to  1987 million
     leonis financial result involved a significant improvement from negative  387 million to negative
 322 million this reflected the refinancing measures successfully carried out in the past two years which
resulted in a more favourable interestrate structure finance costs were therefore down substantially from
 434 million to  327 million by a considerable margin this more than offset the fall in finance income to
 05 million versus the previous years figure of  47 million which included exchange gains
     in total leoni reported consolidated earnings before taxes of  1312 million for the 2013 financial year
previous year  1993 million tax expense amounted to  253 million which still corresponded to a very
low tax rate of 193 percent previous year 212 percent in particular this reflected income in the fourth
quarter from reversal of deferred tax assets relating to loss carryforwards which will probably be useable in
the future because of the merger of two subsidiaries in italy and a case of restructuring in china
     after taxes consolidated net income for 2013 came to  1059 million as opposed to  1570 million in the
previous year earnings per share amounted to  323 previous year  480

financial situation
finance strategy
the leoni group endeavours to have a permanently solid balanced finance structure the aim is to have and
maintain an equity ratio of at least 35 percent and gearing debtequity ratio below 50 percent so as to last
ingly safeguard the companys strong acceptance by the capital market as well as banks and suppliers we use
the capital market to cover our longterm financing requirement we obtain shortterm finance via credit lines
from our core banks deutsche bundesbank has rated leoni as an eligible borrower for more than a decade
the rating agencies are not commissioned to issue a rating because this would in our view not provide any
added benefit leoni does not have any financial covenants to fulfil for borrowings
 our growth is normally to be funded via net cash flow furthermore we take care that significant expansion
surges  especially in the case of acquisitions  are backed to an appropriate extent by equity details on capi
tal management are contained in the notes                                                                                     notes

finance and liquidity management
the leoni groups financial management is handled by the leoni ag holding company it takes the necessary
measures for the entire group of companies based on ascertaining the capital requirement at corporate level
in exceptional cases we transact regional special finance deals the most important objectives of financial
management are safeguarding the groups liquidity worldwide optimising finance costs and revenue as well
as controlling and minimising currency and interest rate risks we use a wide range of instruments to keep our
exposure to individual markets or types of finance as low as possible generally speaking leoni pursues long
term collaboration with international banks that is based on mutual trust group subsidiaries are financed
mostly in their functional currency as in the previous year the principal financial liabilities in 2013 were
denominated in euros russian rubles us dollars as well as chinese yuan
 among other means we manage our liquidity via a cash pooling system with pools in the home countries
of the currencies of most importance to the group furthermore leoni ag executes the majority of the pay
ments for the group
 in order to be able to reliably meet all our financial obligations at any time we use capital market instru
ments such as bonds and borrowers note loans at the corporate level for the whole group and obtain credit
lines in sufficient amounts existing credit lines were extended in 2013 to ensure liquidity on 31 december
2013 there were short and mediumterm credit lines from banks amounting to  4787 million previous year
 4860 million with terms up to 28 months of which  138 million were utilised at short term on the report
ing date previous year  239 million
 the offbalance sheet instruments leasing and factoring which we use to improve liquidity are also man
aged at head office factoring in particular constitutes an important addition to the other shortterm liquidity
management instruments because of its flexibility with respect to the trend of sales and the associated need
for finance at the end of 2013 factoring reduced trade receivables by the amount of  1225 million previous
year  913 million of the other liabilities  180 million previous year  323 million was due to the receipt
of payment on receivables that were sold within factoring agreements details on leasing are contained in the

                                     leoni secured the refinancing due in 2013 early by having successfully placed a borrowers note loan in the

                                     us not only to repay the bond in the amount of  200 million due in 2013 and a borrowers note loan in the
                                     amount of  24 million but also to realign our entire finance structure on favourable terms due to the current
                                     low interest rate level we also placed a borrowers note loan in the amount of  25 million in november 2013

leoni ags consolidated balance sheet came to  23997 million as at 31 december 2013 as opposed to
 23864 million at the end of 2012 on the asset side this moderate balance sheet enlargement was due
mainly to the larger items of property plant and equipment which were up by nearly 5 percent to  7098 mil
lion this is primarily a reflection of our proactive capital investment policy intangible assets were down from
 911 million to  823 million due to normal amortisation overall noncurrent assets increased by about

plastics supply situation only slightly eased
the prices for standard plastics and plasticizers remained relatively stable through the year 2013 the
petrochemical industry responded to the cyclical downturn in demand by adjusting its production capacity
meaning that supply and demand balanced out at a still relatively high price level by contrast special plasti
cizers for the manufacture of automotive cable compounds became more expensive as shortages repeatedly
occurred


component procurement increasingly global
as in the previous year leoni frequently worked with suppliers that are stipulated by customers in the auto
motive industry as part of being awarded the contract to procure components like connectors and fixings in
2013 purchasing activity for global projects was stepped up in the year under report especially so in asia and
the americas we also extended our supplier marketing to encompass our bus electromobility and compo
nents we counteracted price increases and procurement bottlenecks by means of intensive global negotia
tions with the suppliers as well as with new technologies and by substitution


supplier relationships internationalised further
enhancing and maintaining supplier capital plays an important role for leoni the wcs division systematically
continued to develop its supplier management in 2013 especially with respect to qualification and assessment
to ensure reliable supply of raw materials and special insulation materials via suitable suppliers and sources
the supplier pool was internationalised further and procurement requirements were wherever possible
combined worldwide or regionally to stabilise supply and optimise costs in the wiring systems division the
supplier pool was enlarged slightly by having extended the activity to bus electromobility and components
we also developed and set up an itsupported interface to be able to monitor the performance of our suppli
ers by means of a supplier score card in real time and transparently

attractive jobs
leoni has set itself the objective of providing its employees with interesting jobs and a motivating encour
aging and constructive setting in order to gain their loyalty to the company among the aspects contributing
to this are flexible workingtime models extensive advanced training options and performancerelated
compensation occupational health and safety also play an important part in the appeal of a job you will find
information on this in the sustainability report                                                                                               sustainability report

working time models               the existing range of flexible workingtime arrangements like parttime flexitime
and trustbased working jobsharing and teleworking was extended even further in 2013 the objective is to
achieve a better worklife balance and thereby greater diversity in the workforce to do so we extended our
range of teleworking options to include a flexible one that allows a greater proportion of the workforce to par
ticipate staff who have the corresponding facility can perform up to 20 percent of their working time in their
home office this leonihome flex solution is currently a pilot project at the two divisional headquarters in
kitzingen and roth and is in the future to be offered at all locations in germany leoni also devised a plan for
family caregiver leave based on the new legislation in this respect

in the wire  cable solutions division development work is done primarily at the larger facilities in germany
and switzerland but increasingly also in the important markets of asia and north america in addition there
is the research  development department within the head office business development function which runs
divisionwide innovation and applicationoriented development projects additional impetus stemmed from
a new strategy department within business development which generates innovation ideas and provides
methodologies for sustained innovation and technology management
 the r  d specialists of the two divisions collaborate closely in many areas of work leoni can thereby com
bine a wide variety of knowhow for specific tasks thus achieving synergies also in the interests of customers


focal areas of development
as in the preceding years the wiring systems divisions r  d work in 2013 was focused on the development
of customised projectrelated wirings systems reducing the weight and costs of cable harnesses sizing as
well as the use of alternative conductor materials also played an important role we simultaneously forged
ahead with the development of further highvoltage components and of the 48volt wiring system which
among other things raises the efficiency of the components and thanks to smaller conductor crosssections
leads directly to weight savings
 the wire  cable solutions division during the year under report continued to work on a large number of
customer and marketspecific projects including expansion of its portfolio of halogenfree cables miniatur
ised cables fiber optic cables and production for highfrequency applications apart from the automotive
industry the most important target markets include medical technology the capital goods industry and the
infrastructure sector we also stepped up optimisation of our metals and alloys production processes

                       results of r  d work
                       our strategic objective of enhancing leonis power of innovation demonstrated effect during the year under
                       report in 2013 we completed numerous customerspecific development projects took products to the
                       marketability stage and registered proprietary rights the number of submitted patents and utility models
                       rose from 26 to 42 of which 24 in the wiring systems division previous year 17 and 18 in the wire  cable
                       solutions division previous year 9 two of our development projects also received awards the chinese car
                       and automotive parts magazine orientauto presented our innovative foammoulding technology and its
                       applications with the innovation award at tongji university in shanghai and a dissertation overseen by
                       leoni on the topic of electric energy generation from waste car heat was given the innovation prize of the
                       querkraft association
                        some of our key new developments are described hereinafter many of these innovations also strengthen
                       our position in the green technology segment thanks to weight reduction and the use of environmentally
                       friendly materials


                       aluminium as a conductor material            the use of aluminium in the cable harness was again of great sig
                       nificance to the applicationrelated projects in the wiring systems division this enables costs to be saved and
                       the environment to be spared because the proportion of copper in the wiring system is reduced and therefore

                                                                                                 group management report    further performance indicators      87




also the vehicles weight and co2 emissions we successfully validated corresponding prototypes and started
initial massproduction deployment in cars in the past financial year


optimised wiring system architecture            in 2013 we further developed our methods for sizing cable har
nesses by considering in the layout on the one hand safeguarding of the vehicle as well as its functions and
on the other hand adjusted downsizing to simultaneously tap further optimisation potential in a toolchain
to do so leoni uses a combination of simulating physical sizes measuring them in operating condition and
targeted analysis of customer specifications


innovative insulation materials         the wire  cable solutions division worked among other things on
various new insulation materials for automotive cables which are scheduled for market launch in 2014 and
will also make a contribution to sustained sparing of resources for instance we are currently developing a
pvcbased insulation material for automotive cables with an ultrathin wall to reduce weight and installation
space furthermore a halogenfree insulation material which is suited to temperatures of up to 125 degrees
celsius and is simultaneously abrasion proof as well as resistant to dirt and oil is particularly environmentally
friendly


intelligent solutions for the capital goods industry             leoni presented the robotics market with its
lsh 3 umbilical solution in the year under report this new generation of power supply systems to include
cables as well as pneumatic and hydraulic components reduces thanks to its innovative design the risk of
potential clashes and further enhances our systems expertise with a hybrid cable that has an ethernet core
we also developed a particularly robust product for various types of drive systems which transfers both data
and power and thereby reduces the amount of cabling by up to 85 percent


more patient comfort        leoni also further underpinned its systems expertise in the medical technology
sector in 2013 we developed our leoni orion highprecision and intuitive patient positioning system for can
cer radiation therapy based on our extensive experience in robotics and programming leoni orion facilitates
especially rapid and precise treatment and is scheduled for market launch in 2014 another novelty involves an
innovative process for refining silicone cables which we registered for patent in 2013 this makes the cables
for nearpatient applications like ultrasound minimally invasive diagnostics and treatment smoother thereby
making it possible to avoid unwanted adhesion effects on the patients skin


basic research and collaboration
in our basic research work we continued our multifaceted collaboration and projects in 2013 and gained sig
nificant new findings in the wiring systems division for example we made substantial progress in aluminium
joining technology be means of crimping and ultrasonic welding in the field of plastic foammoulding we
qualified several types of foam with improved properties for use in mass production and developed a costef
fective high temperature foam with temperature stability of up to 130 degrees celsius and an integrated
foaming process the subsidised highteg joint venture project to produce thermoelectric generators with
textile methods which enables waste heat in cars to be used to generate electrical power was successfully
taken further forward
 among other things the wire  cable solutions division participated in the 100 gigabit research project
which is aiming for a technological leap in data transmission another important joint project involves the
signal conductor project to develop metallurgical materials and processes for manufacturing signal transmis
sion cables we are furthermore collaborating with technische hochschule nürnberg technical university of

                                     england on the cable production line at our plant in roth germany we switched to combined cycle cooling
                                     and thereby substantially lowered our energy and water consumption at the same facility we also installed

energy consumption and co2 emissions in the group
as part of its un global compact communication on progress cop leoni has since 2012 made public the
trend in its groupwide energy use and co2 emissions we regard both of these figures as key indicators for
sustainability the figures available by the date of the management report refer to 2012 this year we succeed
ed in reducing our energy consumption relative to sales by 25 percent our co2 emissions rose by 44 percent
in absolute terms due among other factors to major preparatory work for new projects in the wiring systems
division this meant a 15 percent increase per  1 million of sales and no change per employee the data for
2013 will be available at the end of march 2014 and will be made public in the next cop

carbon disclosure project
leoni participated in the carbon disclosure project for the sixth time in 2013 on behalf of institutional inves
tors the initiative surveyed among other things the co2 emissions of the 350 largest marketlisted companies
in the germanspeaking area the corresponding 2012 figures were ascertained during the year under report
compared with other companies in the automotive and cable sectors that participated in the carbon disclo
sure project leonis emission readings were well below the average measured both as a proportion of sales
and relative to the number of employees


recycling
leoni participates in the our cars initiative and thus in projects to recycle them such as the eu endoflife
vehicle directive for example by using copper the principal component in our products and a material that is
100 percent recyclable we have a very good starting position in this respect


green technology
leoni understands the term green technology as encompassing all products system solutions and services
that make the use of energy more efficient and easier on resources thereby reducing emissions and pollution
of the environment leoni already serves all of the most significant markets for environmental technologies as
defined by the bundesumweltministerium bmu and is very well positioned in many of these sectors

                       the primary instrument for identifying and assessing risk comprises the risk workshops that are held once a
                       year for the divisions and the holding company during which the inventory of risks of the divisions and of the
                       group is updated a training session is held and the likely range of fluctuation in market risks is estimated for
                       the aggregate statement we run these risk workshops for the divisions and for the leoni group prior to these
                       events the corporate risk manager and the responsible area risk managers conduct separate interviews with
                       the operations managers for each business groupunit of the two divisions
                            the responsibility for indentifying assessing and dealing with risk always remains with the respective risk
                       owner dealing with risk is prioritised by the maximum possible loss insurance solutions so far as they are
                       commercially viable play a large part in this respect as soon as a riskminimising measure has been imple
                       mented the potential maximum loss is reduced by this factor

                       using the risk reporting sheet are verified by the risk management of the divisions and entered on a central
                       risk database on a quarterly basis as well as updated with any risk reduction that has taken place as a result of
                       initiated countermeasures


                       the management board receives a quarterly risk report with the following content

opportunity management system
the identification awareness and exploitation of opportunities of the leoni group is managed on a decen
tralised basis under operations management forming the basis for this is the target agreement and strategy
process originating from the management board outside forecasts and market analyses also support oppor
tunity management it is integrated in the risk management and controlling process at the respective business
group  unit levels as well as in the principal projects of the wiring systems division


reporting  the documentation is prepared by our operational managers on the basis of an annual riskop
portunity comparison by our operational managers per business group  unit as well as for significant projects
and condensed for the management board and the supervisory board in an aggregate statement for which
we make use of what is known as monte carlo simulation

internal control system
the task of leoni ags internal control system is to document the groupwide controls pertaining the princi
pal process risks to fulfil the legal obligations stemming from the 8th eu directive and their implementation
in the german act on the modernisation of accounting law bilmog as well as to identify weaknesses in the
control system
 the operational and organisational structure of the internal control system is at leoni divided into four
local control levels corporate departments divisions business groupsunits and local companies and a cor
porate documentation level which is integrated in the risk management system the locally executed manual
and itsupported controls are documented in risk management at the corporate level as part of a control
selfassessment csa process our control processes are not limited to just accountingrelated risks but also
encompass operating and compliance controls the corporate internal control committee which is composed
of the persons responsible for control at the respective head offices and the control level managers carries
out audits of all control matters and processes involving the internal control system with respect to being up
to date complete and effective the control level managers support the process and the persons responsible
for control


reporting        reporting is done quarterly on the corporate internal control committee and via the quarterly
risk report to the entire management board the csas submitted by operating management form the basis of
the reporting


process improvement          the audit committee reviews the internal control systems effectiveness once a
year this may involve the auditors presenting weaknesses in the internal control system found during the
annual audit furthermore the internal audit department checks on a random basis whether the internal
controls at the four business levels are being carried out
 recommendations for action that arose from the external audit carried out in 2012 on implementation of the
legal requirements to have an operational and accountingrelated control system that is fit for purpose were in
their key points implemented in 2013

                       presentation of the principal risks and opportunities
                       the risks to and opportunities for the leoni group are broken down by the classes of strategic risksoppor
                       tunities and market risksopportunities operational risksopportunities financial risksopportunities and
                       compliance risksopportunities the principal risks top 12 and opportunities are presented below


                       strategic risks and market risks
                       we encounter strategic risks and market risks mainly in the areas of
                          price pressure  fluctuation
                          procurement market risks
                          threat to market position and competitive advantages
                          market trends  fluctuation in sales
                          location  country risks
                          market appeal
                          competitive forces
                          strategy  organisation  core skills


                       the four principal risks are


                       economic slump          customers in the automotive industry and among its suppliers account for about 75
                       percent of leonis consolidated sales the current business performance of this sector therefore has great
                       influence on leonis business volume and earnings          measures leoni has prepared for any cyclical slump
                       in sales by making its cost structure even more flexible


                       pressure to cut prices          leoni supplies its products to markets that are characterised by fierce compe
                       tition the trend prevailing in the automotive industry towards sharing development costs with suppliers
                       also continues to affect leoni       measures we confront the unabatedly heavy pressure on prices in the
                       automotive industry with effective stringent cost management in all areas of our company setting up more
                       production facilities in lowwage countries and resolutely optimising purchasing prices


                       copper price fluctuation            leoni uses copper in all of its business segments the global market price of
                       this raw material which is subject to substantial fluctuation therefore exerts a major influence on the cost
                       of materials in the group if the price of copper rises for a protracted period of time the lag in passing this
                       cost on to our customers can exert an adverse earnings effect on the reporting date any substantial drop in
                       demand could if there is a simultaneous dip in the price of copper lead to us having to sell at lower prices
                       some of our copper inventory bought forward at higher prices this would impact negatively on earnings if
                       the price has fallen sharply up to the reporting date copper inventories may be exposed to the risk of deval
                       uation a shortage of copper stocks could lead to supply bottlenecks and higher copper prices         measures
                       this pronounced volatility can with a time lag largely be passed on to our customers based on contractual
                       agreements to this effect leoni prefers longterm and direct supply relationships with copper suppliers to
                       avoid supply bottlenecks

                                                                                                 group management report    risk and opportunity report      99




fluctuation in the cost of materials         contact systems which consist of plastic casings and metal con
tacts are made mostly with tools stemming from a single source due either to customer requirements or eco
nomic considerations rising demand could lead to increases in the costs of our most important raw materials
this can result in demands for higher prices and therefore in increased procurement costs for the correspond
ing components and can furthermore cause supply bottlenecks in the event of shortages          measures
international competition has hitherto enabled us to largely avoid any increases in the cost of materials


strategic opportunities and market opportunities


globalisation innovation systems business and cost leadership               thanks to its strategic alignment
the leoni group has the opportunity to benefit more substantially and more quickly from outside develop
ments ie to expand its market position and to raise its profitability the primary approaches to this involve
the four levers of our strategy by further globalising its operations leoni can better exploit the opportunities
in the emerging markets and increasingly internationalise its industrial business which is still quite european
in nature enhancing the power of innovation provides the opportunity to improve our market position on the
one hand with new products and solutions and on the other hand by ongoing optimisation of our processes
the systems business lever harbours potential in terms of gearing our range of manufacture even more closely
to customer requirements raising the efficiency of our production structures and processes entails the oppor
tunity to achieve additional cost benefit and thereby to increase profitability


the economic cycle       generally speaking leoni has the opportunity to generate more sales than expected
in the markets it targets by outperforming the overall market and correspondingly rising demand this applies
especially to the bric countries and south korea should for example the automotive markets in these
countries grow more strongly leoni could benefit via both direct shipments to these regions and indirectly
by supplying cars exported from europe


commodity prices       a more favourable trend in commodity prices would benefit leonis costofmaterials
ratio and therefore its margins


electromobility green technology and alternative energy generation                   new trends in technology
and society also present leoni with growth opportunities  for instance the growing interest among car
drivers in hybrid and electric drives as well as electrical and electronic innovations in vehicles green technol
ogy and energy saving are also playing an ever larger role in virtually all of the other sectors of importance
to leoni in china and india for example we see mounting potential for alternative energy generation using
solar and wind power plant as well as for railway engineering in general the key global trends  of mobility
urbanisation environmental awareness and shortage of resources demographic change globalisation as well
as industrialisation and automation  present leoni with additional expansion opportunities in many areas

                        operational risks
                        we face operational risks mainly in the areas of
                           production
                           purchasing  logistics
                           personnel
                           project management
                           research  development
                           distribution
                           information management


                        the six principal risks are


                        break in the supply chain to our customers           the leoni group had a total of 79 facilities in 33 countries
                        in 2013 policy on choice of location is geared closely to the requirements of our customers which leoni
                        follows into foreign markets the constant pressure on prices and costs compels us towards disproportion
                        ately large increases in production capacity located in lowwage countries this means that buyers and
                        customers in many instances have to be supplied across several national boundaries there are also political
                        risks in some countries for example in north africa and the ukraine difficult political situations could at any
                        time result in unrest and also strikes at our production facilities in those locations or in closed seaports and
                        airports the option of temporary supply from production facilities in other nonaffected countries is severely
                        limited because of the customised products in the wiring systems division justintime delivery and the
                        singlesource principle of some customers extend the reach of this risk further relocation is possible only with
                        a corresponding lead time necessitated by setting up the required production capacity and recruitment that
                        is why we offer our customers the option of supply from two facilities in different countries in many cases
                        however our customers have decided for economic reasons to continue to share the risk of 100 percent supply
                        from north africa a break in the supply chain to our customers due for example to unrest cybercrime or
                        natural disasters could result in a supply bottleneck persisting several weeks    measures owing to the size
                        it has attained leoni operates a considerable number of production facilities worldwide which have backup
                        capacity as is prudent and accepted by the carmakers furthermore preventive measures have been applied at
                        all production facilities and are documented in a global emergency plan these range from a roundtheclock
                        guard service to extensive fire protection systems furthermore no leoni facility is located in an area known
                        to be under serious threat of earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters


                        startup and project costs         we successfully started making a large number of new products in the 2013
                        financial year the current expansion of our production capacity for our customers new model ranges is
                        progressing according to plan should we fail to ensure that production starts on schedule and according to
                        the requirements of our customers this could have serious consequences for future business and incur heavy
                        exceptional costs      measures we enhanced our fullydeveloped project management for such large pro

information management            running a company like leoni that operates on a global scale is only possible
with the help of sophisticated it systems constant readiness to supply goods and services  especially to the
automotive industry that frequently calls for either justintime or justinsequence delivery  also depends
on the availability of it systems and their data at all times serious disruption such as system outages attacks
on our networks loss or corrupting of data could threaten leonis ability to supply temporarily stop custom
ers production and hence result in having to face farreaching claims for compensation         measures leoni
therefore constantly works  in some instances with the support of outside specialists  at optimising its it
setup both in terms of concept and operation one example of this is having a second backup computer
centre as an emergency system an information security and data protection officer who reports directly to
the management board demonstrates the very high priority given to security of our information systems and
networks as well as to safeguarding the confidentiality availability and dependability of our data


product liability  recall leonis output is used primarily for technically sophisticated products and
equipment with high safety standards a failure could have farreaching consequences ranging from down
time costs to penalties and through to personal injuries      measures we minimise the associated risks by
taking effective measures as part of process safety and quality management all plants are iso 9001 certified
and some depending on the customer group they supply have additional isots 16949 automotive industry
en 9100 aerospace or iso 13485 medical technology certification some plants also have an environmental
management system certified to iso 14001 there is also insurance cover for operating product and environ
mental liability as well as for product recalls product liability cases and recalls are reported without delay
by means of a red alert process that has been set up to all concerned units so that countermeasures can be
applied immediately


loss of a customer       the loss of a customer we supply could temporarily result in losses of earnings 
contributions to profit and additional capacity adjustment costs       measures we have reduced our exposure
to a small number of major customers in the wiring systems division with a broader international customer
base the lengthy contract periods which usually cover the lifespan of a particular model range and having
established very close and stable customersupplier relationships for instance by way of comprehensive
development work and outstanding service in terms of delivery mean that there will be early notice of losing
a customer


fluctuation in personnel costs          the growing shortage of skilled professionals in germany changes in
the availability of personnel and the resulting rise in wage and salary costs at labourintensive production
locations in eastern europe north africa and asia present human resource management with particular
challenges this situation is brought about by the large number of production operations being located in
countries with low wage levels     measures effort has been stepped up to increase staff advancement  for
example with internal programmes to provide employees with further qualifications and aimed at integration
as well as offering a wide range of social benefits  to maintain the ability to recruit and tie staff as an attrac
tive employer for our travelling and seconded staff members we have enhanced an existing care insurance
policy to include further medical and securityrelevant benefits for example evacuation in the event of
unrest as in north africa or a natural disaster would be handled by an international service provider

                        provide leoni with opportunity not only to reduce costs but also to expand
                             for example the future market of electromobility and the growing demand for electrical components
                        provide the wiring systems division with good opportunity to outperform expectations expanding the

                        financial risks
                        we face financial risks mainly in the areas of
                           currency and interest risks
                           risk of bad debt losses
                           borrowing
                           liquidity risks
                           maimpairment risks


                        the three principal risks are


                        bad debt  liquidity the default of a large customer on debt could exert a considerable adverse effect
                        on net income         measures all customers with whom the leoni group intends to conclude business on a
                        credit basis are subject to credit screening regular analysis of receivables and the structure of the receivables

                        further tool to reduce the risk of default
                             to back its plans for growth leoni uses alongside the existing longterm borrowers note loans ample short
                        and longterm loan commitments from banks mainly in the form of conventional lines of credit in addition
                        stringent cash pooling is used to safeguard liquidity the most important cash flows in the group are managed
                        and handled by leoni ag at head office if in the event of a crisis for example the inhouse rating of our
                        core banks for leoni were to drop below investment grade this would probably mean increased cost on any
                        required loans which might not be provided in the desired amount

                                                                                                 group management report    risk and opportunity report      103




the group monitors its current liquidity situation on a daily basis monthly currencyspecific rolling liquidity
planning for respective periods of 12 months is used to manage future liquidity requirement the planning
takes into consideration the terms of investments and financial assets eg receivables other financial assets
as well as the expected cash flows from business activity


impairment risks          leoni subjects assets and goodwill to impairment testing based on the ifrs accounting
rules an increase in the discount rate andor worsening of earning prospects will cause the risk of impairment
to rise


currency risks         although we conduct business mainly in euros or in the local currency of the respective
country we are increasingly faced with currency risks due to the globalisation of the markets      measures in
the groups holding company leoni ag the corporate finance department deals with currency risks in
collaboration with the currency committee hedging transactions are executed in line with the existing
underlying transactions or the planned transactions selection of the hedging instrument to be used is based
on regular indepth analysis of the underlying transaction to be hedged the objective is to limit the impact
of exchange rate variation on net income apart from the actual hedging transactions we primarily take
advantage of the option of netting foreign currency items within the group to hedge our operating business
activity as a further currencyhedging measure as a matter of principle we finance our foreign subsidiaries in
their respective functional currencies by way of refinancing in the corresponding currency


further details on these financial risks are contained in the notes                                                        notes

financial opportunities
to cover the interest rate and currency risks the company engages for example in hedging transactions
under the auspices of the currency committee with the aim of avoiding any deviation from the budgeted
exchange rate any appreciation in the currency involved for us in forex items that are not hedged and any
depreciation in the currency of the forex items that we have hedged present opportunities


compliance risks
we face compliance risks mainly in the areas of
   capital market law
   tax law
   competition law
   product liability and recall risks
   environmental risks
   corruption  fraud
   leoni code of ethics  social charta
   information security  data protection

                                       tigations under competition law in the automotive supply sector and the european commission commenced
                                       proceedings in this regard on 3 august 2012 against leoni ag among others as part of these proceedings
                                       the commission investigated whether competitors breached competition law in the sale of cable harnesses
                                       in europe as also reported the eu commission imposed a fine of  1378 k on leoni ag and one of its french

                                       and december 2009 although not itself involved in this violation leoni ag as the group holding company
                                       assumes joint liability for this violation as determined under the stipulations of european law the customer
                                       did not suffer any damage due to the alleged conduct the possibility cannot be ruled out however that this
                                       or another customer or a third party might attempt to assert claims leoni believes that it would be able to
                                       successfully defend itself against any such claims

forecast

business and underlying conditions
macroeconomic conditions
in the imfs view the global economy will on the whole gain pace in 2014 and will from todays perspective
register 37 percent growth a tailwind is likely to stem above all from further recovery in the industrialised
countries which might be able to raise their overall economic output by about 22 percent the eurozone in
particular should present a significantly better picture than in the previous year it is likely to arrest its down
trend and for the first time in years to generate moderate growth of 1 percent again economic forecasters
also project considerably greater momentum for the united states growth of 28 percent and the united
kingdom growth of 24 percent
  although the imf forecasts faster growth of 51 percent for the emerging and developing countries as well
this figure is below the original estimates in many regions the beneficial effects of rising exports to the indus
trialised countries are being undermined by a weakerthanexpected trend in domestic demand
  again the imf has referred to the still numerous risks to the generally positive trend among other factors
mentioned are the increased risk of deflation in the eurozone and the uncertainty about the direction of mon
etary policy in the industrialised countries which could threaten global financial stability

                        positive impetus again germanys mechanical engineering companies thus estimate a 3 percent realterms

                          for the german medical technology industry the spectaris association forecasts further export growth in
                        2014 but only sideways movement in the german market

business performance and future direction
the leoni groups business performance
leonis good performance in the automotive business continued in the first few weeks of the current financial
year against this backdrop and given the favourable order situation in both divisions the management board
projects an increase in consolidated sales to approx  41 billion in 2014 we again expect to see the largest
gains in the bric countries including south korea as well as in the united states meaning that the proportions
of total sales generated in these countries will probably rise to more than 18 percent and nearly 15 percent
respectively with respect to germany we have budgeted for a moderate increase and a share of total sales
of about 36 percent while the amount of business in the rest of europe and other countries outside europe is
expected to contract and account for roughly 28 percent and 3 percent respectively the primary reason for
this is the persisting economic weakness in southern europe
 from todays perspective consolidated ebit will rise at a significantly greater rate than sales to more than
 200 million in 2014 we expect beneficial effects to stem from the additional amount of business efficiency
enhancements as well as the restructuring and rationalisation measures applied in 2013 the wire  cable
solutions division will probably account for the majority of this growth the wiring systems divisions ebit is
expected to improve slightly
 our forecast is based on the following assumptions in terms of the markets the growth of the global au
tomotive industry will continue while demand in europes nonautomotive sectors will remain rather muted
the average price of copper in 2014 is projected to be  550 and thus slightly above the previous years level
our wage costs will continue to rise considerably in the lowwage regions of asia and north africa whereas
we anticipate a moderate trend in eastern europe spending on restructuring should be down significantly
 our mediumterm planning is unchanged from todays perspective leoni will generate further gains in
both sales and especially earnings in 2015 we project consolidated sales of  5 billion and an ebit margin
of 7 percent for 2016 this is based on the new projects that went or are going into production in the wiring
systems division in 2013 and 2014 which will then make a substantial contribution to sales as well as steady
growth of the wire  cable solutions division in its bgs automotive cables industry  healthcare and com
munication  infrastructure there will meanwhile continue to be disproportionately strong sales growth in
the bric countries including south korea and in the nafta area
 there will be no fundamental change to leonis business policy in the next two years however we will
adjust our strategic direction to current market developments in both divisions the automotive business
constitutes the core activity where leoni is aiming for the strongest possible growth in addition we will
retain a sturdy mainstay in the nonautomotive market with our focus on the communications infrastructure
industrial and medical technology sectors here too we will gradually enhance our systems expertise leonis
dividend policy continues to provide for a payout of about one third of annual net income


performance of the wiring systems division
the wiring systems division is likely to increase its external sales to approx  24 billion in 2014 together
with a moderate improvement in earnings to more than  120 million the current reporting period is again
characterised by numerous new product startups these new and followon projects will initially contribute
only slightly to the amount of business and will incur substantial preproduction and startup costs but in the
upcoming years this will then increasingly impact on sales and earnings

                        from a regional perspective we expect the business to continue to shift in the direction of asia and north
                        america in 2014 the division will thus take another step closer to the mediumterm strategic target of having
                        sales evenly distributed among the triad markets with respect to enduse customers the business growth is
                        to be based on additional orders from both existing customers and new customers in among other sectors
                        the power sports as well as commercial vehicle industries and also via our portfolio of plugs and connectors
                         the wiring systems divisions global production network will continue to be steadily optimised and ex

                        tions for instance in south america new technologies and processes could in the future be used particularly
                        for automating the production of wiring systems in this field we are already working closely together with
                        several customers interested in such innovative processes


                        performance of the wire  cable solutions division
                        the wire  cable solutions division can be expected to generate sales growth to approx  17 billion in 2014
                        all business groups and regions are expected to contribute with the strongest gains once more likely in the
                        automotive cables business as well as in the nafta area and the bric countries we expect the proportions
                        of the divisions total sales generated in these two areas to rise to just over 18 percent and about 17 percent
                        respectively based on the larger amount of business as well as product mix and productivityrelated bene
                        ficial effects the projected ebit of more than  80 million represents growth significantly outpacing that in

                        standardisation of our it systems will also gradually exert a beneficial effect on earnings

                        pects to be able to gain new customers as well in these important growth regions we will continue to extend
                        our range of products and services in the direction of system solutions in so doing we will focus on our activ
                        ity in the automotive cables industrial and medical technology businesses as well as on selected segments of
                        the infrastructure and communications markets


                        financial and asset situation
                        thanks to the concluded longterm financing measures the extensive existing credit lines and the expected
                        net income the leoni groups liquidity in 2014 is again assured on a lasting basis given the current low level
                        of interest rates we will probably place another borrowers note loan in the amount of  25 million in march
                        we estimate groupwide free cash flow of approx  30 million in 2014 net financial liabilities should come to
                        an amount similar to 2013 at approx  260 million the net income expected for the year will mean another
                        increase in equity from todays perspective taking the equity ratio up slightly to about 36 percent


                        capital expenditure
                        the leoni group will likely spend approx  200 million on property plant and equipment as well as intangi
                        ble assets to prepare for the planned growth of this amount germany will account for about 283 percent
                        eastern europe for 263 percent asia for 194 percent north africa for 93 percent the americas for 98 percent
                        and other european countries for 69 percent

                                                                                                  group management report    forecast      111




in the wiring systems division the amount required for the necessary work to prepare for the numerous new
and followon contracts from the automotive industry will from todays perspective rise to approx
 120 million in regional terms the investment in this division will be relatively evenly spread among
growthrelated and replacement measures in western europe eastern europe north and central america as
well as asia other significant individual projects involve rebuilding and updating the headquarters in kitzin
gen expanding capacity in serbia as well as constructing the new plant in tieling china
 the wire  cable solutions division will probably spend approx  70 million on property plant and equip
ment as well as intangible assets in germany and particularly also in asia as well as north america potential
acquisitions are also being studied in these regions apart from expanding capacity for our core automotive
cables business the focus will be on the medical technology industrial solutions infrastructure and commu
nications sectors the holding company is to account for about  10 million primarily for it projects


procurement
the proportion of leonis business accounted for by materials will remain high in the upcoming year as well
alongside a slight rise in the price of copper we are anticipating further increases in the prices for special insu
lation materials optimising procurement structures and costs therefore has an unchanged high level of prior
ity the wcs division will consequently internationalise its supplier pool further and increasingly combine its
purchasing volumes on a regional basis our regional expansion of strategic providers of development work in
the bric countries is especially important in this respect the wiring systems division will likewise continue to
globally optimise its sourcing which also calls for a system applicable worldwide for managing contracts with
the suppliers that also operate internationally the focus of this activity is on asia and the nafta area


employees
the number of leoni employees will probably rise slightly in 2014 additional recruitment is planned in both
the leoni ag holding company and the wiring systems division at various locations in eastern europe asia
and north america involving new product startups startup training and recruitment plans will support
the imminent ramping up in this division the workforce in the wire  cable solutions division is likely to
remain at roughly the same number our groupwide hr measures this year will focus among other things on
bestpractice activity to optimise and harmonise our hr processes and organisation targeted promotion of
young talent and succession planning as well as project management


research  development
any changes to the focal areas of leonis r  d work will be no more than minor in 2014 in the wiring sys
tems division development work will support the planned future growth with innovative signal and power
transmission solutions the focus in this respect will be on further extending the use of alternative conductor
materials like aluminium in cable harnesses and resolute realisation of potential to optimise costs and weight
another area of activity involves networking between vehicles as well as within vehicles the wire  cable
solutions division will among other things maintain its commitment to the area of green technology

                        the carbon disclosure project and work on further improving our ecological footprint the wcs division will

                        will in the future gradually be audited according to these parameters the plan is furthermore to continue
                        standardising occupational health and safety processes we also encourage our suppliers to prove that they
                        are fulfilling their social responsibility by meeting these occupational health and safety as well as environmen

                             our quality processes are thus to be more closely harmonised across all organisational boundaries and the
                        interfaces between the leoni ag holding company and the divisions are to be made more efficient

                        situation in both divisions especially the new and followon projects in the wiring systems division as well
                        as the ongoing measures to internationalise and enhance efficiency constitute a good foundation for our
                        mediumterm growth and profitability targets the restructuring measures applied last year will also exert
                        positive effect for 2014 we forecast moderate sales growth to approx  41 billion and a significant dispropor

                        liabilities of approx  260 million equity is likely to increase slightly meaning that gearing should again

                        principles of consolidation
                        the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of leoni ag and of all subsidiaries that are either
                        directly or indirectly controlled by leoni ag there is control when leoni ag holds either directly or indi

subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the time of acquisition ie from the time when the group has ac
quired control over the subsidiary inclusion in the consolidated financial statements ends as soon as leoni
no longer has control a change in the ownership share of a subsidiary is without loss of control accounted
for as an equity transaction losses are allocated to the noncontrolling interests even when this results in a
negative balance
  the financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared using uniform accounting policies on the same
balance sheet date as the financial statements of the parent company all intercompany balances income
expenses as well as unrealised profits losses and dividends from intercompany transactions are eliminated in
full
  all business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method based on applying the require
ments of ifrs 3 the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred
measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree for
each business combination the acquirer measures the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree either at fair
value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets
  acquisitionrelated costs are expensed
  any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acqui
sition date subsequent changes in the fair value of a contingent consideration which is deemed to be an
asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with ias 39 either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive
income if the contingent consideration is classified as equity it should not be remeasured until it is finally
settled within equity
  if the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisition date fair value of the acquirers previously
held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss
  goodwill arises and is upon initial consolidation measured at cost if the consideration transferred and the
amount recognised for noncontrolling interest exceeds the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities as
sumed if this transferred consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired
the difference is recognised in profit or loss after goodwill is first accounted for it is tested for impairment
according to ias 36 at least once a year which may lead to an impairment loss impairmentonly approach


shares in associated companies and joint ventures
it is an associated business when leoni can exert significant influence over its operating and financial poli
cies which is the case in principle when between 20 and 50 percent of the voting rights are held
  a joint venture involves the establishment of a separate company in which each venturer has an interest a
joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that
is subject to joint control
  shares in associated companies and in joint venture companies are accounted for under the equity method
the shares are valued with their purchase price on the acquisition date which is increased or reduced respec
tively in the subsequent periods for any changes in net assets of the company such as the proportionate share
of net income or loss and by received dividends the proportionate net income or loss is determined using
the accounting policies described in this note in line with the treatment of fully consolidated subsidiaries the
goodwill included in the carrying amount of companies accounted for under the equity method are no longer

                        ed for under the equity method is reviewed for impairment according to ias 36 provided there are indications

measurement of fair value
the group measures various assets at their fair value on each balance sheet date fair value is the price that an
entity would receive to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date when measuring fair value it is assumed that the business transaction
takes place either on the principal market or if there is no principal market on the most advantageous market
for the asset or the liability the group must have access to the principal market or the most advantageous
market
  the fair value of an asset or a liability is measured on the assumptions on which market participants would
base their pricing of the asset or the liability this assumes that the market participants act in their best busi
ness interest
  a fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset takes account of the market participants ability through
the assets highest and best use or through its sale to another market participant who finds the assets highest
and best use to generate economic benefit

research and development costs
research costs are expensed as incurred
 development costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to customerspecific development contracts
accounted for pursuant to ias 11 or they meet the criteria of ias 38 for capitalisation as an intangible asset
pursuant to ias 11 for customerspecific development contracts that meet the corresponding conditions the
percentageofcompletion method is applied the capitalised amount where payment is expected after more
than one year is disclosed under trade receivables from longterm development contracts the current pro
portion is contained in trade receivables the percentage of completion is determined according to the ratio
of total costs to costs incurred costtocost method the income from development contracts is reported
under sales in the income statement


government grants
a government grant is recognised when there is sufficient assurance that the grant will be received and that
the enterprise will comply with the conditions attaching to it expenserelated grants are recognised as in
come on a systematic basis over the periods necessary to match them with the associated costs grants for an
asset are deducted from the cost of the asset


inventories
inventories encompass raw materials production supplies and goods purchased as well as work in progress
and finished goods they are stated at the lower of cost and the net realisable value raw materials produc
tion supplies as well as goods purchased are evaluated at cost using the weighted average cost formula or
at the lower net realisable value on the balance sheet date the net realisable value is computed based on
the estimated selling price in the normal course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale costs of conversion of work in progress and finished products
comprise alongside the direct costs of production material and production wages proportionate material and
production overhead costs based on standard capacity


noncurrent assets held for sale
a noncurrent asset or a disposal group is classified as held for sale if the related carrying amount is realised
mainly by a sale transaction and not by continued use and if the criteria pursuant to ifrs 5 in this regard are
met if noncurrent assets or a disposal group are classified as held for sale depreciation is ceased and the
company determines the fair value of such assets if the fair value of the assets held for sale or the disposal
group less the selling costs is less than the net carrying amount of the assets a writedown is made on the
fair value less the selling costs if the disposal plan changes and the criteria pursuant to ifrs 5 for an asset or
disposal group that were classified as held for sale are no longer met they are no longer presented separately
but reclassified to the balance sheet item where they were originally recorded they are valued at the lower
of the carrying amount before the asset or disposal group was classified as held for sale as adjusted for any
subsequent depreciation amortisation or revaluation that would have been recorded without classification as
held for sale and their recoverable amount at the date of the decision not to sell

intangible assets
intangible assets comprise patents software licenses and similar rights as well as customer relationships
brands technology and production knowhow acquired in the context of business combinations an intan
gible asset that results from development expenditure is capitalised if a newly developed product or process
can be clearly defined is technically feasible and is intended for either own use or for sale capitalisation also
assumes that the development expenses can with a sufficient degree of likelihood be covered with future
inflow of cash and cash equivalents and the other ias 3857 criteria are met
 intangible assets acquired separately are upon initial recognition valued at cost the costs of intangible
assets acquired as part of business combinations equal their fair values as at the date of acquisition in the
subsequent periods intangible assets are carried at their cost less any accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses measurement in the subsequent periods should differentiate between intan
gible assets with a finite useful life and with an indefinite useful life
 according to ias 38 intangible assets with a finite useful life must be amortised over their useful life the
company therefore in accordance with these requirements amortises development costs capitalised as assets
on a straightline basis and amortises other intangible assets with a finite useful life on a straightline basis
over their useful lives to their estimated residual values which is normally nil other intangible assets with a
finite useful life are mainly software licenses with an estimated useful life of three years as well as customer
relationships with useful lives of six to 23 years as well as technology and production knowhow with a useful
life of five to 15 years in both cases acquired in the context of business combinations the amortisation meth
od and the amortisation period for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end
of each financial year any changes to the amortisation method and the amortisation period due to revision of
the expected useful life or the expected use of the assets future economic benefit are treated as changes in
estimates
 according to ias 38 intangible assets with an indefinite useful life have no longer been amortised instead
such intangible assets must according to ias 36 be reviewed for impairment at least annually and written
down to their lower recoverable amount the review is carried out as at 31 october of each year according to
the same principles as in the case of goodwill the remarks below therefore apply accordingly

                        intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed once a year to determine whether the estimate of as
                        sessment of an indefinite useful life is still justified if this is not the case the assessment is prospectively changed

                        goodwill
                        goodwill from a business combination is upon initial recognition measured at cost calculated as the excess of the
                        transferred consideration over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed after initial recognition
                        goodwill is measured at the acquisition cost less any accumulated impairment losses
                         goodwill is not amortised instead it is in line with the requirements of ias 36 reviewed for impairment at least
                        once a year the group reviews the goodwill for impairment annually as at 31 october a review also takes place if
                        events or circumstances indicate that there might be an impairment loss for the purpose of the impairment test
                        goodwill acquired in the context of a business combination is from the acquisition date to be allocated to the
                        groups cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination this applies

                        have occurred if there are such indications the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and compared
                        with its carrying amount if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount an impairment loss is

financial instruments
a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial
liability or equity instrument of another enterprise financial instruments recorded as either financial assets
or financial liabilities are as a matter of principle presented separately they are reported on a net basis only
where a right of setoff with respect to the amounts exists at the present time and it is intended to settle net
     financial instruments are recognised as soon as leoni becomes a contracting party to the financial instru
ment in the case of regular way purchases or sales in the context of a contract whose conditions provide for
the asset to be delivered within a period of time that is normally determined by the rules or conventions of the
respective market the settlement date ie the date on which the asset is supplied to or by leoni is pertinent
to initial recognition as well as derecognition
     financial assets comprise in particular cash and cash equivalents trade receivables as well as other orig
inated loans and receivables financial instruments held to maturity as well as both primary and derivative
financial assets held for trading purposes
     financial liabilities normally provide a claim for return in cash or another financial asset these comprise
particularly bonds and other securitised liabilities trade liabilities liabilities to banks liabilities under finance
leases borrowers note loans and derivative financial liabilities


financial assets are derecognised when one of the three following conditions is met
   the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from a financial asset are extinguished
   although the group retains the rights to receive the cash flows from financial assets it assumes a contrac
     tual obligation to immediately pay the cash flows to a third party in the context of an agreement that meets
     the requirements of ias 3919 passthrough arrangement
   the group has transferred its contractual rights to receive the cash flows from a financial asset and substan
     tially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of the financial asset have thereby been transferred or
     alternatively when control of the financial asset has been transferred

accruals
accruals are also reported under liabilities accruals are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been
received but have not been paid or invoiced by the supplier


pension and other postemployment benefits
the valuation of definedbenefit pension obligations is based upon actuarial computations using the project
edunitcredit method in accordance with ias 19 changes due to the actuarial assumptions or differences
between the actual development and the original assumptions as well as gains or losses on the pension plan
or plan assets actuarial gains or losses as a difference between the return on plan assets recorded in net
interest expenses and the actual return are recognised in other comprehensive income past service costs are
recognised in the income statement at the time of the change to the plan
 the amount recognised as a defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined
benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly the
value of a defined benefit asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form
of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan
 the interest costs relating to the net obligation are presented under finance costs


other provisions
other provisions are recorded when a present legal or constructive obligation to a third party has been
incurred from past events the payment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated so far as
the group expects repayment for an accrued provision at least in part for example from an insurance policy
such repayment is recognised as a separate asset provided the inflow of the repayment is virtually certain
the provisions are valued according to ias 37 with the best estimate of the amount of the obligation where
provisions do not become due until after one year and a reliable estimate of the payment amounts and dates
is possible the present value for the noncurrent proportion is determined on a discounted basis accrued
interest is recognised under interest expense
 obligations to dispose of an asset and to recultivate its site or similar obligations must be recognised as a
component of acquisition and production costs and simultaneously recognised as a provision in the subse
quent periods this amount added to the asset is to be depreciated over its residual useful life the best possi
ble estimate of the payment obligation or provision is accreted to its present value at the end of each period
 restructuring provisions are recognised when the constructive obligation has arisen according to the criteria
under ias 3772
 accruals are not reported under provisions but rather under liabilities


restructuring cost
costs incurred in connection with restructuring measures are presented in other operating expenses because
such costs do not pertain to the general operating activity of the functional areas and this provides a trans
parent picture of the groups restructuring activity a breakdown of this cost according to the functional areas
shown on the income statement is contained in note 6

                        are computed by dividing consolidated net income due to the leoni shareholders by the weighted average
                        of the number of ordinary shares outstanding during the relevant period the diluted earnings per share are
                        computed by dividing consolidated net income attributable to the leoni shareholders by the total of the

segment reporting
segment reporting is based on the accounting standard ifrs 8 operating segments following the manage
ment approach contained therein which provides for reporting based on the internal organisational and
reporting structure as well as what management uses internally for evaluating segment performance the
segment reporting and designation therefore follows the internal organisational and reporting structure of
the group the group is organised into business units by products and services for the purpose of corporate
governance the group therefore has two segments subject to reporting wire  cable solutions and wiring
systems management monitors the earnings before interest and taxes ebit separately to take decisions on
allocation of resources and to determine the profitability of the segments the ebit is ascertained in line with
the accounting and valuation principles of the consolidated financial statements it also contains the earnings
from measurement under the equity method of joint ventures and associates


key judgments estimates and assumptions
when preparing the consolidated financial statements management makes judgments estimates and as
sumptions that influence the amounts of assets liabilities and contingent liabilities as well as the expense and
income reported on the balance sheet date the uncertainty that these assumptions and estimates involve
can however in future periods cause outcomes that result in major adjustment to the carrying amounts of
the assets and liabilities concerned
 the most significant assumptions concerning the future as well as other key sources of estimation uncer
tainty at the balance sheet date which present a risk that material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the
assets and liabilities will be necessary within the next financial year are explained hereinafter
 testing of the goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life is based on their value in use
noncurrent assets with a finite useful life were also tested for impairment based on their value in use to
estimate the value in use the group must estimate the probable future cash flows of the cashgenerating
units to which the noncurrent asset or goodwill relates and moreover choose a reasonable interest rate to
compute the present value of these cash flows discounted cash flow method the cash flows are extrapolat
ed from the business planning for the next five financial years excluding any restructuring measures to which
the group has not yet committed and material future capital expenditure that would raise the performance
of the cashgenerating units tested the business planning is prepared on a bottomup basis meaning that
the budgeted figures are prepared in detail for each business unit or business group and subsidiary and
condensed to the segments and the group as a whole key planning assumptions are based on the unitsales
projections issued by the carmakers accordingly the recoverable amount or value in use is heavily depend
ent on the projections for quantities sourced the recoverable amount is furthermore heavily dependent
on the discount rate applied under the discounted cash flow method goodwill amounted to  148417 k on
31 december 2013 previous year  149353 k although in the case of two items of goodwill in the wiring
systems division the test for impairment produced positive results of  3101 k and  6157 k the value in use
of the underlying cashgenerating units would all other parameters being equal correspond to their carrying
amounts when increasing the discount rate before taxes by 057 of a percentage point and 173 percentage
points respectively a further increase in the interest rate could therefore entail need for writedown the

                        test was based on the value in use with the projected cash flows extrapolated from the current fiveyear plan
                        the pretax discount rate applied was 1478 percent the test did not find any need for writedown from an

reclassification of preyear amounts
a change was made to the deferred income reductions as at the reporting date in the consolidated statement
of financial position for improved presentation of the asset situation the proportion of deferred items that
will only be realised after more than one year was in the consolidated statement of financial position present
ed under noncurrent assets and not as before within current assets the corresponding figures of the previ
ous year as at 31 december 2012 and 1 january 2012 were adjusted accordingly due to the reclassification as
at 31 december 2012 other current assets are lower by  9073 k than previously presented and now amount
to  80588 k conversely other noncurrent assets amount to  22519 k after the reclassification due to the
reclassification as at 1 january 2012 other current assets are lower by  5274 k than previously presented and
now amount to  71581 k conversely other noncurrent assets amount to  19036 k after the reclassification
     apart from this reclassification changes were made to corresponding figure of the previous year due to ap
plication for the first time of the amended requirements under ias 19 employee benefits ias 19 r this also
affected the item other noncurrent assets details of the impact of ias 19 r on the presented earlier periods
are contained in note 3 where the reclassifications described above have already been taken into account




3  new accounting requirements

new accounting requirements applied for the first time in the financial year

   in june 2011 the iasb issued an amendment to ias 1 presentation of financial statements  presentation of
     items of other comprehensive income which is to be applied for the first time to financial years beginning
     on or after 1 july 2012 the new requirements involve changed grouping of items presented in other com
     prehensive income items that could be reclassified or recycled to profit or loss at a future point in time
     are to be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified the new requirements therefore
     resulted in a corresponding change to presentation of the items in other comprehensive income in leonis
     consolidated financial statements

   also in june 2011 the iasb issued numerous amendments to ias 19 employee benefits ias 19 r this
     amended standard is to be applied for the first time to financial years beginning on or after 1 january
     2013 the adjustments made range from fundamental changes such as removing the corridor mechanism
     which served to spread or smooth the volatility arising from retirement benefit obligations over time and
     the concept of expected returns on plan assets to simple clarifications and rewording the removal of the
     corridor mechanism and the associated recognition of actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive
     income as well as the use of a uniform net interest component for the expected return on plan assets and
     the interest expense on retirement benefit obligations have the greatest impact on leonis consolidated

     keeping the previous arrangements under ias 19 in the 2013 financial year would in principle have had a
     similar impact on the balance sheet items concerned and on profit or loss as in the preceding period pre
     sented above especially the amortisation of actuarial losses with a maintained corridor mechanism would
     thus in turn have had the greatest influence on earnings before interest and taxes

   in december 2010 the iasb issued an amendment to ias 12 deferred taxes recovery of underlying assets
     the amendment clarifies the determination of deferred tax on property measured at fair value and intro
     duces a rebuttable presumption that deferred tax on investment property using the fair value model in
     ias 40 should be determined on the basis that its carrying amount will be recovered through sale it
     includes the requirement that deferred tax on nondepreciable assets that are measured using the reval
     uation model in ias 16 should always be measured on a sale basis the amendment is effective in the eu
     for financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2013 this change to ias 12 had no effect on the leoni
     groups financial position or performance

                             value and defines comprehensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures on measurement of fair value
                             ifrs 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value but rather provides guidance on how
                             to measure fair value under ifrs when fair value is required or permitted ifrs 13 defines fair value as the
                             price that an entity would receive to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
                             between market participants at the measurement date the new requirements resulted in additional
                             disclosure obligations cf note 28 and had no further material effect on the groups financial position or

                             or loss depending on their characteristics and taking into consideration the business models for managing
                             financial assets equity instruments must always be accounted for at fair value but changes in value of
                             equity instruments may be recorded in other comprehensive income so far as this option was established
                             upon their acquisition
                               in october 2010 the iasb issued the second part of ifrs 9 with the new requirements for classifying and
                             measuring financial liabilities in particular these new requirements change the measurement of financial
                             liabilities that are measured through profit or loss by applying the fair value option all other requirements
                             with respect to classifying and measuring financial liabilities were adopted in the new ifrs 9 unchanged
                             from ias 39
                               in november 2013 the iasb issued additions to ifrs 9 which contain new requirements for hedge
                             accounting and replace the corresponding requirements in ias 39 these additions adopt a new general
                             hedge accounting model in the standard which extends the scope of eligible hedged items and hedging
                             instruments a fundamental difference to the previous ias 39 hedge accounting model is the lack of the
                             80  125  per cent bright line threshold for effective hedges and the requirement to perform retrospective
                             hedge effectiveness testing under the ifrs 9 model it is necessary for there to be an economic relationship
                             between the hedged item and hedging instrument with no quantitative threshold however the additions
                             to ifrs 9 include the accounting policy choice to account for all hedges under either the existing ias 39
                             requirements or the new ifrs requirements the iasb has furthermore removed the date for mandatory in
                             itial application from 1 january 2015 that was hitherto contained in ifrs 9 a new date for initial application
                             will not be set until the standard is available in full the iasb has already decided however that ifrs 9 will
                             come into force at the earliest for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2017

                           in november 2013 the iasb issued amendments to ias employee benefits the requirements under
                             ias 19 were revised with respect to contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to the peri

amortisation of intangible assets with a finite useful life was included in the cost of sales in the amount of
 14167 k previous year  14510 k in selling expenses in the amount of  677 k previous year  668 k in
general and administrative expenses in the amount of  4283 k previous year  4298 k as well as in research
and development costs in the amount of  514 k previous year  681 k
  intangible assets with an indefinite useful life were just as the goodwill tested for impairment as at
31 october this involved two brands in the wire  cable solutions division specifically in one cashgenerat
ing unit in each of business group communication  infrastructure and business group industry  healthcare
the impairment tests based the recoverable amount of the respective cashgenerating unit on the value in
use the underlying cash flow forecasts are in each case based on the fiveyear business planning as approved
by the management board the cash flow planning was as a matter of principle on a bottomup basis from
the individual planning of the operating units it took into account price agreements based on experience and
anticipated efficiency enhancements as well as a sales trend based on the strategic outlook the cash flows
after the fiveyear period were in the case of the brand in business group communication  infrastructure
as in the previous year extrapolated by applying a zero growth rate the pretax discount rate applied was
1348 percent previous year 1329 percent in the case of the brand in business group industry  healthcare
a pretax discount rate of 1217 percent previous year 1207 percent was applied for the fiveyear detailed
planning period and thereafter one of 1067 percent previous year 1107 percent which corresponds to a
growth rate of 15 percent after the fiveyear planning period neither impairment test resulted in any need
for writedown in the case of the brand in business group industry  healthcare the value in use of the
cashgenerating unit exceeded the carrying amount of  132 million by just  03 million an increase in the
pretax discount rate by more than 028 of a percentage point would all other parameters being equal take
the value in use of the cashgenerating unit below its carrying amount
  as in the previous year no writedowns on intangible assets were recognised in the 2013 financial year
  there was no appreciation either in this financial year or in the previous year

the groups management holds the basic view that by prudent judgment any fundamentally possible change
to basic assumptions for determining the value in use of the cashgenerating units or groups of cashgenerat
ing units to which goodwill has been allocated would not lead to the carrying amounts of the cashgenerating
units exceeding their recoverable amount in the wiring systems division there are exceptions in the cases of
two cashgenerating units to which relatively small amounts of goodwill of  31 million and  62 million were

tables calculation of the defined benefit obligation with a oneyear rise in life expectancy raises the defined
benefit obligation of the plans as follows in the united kingdom by 232 percent in germany by 254 percent
and in switzerland by 120 percent
  the calculation of sensitivities was as part of an observation performed on a ceteris paribus basis based on
changing an assumption whereas all other assumptions remain unchanged whereby dependencies between
the assumptions are ruled out the method for calculating sensitivities is identical to that for calculating the
net pension obligation

                        consolidated earnings depend on the level of market interest rates any change in this level would impact on
                        the groups earnings and equity the analysis we carry out covers all interestbearing financial instruments
                        that are subject to the risk of changes in interest rates at the end of the 2013 financial year the interest rate

derivatives either no longer met the conditions for hedge accounting or the effects were recorded directly in
the income statement meaning that the risk of changes in interest rates did not affect other comprehensive
income in equity
  when calculating the sensitivity of the interest rates we assume a parallel shift in the yield curve the up
ward shift comes to 50 basis points the downward shift comes to just 25 basis points because of the currently
low level of interest rates a rate of zero interest is applied as the floor with respect to the currencies that are
key to us in this respect the impact of the shift is as follows

as at 31 december 2013 there were no primary financial assets held in the category at fair value through
profit or loss that would have to be included in the presentation the primary financial assets in the availa
bleforsale category as at 31 december 2013 comprise exclusively noninterestbearing equity instruments
they are consequently not at risk of changes in interest rates are not included in the assessment nor are
fixedinterest financial instruments at risk of changes in interest rates and are thus disregarded in our assess
ment neither in the current year nor in the past year were cash flow hedges entered into to hedge interest
rates there was consequently no effect in other comprehensive income


currency risks
although we conduct business mainly in euros or in the local currency of the respective country we are
increasingly faced with currency risks due to the globalisation of the markets
  in the groups holding company leoni ag the corporate finance department deals with the resulting cur
rency risks in collaboration with and based on the conditions set by the currency committee with respect to
limits and terms hedging transactions are executed in line with the existing underlying transactions as well
as the planned transactions
  selection of the hedging instrument to be used is based on regular indepth analysis of the underlying
transaction to be hedged most of the hedging transactions are in pounds sterling mexican pesos polish
zloty romanian lei swiss francs and us dollars the objective is to limit the impact of exchange rate variation
on net income apart from the actual hedging transactions we primarily take advantage of the option of
netting foreign currency items within the group to hedge our operating business activity as a further curren
cyhedging measure as a matter of principle we finance our foreign subsidiaries in their respective functional
currencies by way of refinancing in the corresponding currency
  on the balance sheet date there were currencyhedging transactions amounting to  462404 k previ

their total fair value of  503 k previous year  105 k was recognised in other comprehensive income the
cash flow from the underlying transactions is expected in the 2014 and 2015 financial years the changes in
fair value recognised in other comprehensive income are derecognised via the income statement at the time
the underlying transaction takes effect

                        exchange rate sensitivity
                        changes in exchange rates that are by prudent judgement essentially possible would affect consolidated
                        earnings due to the fair values of the monetary assets and liabilities additional factors would arise that would
                        affect equity due to change in fair value in the context of cash flow hedge accounting we consider the risk of
                        changes in interest rates arising from the currency derivatives to be immaterial which is why it is not included
                        in the assessment

risks related to raw material prices
business within the wire  cable solutions division is sensitive to changes in raw materials prices especially
of copper but also gold and silver for this reason purchase prices for gold silver and especially copper are
hedged by way of future transactions to cover the usual future procurement volume such commodity future
transactions are signed within ordinary business activity and as part of purchasing activity for required raw
materials and therefore need not in line with ias 39 be accounted for as financial derivatives commodity
future transactions that are settled in cash are recognised as derivatives changes in the fair value of which are
recognised in the cost of sales the risks arising from these derivatives are of minor significance to the group


capital management
the primary objective of leonis capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating a
good equity ratio and appropriate gearing to support its business and increase shareholder value
  the group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments based on the change in underlying eco
nomic conditions to maintain and adjust its capital structure the group can make adjustments to dividend
payouts to shareholders repay capital to shareholders or issue new shares in order to have as broad a range
of funding options as possible leoni aims to seek approval during its annual general meeting for all anticipa
tory resolutions no changes to the fundamental guidelines or processes were made in either the 2013 or 2012
financial years leoni controls its capital with gearing gearing is defined as the ratio of net financial debts to
equity
  leoni expects a sustained equity ratio of at least 35 percent due to fluctuation in elements of other com
prehensive income that cannot be influenced and which is even stronger because of the changed require
ments under ias 19 to retirement benefit obligations cf note 3 the equity ratio could temporarily also drop
below this figure with respect to gearing a figure below 50 percent is the target to be met on a lasting basis
during periods of acquisition this ratio may be temporarily exceeded in principle the aim is that capital
spending on organic growth that exceeds the market average can be generated from operating cash flow and
that reducing financial liabilities is possible

due to the short terms of the cash and cash equivalents trade receivables and other current receivables the
fair values largely correspond to the carrying amounts
  the fair values of other noncurrent receivables maturing after more than one year correspond to the pres
ent values of payments relating to the assets in each case taking into account the current interest parameters
that reflect market and partnerrelated changes in terms
  trade liabilities and other liabilities usually mature in the short term the amounts on the balance sheet
represent approximations of the fair value

                        applicable yield curves and taking into account the groupspecific margins for this reason the fair values are
