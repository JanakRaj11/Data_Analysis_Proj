        what is sustainability

                                                                   5

       sumitomo forestrys mission living in harmony with the environment
environmental issues such as global warming have become significant
shared challenges for the people of the world for sumitomo forestry
these environmental challenges are directly and inextricably linked to our
company whose businesses have always been centered around natural
resourcesforests trees and woodsince its establishment protecting
the natural environment is extremely critical not only to preserving
management resources and the foundation of our businesses but also for
the possibilities of leveraging our many years of experience gained through
our core businesses to support solutions for a diverse range of
environmental challenges wood is a natural resource familiar to all having
played a central role in human life for generations and continuing to use
wood resources appropriately is essential we will continue our efforts to                      ry u yano
realize environmental symbiosisliving in harmony with the                         chairman and representative director
environmentas only sumitomo forestry can as an enterprise that takes
pride in our businesses that leverage wood and that recognizes the unlimited business opportunities inherent in such
activities




       preserving biodiversity
interest in biodiversity continues to increase in anticipation of the convening of the 10th meeting of the conference of
the parties to the convention on biodiversity cop 10 in nagoya in october 2010 the targets set in 2002 of
dramatically reducing by 2010 the speed with which biodiversity is lost have not been achieved however and the
situation remains critically severe

the sumitomo forestry group owns vast areas of forest veritable treasure houses of biodiversity we believe that forest
resources are infinitely sustainable resources born of abundant and diverse ecosystems and thus have always managed
forests in biodiversityfriendly ways from a global perspective however forests continue to be lost due to illegal logging
and other activities even in japan many degraded forests can be found that are left alone and unmanaged we believe
we must redouble our efforts to bring back lost forests globally and proactively promote the use of timber and timber
products that contribute to the revitalization of the forestry industry in japan




                                                             6

      focusing on four material issues to realize a sustainable society
                                              the sumitomo forestry group aspiring to the realization of a sustainable
                                              society set forth four material issues in 2007 since that time the group
                                              has advanced specific initiatives in each of the four areas

                                              sustainable procurement of timber is one area illegal logging in natural
                                              forests is an international problem sumitomo forestry confirmed that
                                              absolutely no illegally logged timber is contained in the directly imported
                                              timber and timber products it handles having completed compliance
                                              investigations of all its overseas suppliers of such products in fiscal 2009
                                              we will expand use of timber and timber products made of wood
                                              harvested from sustainably managed forests and focus on plantation
                                              forestry to preserve natural forests and contribute to the revitalization of
                 aki ra ichi kawa
                                              lost forests
      president and representative director

                                              another area is the provision of environmentally friendly homes the need
for excellent longterm housinghighquality homes that can be passed down through generationscontinues to rise
we will continue to create new ways to provide environmentally sound housing using a wide range of approaches
including the ryouonbou design concept that uses the power of nature to enable lifestyles not dependent upon heating
and cooling equipment landscaping that promotes biodiversity and expansion of the renovation business

the third area is the prevention of global warming in fiscal 2009 we launched the carbon offset initiative for all
custombuilt and spec homes in which the co2 released by the timber used in principal structural members during its
lifetime from harvesting to construction is absorbed by plantation forests created on degraded forests in indonesia the
full absorption of the co2 released by the timber used in these houses requires a tenyear commitment to management
and cultivation a commitment we have made and continue to honor in addition the group set new targets to achieve by
2014 having revised the shared targets for reduction of co2 emissions across the group

the fourth area is promoting diversity in the workforce we will not be able to implement the commitments discussed
above nor contribute to society and the global environment without the dedicated efforts of healthy and happy
employees we are committed to empowering employees to achieve worklife balance and to the creation of a
workplace environment in which people from diverse backgrounds regardless of age country of citizenship home
environment etc can work energetically together in harmony and take pride and have confidence in their work we are
focusing particularly on expanding opportunities for women in the workplace we firmly believe this will lead to greater
global competitiveness enhance the vitality of the workforce and create a new sense of values for all employees


 four material issues
      providing timber products and materials from sustainable forests
      providing environmentally friendly homes
      promoting global warming countermeasures through our business
      promoting familycentered employee lifestyles

       sumitomo forestry groups history and role
the history of sumitomo forestry dates back about 300 years in japans meiji era sumitomo carried out a largescale
reforestation plan to restore the mountain forests of besshi in the shikoku region after pollution from smelting and
mining operations damaged the area planting as many as one million trees a year over several years sumitomo
succeeded in returning the mountains back to their original lush conditions the spirit behind this preservation
forestry allowed resources to be continually utilized in a pattern of logging followed by planting and eventually led to
the concept of sustainable forestry as a leading company in sustainability sumitomo forestry is harnessing this spirit in
its current operations

society has significantly changed in recent years as a result of global environmental problems and social issues that have
emerged as a corporate group that conducts forest management and provides timber and homes sumitomo forestry
group believes that it can play a significant role in resolving these problems

                      i am impressed that sumitomo forestry has been practicing sustainability for as long as 300 years i expect it to
                      take even stronger leadership in restoring the environment back to health business partner




       csr management approach
the sumitomo forestry groups corporate philosophy advocates utilizing timber as a renewable healthy and
environmentally friendly natural resource and contributing to a prosperous society through all types of housingrelated
services in order to realize this philosophy and to develop corporate integrity deserving of the trust of society it is
imperative to achieve a balance among the three csr aspects of economic social contribution and environmental
activities in this context so that each and every employee can consider the significance of their own tasks behavior
and interaction with society from a csr perspective as well as respond to the expectations of society we have
formulated a statement entitled our work and csr as a point of reference for group employees in considering what
should be held most important in relation to their actions we formulated the statement our values and ideals

there are many social issues that need to be resolved in order to create a sustainable society what are the issues which
sumitomo forestry should focus on and work to help solve
sumitomo forestry has determined four material issues to focus on taking up issues that are particularly relevant to our
company in determining these issues we believed that it was important not only to focus on items that we find
important but that it was also essential to consider the expectations that society has for us as a company for this
reason we sought to gather the opinions of our stakeholders

        kikorinplywood  giving birth to a sustainable cycle of timber resources

one of the few forested nations in the world indonesia is an important supply base for the raw materials used in
sumitomo forestrys products illegal and excessive logging and huge forest fires however have caused a rapid decline
of once abundant natural forests and it is said that indonesia is leaning in the direction of regulation of the use of natural
forests by the timber industry

sumitomo forestry set forth its timber procurement philosophy and policy
in 2007 with the goal of preserving forests in japan and the world through
the use of sustainable timber resources in order to continue production
operations in indonesia without reducing the natural forests the company
began switching over to use of timber from forests certified as being
managed in a sustainable manner known as certified timber and timber
from plantation forests for the products we manufacture in 2008
sumitomo forestry set the goal of increasing the share of this kind of
sustainable timber to 50 of all imported plywood products by 2011 to
facilitate the use of certified timber the company acquired coc
certification1 from fsc2 and pefc3 and has been proactively promoting
distribution of certified timber

aiming to further these efforts in november 2009 the company launched a new environmentally sound plywood named
kikorinplywood this revolutionary product offers not only high quality as plywood but also a comprehensive
approach to environmental sensitivity more than 50 of the timber used to manufacture kikorinplywood comes
from forests certified by fsc or pefc as well as from plantation forests that are sustainably managed in japan where
environmental consciousness is budding we believe sumitomo forestry must assume leadership introduce new
environmentally sound products and further increase environmental consciousness across the market



         kikorinplywood  what is it

      kikorinplywood is plywood containing at least 50 timber
      harvested from forests certified by fsc or pefc or from
      plantation forests in indonesia and other countries




                                                              21

plantation timber presented a number of challenges because of its different nature than lauan timber which was used
previously compared with lauan plantation timber has a lower specific gravity and also a smaller diameter making it
difficult to process using conventional manufacturing facilities plantation timber is also prone to warping due to higher
moisture content the production of highquality plywood became commercially viable as a result of extensive research
and development as well as trial and error

pt kutai timber indonesia ktihttpwwwkticoid a sumitomo forestry group company works in cooperation
with local residents to cultivate plantation timber including falcata albizia falcataria using the social forestry4 method
which contributes to the improvement of the lifestyles of local residents kti provides seedlings free of charge to local
residents who then plant them on their farmland or gardens this enables a stable supply of plantation timber even on
java island where it is difficult to secure large areas of land for plantation forestry this secure supply makes it possible
to clearly identify the percentage of kikorinplywood s content that comes from environmentally sound timber

we believe that this environmentally sound plywood was made possible through the trust weve built over many years by
treasuring relationships with our suppliers and customers and by operating in ways that serve the people of local
communities

to maintain high quality sumitomo forestrys local representatives and
technology instructors conduct exhaustive quality control and production
management during the manufacturing process at kti and all group
affiliated facilities

kikorinplywood which is made from environmentally sound raw
materials is shipped with the mark of kikorin quality printed on the side
this marking indicates the product possesses kikorin quality the level of
quality for which the sumitomo forestry group takes responsibility




                                                     a portion of the revenues from kikorinplywood is invested in plantation
                                                     forestry operations in this fiscal year investments were made in
                                                     plantation forestry operations in indonesia where sumitomo forestry is
                                                     endeavoring to revitalize degraded forests and bring back the forests
                                                     when our customers buy kikorinplywood they are indirectly
                                                     contributing to the protection and revitalization of forests and the
                                                     preservation of biodiversity




realizing the companys philosophy of timber procurement from sustainable forests would not be possible without the
cooperation of our customers suppliers and partners sumitomo forestry will expand distribution of kikorinplywood
enhancing the understanding and enthusiastic adoption of a product that embodies our philosophy thus contributing to
the creation of a cycle of sustainable use of timber resources

     comments from the development manager
kikorinplywood is a product that represents our efforts to realize the
companys timber procurement philosophy by expanding the handling of
such products i believe we can increase environmental consciousness in the
timber industry and lead the entire industry in the direction of sustainability
i believe we have a duty to do so as a company whose businesses are
centered on wood the irreplaceable natural resource

                                                the launch of an environmentally sound plywood product like kikorin
                                                plywood is a tremendously good thing even an environmentally
                                                sound product however doesnt make sense if the quality is poor
                                                kikorinplywood meets our standards for quality and delivery while

                                                like to see sumitomo forestry pursue topquality products and stable

                                                products like this heightening environmental consciousness

                                             sustainable timber procurement

     revised action plans based on timber procurement philosophy and policy
    the sumitomo forestry group set forth its timber procurement philosophy and policy in fiscal 2007 and has been
    steadfastly executing the action plan for promoting procurement of sustainable timber in fiscal 2009 having
    achieved targets broadly with the exception of those items whose target completion was scheduled for fiscal
    2010 the new action plan setting targets for fiscal 2010 and beyond was promulgated expanding the use of
    timber from certified plantation and domestic forests and continuing to ensure 100 legal compliance of timber
    and timber products imported directly are two areas of priority focus for the group as a whole




                                                                         24

      sumitomo forestry protecting the worlds forests handling
                   environmentally friendly timber
           what are sumitomo forestrys priority initiatives


    expanding environmentally friendly timber around the world

trees are one of the few truly renewable resources on the
planet natural forests are being lost however to illegal
logging overharvesting and forest fires
in order to continue using tree resources shifting to the
use of timber from appropriately managed natural forests
or from plantation forests with an established cycle of
plantation  cultivation  harvest  plantation is
essential
thus sumitomo forestry is expanding the use of timber
from certified plantation and domestic forests
contributing to the sustainable use of forest resources
and to the protection of the global environment



      timber from certified forests

timber from certified forests refers to timber harvested
from forests certified to be properly managed by an
independent nonprofit nongovernmental body that
conducts investigations of forest management and
forestry operations timber from certified forests is
certified to be not only legally compliant and from
sustainable resources but also for the consideration given
to the environment including biodiversity and the local
community




   expanding the handling of timber from certified forestsp30




      timber from plantation forests

sumitomo forestry defines timber from plantation
forests as timber harvested from forests that have
established a cycle of planting cultivating and
harvesting trees then starting the cycle over again with
planting of more trees the use of timber harvested from
properly managed forests can be said to enable the use
of trees without any permanent depletion of resources

      timber from forests in japan

sumitomo forestry handles timber from forests in japan that have been properly managed
largescale reforestation was conducted in postwar japan but because japanese timber was not
competitive in many respects with imported timber it was not used and the forests came to be
neglected

the proactive use of japanese timber enables the cycle of harvesting reforestation and maintenance
such as thinning leading to the revitalization of forests and preservation of national lands moreover
use of japanese timber contributes to the prevention of global warming through absorption of co2

   promoting joint operations for efficient forest managementp32


   conservation and sustainable use of japanese timber resourcesp144




    using only legally compliant imported timber and timber products
    never illegally logged timber

illegal logging of trees is a serious problem because it
leads to destruction of forests loss of natural resources
and disruption of ecosystems
sumitomo forestry never uses illegally logged timber of
course as a company that handles timber timber is
imported from many countries each with its own
distribution channels making it difficult to investigate the
procurement process of each




sumitomo forestry validates the traceability of all directly imported timber and timber products all the
way back to the location of the logging ensuring its legal compliance
protecting the worlds forests from illegal logging is our duty and responsibility as a leading company
deeply involved with timber and timber products we will continue to ensure that 100 of the directly
imported timber and timber products we handle is confirmed as legally compliant




achieved 100 use of legally compliant timber and timber productsp29

logged timber is handled sumitomo forestry conducts investigations to confirm the legality of all overseas
suppliers of logs timber and wood products as necessary local representatives and responsible managers from
sumitomo forestry visit the forests and logging operations seeking to increase the reliability of the investigations
in fiscal 2009 and continuing from fiscal 2008 all 163 overseas suppliers were confirmed to be in compliance for
the three years since fiscal 2007 the companys directly imported timber and timber products were confirmed to

setting sustainable forestry standards
in fiscal 2008 sumitomo forestry began an examination to clarify the standards by which we define sustainable
forestry in order to set the standards discussions were held with not only relevant departments within the
company but also with third parties such as nongovernmental organizations ngo involved with the environment
and the forestry agency of japan the standards set forth in the united nations conference on environment and
developments declaration of forest principles and the montreal process were also studied

timber from plantation and certified forests is generally considered to be from sustainable forests but the
natural regeneration of north american broadleaf trees can also be said to be sustainable at the present time it is
extremely difficult to set clear standards

sumitomo forestry will continue to pursue sustainable procurement of timber with the initial target of expanding
our use of timber from compliancecertified plantation forests and certified forests



maintaining forestry certification of companyowned forests and continuous
improvement
sumitomo forestrys companyowned forests located in hokkaido shikoku kyushu and wakayama cover a total
area of 42642 hectares about 1900 of japans land area these forests are managed in an environmentally
sound and sustainable manner

sumitomo forestryowned forests acquired certification from japans sustainable green ecosystem council
sgec1 in september 2006 meaning that a third party has verified that the forests are properly managed in
fiscal 2009 the forests were inspected for the third time since earning forestry certification and it was
determined that sumitomo forestry has taken appropriate measures to preserve biodiversity among other issues
in addition 9735 hectares of forests acquired in kyushu and shikoku through april 2009 were also certified by the
sgec

expanding forestry plantation land overseas
sumitomo forestrys group companies outside japan are increasing their use of plantation timber and promoting
plantation forestry operations to ensure stable supply of raw materials while protecting the environment in fiscal
2009 the group planted 4313 hectares

in fiscal 2009 sumitomo forestry jointly launched a largescale commercial forest plantation business in
cooperation with alas kusuma group a company involved in the forestry and plywood manufacturing businesses
in indonesia this operation contributes to not only preservation of biodiversity and reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions but also contributes to the economic development of the local community by providing employment for
local residents in commercial forest plantation operations

this initiative classified indonesias lowland forests and peatswamp forests which have been degraded by illegal
logging and slashandburn farming into three areas 1 forests preservation zones 2 buffer zones and 3
forestation zones by further classifying plantation areas by environmental factors such as soil composition and
moisture content the initiative is able to optimize forestation operations to local environmental conditions
forestation program planning utilizes leadingedge satellite information technology acquired through joint research
with the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxas space open lab system

the aim is to enable sustainable commercial plantation forestry that contributes to the preservation of biodiversity
through appropriate designation of forest preservation zones mosaic planting wherein forestation is undertaken
only in designated areas suited for that purpose and the aggressive introduction of indigenous species an
experimental plantation was launched in october 2009 and full plantation operations will begin in 2010 the plan
calls for 40000 hectares to start with rising ultimately to 280000 hectares

promoting joint operations for efficient forest management
to maximize the functionality of forests proper maintenance of forestsclearing away of underbrush pruning
and thinningis vital but in japan the large number of owners holding small parcels of land makes it difficult to do
so efficiently

as a result maintenance of forests and usage of domestic timber are delayed diminishing the vitality of forests
and creating a significant problem to break through this problem increasing efficiency of forest maintenance
through joint operations between owners of forests in japan is necessary

aiming for a revitalization of forestry in japan sumitomo forestry signed an agreement to promote forest
maintenance between owners of national private and public forests and also began joint forest maintenance
operations with oji paper co ltd in fiscal 2009 the first joint operation of its kind in japan between two
corporations holding largescale forest assets

expanding use of domestic timber
sumitomo forestry timberland management co ltd which procures and sells domestic timber is actively
promoting the use of japanese timber

in order to increase demand for japanese timber it is necessary to provide products with consistent quality not
just quantity in fiscal 2009 the company began selling japanese timber products using a companydeveloped
standard the fs forest service grade the other companydeveloped standard is mizdas1 but fs grade was
specifically developed for widespread and popular adoption to promote the expanded sales of japanese timber
products on a national scale

in addition the company endeavored to utilize wood left over from logging and to realize lowcost forestry by
transporting logs directly from intermediate bases in mountains and by scaling up of joint operations going
forward the company will focus on increasing sales of fs grade products as well as through continued operations
such as these to advance sustainable forestry and forest management thereby expanding the volume of japanese
timber handled

production of housing materials and furniture using japanese timber
sumitomo forestry developed and started sales of the monbetsu no mori line of furniture that makes effective use
of thinnings of broadleaf trees harvested from companyowned forests primarily in monbetsu hokkaido

the company is actively involved in the use of domestic timber in the houses it builds and has increased to 70
the ratio of domestic timber used in principal structural members in addition to structural members aiming to
proactively use domestic timber in furniture the company launched the monbetsu no mori project with 11
member companies which advances the development of furniture that leverages the best qualities of domestic
timber and the best qualities of wood

thinnings which are curved and wood left over from logging are difficult to process into timber products and have
conventionally been used primarily as raw materials for pulp or as fuel in the form of firewoodor disposed of
unused the monbetsu no mori brand of interior furniture is the result of investigation into the effective use of
thinnings from broadleaf and other trees the thinnings from broadleaf trees used as raw materials for the
monbetsu no mori brand come from sgec1certified forests going forward the products will be marketed carrying
the sgec label

by promoting the supply of thinned timber from broadleaf and other trees to companies that support and endorse
these types of projects the company is encouraging the proactive use of domestic timber and supporting the
revitalization of domestic forests and protecting the environment thus contributing to the achievement of the
governments goal of 50 selfsufficiency in timber

                        sumitomo forestry building homes creating forests

sumitomo forestry effectively uses japans forest resources to promote both vibrant forests and revitalized local
communities about 70 of the principal structural members used in the homes sumitomo forestry builds come from
domestic timber including super cypress laminated engineered wood for posts and foundations made from japanese
cypress kizure panels for durable facings using thinned timber from japanese cedar and other trees and other products
as part of its efforts to utilize domestic timber the company is also promoting the use of local timber in the
communities where the timber was harvested including hokkaido nagano ehime nara and yamaguchi in nagano
prefecture for example the majority of principal structural members used in houses built in nagano are made from
timber harvested locally including shinshu japanese larch




nagano prefecture possesses abundant timber resources as forests cover about 80 of the land area of the prefecture
the area was planted with japanese larch which thrives even in areas with little rainfall in the postwar period and the
area is rich in natural resources output of timber in the region has fallen to onesixth of its peak 40 years ago however
due to prices remaining stagnant for decades inadequate logging roads and lack of forestry workers


                                                            34

when there is no demand for mature trees forests are neglected and thinning and other required maintenance are
postponed as a result the forests deteriorate and lose the beneficial functions that serve the public good such as
preservation of national lands and cultivation of water resources as well as losing the ability to absorb and store co2
the cause of global warming
sumitomo forestry contributes to revitalization of japans forests and their multifaceted benefits by proactively using
timber grown in nagano prefecture stimulating interest in forestry among owners of forests promoting proper
management and repeating the cycle of harvesting mature trees then replanting in plantation forests

use of locally grown timber also serves to stimulate forestry and the economy of the area

mr koaizawa secretary of the toshin timber center cooperative federation the timber supply base for eastern nagano
prefecture commented on the need to build infrastructure and the potential effects thereof saying nagano
prefecture is proud to be number two in japan for the quantity of japanese larch stocks behind only hokkaido but the
output of timber from nagano in fiscal 2008 was equivalent to only 03 of the total available this shows that while
nagano prefecture possesses abundant timber resources they are not being used effectively if hypothetically that
number could be tripled to 10 of the total the contribution to local employment and the economy would be
significant i believe that with construction of logging roads and installation of highperformance equipment this number
is definitely achievable

mr saito president of saito wood industry co ltd a naganobased manufacturer of principal structural members
made from shinshu japanese larch for use in sumitomo forestry home houses commented on the stimulating effect of
increased logging on the local economy saying if more homebuilders were to actively use locally grown timber
demand for local timber would grow resulting in more logs being harvested from the mountains in turn i would need to
quickly invest in plant and equipment at the factory and also hire more workers to handle the increased production
volumes

local customers often say they would like to use timber grown in local forests in the area they were born and raised in
the homes they plan to live in for rest of their lives fulfilling the wishes of local residents who want to use trees grown in
the region contributes to local economic development through the cycle of harvesting replanting and managing healthy
plantation forests

building homes begins with creating forests sumitomo forestry building homes is linked to creating forests in japan
sumitomo forestry as a builder of 10000 wood construction homes annually continues the creation of healthy forests
in japan and supports the livelihood of the people involved with forests



         comments from business partners

   to realize the governments target of 50 or higher selfsufficiency
   in timber in japan in ten years time as set forth in the plan to
   revitalize forests and forestry it is necessary to create sales and
   distribution channels matched to upstream midstream and
   downstream industries through consolidation of forest management
   and to aim for the creation of a steady flow of transactions less
   affected by swings in demand from the perspective of one who is
   dealing with timber transactions every day i believe it is necessary
   for companies like sumitomo forestry who are fully integrated
   businesses from upstream to downstream to take the initiative to
   drive results

   further i would like to see sumitomo forestry as a leading
   homebuilder appeal to the general public broadly and in an easyto
   understand manner about the importance of proactively using domestic timber and the necessity of creating
   systems to do so that would have a significant impact going forward on the improvement of japans
   selfsufficiency in timber

                                                    since the promulgation of the kyoto protocol in 1997 concern over
                                                    global warming has risen every year corporate efforts to reduce
                                                    greenhouse gases and the role of forests in absorbing co2 are at the
                                                    center of attention i look to sumitomo forestry to make even
                                                    greater contributions toward the realization of a lowcarbon
                                                    recyclingcentric environmentally symbiotic society through the
                                                    construction of wooden houses that proactively use domestic
                                                    timber including locally grown timber




    current state of japans forests
japan is a country blessed with abundant forest resources forests cover approximately 70 of japans land area
and approximately 40 of those forests are artificial forests planted and cultivated by man1 the pressing problem
in japan today is the neglect and subsequent deterioration of these artificial forests

to meet demand for timber during the postwar period trees such as japanese cedar and japanese cypress which
are wellsuited for use as construction materials were planted on mountains across japan given the long time
required for the saplings to grow into mature trees that can be used in construction materials however it became
necessary to rely on imports to meet the demand for timber imported timber could be ordered in large quantities at
cheap prices resulting in a sudden spike in domestic consumption of timber at the same time however domestic
trees ready for harvest were not price competitive and the domestic forestry became unprofitable as a result
owners of forests lost interest in forestry and many of the plantation forests were neglected

    role of forests
healthy forests serve the public good through accumulation of water resources and other benefits not only do
forests provide wood resources as the trees grow they also absorb and store co2 a cause of global warming and
provide habitats for plants and animals




                                                                 36

   reasons to use domestic timber
while extensive plantation forests were planted in postwar japan japanese timber was not competitive against
imports for a variety of reasons use of domestic timber declined and japans forests were neglected lack of
maintenance led to deterioration of the forests and slow growth of root systems that protect the soil leading to
landslides during times of heavy precipitation also as trees mature their growth slows and co2 absorption via
photosynthesis decreases proactive use of domestic timber promotes the cycle of harvesting planting and
maintenance that supports the development of healthy forests contributing to revitalization of forests protection of
national lands and reduction of global warming

sumitomo forestry carries out life cycle assessments lca to
evaluate the environmental impact of a home throughout its life
cycle from the procurement of raw materials to the houses
construction occupancy and demolition according to lca a
homes environmental impact comes primarily from energy
consumption during occupancy accounting for 7080 of its total
energy consumption this inspired sumitomo forestry to propose
the ryouonbou design concept which cuts energy consumption
during occupancy as well as solar power systems and solar hot
water systems in order to lower a homes environmental impact

                                    excellent longterm housing

providing excellent longterm housing
compared to houses in european countries which last an average of about 100 years houses in japan typically
have a life span of only about 30 years and consequently continuous rebuilding has a serious environmental
impact

sumitomo forestry believes that popularizing excellent longterm houses that become social assets is vital for
creating a prosperous society as such the company is promoting the following four policies to extend the life of
houses

   make houses more reliable by improving their basic functions
   create comfortable living environments
   increase future options for layout to accommodate changes in lifestyles
   enhance maintenance programs to support longterm upkeep

the japanese government implemented the excellent
longterm housing promotion act in june 2009 issuing clear
guidelines emphasizing the importance of excellent houses and
their maintenance for longterm occupancy building houses
certified as excellent longterm houses not only reduces
the costs incurred with repeated rebuilding but also reduces
waste generation and environmental impact in the longterm
such houses foster more prosperous lives




as part of these measures the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit is promoting its
ultralonglife house leading model project sumitomo forestry submitted its houses to the first model project
and succeeded in having three of its ultralonglife models chosen for the project in fiscal 2009 three sumitomo
forestry housing designs were selected as excellent longterm house leading model projects by the mlit
continuing a trend started in fiscal 2008 when three designs were also selected as the first leading model projects
the myforesttaiju myforestbfsi and myforesthokkaido all excellent longterm housing model project 21
series were recognized for basic functionality proactive use of domestic timber structural frameworks that
increase seismic resistance and improve durability and extensive maintenance programs

carbon offsets for housing construction
sumitomo forestry uses plantations to absorb the co2 emitted over the lifetime of principal structural members
from the harvesting of timber to the construction of housing in order to offset the co2 emitted by all the
custombuilt and spec homes we will sell in the five years beginning with fiscal 2009 we plan to plant
approximately 2000000 trees on 1500 hectares of land in the fiveyear period then manage and cultivate the
trees for another ten years in fiscal 2009 we conducted environmental reforestation on 60 hectares of protected
forests in indonesias bromo tengger semeru national park

increasing the share of domestic timber used
to promote the use of japanese timber and revitalize the japanese timber industry sumitomo forestry has been
working to achieve its goal of raising the percentage of japanese timber used in principal structural members for
houses to about 70 this goal was achieved in fiscal 2008
advances are also being made in local production for local consumption where timber is harvested and used
locally in areas such as hokkaido nagano and ehime

continue appropriate disposal of waste from new construction
sumitomo forestry is aiming to achieve zero emissions from construction of new homes in fiscal 2009 80
of waste materials generated from new construction was recycled

sumitomo forestry deployed industrial waste traceability systems in ten offices in japan the system applies ic
tags to industrial waste which is separated and picked up separately and sends back information in an electronic
manifest allowing for tracking of the movements of the waste this system will enable the accurate measurement
of the volume of waste generated as well as contribute greatly to the elimination of illegal dumping

                        reducing environmental impact during occupancy

the ryouonbou design method
sumitomo forestry uses the ryouonbou design method as a technology for passive reduction of environmental
impact ryouonbou leverages the wisdom and techniques that characterize traditional japanese houses in skillfully
using natural forces to create a comfortable living environment without reliance upon cooling and heating
equipment during summer wind design blocks out the suns rays and creates a path along which air can flow
creating a cooling sensation during winter sun design captures the heat of the sun not allowing it to escape
green design uses greenery as a natural air conditioning unit ryouonbou combines elements of each design
direction to create a naturally comfortable and comforting home

through the introduction of ryouonbou design test calculations using model plans demonstrate the potential to
reduce co2 emissions during occupancy by up to 40 compared with houses built to the new energy efficiency
standards



                      i think a home that is cool in summer and warm in winter is a comfortable house and economical too i think it
                      would be great if this could be applied to not only houses but to retail stores offices and schools too
                      customer



utilization of solar power
sumitomo forestry is utilizing solar power as an active technology to reduce environmental impact its myforest
solabo co2conserving promotion model boasts a double solar system combining a solar power generation and a
solar hot water system this reduces co2 emissions by about 651 compared to a house built to meet 1992
energy conservation standards

the solar hot water system uses mediumheat antifreeze that absorbs heat circulating in a roofmounted solar
thermal energy panel the antifreeze heats up water stored in a tank and a gas heater adjusts the water
temperature to appropriate levels for home use this system ensures a stable hot water supply and also makes
significant contributions in reducing co2 emissions during occupancy given that hot water systems account for
about 30 of an ordinary households energy consumption and the use of solar energy as heat in its original form
ensures efficient energy use

 ibaraki prefecture it is also based on certain assumptions in sumitomo forestrys model plan and could differ from reality

       plantation forest operations to offset co 2 emitted by principal structural
           members from harvesting of timber to construction of housing

from april 2009 sumitomo forestry began a program of using plantations
to absorb the co2 emitted over the lifetime of principal structural
members from the harvesting of timber to the construction of housing
the principal structural members used in housing generate approximately
six tons of co2 per unit from the cutting down of timber to actual
construction it is possible to offset this by planting trees on land area
equivalent to two times the floorspace of the house and cultivating these
trees for ten years in order to offset the co2 emitted by all the
custombuilt and spec homes sold during the fiveyear period beginning
with fiscal 2009 we plan to plant approximately 2000000 trees on 1500
hectares of land during the five years then manage and cultivate the trees
for another ten years

there are two methods of tree plantation environmental reforestation
whereby timber is not cut down and industrial reforestation where mature trees are cut down and used as raw
materials for processed wood products

 how carbon offsets work




                                                          43

                                                  in fiscal 2009 we conducted environmental reforestation on 60 hectares
                                                  of protected forests in indonesias bromo tengger semeru national park
                                                  in this park located on expansive highlands at an altitude of 1700 to 2500
                                                  meters the majority of the park was grasslands having been degraded by
                                                  repeated forest fires and sulfurous acid gas released by mount bromo
                                                  here aspiring to recreate a verdant forest environment we planted trees
                                                  native to the soil including casuarina junghuhniana miq and schima
                                                  walichii




further we have begun monitoring animals insects and plant life in
conjunction with indonesian universities and research institutions in order
to survey the impact of plantation activity upon biodiversity these surveys
are investigating the effects of plantation forestry upon the remaining
natural forests in the national park as well as the impact upon the
surrounding environment as forests recover as a result of plantation
activity surveys to date have shown mammalian species such as old world
monkeys cercopithecidae and avian species are inhabiting both the
natural and plantation forests we will continue the surveys to shed further
light upon the relationship between plantation activity and biodiversity




from fiscal 2010 we are working in cooperation with local residents to conduct sustainable industrial reforestation in
areas outside of the protected forests in the abovementioned national park the local residents will share in the profits
when the timber is harvested in several years with the remainder allocated to cover the costs of reforestation and
cultivation of forests creating a new source of income for the people of the region we are committed to plantation
forestry that contributes to the local community through the realization of sustainable forestry management

to communicate the progress of these efforts to people who have actually
purchased a home we publish regular updates on club forest  a dedicated
website for owners of sumitomo forestry homes we will continue to
advance our efforts with carbon offsets and raise awareness of the value of
prevention of global warming and preservation of indonesian forests
amongst our customers




                          i expect big things from the implementation of carbon offsets through plantation activities student
                          i think revitalizing the worlds deforested lands through plantation forestry and creating new employment in
                          local communities are vital to the global economy student
                          with the advent of the ecopoint system for housing i expect environmentally sound housing will grow if the

carbon offset home building is one such initiative using plantations to absorb the co2 emitted over the lifetime of
principal structural members from harvesting of timber to construction of homes we are the first homebuilder to offer
this approach leveraging our long experience with creating forests and contributing to the environment through home
building we believe this corporate stance is linked to increasing customers trust in our company and their peace of
mind

in the marketing strategy department we publish information and provide training for our sales people regarding the
environmental activities of sumitomo ringyo no ie sumitomo forestry home houses including carbon offset home
building we also provide this information to our customers through publication of catalogs and pamphlets we will
continue to proactively provide information about our activities

     comments from an expert authority
everyone wants to have both a sustainable lifestyle and peace of mind
thats not something given however it is something that we must earn
through living life intelligently consumers can play an important role by
selecting products and services that consider the environment

ones home is the foundation of ones life and its a lifelong relationship
thats why its so important to make intelligent choices and only
homebuilders can help reduce the environmental impact of housing during
two stages of its life cycle procurement of resources and during
construction sumitomo forestrys system for carbon offsets is a new
concept and one that is very impressive




i was curious as to how this story was being told so i visited a model home while the salesperson answered my questions
about co2 offsets in detail when asked i think it would be even better if the salesperson proactively volunteered to tell
this story at their own initiative and in a way that excites and inspires customersbecause its such a great system if
consumers dont know about it they cant imagine it which is why telling this story is also csr

                                    in japan and overseas

sumitomo forestry has endeavored to reduce co2 emissions based on the mediumterm environmental management
policy by setting fiveyear targets for fiscal years 2006 to 2010 in three areas of operation offices plants in japan and
plants outside japan

in december 2009 however the group revised the co2 reduction targets in the environmental management midterm
plan due to the difficulty of determining the actual status of co2 reduction activities per sales unit shared by plants in
japan and overseas which is easily impacted by economic downturns

the new targets for plants in japan have been set using appropriate base units for each plant resulting in indicators that
enable much easier management of reduction efforts at the production stage further targets and management
indicators for total emissions emissions per sales unit andor other measures as appropriate to each plant have been
set in consideration of local laws and regulations

at the current time the midterm targets are set for fiscal 2014 we will continue to consider setting of longterm
targets in consideration of the japanese governments movement to set targets for reduction of greenhouse gases as
well as deliberations at the global level

  displaying carbon footprints
 sumitomo forestry crest co ltd began displaying carbon footprints1 on plywood made of japanese timber in
 may 2009 at its komatsushima plant this program to display carbon footprints on wood products is a first in
 japan going forward we will research all carbon footprints of the products which are manufactured at this plant

 from october 2009 pt rimba partikel indonesia rpi began
 displaying the carbon footprint on the particleboard products they
 manufacture and sell this marks the first time that an indonesian
 company has labeled timber products rpi particleboard products
 make effective use of resources using wood leftover from logging
 sawdust and timber from companyowned plantations further the
 companys products are manufactured using low carbon emission
 methods including the use of electricity from a wood biomass power
 generation facility




 1 greenhouse gases emitted during the entire life cycle of the product and service from procurement of raw materials to disposal
    and recycling are converted to co2 to present the data in a more understandable manner

  cdm business using wood biomass for power generation
  at pt rimba partikel indonesia rpi a fourmegawatt wood biomass power facility that primarily burns lumber
  millends and sawdust was approved as a cdm project by the united nations cdm executive board and registered
  as such on may 23 2008 this was the first wood biomass power station in indonesia to be registered as a cdm
  business by replacing its existing diesel generators with wood biomass generators rpi expects to reduce its co2
  emissions by about 15000 tons a year

  the facility began full operations from june 2008 and rpis 2009 co2 emissions were 4859 tons a reduction from
  10033 tons in fiscal 2007 before operations began in fiscal 2010 the estimated co2 output will be 4385 tons



  reducing co 2 emissions from offices
  in order to reduce the co2 generated by offices the sumitomo forestry group sets common targets across all
  group companies and continues to advance its efforts in its offices to the greatest possible extent

  at the companys model homes and showrooms across japan we began from fiscal 2008 to switch over to
  environmentally sound lighting systems in fiscal 2009 we began turning off the daytime lighting on second
  floors when customers are not present in model homes across the nation

  from fiscal 2009 in order to reduce co2 output from offices we specifically focused on activities to reduce the
  amount of electricity and gasoline used in daily business

what challenges do people with disabilities encounter working in companies what ways of working lead to increased
corporate value employees with disabilities and personnel managers came together to discuss these and other
questions joining the discussion was mr makoto hata who has been involved for many years with promoting the
employment of people with disabilities under the philosophy the experience and ideas of employees with disabilities
are linked to improving corporate value

communication in the workplace
what sorts of things do you feel in the course of your daily work
    nemoto i joined the company in december a busy time for everyone at first i had trouble communicating
    well with people but when someone asked me if i wanted to join them in playing sports something outside of
    work well that broke the ice and ive been able to get along well with everyone




                                                        51

tanaka on my first day of work there was a person who wouldnt look me in the
eyes and i felt a little hurt i heard later that person was just surprised because they
hadnt heard that a person with disabilities was coming to work on the other hand
there were people who said may i ask you about your disability which made me
feel grateful in order to avoid misunderstandings its really important that the
people around you understand the nature of the disability




mr hata the understanding of the people around you is really important isnt it when communication
doesnt go well people may lose their confidence build up stress and become unable to continue working if
you write up the nature of your disability and how others can help passing out a single a4 sheet of paper
goes a long way toward increasing understanding of the people around you i recommend that you dont be
shy and appeal to the people around you

nakamaru i grew up in a family with a hearingchallenged person so i know but
even when the nonchallenged person feels im communicating the hearing
challenged person probably has many frustrations its really hard to understand the
subtle nuances in conversations or jokes just through sign language or in writing
and if we arent facing hearingchallenged people directly theres no way we can
catch what they are saying i think it would be good to have training specifically for
how to communicate with hearingchallenged people




kawata for each employee with a disability we arrange for the individual to meet with the people in the
department where theyll be working so they can have a better understanding of the nature of the disability
but it seems we need to do more doesnt it


seharada even though i have a hearing disability i am able to do my work because the members of our
team write a summary of meetings and telephone calls for me people who arent on the team or who are
from other departments dont know about that kind of detailed support


harada there are people who mistakenly believe if i speak in a loud voice a person with a hearing
disability can hear me and often the written notes are too brief and it feels like theyre giving orders when
i ask why or how people will make more detailed memos or send me an email summarizing the
morning briefing for which i am very grateful

shintani before i joined the company i worked for 13 years as a
telephone switchboard operator at a department store i was proud of
that and so in the beginning i deliberately didnt explain about my
disability i wanted to be recognized as a person we can use by
showing people i could do each and every job as a result there were
many difficulties and looking back im not so sure that approach was
a good one but now there are times when my colleagues rely on me
and i feel validated by the people around me


shimizu i think its extremely important for the diversity of employees to communicate with each other and
create a place where its easy for them to work together as a company providing services related to housing
and lifestyles we must embrace employee diversity and stand in each others shoes to foster greater
understanding because that will help us to understand our customers better




                                                  52

    mr hata i heard a story from an apparel company where 8 of the employees are people with disabilities
    in their experience the care that employees with no disabilities show toward employees with disabilities
    manifests itself as consideration for customers by working together every day by learning on a daily basis
    the sense of consideration for others naturally becomes part of that person and this is reflected in their
    behavior people have a tendency to generalize that hiring people with disabilities will lower work efficiency
    but there are many cases where its turned out to be a plus



leveraging disabilities to improve corporate value
as a homebuilder our company is deeply involved in peoples lives how can
we best utilize our people with disabilities to further increase corporate
value
    shintani i asked a few friends for their opinions since i would be participating in
    this discussion visually and physically challenged people have many requests for
    architectural designs that consider the needs of people with their type of disabilities
    i think its vital that we listen and respond to those needs




    seharada if we had a system that leverages of the experience of employees with disabilities where they
    could give advice to the project managers during the design phase i think we could respond to the needs of
    customers with disabilities in very concrete ways


    harada when a friend who is hearing challenged visited the showroom of a
    homebuilder he lost interest because there was no advice or explanation regarding
    features or fittings designed for people with disabilities if we could say we can do
    this and offer ideas matched to the persons disability then im certain they would
    say if thats the case lets build a home with this company




    tanaka im a certified housing environment coordinator for elderly and disabled people i would like to be
    of service to our customers who have disabilities using not only my functional knowledge of facilities for
    people with disabilities but also incorporate the opinions of the people who use them its unfortunate that i
    havent been able to do so id be delighted to use my personal experience and certification in creating a
    catalog for elders and people with disabilities or be involved in the planning of a model house for people with
    disabilities

    seharada id love to visit a model home designed specifically for elders and people with disabilities




    mr hata there is a hotel chain that had an employee with disabilities test the usability of their hotels
    asking the person to speak frankly about the problems they encountered and what they would like and
    reflecting this in a manual no matter how hard a person without disabilities tries to imagine there are things
    that only people with disabilities can understand




                                                      53

ive visited many model rooms and showrooms both our own and those of our
competitors sometimes there isnt sufficient understanding that people can have
different disabilities and also varying degrees of severity of a given disability there
may be times when they feel the salesperson is finding it difficult or troublesome to
deal with them people with disabilities are sensitized to the reactions of people
around them and just the expression on the salespersons face can make them feel
discriminated against in that instant theyll decide im not working with this
homebuilder i think its important to provide information about disabilities to
establish standards for interacting with people with disabilities and not just make
catalogs

harada i heard a story about a hearingchallenged customer who built a house who said i really wanted
to make more detailed requests but communication with the project manager took time and i wasnt able to
say everything i wanted to because i didnt want to cause him any more inconvenience if i could be
involved in the architectural planning for customers with disabilities i think i could be of help with not just the
technical aspects but also with ensuring smooth communications during meetings from the perspective of
the customer

seharada i think customers with disabilities should feel we want them to live in a
house theyll be totally satisfied with




mr hata everyones insights are extremely valuable even from a management perspective if you can
reflect the things you feel every day in your work then youll make a huge contribution to the company



nakamaru i think its such a missed opportunity that we arent utilizing the knowledge of employees with
disabilities perhaps it is necessary for the company to proactively consider how we can efficiently leverage
this knowledge


mr hata if one could search for this knowledge by type of disability you could
share insights matched to specific needs as a first step perhaps you could start by
collecting and collating the voices of all employees with disabilities listening to you
all im delighted with everyones high enthusiasm and desire to help when people
hear employ people with disabilities its easy to think what kind of support
will each disability require but what is important is to first consider how to
leverage the persons individuality and their talents in so doing the difficulties and
struggles people have experienced will be resolved



nakamaru i think the people who have gathered here today are the kind of people who never give up and
keep striving even if they have a disability but i know there must be those who find it difficult to keep going
as a person who doesnt have a disability i was reminded of my mission and role in determining what should
be done next




                                                  54

     response to the discussion

we have learned a lot by listening to everyone speak today
we realize with regret that we werent doing enough to help
with the struggles and difficulties employees with disabilities
experience we want to implement the ideas expressed in the
discussion today ideas that enhance the identity of people
with disabilities starting from the ones that can be done right
away

there was a time when it was thought best to hire people with
the same types of disability and put them in one department
clearly however todays discussion has reemphasized that
we should aspire to a workplace where people with disabilities         koi chi shi mizu        tatsumi kawata
and people without disabilities can work together sidebyside
build mutually supportive relationships and learn from each
other

the group plans to increase the number of people with disabilities we employ together with all of you we will
continue to strive to create a workplace where all employees regardless of whether or not they have a disability
can work with enthusiasm and achieve great things

encourages male employees to take childcare leave surveys are taken of male
employees whose spouses have given birth to a child and childcare leave guides
are distributed to male employees the company intranet is also used to publicize

biodiversity is an essential condition that forms the very foundation for supporting human life currently however
biodiversity is being lost at a rapid pace around the world due to human activity as a company with a deep relationship
with forests sumitomo forestry focuses its resources on the preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity


      biodiversity and sumitomo forestrys operations
wood has been the axis of sumitomo forestrys businesses since our founding centuries ago while many companies are
indirectly involved with biodiversity through their supply chains at sumitomo forestry planting trees and cultivating
forests that support biodiversity is directly and inextricably our businesswe are passionately cognizant of the critical
importance of and our responsibility for biodiversity moreover wood is one of the blessings we receive from
biodiversity if biodiversity is lost we risk losing the foundation of our business thus it is imperative that we are
proactively and aggressively involved with preserving and encouraging biodiversity to an even greater degree than other
companies

                        because youre in an industry that handles timber i expect sumitomo forestry to continue its proactive efforts to
                        preserve biodiversity and engage in sustainable forestry company employee

      policy and plans for biodiversity preservation
sumitomo forestry declared its commitment to preserve biodiversity when it revised its environmental philosophy and
set forth its timber procurement philosophy and policy in fiscal 2007 the company has endeavored to preserve
biodiversity through such initiatives as promulgating its policy on biodiversity preservation in companyowned forests in
japan monitoring animal life preserving riparian forests and publishing the red data book listing all endangered species
that may be living in companyowned forests

                        i firmly believe that sumitomo forestry will be recognized as a company that contributes to the earth a company
                        that protects the forests that nurture life through the implementation of policies that consider the generations

      assessments and evaluations of the linkage between our businesses and
      biodiversity
in fiscal 2009 to identify the impact of our businesses on biodiversity we conducted assessments and
evaluationsfrom the perspective of biodiversityof our operations particularly in those business domains where it is
thought our activities impact biodiversity based on the results each division is engaged in specific activities we seek
out thirdparty perspectives from experts and specialists from ngos and npos to ensure objectivity and actively
advance our activities in an effective manner

         biodiversity activities at plants

   sumitomo forestry crest co ltd in commemoration of the
   merger with the former toyo plywood co ltd is planning
   biodiversity conservation activities optimized for the local
   communities where its seven production facilities are located under
   the shared objective of providing habitats for local species and
   rest areas through conservation of plant life indigenous to the local
   community
   for example at the kashima plant we are planning the cultivation of
   the endangered plant species beach silvertop glehnia littoralis
   which is native to the sandy beaches of kashima as a first step we
   have begun cultivation in planter boxes of seeds received from
   kamisu city
   at the no2 kyushu plant in order to preserve native bird species
   we are scheduled to conduct survey assessments of the status of bird species and cultivation of trees that are
   appropriate for each target bird species we intend to initiate biodiversity conservation programs at each of our
   other plants




      activities going forward
we will continue to promote conservation of biodiversity in not only residential landscaping and biodiversity activities at
plants but also across our business operations

the united nations has designated 2010 as the international year of biodiversity and in october the tenth meeting
of the conference of the parties cop10 convention on biological diversity will be convened in nagoya aichi prefecture
we will continue to contribute to the preservation of biodiversity through the technologies weve developed while raising
awareness of the importance of biodiversity by dissemination of information at a variety of opportunities

we asked environmental journalist yuko sakita to comment on this report


                                          introduction
                                       the companys history of cultivating trees on the land and using them for
                                       housing spans more than 300 years a testament to the foresight of
                                       management in the commitment section the company declares we will
                                       continue our efforts to realize environmental symbiosisliving in harmony with
                                       the environmentas only sumitomo forestry can as an enterprise that takes
                                       pride in our businesses that leverage wood and that recognizes the unlimited
                                       business opportunities inherent in such activities

                                       the united nations has declared 2010 to be the international year of biological
                                       diversity and japan will host the 10th meeting of the conference of the parties
   yuko sakita                         to the convention on biological diversity cop 10 i applaud sumitomo
   environmental journalist
                                       forestry for aspiring to live in harmony with the environment counter global
                                       warming and create a culture of recycling so as to realize a sustainable society
                                       from a global perspective that is firmly rooted in local communities and as a
                                       company whose businesses are directly related to the environment


    visit to the tsukuba research institute
  i visited the tsukuba research institute for the first time to prepare to write this third party evaluation of the
  environmental and social report i was impressed with the consideration being given to preservation of local
  ecosystems through planting of native species during landscaping of homes environmental reforestation in
  indonesia commercial reforestation operations that purchase timber cultivated by local residents to stimulate local
  economies and the passion of the researchers as they worked to protect biodiversity while utilizing forests

  i was able to observe the breadth of research being conducted including development of technologies to make
  timber products from thinnings while utilizing as much japanese timber as possible during construction of housing

  i was especially impressed with the research into housing and lifestyles particularly the ryouonbou concept of using
  nature such as the sun and wind rather than air conditioning to create a comfortable living environment

  the government of japan is also focused on the creation of a sustainable society and has set mid to longterm
  targets for co2 reduction 25 reduction compared to 1990 levels by the year 2020 80 reduction by 2050
  even as targets are being aggressively set however co2 released from homes and workplaces has actually risen
  34 since 1990 making finding solutions to reduce co2 output from peoples lives a critical factor in reducing
  global warming a big part of the solution will be lowcarbon homes and lifestyles and the ryouonbou design
  approach is a powerful and concrete measure that can be taken now the creation of net zero energy homes
  through the use of new technologies in insulation energyefficient equipment and solar power combined
  synergistically with the use of natural winds that flow through rooms and shade from trees will enable the creation of
  comfortable living the environments and lifestyles

  i would like to see technology and nature combined to create comfortable places to live that are just right not too
  hot not too cold and this can be done not just in new houses but also in renovation




                                                           64

  overall impression
the defining characteristic of this environmental and social report 2010 is its focus on defining the most important
ways sumitomo forestry can contribute to the creation of a sustainable society reflecting the voices of employees
and its many stakeholders the company has distilled its mission into four focus areas created road maps declared
its intentions and comprehensively implemented initiatives in its businesses
providing timber products and materials from sustainable forests
providing environmentally friendly homes
promoting global warming countermeasures through our businesses
promoting familycentered employee lifestyles
these four items simply and clearly express the companys posture and this strong message is an asset for a global
company with operations in manufacturing distribution home building and sales around the world i expect
sumitomo forestry to continue developing its businesses in ways that are beneficial for both employees and the
environment honoring its responsibilities to societyas befits a company that became a signatory to the united
nations global compact in 2008and committing to upholding the principles of human rights labor rights
environmental protection and anticorruption

  setting environmental targets
reviewing the primary targets of the mediumterm environmental management plan its clear the company is
making efforts to reduce co2 generated from offices plants in japan and plants overseas the co2 reduction
targets for domestic and overseas plants were previously based upon a per unit of revenue calculation which can be
greatly influenced by global economic recessiontotal co2 emissions are down but co2 per unit of revenue is up
the company is reevaluating the targets by individual plant and i would like to see the company redouble its efforts
to materially reduce co2 emissions as governments continue to fundamentally strengthen measures to counter
global warming i would like to see sumitomo forestry take the lead when it sets new longterm targets

setting targets for recyclable resources and industrial waste the company aims to achieve zero emissions in 2012
through elimination of industrial waste disposal by simple incineration or landfill i would also like to see even greater
efforts from the design stage using environmentally sound design principles for example to create zero emission
houses designed to last generations and also to be easily recycled

  conclusion
this year sumitomo forestry will stop printing this environmental and social report on paper and will shift to
onlineonly distribution this is a very meaningful response to the increased volume of information required by full
disclosure and as a measure to conserve paper resources i would suggest however that a simplified version could
be useful for people considering a custombuilt home and the companys individual investors including many seniors
since they may be less familiar with computer technology a simplified version would be useful in building
relationships of trust in a facetoface setting

further i would like to see the company publish this information in multiple languages on the internet to share it with
the employees of each office and the residents of local communities around the world earning the trust of people
across the globe and growing the company through the creation of a virtuous cycle of environment and
economics

houses have a significant influence on our lives providing a means for living and a source of personal comfort sumitomo
forestry is helping to build a better society by providing homes where people can live for a long time with peace of mind

    providing highquality homes with excellent allround balance

 building longlasting homes
in japan in light of the growing severity of environmental problems in recent years along with the countrys declining
birth rate and aging society homes have come to be regarded as social assets that should be used by subsequent
generations compared to houses in european countries which last an average of about 100 years houses in japan
typically have a life span of only about 30 years and consequently the continuous rebuilding has a serious environmental
impact

sumitomo forestry believes that popularizing excellent longterm houses that become social assets is vital for creating a
prosperous society as such the company is promoting the following four policies to extend the life of houses

   make houses more reliable by improving their basic functions
   create comfortable living environments
   increase future options for layout to accommodate changes in lifestyles
   enhance maintenance programs to support longterm upkeep

the japanese government implemented the excellent longterm housing promotion act in june 2009 issuing clear
guidelines emphasizing the importance of excellent houses and their maintenance for longterm occupancy building
houses certified as excellent longterm houses not only reduces the costs incurred with repeated rebuilding but also
reduces waste generation and environmental impact in the longterm such houses foster more prosperous lives

as part of these measures the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit is promoting its ultra
longlife house leading model project sumitomo forestry submitted its houses to the first model project and
succeeded in having three of its ultralonglife models chosen for the project in fiscal 2009 the myforest taijuexcellent
longterm housing model project 21 myforestbfsi excellent longterm housing model project 21 and myforest
hokkaido specification excellent longterm housing model project 21 were selected as excellent longterm house
leading model projects and as such are eligible for subsidies to cover part of the construction costs

                             i would like to see sumitomo forestry contribute to reforms in housing assessment practices including the
                             implementation of a tax system similar to that in the united states so that prime housing stock becomes a
                             social asset in japan as well ngo
                             i expect sumitomo forestry to promote the introduction of natural energy as well as longlasting houses with
                             reduced chemical substances and improved earthquake resistance citizen



 improving durability
sumitomo forestry has set a minimum expected service life1 of 75 years for principal structural members to ensure that
the houses it builds are highly durable and can be passed down over three generations standard specifications for the
structural framework are set at level 3the highest levelfor evaluations based on the japanese housing performance
indication system with respect to alleviated deterioration

1 the number of years a material or component is expected to function as originally intended assuming a certain level of maintenance
  including regular inspections as envisaged by sumitomo forestry

                         i would like to see sumitomo forestry design houses that last a long time consumer behavior analyst



 disaster preparedness
a homes resistance to earthquakes wind and fire is an important element in protecting its residents and their property
in the event of a fire or natural disaster such as an earthquake or destructive typhoon

sumitomo forestry uses the following three construction methods to ensure a strong structural framework

                                                                    76

   multibalance construction method incorporating a postandbeam framework with integrated panels to minimize
   deformation and torsion of the structure due to a major earthquake or typhoon
   big frame construction method providing superior seismic and wind resistance by connecting big columns and beams
   using highstrength bf metal joints
   twobyfour construction method in which the structure is built using diaphragm componentsframes constructed
   from structural materials faced with structural plywoodresulting in an excellent balance of resistance to earthquakes
   and strong wind

in terms of a fireresistant structure standard specifications for sumitomo forestry houses include an external wall
structure that can withstand fire for 30 minutes this can be increased to 45 or 60 minutes depending on the building
size regulations governing the specific building location and customer preference in october 2009 structures using the
multibalance and the big frame construction method were certified as government regulated semifireproof
construction houses by the japan housing finance agency all of the companys housing product lines including the
previously certified twobyfour construction method comply with this fire resistance standard in fiscal 2009
approximately 2300 houses were built to these specifications which employ a fire stop structure that strengthens
the ceilings fire prevention shield and prevents the rapid spread of fire within rooms thus it is now possible to enjoy
both increased fire resistance and the advantages of wood construction houses with traditional japanese walls posts
and beams

to prepare for an earthquake flood or other natural disaster disaster response teams are stationed at local sumitomo
forestry branches to rapidly repair affected houses and take other measures of support to respond to customers
concerns


houses designed to prevent crime
in its scrupulous attention to the details of its custombuilt houses sumitomo forestry proposes crime prevention
measures from the site survey and design stage


enhancement of the longterm support system
in order to help our customers live comfortably in their houses for as long as possible sumitomo forestry offers its
longterm support system providing maintenance support for 60 years after a house is handed over to its owner

longterm support system
   the expected service life of principal structural members is at least 75 years
   the service life for each material is determined and houses are designed to facilitate inspection repair and
   replacement
   regular inspections are carried out over 60 years
   maintenance programs including renovations are proposed and maintenance records kept
   proposals from the design stage are offered to allow for future changes in the life stages of the occupants
   customer support center and call center available 24 hoursday 365 daysyear

the longterm support system offers a standard 10year warranty which can be extended up to 20 or 30 years on the
structural frame and waterproofing as long as feebased maintenance work judged necessary by the company such as
antipest treatment in the 10th year is performed

the optional ls20 excellent longterm model house offers a 20year warranty for water resistance because highly
durable materials are used for the external walls veranda flat roof etc at the time of construction making feebased
maintenance in the 10th year unnecessary in most cases in fiscal 2009 when excellent longterm housing promotion
act came into effect we introduced a 30year warranty the ls30 excellent longterm model house


                      i want sumitomo forestry to use its position as a housing manufacturer and builder to continue making attractive
                      houses as the years go by and also expand its service business to provide more comfortable living environments
                      ngo




                                                                77

pursuing universal design
sumitomo forestry offers houses that integrate universal design as the foundation for safe comfortable and enjoyable
living for all family members

spatial configuration and trafficflow planning are tailored to the familys lifestyle dimensional planning is designed to
enable smooth and strainfree movement and positions while handrails and other materials are intended to prevent
accidents these improvements are constantly refined by test results from human lifestyle engineering work at the
tsukuba research institute in japan

sumitomo forestry has organized internal universal design working groups since 2003 and carries out research at the
universal design house in the tsukuba research institute in addition the company raises awareness of the universal
design concept among employees by having them stay at the universal design house and encouraging them to apply

 adherence to housing performance indication system
the japanese housing performance indication system provides a highly reliable and objective evaluation by a thirdparty
expert so that the customer can assess the quality and performance of a house the system comprises ten evaluation
items including structural stability fire safety durability and energy efficiency

sumitomo forestry actively promotes this system because it ensures safe and reliable houses as well as raises their
asset value in fiscal 2009 971 of the companys properties were evaluated for their design performance customers
were also recommended to acquire construction performance evaluations

1 this rate pertains to all houses constructed including additions and remodeling whereas the housing performance indication system only
  applies to new construction


 timber used for housing
sumitomo forestry adheres to its timber procurement philosophy and
policy with the conviction that it should procure the timber it uses to build
houses from forests that are managed according to sustainable methods

following the attainment of sustainable green ecosystem council sgec1
certification of its company owned forests in japan in fiscal 2007
sumitomo forestry obtained chain of custody coc2 certification for its
handling of sgec certified timber products from the stages of distribution
and processing through house construction coc certification recognizes
that the company separates sgeccertified timber from other timber at
every step from storage and timber processing to distribution                   sgeccertified timber used in housing
furthermore the certification represents a thirdparty verification that
sumitomo forestry uses certified timber in its houses sumitomo forestry was the first major housing manufacturer in
japan to earn both certifications

use of certified timber is labeled on all of the companys standard engineered studs used in sumitomo ringyo no ie
sumitomo forestry home houses in hokkaido indicating that these houses are made of japanese larch grown in
hokkaido

sumitomo forestry promotes the use of japanese timber in the houses it builds and in fiscal 2009 achieved a usage rate
of 70 for its principal structural members

1 the sustainable green ecosystem council is japans own forestry certification system in which third parties verify
sustainable forest management certification is based on seven standards including the preservation of biodiversity and
the conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources
2 chain of custody coc certification is given to businesses that separate and label forest products from certified
forests in the storage processing and distribution processes

                         i would like sumitomo forestry to leverage its role as an industry leader to promote the use of japanese timber in
                         the interest of curbing global warming and cultivating water resources ngo

 dedication to wooden homes
japan is blessed with abundant forest resources and wooden homes have been built in the country from ancient times
natural wood not only creates a calm ambience but also embodies a variety of qualities that facilitate comfortable living
throughout the seasons sumitomo forestry takes advantage of the natural appeal of wood focusing on harmony with
nature in sumitomo forestry home houses to create its myforest brand the company actively uses japanesegrown
cypress trees for the posts and other structural members of these homes using timber grown in japan revitalizes the
domestic forestry industry thereby protecting the nations forests against degradation aspiring to offer homes that
provide people with comfortable living and enjoyment of the changing seasons sumitomo forestry applies its
ryouonbou design concept that incorporates traditional approaches to using natural light ventilation and greenery




                                                                    79

materials produced by the group and developing new construction methods to improve energy conservation and

                          i think that wood should be used not only for structural members but also for the parts of a house that
                          residents actually touch such as walls and ceilings so that the warmth of wood can be appreciated

preserving the quality of traditional japanese houses

passed down from our ancestors and filled with our memories i want to make this house into a strong structure
and pass it down to future generations the renovation of a 100yearold home in nara city nara prefecture
gave shape to this customers dream

the framework of the house was lifted up with jacks so that work could be done on the foundation the original
posts and beams were preserved while optimal seismic reinforcement was completed using traditional japanese
techniques uneven surfaces were leveled and humidity countermeasures implemented eliminating inconveniences
for daily life as well as improving the environment for storing precious documents and artwork



   comments from the renovation engineer
   when explaining seismic reinforcement for traditional japanese
   homes to a customer the content of the explanation will always be
   technical in nature so we always go beyond just showing the design
   blueprintswe always show perspective drawings and present
   examples of previous projects the company has worked on to
   make the explanation both accurate and easy to understand
   customers are especially anxious about foundation work when we
   raise the framework off the ground using jacks we always show
   photographs of actual projects and take the time to explain the
   process and situation of the construction in a polite way to put
   customers at ease

airflow in the houses landmark trees were situated to provide relief from the summer heat and a garden zone was
created to block the sun and create a cool spot in the neighborhood grass was planted in twocar parking spots to ease
the glare

 childcarerelated programs




                       i would like to know about the specific programs that sumitomo forestry has put in place to promote value
                       families customer



encouraging male employees to take childcare leave
as part of sumitomo forestrys efforts to value families the company encourages male employees to take childcare
leave surveys are taken of male employees whose spouses have given birth to a child and childcare leave guides are
distributed to male employees the company intranet is also used to publicize the status of employees taking childcare
leave as well as stories from employees who have taken childcare leave

in fiscal 2009 the company hosted the fifth annual conference for employees who are taking childcare leave including
two male employees the participants held a lively discussion with the company president on how to increase
acceptance of continuing to work while raising children this year marked the first time that the employees supervisors
and peers participated in the program based on the contents of these discussions sumitomo forestry published and
distributed a worklife balance pamphlet to all employees in april 2010

in fiscal 2009 the number of male employees taking childcare leave increased to 17 sumitomo forestry will continue to
foster an environment that accepts the usage of the childcare leave program by both men and women and the balance
between work and childcare creating a positive cycle that improves the support of parents caring for their children

                       im very interested in your childcare leave program for male employees id like to know the specifics because a
                       program in name only where no one actually participates is meaningless shareholder investor



                                                                  97

launching the telework program
sumitomo forestry formally launched the telework program in fiscal 2009 in which employees may work at home or

offices giving employees a new way of working as well as increasing both work efficiency and worklife balance
accordingly sumitomo forestry reviewed its information systems and security measures to establish systems for the
treatment working environment and health management of telework employees and implemented a fullscale program
from april 2009 eight employees are participating in the program employees who have needs for childcare or family
care as well as those whose commute times were especially long the time saved by not commuting to an office is being
used for both work and family life and working in a quiet home environment has proven to increase productivity
providing proof of the concept for the telework program

childcare leave 2 publishing an educational booklet and nurturing an environment supportive
of childcare by both parents and 3 implementation of revised rules to facilitate easy
commuting during pregnancy sumitomo forestry intends to earn certification attesting to the
compliance of the 3r d action plan with the next generation law as it succeeded in doing with
the previous two plans

in fiscal year 2009 the number of male employees taking childcare leave rose to 17 the
                                                                                                        the kurumin mark of
sumitomo forestry worklife balance pamphlet was distributed throughout the company and
                                                                                                           certification
efforts continued to achieve targets in april 2010 maternity health management leave was
established allowing expectant and nursing mothers to take up to ten days in onehour

housing division in light of more stringent constructionrelated legislation the maturation of the housing market and
dramatic changes in the external environment such as heightened competition accordingly sumitomo forestry took
specific measures to curb overtime work such as discontinuing perfunctory meetings restricting times for internal

reforestation project in indonesias bromo tengger semeru national park
in november 2008 sumitomo forestry began working with the republic of indonesias ministry of forestry to carry out a
reforestation project on approximately 1000 hectares in bromo tengger semeru national park in east java this project
aims to obtain united nations accreditation as a clean development mechanism cdm project

national park is situated at a high altitude and centered on mt bromo
which is considered a hindu holy site by the indigenous tengger tribe
repeated forest fires and sulfur dioxide gas emitted by mt bromo
however have devastated the forests making their recovery extremely
difficult

after the project start saplings were prepared roads repaired and in
january 2009 tree planting began to date 171 hectares of land have
been planted with trees going forward the project will continue to
expand the land area under reforestation as well as nurturing the trees
already planted

forests absorb co2 but also cultivate water resources prevent landslides
provide recreation areas and maintain and protect biodiversity plantation
forest operations help recover these functions and will result in the return
of precious and vital forests in the national park and for the local peoples
thus the project proactively employs local peoples encourages local
school children to get involved with plantation activity and deploys

sumitomo forestry calculates the input of resources and energy as well as the emissions of co2 and waste over the life
cycle of products in each business to determine the environmental impact of its business activities and to develop
effective means of reducing the emissions and waste

    life cycle assessments
sumitomo forestry believes that an accurate understanding of key issues in its business activities is crucial to the pursuit
of environmentally sound business activities and the creation of a sustainable society accordingly the sumitomo
forestry group has been carrying out life cycle assessments lca since fiscal 2006 to identify the environmental
impact of all of its business activities lca is a method of comprehensively evaluating environmental impacts of a
product throughout its life cycle including raw material procurement manufacture transportation sale use reuse and
disposal

in fiscal 2007 sumitomo forestry carried out an inventory analysis1 of structural plywood staircases and countertops
to raise the accuracy of lca for a single house the analysis demonstrated that structural plywood made from japanese
timber emitted less co2 from procurement transportation and processing than imported timber accordingly sumitomo
forestry crest co ltd began displaying carbon footprints2 on plywood made of japanese timber in may 2009 at its
komatsushima plant this program to display carbon footprints on wood products is a first in japan going forward we
will research all carbon footprints of the products which are manufactured at this facility

from october 2009 pt rimba partikel indonesia rpi began displaying the carbon footprints on the particleboard
products they manufacture and sell this marks the first time that an indonesian company has labeled timber products
rpi particleboard products make effective use of resources using wood leftover from logging sawdust and timber from
companyowned plantations further the companys products are manufactured using low carbon emission methods
including the use of electricity from a wood biomass power generation facility

in addition in fiscal 2008 sumitomo forestry set up an lca database related to the harvesting of logs at all stages
from cutting underbrush to taking away the logs surveys of fuel consumption for machines used to harvest the timber
as well as fuel consumption for transportation to markets have been completed and the data will be tabulated to clarify
the lca of log harvesting in the forestry management

1 analysis of the input energy materials etc and output gas emissions waste etc of a product over its life cycle from manufacture to
  disposal

    environmental impact from the construction of a new house




    contribution to expanding carbon stocks
carbon stocks refer to the co2 that is stored in the atmosphere forests and oceans these stocks play a major role in
curbing global warming as trees grow they absorb co2 from the atmosphere and sequester it as carbon when trees
are harvested and processed into products they continue to store carbon co2 is only released when the wooden
materials are incinerated at the end of their life cycle

when mature trees are harvested and used as building materials the co2 sequestered in the trees is stored for a long
period of time this means that building wooden houses can be likened to creating forests in the city the carbon stocks
of the sumitomo forestry groups timber used for housing construction in fiscal 2009 was equivalent to 194000 tons
of co2 about the amount of co2 emitted by approximately 38000 households over one year

the sumitomo forestry group promotes the use of timber from sustainably managed forests in the construction of its
highquality longlasting wood houses and for the wooden building materials it uses the group also encourages the
reuse and recycling of timber resources such initiatives will contribute to reducing the effects of global warming by
expanding carbon stocks in the form of timber

                          2
as global warming becomes an increasingly serious issue reducing co2 emissions has become an urgent matter the
sumitomo forestry group will make a positive contribution to this task by seeking to reduce co2 emissions from its
business activities and the houses occupied by its customers and by facilitating absorption of co2 through proper forest
management

    global warming and sumitomo forestrys role
co2 emissions are continuing to rise on a global basis the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on
climate change ipcc states that global warming is very likely due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations caused
by human activity the report projects that by the end of the 21st century the global average temperature will increase
by 11 64 compared to the average between 1980 and 1999 to prevent such a scenario the 2009 g8 summit at
laquila set the targets of a 50 reduction of greenhouse gases globally and an 80 reduction by the developed
nations by 2050 aiming to limit atmospheric temperature rises to two degrees or less in december the 15th
conference of the parties cop 15 to the united nations framework convention on climate change agreed to
implement reduction activities by not only developed nations but also developing nations and to provide financial
assistance to developing nations for those activities making the effort to reduce greenhouse gases a truly global
endeavor

japans co2 emissions in fiscal 2008 were 16 higher than in 1990 and companies are being required to enact
concrete measures including strengthened legal regulations to achieve the reduction targets agreed in the kyoto
protocol in addition the government of japan announced in september 2009 that by 2020 japan would reduce its
greenhouse gases by 25 compared to 1990

the sumitomo forestry group will make a positive contribution by reducing co2 emissions from its business activities
while facilitating absorption of co2 through proper forest management as a housing provider the group recognizes its
important responsibility to help reduce co2 emissions from the household sector which currently account for about 14
of japans total emissions and which are increasing each year

                          while the prevention of global warming is a universal challenge i want sumitomo forestry to point the way as
                          a leader in the housing industry sales partner
                          i think that trees can play a major role in reducing co2 emissions i expect sumitomo forestry to lead the way
                          in finding solutions to global warming as a company whose primary business is forestry student




    reducing the effects of business operations on global warming
the sumitomo forestry group is working to reduce co2 emissions through its business activities at offices and plants as
a countermeasure to global warming in fiscal 2009 the group reduced its energy consumption through initiatives for
daily business activities including environmentally sound driving and saving electricity and sumitomo forestry crest co
ltd reduced energy consumed during inspections at each of its plants

co 2 emission reduction targets
sumitomo forestry has endeavored to reduce co2 emissions by setting fiveyear targets for fiscal years 2006 to 2010
in three areas of operation offices plants in japan and plants overseas

in december 2009 however the group revised the co2 reduction targets in the environmental management midterm
plan due to the difficulty of determining the actual status of co2 reduction activities per sales unit shared by plants in
japan and overseas which is easily impacted by economic downturns

the new targets for plants in japan have been set using appropriate base units for each plant resulting in indicators that
enable much easier management of reduction efforts at the production stage further targets and management
indicators for total emissions emissions per sales unit andor other measures as appropriate to each plant have been
set in consideration of local laws and regulations

at the current time the midterm targets are set for fiscal 2014 we will continue to consider setting of longterm
targets in consideration of the japanese governments movement to set targets for reduction of greenhouse gases as
well as deliberations at the global level


                                                                 130

    offices              by fy2010 achieve a 12 reduction in overall emissions compared with fy2006 and
                         maintain this level to 2014

    plants in            by fy2014 achieve an 8 reduction in base units1 compared with fy2006
    japan

    plants               set targets for each plant in consideration of local laws and regulations including overall
    outside japan        emissions emissions per unit sold andor other targets as appropriate to each plant

reducing co 2 emissions from plants wood biomass power generation facility
installed at rpi
rpi is a particleboard plant located in central java indonesia the plant was established as a joint venture between
sumitomo forestry and local businesses in 1990 rpi is making an effort to reduce co2 emissions by switching from
conventional dieselbased power generation to wood biomass power generation which mainly uses offcuts and sawdust
from sawmills near the plant as fuel

through the use of the wood biomass power generation facility which went into full operation in june 2008 rpi achieved
a 10033 tco2 reduction in co2 emissions in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2007 moreover the united nations
cdm executive board registered this initiative as a clean development mechanism cdm project in may 2008

reducing co 2 emissions from offices
in order to reduce the co2 generated by offices the sumitomo forestry group sets common targets across all group
companies and continues to advance its efforts in its offices to the greatest possible extent

at the companys model homes and showrooms across japan we began from fiscal 2008 to switch over to
environmentally sound lighting systems in fiscal 2009 we began turning off the daytime lighting on second floors in
model homes across the nation when customers are not present

from fiscal 2009 in order to reduce co2 output from offices we specifically focused on activities to reduce the amount
of electricity and gasoline used in daily business

reducing co 2 emissions from transportation
sumitomo forestry improved its distribution systems in fiscal 2007 to more efficiently transport materials from
manufacturers to housing construction sites construction materials previously shipped directly from manufacturers to
construction sites are now collected first at regional relay centers mixedload shipments containing materials from
different manufacturers are then delivered to construction sites this streamlining of material deliveries to construction
sites results in fewer delivery trucks and lower co2 emissions

the company established 28 relay centers nationwide and reduced co2 emissions equivalent to the emissions of
142443 vehicles in fiscal 2009

participating in japans trial integrated emissions trading market
in october 2008 the government of japan launched an integrated emissions trading market on a trial basis with a view
toward adopting fullscale emissions trading in japan currently there are 521 participant companies with set targets
including 392 industry associations federations and other organizations 68 companies participating in trading of
emissions credits and 126 companies participating as emissionsreducing entities in the domestic clean development
mechanism for a total for 715 companies as of july 6 2009 sumitomo forestry is the only company from the
housing industry participating in the trial emissions trading scheme participant companies establish and pursue a
voluntary goal for reducing co2 emissions in addition to undertaking their own efforts to reduce emissions the
participants help reduce japans co2 emissions by trading emission allowances and credits in november 2009 the
companys fiscal 2008 performance against targets was audited and verified and the achievement of targets
confirmed



    reducing the environmental impact of households

considerations for reducing the environmental impact of housing
throughout the entire life cycle of a house from materials production to demolition energy consumption during
occupancy has the greatest impact on the environment energy use during the occupancy stage can reach as high as
7080 of energy consumption over the life cycle the nearly 10000 houses built annually by sumitomo forestry emit
approximately 63000 tons of co2 per year the key to reducing the environmental impact of housing is a matter of how
to reduce energy consumption during occupancy

sumitomo forestry is tackling this issue with its ryouonbou natural heating and cooling design concept the use of
insulation and airtightness specifications exceeding nextgeneration energy conservation standards and the use of
natural energy such as solar energy for power generation and water heating

   providing environmentally friendly homesp34




                       i expect sumitomo forestrys houses to be equipped with features that can help reduce environmental impact

                                                                 133

 reducing energy use through the ryouonbou design concept
the ryouonbou design concept draws on the wisdom and techniques of japans traditional houses to effectively take
advantage of natures blessings and offer a housing style that enables people to live comfortably while limiting energy
consumption

the ryouonbou concept is based on three design principles for creating housing that is cool in the summer and warm in
the winter kaze no sekkei wind design provides a refreshing coolness in the summer by blocking sunlight and creating
airflow that channels the summer heat outside taiyo no sekkei sun design allows winter sunshine into the house and
prevents heat from escaping keeping the indoors warm midori no sekkei greenery design provides comfortable living
throughout the seasons by utilizing garden vegetation to create a natural temperature control system

research on a model house demonstrated that the ryouonbou design concept could reduce co2 emissions during
occupancy by about 401 compared to houses built to specifications mandated by 1992 energy conservation
standards

1 this figure only applies to emissions attributable to heating and cooling

                          i recommend that sumitomo forestry cooperate with ngos and npos when promoting environmentally symbiotic

  midori no sekkei




deciduous trees grow thick with leaves in summer blocking out direct sunlight and creating a cool shady area of foliage
in winter the trees lose their leaves allowing the sunlight into the rooms



by planting trees on the north side of the house it is possible to make it cooler in summer this also has the effect of
protecting the house from the northerly winds



in addition to blocking out sunlight during summer the greenery also cools the air the use of climbing plants such as
bitter melon offers the added benefit of fresh produce



we recommend trees that suit the individual home and change appearance with the seasons as well as bringing out the
beauty of a home greenery also helps blend the building in with its surroundings




in addition to allowing rainwater to be absorbed in the earth a green parking space prevents the powerful rays of the
summer sun from being reflected back into the atmosphere thereby moderating increases in temperature in the area
around the home



strategically placed foliage in front of windows and other open areas restricts the view in the house from outside and
enhances privacy




a lawn effectively reduces the reflection of the heat of the sun back into the atmosphere leaf transpiration whereby
moisture evaporates from the grass helps moderate increases in temperature



by strategically placing trees according to prevailing wind direction it is possible to obstruct the cold northerly wind in
winter reduce its force and chill and divert its direction

 employing nextgeneration energy conservation standards
the japanese government has established energy conservation standards geared toward reducing energy consumption
in houses

sumitomo forestrys standard housing specifications have been based on nextgeneration energy conservation
standards1 since fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2009 these standards were employed in over 957 of the houses built by the
company the standards also correspond to the highest energysaving level level 4 under japans housing performance
indication system

1 these refer to the standards and owner determination of energy usage rationalization pertaining to houses notice no 3 of the
 ministry of economy trade and industry and the ministry of land infrastructure and transport 2006 and guidelines for design and
 construction of energy usage rationalization systems for houses notice no 378 of the ministry of land infrastructure and transport
 2006


 growing use of solar energy in houses
employing a solar power system in addition to the ryouonbou design concept can further reduce a houses environmental
impact sumitomo forestrys myforestsolabo model features a dual power system solar power system as a standard
feature and a fuel cell that generates electricity and heat from hydrogen and oxygen and uses the heat generated during
power generation to heat water in this way the system can drastically reduce energy consumption and co2 emissions

in 2008 the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism chose sumitomo forestrys proposal for maximizing
solar energy use and raising energy selfsufficiency through its w double solar system which combines a solar power
system with a solar hot water system as a model business promotion of co2 conservation in homes and buildings a
house based on this model can be expected to save about 150000 yen per year in heating and lighting expenses and
generate about 65 less annual co2 emissions than an ordinary house built according to 1992 energy conservation
standards1

in fiscal 2009 about 20 of all houses sold by sumitomo forestry were equipped with solar power systems going
forward we will work even harder to increase the number of homes using solar energy through promoting the sales of the
myforestsolabo model and other lines

1 an ordinary house built to meet 1992 energy conservation standards is defined as having two floors with a total floor area of
  approximately 130 m2 and occupied by a family of four in tsukuba city ibaraki prefecture it is also based on certain assumptions in
  sumitomo forestrys model plan and could differ from actual conditions


 solar hot water system developed
water heating accounts for around onethird of an average households energy consumption solar hot water systems
that effectively utilize solar energy can therefore contribute enormously to reducing energy consumption and co2
emissions the development of new products that utilize solar thermal energy which is more efficient than solar power
generation has progressed outside japan where their application is widespread due to the environmental and economic
advantages

although solar thermal energy use has been slow to spread in japan sumitomo forestry believes it is a technology that
will become indispensable to society in the future accordingly the company worked with an equipment manufacturer to
develop a new solar hot water system the system uses a roofmounted solar thermal energy collector containing
mediumheat antifreeze to absorb heat the antifreeze is fed into a thermal converter in a water storage tank which
incorporates a gas heater to heat the water this system ensures a stable and economical hot water supply moreover
since the piping is passed through the roof it does not mar the exterior appearance of the house the amount of solar
heat used and the amount of money saved are displayed on a remote control enabling homeowners to check the
systems effectiveness

the system which can be installed for less cost than a solar power generation system is estimated to reduce co2
emissions by at least 30 and save about 30000 yen annually on processed natural gas expenses for gas water heating
in an ordinary house1




                                                                    136

houses use a large amount of resources so reducing the use of and recycling those resources are important issues
sumitomo forestry is striving to achieve zero emissions of industrial waste generated at its plants new housing
construction sites and other operations sites by facilitating the recycling of these waste and using building materials
that can be recycled after use

    policy on resources
building a house requires an enormous amount of resources approximately 762 tons of resources are used for the
principal structural members and building materials that go into a single house built to the companys standard
specifications aiming to reduce environmental impact and effectively utilize resources sumitomo forestry recognizes
the importance of focusing on zero emissions initiatives including reducing the generation of waste reusing resources
recycling waste as raw materials recycling chemicals and utilizing heat from incinerating waste

at the time of inputting raw materials besides reducing the use of resources by eliminating redundant materials and
using components that generate a low amount of offcuts it is important to use components manufactured from
recycled materials in order to promote the cyclical utilization of resources sumitomo forestry is applying specific
initiatives for each type of building material to complete the loop of recycling including using recyclable resources
thoroughly separating wastes at construction and demolition sites and using recycled products such as recycled crushed
stones

                          i think houses being constructed now should last 3050 years before replacement when the houses are taken
                          down the components should be easily separated for reuse customer




    zero emissions initiatives
the sumitomo forestry group started carrying out zero emissions initiatives to advance the recycling of resources in
fiscal 2007 the group has defined zero emissions as not disposing in landfills or simply incinerating all of the industrial
waste generated at manufacturing sites new housing construction sites and other operations sites excluding demolition
work sites quantitatively this means achieving a recycling rate of at least 98 all group companies and departments
had been pursuing the goal of a recycling rate of at least 98 for industrial waste by the end of march 2010

as of march 2010 however the groups overall recycling ratio was 799 despite continuing initiatives as a number of
issues and problems arose

the scope and breadth of the sumitomo forestry groups businesses which include housing construction and related
businesses renovation manufacturing and distribution inherently makes increasing the recycling rate a challenge
moreover all industry waste disposals were being contracted to an external vendor resulting in insufficient recycling
routes which made increasing the recycling rate difficult

thus the group undertook a reevaluation of its efforts to date as well as of the definition and scope of zero
emissions to identify the toppriority initiatives the group should undertake



          new definition

   the group will not simply incinerate or bury in landfills all of the industrial waste
   generated from its plants in japan and new housing construction sites


going forward based on the new definition the group will continue zero emissions activities at domestic manufacturing
facilities and reevaluate the fundamental approach and systems used at new construction sites1 the group initially aims
to achieve zero emissions in the capital area by december 31 2012

                                                                  138

waste reduction at new housing construction sites
in fiscal 2009 sumitomo forestry achieved a recycling rate of about 832 for waste generated at new housing
construction sites

in fiscal 2008 the housing division started a trial run of an industrial waste traceability system that uses ic chips to
ascertain the actual output of waste from new housing construction sites ic tags were attached to waste which was
sorted into 11 categories and collected separately and the information obtained was sent to the japan industrial waste
technology center via the japan waste network jwnet electronic manifest to monitor the movement of the waste
the system enables accurate measuring of the weight of waste and contributes significantly to preventing inappropriate
disposal in fiscal 2009 this industrial waste traceability system was installed and operated at ten branches including the
six branches in the greater tokyo area mito kyoto shiga and kitakyushu going forward data collected before and
after the installation of this system will be analyzed enabling the optimization of efforts to control generation of
industrial waste

the group continues its efforts to limit the generation of industrial waste through the use of precut timber reducing the
amount of packaging materials used examples of efforts in this area include use of precut lumber for soffits the
underside of eaves and gables and setting the dimensions of the eaves to minimize endcuts from materials used to
finish the underside of the homes eaves in addition the practicality and costs of precutting ceramic roof tiles sidings
and panels for exterior reinforcement are being investigated for future deployment

recycling of waste materials such as siding roof tiles and composite wastesnot simple incineration or burying in
landfills  is a major issue in the pursuit of zero emissions the company is also exploring the possibility of obtaining
interregion recovery and recycling certification used by nichiha corporation and kubota matsushitadenko exterior
works ltd which are manufacturers of siding and slate roofs that the company hopes to recycle

waste reduction in other businesses
industrial waste is generated by a wide range of corporate activity including research facilities renovation work
landscaping and greening work and repair work for rental properties and the distribution business in these areas as well
the group set performance targets for zero emissions and endeavored to achieve those targets but was not able to
achieve them in fiscal 2009

    proper disposal of demolition waste
sumitomo forestry demolished nearly 2100 old houses in fiscal 2009 to make room for new housing construction
generating some 93000 tons of waste in the process recognizing the importance of keeping waste materials in
circulation the company has strived to improve recycling even before the enactment of the construction waste
recycling law by thoroughly dismantling sorting and separately disposing of waste materials the company has
achieved a nearly 100 recycling rate for concrete and metal waste and a 98 recycling rate for wood waste the
present challenge is developing recycling routes for roofing tiles glass ceramics gypsum board and other composite
waste as there is still no effective means of recycling these materials

    resource recycling

recycling of wood waste
offcuts from the timber milling process and waste wood from new housing construction and demolition sites can be
turned into wood chips for use in papermaking and particleboard or as biofuel sumitomo forestry has created its own
recycling routes for facilitating the distribution of wood chips by employing the networks it has developed through its
timber distribution business

researching the effective utilization of used activated carbon
for the past two years fiscal 20082009 sumirin agroproducts has conducted joint research with the tokyo
metropolitan government bureau of waterworks to develop potting media for agriculture and horticulture and a soil
improvement agent for landscaping both made with used activated carbon from drinking water treatment plants the
bureau uses an advanced water purification process that combines ozone treatment with biologically activated carbon
this system uses large quantities of activated carbon in the processes of reducing organic material and deodorization
used activated carbon needs to be replaced with new carbon due to agerelated deterioration the bureau forecasts
that it will generate approximately 5000 m3 of used activated carbon in fiscal 2010 for which it needs an effective use

this research demonstrated that used activated carbon effectively promoted plant growth when used as potting media
for agriculture and horticulture as a soil improvement agent for landscaping and as a raw material for foundation
materials sumirin agroproducts and the tokyo metropolis have applied for a patent on these research results going
forward the company plans to commercialize and expand sales channels for potting media and soil improvement agents
using used activated carbon

sumitomo forestry procures sustainable timber resources actively uses japanese timber and is expanding its
reforestation efforts outside japan to ensure that forest resources are available in perpetuity

 definitions for english translations of shokurin the terms below are used with the following definitions throughout this
report

reforestation the replanting of trees on land that had previously been forested but lost its forest cover due to
harvesting or forest death

afforestation the planting of trees on land that had never been forested or the replanting of trees on land that had
been forested several hundreds of years ago

    conservation and sustainable use of timber resources




cultivation
   the sumitomo forestry group owns forests with a total area of 42642 hectares within japan and outside of japan
   manages forests with a total area of approximately 37000 hectares forests perform a number of functions for the
   public good including conserving national land cultivating water resources curbing global warming by absorbing co2
   and preserving biodiversity these functions can be enhanced by appropriate forestry management including clearing
   away of underbrush pruning and thinning

   forests absorb co2 then retain it as carbon the carbon stock of the sumitomo forestry group forests in japan was
   105 million tco2 and 36 million tco2 overseas




                                                            142

harvesting
  in fiscal 2009 the sumitomo forestry group harvested approximately 220000 m3 of trees the harvested trees
  were milled and processed then provided to the world in a variety of applications including housing and furniture in
  some cases for example structural members used in houses the timber will be used for decades even after trees are
  processed into products the wood continues to retain co2 as carbon thus it can be said that using wooden
  products and building woodconstruction homes are activities that create forests in cities



          carbon stock in housing

   one sumitomo ringyo no ie sumitomo forestry home house has a
   carbon stock of about 226 tco2 and the carbon stock of all
   houses constructed by the company in fiscal 2009 totaled
   approximately 194000 tco2

   1 carbon stock of the timber used in building houses in fiscal 2009




usage
  wood products dont become waste after just one use for example in the case of woodconstruction homes the
  lumber can be reused after demolition as wooden materials such as boards wood chips resulting from that process
  and wood that can no longer be used can still be used as wood fuel this is called cascade usage and is a way to use
  wood completely and totally in this way carbon is retained until wood products are used as biomass fuel to create
  electricity

plantation
  just harvesting trees and using the timber means forestry resources will be diminished sumitomo forestry always
  plants and cultivates new trees after harvesting trees to ensure sustainability of forest resources
  in fiscal 2009 sumitomo forestry planted forests in japan with a total area of approximately 49 hectares and 4300
  hectares overseas


                                                                   143

   from a carbon stock perspective during the time wood products used in cities are retaining carbon newly planted
   trees grow absorb co2 and retain carbon companyowned forests and the carbon retained in the homes we build
   thus increase the carbon stock and contribute to counteracting global warming



    conservation and sustainable use of japanese timber resources
the depletion and devastation of forests has become a global issue as a timber distributor and owner of approximately
42600 hectares of forest sumitomo forestry believes that it has an important role to play in ensuring the sustainability
of timber resources the company will continue to promote the use of sustainable timber by capitalizing on its
accumulated forest management expertise and on the results of its research and development efforts related to trees
and wood

                          japans forestry industry is in decline id like to see sumitomo forestry take the initiative in reviving this industry
                          in japan customer



 management of companyowned forests
sumitomo forestrys companyowned forests located in hokkaido shikoku kyushu and wakayama cover a total area of
42642 hectares about 1900 of japans land area these forests are managed in an environmentally sound and
sustainable manner

forests perform a number of functions for the public good including conserving national land cultivating water
resources curbing global warming by absorbing co2 and preserving biodiversity these benefits can be enhanced with
proper forest management unlike fossil fuels the cycle of reforestation thinning harvesting and replanting makes it
possible to use forests as a renewable resource

sumitomo forestryowned forests acquired certification from japans sustainable green ecosystem council sgec1 in
september 2006 meaning that a third party has verified that the forests are properly managed in fiscal 2009 the
forests were inspected for the third time since earning forestry certification and it was determined that sumitomo
forestry has taken appropriate measures to preserve biodiversity among other issues in addition 9735 hectares of
forests acquired in kyushu and shikoku through april 2009 were also certified by sgec

the companys management practices consider the ecosystems and surrounding environment and include methods for
appropriate thinning and smallarea clear cutting which enable efficient harvesting of trees followed by reforestation
these practices ensure sustainable forest management

1 japans own forestry certification system through which forest management is verified as sustainable by third parties certification is
 based on seven standards that include the preservation of biodiversity and the conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources

effective use of companyowned forests through joint operations
to maximize the functionality of forests proper maintenance of forestsclearing away of underbrush pruning and
thinningis vital but in japan the large number of owners holding small parcels of land makes it difficult to do so
efficiently

as a result maintenance of forests and usage of domestic timber are delayed diminishing the vitality of forests and
creating a significant problem to address this situation sumitomo forestry launched efforts to create greater
efficiencies by facilitating multiple owners of forests to manage forests cooperatively

joint operations with owners of large forests
in october 2009 sumitomo forestry oji paper co ltd and oji forest  products co ltd signed a memorandum of
understanding to engage in joint utilization of forestry resources centered around each of the three companys forests

the three companies are jointly engaged in two projects involving active use of sgeccertified timber from hokkaido
and a joint forestry operations area in ehime prefectureleveraging technology and expertise accumulated over many
years of forestry management as part of an integrated upstreamtodownstream initiative we aspire to fulfill our
responsibility to society as the largest privatesector owner of forests in japan by realizing the renewal of japans
forests by innovating new privatesectorled business models this project is the first time that privatesector
companies owning large forests have concluded a memorandum of understanding for joint forestry operations

  overview of operations

                                           sgeccertified logs harvested from forests owned by sumitomo forestry monbetsu area and

                                           custombuilt detached houses sold by sumitomo forestry

                                           sumitomo forestry and the oji paper group will jointly create a forestry operations area
 joint forestry operations area in ehime   centered on forests owned by oji paper group with neighboring privately held forests creating
 prefecture                                the scale necessary for operating efficiencies and building new logging roads through the
                                           mountains thereby increasing the productivity and efficiency of operations such as thinning




promotion of publicprivate sector forestry management
in fiscal 2009 sumitomo forestry aiming to enable efficient forestry operations between the public and private sectors
concluded an agreement for promotion of forestry management on public private and companyowned forests in kochi
kumamoto and wakayama prefectures the initiative in kumamoto prefecture is the largest forest area ever covered by
such an agreement

to achieve efficiencies in forest management it is necessary to designate a forestry joint operations area encompassing
national forests private and public forests whose ownership structures are different and then treat the combined
forests as if they were one as well as build an efficient network of strip roads through the conclusion of an agreement
for promotion of forestry management it is now possible to efficiently build a network of strip roads which has been
problematic up until now and to create efficiencies in forestry operations with the expectation of reduced costs

going forward the partners will jointly engage in thinning operations and sales of products made from the thinnings and
aim for even more appropriate and efficient operations

                       forests i hope to see operations that will renew as many declining forests as possible customer



promoting the use of japanese timber
following world war ii mountains throughout japan were planted with japanese cedar and cypress trees in an intense
reforestation effort however japanese timber became less competitive than imported timber due to deregulation
policies making forest management an unprofitable business as a result the countrys forest plantations were
practically abandoned and the forestry industry fell into decline

sumitomo forestry believes that sound business practices are needed to drive japans forestry industry so that timber
resources can continue being produced from the countrys forests in the future this means that greater use of japanese
timber will be a major challenge

                            japanese timber has such high quality id really like to see japans forestry industry become vital again
                            student
                            i want sumitomo forestry to work to revitalize japanese forestry creating a mechanism to use more japanese
                            timber not imported timber student



using japanese timber in homes
sumitomo forestry embraces a policy of actively using japanese timber in its houses and is promoting initiatives to
encourage the use of its super cypress laminated engineered wood for structural use made from japanese cypress
chamaecyparis obtusa and its original loadbearing wall lattice panels made from japanese cedar cryptomeria
japonica and japanese larch larix leptolepis in fiscal 2008 the company reached its target of using japanese timber
for 70 of the principal structural members for sumitomo ringyo no le sumitomo forestry home houses

sumitomo forestry also builds houses that use japanese timber for 100 of principal structural members limited to
certain product models and regions the myforestwaraku miyabi home launched in november 2006 uses japanese
timber for all principal structural members including super cypress 100 japanese cypress laminated engineered
wood for foundations and posts and larch for beams the myforesttaiju home launched in february 2008 uses
japanese timber for all principal structural members with super cypress used for posts foundations and sleepers and
cypress used in original loadbearing lattice panels sumitomo forestry also encourages the use of japanese cedar for
interior materials

the company increased the percentage of japanese timber used for principal structural members in myforestnostalgia
a mainstay product in the twobyfour housing category in twobyfour houses the switch to japanese cypress
laminated engineered wood foundations and sleepers increased the ratio of domestic timber used in principal structural
members from 4 to 30

sumitomo forestry is also encouraging the use of regionally produced timber in hokkaido the company offers a 100
made in hokkaido model that uses only locally grown japanese larch and sakhalin fir in fiscal 2009 the company
built houses in nagano ehime nara wakayama yamaguchi kochi kumamoto and oita using at least some locally
produced timber

                                                                   146

the company will continue to promote these efforts to increase the use of domestic timber

                              my family feels a great deal of pride in the house that sumitomo forestry built for us business partner
                              sumitomo forestry does not exclusively use japanese timber but also uses imported timber i think the
                              company should set separate environmental initiatives for each type of timber business partner

utilization of japanese timber and consideration for the environment
sumitomo forestry developed and started sales of the monbetsu no mori line of furniture that makes effective use of
thinnings of broadleaf trees harvested from companyowned forests primarily in monbetsu hokkaido
the company is actively involved in the use of domestic timber in the houses it builds and has increased to 70 the
ratio of domestic timber used in principal structural members in addition to structural members aiming to proactively
use domestic timber in furniture the company launched the monbetsu no mori project with 11 member companies which
advances the development of furniture that leverages the best qualities of domestic timber and the best qualities of
wood
thinnings which are curved and wood left over from logging are difficult to process into timber products and have
conventionally been used primarily as raw materials for pulp or as fuel in the form of firewoodor disposed of unused
the monbetsu no mori brand of interior furniture is the result of investigation into the effective use of thinnings from
broadleaf and other trees the thinnings from broadleaf trees used as raw materials for the monbetsu no mori brand
come from sgec1certified forests going forward the products will be marketed carrying the sgec label
by promoting the supply of thinnings from broadleaf and other trees to companies that support and endorse these types
of projects the company is encouraging the proactive use of domestic timber and supporting the revitalization of
domestic forests and protecting the environment thus contributing to the achievement of the governments goal of
50 selfsufficiency in timber

1 japans own forestry certification system through which forest management is verified as sustainable by third parties certification is
 based on seven standards that include the preservation of biodiversity and the conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources




                            furniture products made with thinnings of broadleaf trees from forests in monbetsu


sumitomo forestry crest co ltd uses japanese cedar for its ayasugi line of interior materials such as entrance hall
storage areas stairways and flooring although japanese cedar is the most commonly planted tree in japan after it is
cut into posts some parts of the remaining wood are generally not used however sumitomo forestry crest was
particularly suited to apply its unique technologies to process these parts for its ayasugi line
the company also manufactures a line of doors and flooring called totorop which is made of japanesegrown sakhalin
fir a cycle of logging and planting these trees which are commonly grown on plantations in hokkaido enables a balance
between timber supply and forest regeneration totorop products effectively use the knotted parts of the timber which
was previously unused as laminated engineered wood without diminishing performance moreover when drying sakhalin
fir dried scraps and offcuts are used in the drying equipment as biomass a renewable energy
through the extensive use of japanese cedar and sakhalin fir the company is contributing to the preservation of national
lands as well as to the prevention of global warming

sumitomo forestry landscaping co ltd began selling original deck hinoki brand of wooden decks that use thinnings
from japanese cypress in the floorboards japanese cypress is a conifer that possesses beautiful grain and superior
durability and as such has traditionally been used in shrines and altars using the sumitomo forestry groups domestic
network to procure thinnings from japanese cypress which has not been used very much until now and the groups
proprietary technologies to effectively utilize it as a product the company promotes the use of domestic timber and
contributes to the healthy development of domestic forests


                                                                     147

development of efficient timber drying technology
cedar and cypress timber which are often used to make posts are sawed up and then dried however cracking tended
to occur in the wooddrying process especially for cedar due to its high moisture content therefore resolving this
problem was essential to ensuring consistent quality

sumitomo forestry responded by developing and promoting the mizdas system which is incorporated into timber
drying equipment to automatically control temperature and humidity via computer sensors are attached to the section
of the timber to be dried to measure the moisture content and temperature of the wood inside the drying kiln conditions
are adjusted accordingly to ensure appropriate temperature and humidity levels this system reduces cracking
distortion and other damage to the timber making it possible to deliver the highly competitive and highquality mizdas
cedar posts and mizdas cypress posts at low cost




            cypress posts are dried in a kiln equipped with a                 shipment of cedar posts
                               mizdas system




effective use of unused biomass resources
branches and twigs from thinning of forests and offcuts such as wood left over from logging left alone become a source
of greenhouse gas emissions and are related to forest deterioration and thus their effective use is an important
challenge in order to use wood left over from logging effectively as a source of unused biomass sumitomo forestry
timberland management co ltd took a leading role in the model demonstration project for new business creation
using wood resources from fiscal 2008 and has researched the construction of a system to collect wood left over from
logging and provide wood biomass fuel

this effort has been evaluated and in fiscal 2009 it was decided that all wood left over from logging would be provided
as biomass fuel to sumitomo joint electric power co ltd which will mix it with coal fuel to generate electricity in july
2010 by replacing a portion of the coal used to generate electric power with biomass chips this initiative will cut co2
emissions by 6900 tons annually and also contribute to preservation of local forests

going forward the company is aiming to further expand the business of supplying wood left over from logging across
the nation




                                                                148

 contributions to local communities
in its plantation forest operation activities sumitomo forestry cooperates with residents living in the vicinity of its
projects to ensure that they receive the economic benefits of plantation forest operations in 2000 the company
launched social forestry in indonesia a program for distributing seedlings to local residents free of charge kti and
rpi then promise to buy the grown trees back in six to seven years when the trees are ready for harvesting residents
expect to benefit from this project and supporting their independence and communicating with them builds strong
relationships kti formed a reforestation cooperative in fiscal 2007 and acquired fsc fm certification in december

 promoting the use of timber from sustainable forests
sumitomo forestry procures timber from forests all over the world and therefore has a major obligation to preserve the
worlds forests the timber  building materials divisions forest products trading department and building materials
department have acquired forest stewardship council fsc1 and the programme for the endorsement of forest
certification pefc2 chain of custody coc3 certification to encourage the use of timber from sustainable forests in
addition sumitomo forestry has established a system to survey timber suppliers to ensure that it only handles legally
compliant timber in june 2007 sumitomo forestry established the sumitomo forestry group timber procurement
philosophy and policy and is currently implementing an action plan to promote the procurement of timber grown in
sustainable forests in fiscal 2009 sumitomo forestry revised the action plans for fiscal 2010 and beyond and will from
now advance its efforts based on the new action plans

1 the fsc is a thirdparty organization that provides a global forestry certification system its forest management fm certification
  authenticates forest management while fsc coc certification of business organizations confirms that forest products from certified
  forests are appropriately separated and marked in the storage processing and distribution processes
2 the pefc is a forestry certification program that promotes sustainable forest management by offering certification from third parties
  independent of stakeholders
3 a system for certifying appropriate separation and labeling by operators during storage processing and distribution of timber from
  forests




                                                                    149

expanding imports of plywood made from timber from certified forests and
plantations
in an effort to increase its usage of plywood made with timber from certified forests and plantation forests which are
ecofriendly materials in september 2008 sumitomo forestry decided to expand its imports of plywood made with
timber from certified forests the company is aiming for about 50 of its imported plywood to be made with timber
from certified forests and plantation forests within three years mainly by importing fsccertified plywood manufactured
by the alas kusuma group in indonesia in fiscal 2009 imported plywood made from certified and plantation timber was
approximately 120000 m3 or roughly 28 of total handled volume


launch of largescale commercial forest plantation business
as forecasts for global timber consumption continue to rise loss of forests and destruction of ecosystems are
accelerating at a dramatic pace due to forest fires illegal logging and slashandburn farming in southeast the asia and
other parts of the world in this environment sumitomo forestry jointly launched a largescale commercial forest
plantation business in cooperation with alas kusuma group a company involved in the forestry and plywood
manufacturing businesses in indonesia this initiative not only contributes to the economic development of the local
community by providing employment for local residents in commercial forest plantation operations but also to the
preservation of biodiversity and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions

this initiative classified indonesias lowland forests and peatswamp forests which have been degraded by illegal logging
and slashandburn farming into three areas 1 forest preservation zones 2 buffer zones and 3 forestation zones
by further classifying plantation areas by environmental factors such as soil composition and moisture content the
initiative is able to optimize forestation operations to local environmental conditions forestation program planning
utilizes leadingedge satellite information technology acquired through joint research with the japan aerospace
exploration agency jaxas space open lab system

the aim is to enable sustainable commercial plantation forestry that contributes to the preservation of biodiversity
through appropriate designation of forest preservation zones mosaic planting wherein forestation is undertaken only in
designated areas suited for that purpose and the aggressive introduction of indigenous species an experimental
plantation was launched in october 2009 and full plantation operations will begin in 2010 the plan calls for 40000
hectares to start with rising ultimately to 280000 hectares

         policy on biodiversity preservation in companyowned forests in japan

   the companys policy on biodiversity preservation in companyowned forests in japan was established in
   september 2006

    1 diversity of ecosystems
        we will properly manage strictly protected areas designated under the natural parks law and other
        legislation in a manner stipulated by the law in other areas we will ensure continuity of forests by limiting the
        area of forest harvested particularly when clearcutting is conducted

    2 diversity of species
        we will work to prevent a decline in the number of species existing in natural forests by refraining from
        expansive planting projects and other extreme activities involving the replacement of species that would
        have a major impact on existing ecosystems we will also give the utmost consideration to the protection of
        rare flora and fauna in all operations making reference to the sumitomo forestry red data book

    3 genetic diversity
        genetic variation and the maintenance of populations to support them will become issues in the future
        however analysis is complicated and therefore we will closely watch monitoring activities carried out by
        government and public institutions and their findings




initiatives for biodiversity preservation in companyowned forests
the company also created the sumitomo forestry red data book to list
the rare flora and fauna that might exist in companyowned forests and
provides training to those who work in these forests as a result of this
training consideration of biodiversity is enhanced for example when a
plant was confirmed as an endangered species in the forests of kyushu
the plant was transplanted to neighboring forests with similar growth
environment and protected there the company has been conducting
monitoring surveys to determine the inhabitation situation of mammalian
and avian species in companyowned forests since fiscal 2008 going
forward the company plans to assess the longterm impact of logging
and plantation operations on mammalian and avian species by conducting
annual surveys of one of four regions hokkaido shikoku kyushu or                        sumitomo forestry red data book
wakayama and then repeating the cycle so that each region is surveyed               hyuga forestry office miyazaki prefecture

      monitoring survey of mammalian and avian species in companyowned
      forests in kyushu

as part of a monitoring program for sgec forestry certification sumitomo forestry conducted a monitoring
survey of companyowned forests in kyushu in june 2009 mammalian and avian species were surveyed and
photographed at fixed locations to obtain the basic information needed to preserve biodiversity in
companyowned forests and determine the impact of logging on the surrounding environment

1 important species species included in red data book by national or regional stipulation designated as endangered species under
 the act for protection of cultural properties act for preservation of species miyazaki prefectural ordinance and other laws and
 ordinances

regional environmental planning inc the company that conducted the survey made the following observations
on the impact of clearcutting upon mammalian and avian species

1 mammalian species
     in the companyowned forests in kyushu the presence of japanese serow whose habitat is limited to the
     kyushu forests was confirmed as was the existence of deep mountain environments in the area compared
     to regions where clearcutting was conducted the number of confirmed mammal species was high in the
     surrounding forests and that difference was particularly evident among mediumsized mammals including
     hares raccoon dogs foxes and martens further while mammal habitats and evidence of comings and
     goings were reduced medium and largesized mammals are active across broad areas and diversity is
     expected to advance as vegetation is regenerated and clearcut areas are used as habitats

2 avian species
     the impact of clearcutting operations on bird life is significant as shown by the number and types of
     species and territories in clearcut areas however even the meadow bunting whose habitat is low in bushes
     or on the ground and tree forest species1 such as the blueandwhite flycatcher narcissus flycatcher and
     eurasian jay were confirmed that these species were confirmed is thought due to the clearcut areas being
     surrounded by trees that protected the continuity of tree forests further the presence of tree forest
     species such as the blueandwhite flycatcher in young forests was confirmed and recovery of the number
     and types of species was observed from these observations it is thought that going forward habitat
     species will increase as plant life recovers as will the diversity of constituent species




                                                                 152

3 shared
     of the species confirmed foxes and hodgsons hawkeagle are umbrella species2 and it can be thought that
     habitats capable of supporting a diverse range of mammalian and avian species are preserved in
     companyowned forests further sumitomo forestry and regional environmental planning inc will both
     continue to observe and monitor the impact of operations upon the confirmed endangered species and do
     what is necessary to protect them

1 species whose habitat is tree forests
2 species whose position is at the top of the food chain

sumitomo forestry endeavors to identify appropriately manage and reduce the amount of hazardous chemical
materials used and emitted in its business operations in november 2008 the pollutant release and transfer register
prtr act was revised including the target substances that must be identified by emitted or transported amount
beginning in fiscal 2010 the sumitomo forestry group strictly complies with the revised law and continues to properly
manage all hazardous materials

management of chemical substances at research institute and plants
the sumitomo forestry tsukuba research institute and the plants belonging to sumitomo forestry crest co ltd use
chemical substances in laboratory work and production the tsukuba research institute prepared the chemical
substance management manual based on a pollution prevention agreement it entered into with the city of tsukuba the
institute established an organizational structure for chemical substances management in accordance with the manual
and prescribed methods for receiving storing using and disposing of chemical substances

sumitomo forestry crest produces structural lining and interior materials for use in housing construction the companys
seven plants take precautions to prevent chemical leaks and other environmental accidents they have prepared
environmentrelated operations manuals that prescribe methods for waste disposal water treatment and the handling
of organic solvents among other matters the plants are also measuring concentrations of air and water pollutants and
organic solvents in exhaust gas

the worlds limited water resources make it essential that we use this water efficiently sumitomo forestry is therefore
working to reduce its water use at its factories and offices

efficient use of water resources at plants
of the sumitomo forestry groups 10 domestic manufacturing facilities the no 2 kyushu plant of sumitomo forestry
crest co ltd former toyo plywood co ltd plant which manufactures synthetic resin adhesives etc is a designated
facility under the stipulations of the water pollution control act the other factories manufacture primarily processed
wood products such as plywood and housing interior materials and thus do not use large amounts of water nonetheless
efforts to use water as efficiently as possible are being made at all sumitomo forestry manufacturing facilities

the no 2 kyushu plant of sumitomo forestry crest co ltd uses industrial water primarily to cool manufacturing
equipment and to dilute plant effluents in order to reduce the amount of water used the following initiatives were
continued to fiscal 2009

 1 wastewater was reduced by redesigning production plans to match the actual production sequence in order to
    decrease the number of times equipment is washed
 2 wastewater was reduced by recirculating some of the water used to wash equipment and was reused as a raw
    material
 3 a storage pool for effluent and raw water was covered with a roof to prevent rainwater from increasing wastewater
    volume

strengthening the efforts for items 1 and 2 above resulted in a reduction in the volume of wastewater generated by the
manufacturing division the installation and maintenance of the roof covering the storage pool in item 3 above resulted in
an approximately 10 decrease compared to fiscal 2008 in water sent to wastewater treatment facilities strict
management of the effluent standard cod and control of the discharged amount of treated wastewater resulted in a
reduction of the industrial water used as a result of these efforts a 12 reduction in industrial water used per base unit
of production was achieved in fiscal 2009 greatly exceeding the target of a 6 reduction compared to fiscal 2008

to effectively use precious water resources sumitomo forestry crest co ltd is promoting the use of recycled water
resources at its no 2 kyushu plant niihama plant and komatsushima plant in fiscal 2009 approximately 851000 m3
of recycled and reused water was utilized through such efforts as recycling the water used in water curtain spray booth
and reusing treated wastewater to wash filters of dehydrating machines used at wastewater treatment facilities

 internal environmental audits
different departments of group companies conduct audits of each other to reliably and efficiently progress with
environmental conservation efforts in fiscal 2009 the number of departments conducting mutual audits increased to
85 internal environmental auditors evaluate initiatives propose improvements and check compliance frameworks the
results of internal audits are reported to management which prescribes improvements as needed employees are
qualified as internal environmental auditors by passing an examination upon completion of a training course held twice a
year as of the end of fiscal 2009 a total of 1051 employees including 370 from group companies have qualified as
such auditors



 audits by external certification bodies
iso 14001 certification reviews are conducted annually and renewal examinations are held every three years by external
certification bodies the fiscal 2009 renewal examination recommended nine proposals for improvement these
proposals were studied by relevant departments which decided on appropriate actions to take and internal
environmental audits were conducted to determine the effectiveness of initiatives



    promoting environmental education and training
the company conducts environmental education programs to foster
awareness of environmental issues among employees and to encourage
them to take action of their own accord

examples of these activities include distribution of a monthly email
newsletter on environmental topics sent to all employees as well as the
intranet portal for environmental understanding which provides greater
depth than the email newsletter including qas on industrial waste and
other topics the portal encourages employees to educate themselves
about the environment through a wide array of information ranging from
familiar environmental topics to specialized knowledge

during training for new employees on entry to the company employees
are given a lecture on the groups environmental initiatives in addition to this they are taken on a training trip to the
besshiyama companyowned forestthe companys birthplacein the city of niihama ehime prefecture to provide the
opportunity to consider the environment while experiencing a regenerated forest firsthand
the company also gives lectures on proper treatment and recycling to employees in charge of industrial waste and
regularly provides technical environmental education including courses to train internal iso 14001 environmental
auditors in fiscal 2009 the company continued the introductory course on environmental management for new
environmental representatives a program started in fiscal 2008




                                                                   160

    environmental risk management

 efforts to reduce environmental risks
sumitomo forestry identifies important risks relating to its business activities such as risks associated with industrial
waste soil contamination and illegal logging etc and develops appropriate countermeasures in particular the
sumitomo forestry group regards industrial waste from its various business activities as its most serious environmental
risk and accordingly continues to ensure proper disposal the group also recognizes illegal logging as a major risk and is
working to prevent the handling of illegally logged timber by any group company

in fiscal 2009 there were no significant violations of any environmentrelated laws or ordinances


 proper treatment of industrial waste
approximately 70 of illegally dumped industrial waste in japan is construction waste it is essential therefore that
sumitomo forestry proceed with appropriate waste treatment as a responsible company

in fiscal 2008 the company reviewed its management systems with the aim to further improve the appropriate
treatment of industrial waste as a result it appointed personnel in charge of industrial waste treatment to all group
companies and decided to carry out voluntary compliance audits concerning industrial waste at each company as well as
comprehensive site inspections of intermediate treatment plants

starting in fiscal 2006 sumitomo forestry made a groupwide switch to an electronic manifest system in order to
improve compliance in waste management this system has helped the group outsource waste treatment to only the
best contractors all intermediate treatment contractors working with the housing divisions branches and new housing
construction sites have adopted electronic manifest systems during fiscal 2009 97 of all manifests including those
for housing demolition waste were electronic and the group is aiming for 100 in fiscal 2010

sumitomo forestry will continue to ensure proper disposal of industrial waste by carrying out internal audits of industrial
waste management at the division and company levels and by inspecting disposal sites


 countermeasures against soil contamination
in september 2005 the company issued the guidebook on soil contamination countermeasures for the purpose of
averting soil contamination risk when purchasing land or selling housing lots on behalf of others land purchases are
made only after confirming that the land is safe following a land history survey the property development business
division which operates a subdivision business conducts soil contamination inspections prior to the purchase of new
land as a standard procedure and has put in place a system that prohibits the use of contaminated land

in may 2006 the company drew up the guidelines on soil contamination countermeasures for land owned or
administered by the sumitomo forestry group for employment in groupwide efforts to determine the presence of soil
contamination

in fiscal 2008 sumitomo forestry crests kashima plant conducted a soil contamination survey on its grounds as a
voluntary initiative to address environmental risk as a result the groundwater was found to slightly exceed the
standards set for voc volatile organic compound contamination

the soil contamination countermeasures act mandates purification only when the land is to be sold or returned to the
owner in order to reduce risk soil purification using bioremediation1 was carried out in fiscal 2009 subsequently no
values exceeding the relevant standards have been detected at observation wells established as part of a continuing
monitoring program

preventing the use of illegally logged timber
since illegal logging leads to deforestation it has become a major issue of public concern sumitomo forestry performs
checks of all overseas suppliers of raw timber lumber and wood products to confirm legal compliance and to ensure
that the group does not handle any illegally logged timber to improve reliability the group sends local sumitomo
forestry representatives and inspectors to visit logging sites and confirm compliance when necessary in fiscal 2009 the
group continued to confirm the legal compliance of suppliers outside japan and completed checking of 163 companies
surveys conducted over the three years since fiscal 2006 show the company achieved 100 compliance for all timber
directly imported from overseas suppliers

developing technology to propagate treasured and precious trees
in every region of japan there are trees that have been treasured from long ago and some are centuries old to ensure
these precious trees are passed down to subsequent generations sumitomo forestry is working to develop propagation
technology to reproduce the properties of the original trees leveraging the groups accumulated expertise in
propagation through cutting grafting and biotechnology

in 2009 cutting technology was successful in propagating the famous japanese camellia tree at reiganji temple in
kyoto as well as the sasanqua tree at ankokuronji temple in kamakura the sasanqua tree at ankokuronji temple is
thought to be more than 350 years old and previous efforts to use cutting technology failed to root the application of
a natural plant fatty acid called koda1 showed a remarkable effect on promotion of root growth enabling the
propagation of the tree

in february 2010 tissue cultures one type of biotechnology were used to successfully propagate the famous
omurozakura cherry trees of the ninnaji temple in kyoto this is the first time that omurozakura trees have been
propagated to the seedling stage passing on the cherished double blossoms characteristic of this species for future
generations to enjoy

development of technology to use plantation timber
sumitomo forestry is developing technologies to use trees that have not been used previously as well as fastgrowing
trees to promote the growth of its overseas wooden panel business

kutai timber indonesia kti a group company started plantation forestry of balsa trees in 2000 and has been
developing technology to use the balsa which is now nearing the harvesting stage in its plywood and blockboard
products conventional thinking held balsa to be difficult to use in board products but repeated rd cycle resulted in
two ways to do so first the tsukuba research institute and kti developed a blockboard plywood using bamboo as a
surface veneer when used as flooring the high insulative properties of balsa are expected to lessen the coldness of
floors in winter the other use combines balsa with kamerere wood grown on plantations operated by open bay timber
ltd a group company as raw materials for structural plywood despite being broadleaf plywood it can be
manufactured at the same weights as the mainstream conifer plywood made from larch wood and japanese cedar
cryptomeria japonica and contributes to improved workability
patents are pending on these technologies at the current time

in preparation for the start of particleboard pb manufacturing in vietnam in 2012 the tsukuba research institute has
been investigating raw materials that can be sourced reliably in vietnam and used to produce highquality pb
researchers examined the material characteristics of previously unused tree species including plantation trees that can
be sourced from neighboring regions and fruit trees experimentally fabricated pb in laboratory settings and
testfabricated fullsize pb in cooperation with a group company then conducting processing experiments the yearlong
effort made possible the manufacture of highquality pb using sustainable plantation timber and led to the decision to
start operations

development of energysaving renovation techniques
energysaving technologies for structures centered on improvement of insulation and airtightness not only make the
living environment more comfortable but also have the effect of reducing lighting and heating costs and controlling co2
emissions sumitomo forestry is developing a variety of renovation techniques that save energy in existing structures
meeting the demands of society and our customers for saving energy in the home

in fiscal 2009 the company developed a method for easily assessing the insulation of structures on site using a compact
thermal camera the company also developed insulation panels that do not require demolition of the structurethe
panels are easily installed over the existing walls the company will continue to promote energysaving technologies and

development of radiant cooling and heating system
the cooling and heating systemair conditioningmost commonly used today uses convection to control interior air
temperatures air conditioning using convection is extremely energyefficient but may have negative health effects such
as discomfort from coldhot air blowing directly on the body the excess dryness of the air or even causing whats
commonly known as an air conditioning cold

sumitomo forestry is developing radiant cooling and heating systems specifically designed for nursing homes for senior
citizens radiant cooling and heating systems control the surface temperature of the ceiling have the same energy
efficiencies as convection air conditioners and aim to provide a comfortable and healthy indoor environment radiant
cooling and heating systems are characterized as the cool comfortable feeling you get inside a tunnel during the
summer and the warmth you feel when sitting in a sunny spot during the winter radiant systems do not generate
uncomfortable air currents like air conditioners and place a small load on the body in the past however radiant systems
did not sufficiently dehumidify the air resulting in problems with condensation by using a system with a dehumidification
system this problem is solved

the company continues to research develop and test radiant cooling and heating systems aiming for
commercialization of the resulting products

ninnaji temple omurozakura research project
in april 2007 a joint research project to ascertain the ecological history of the omurozakura cherry blossoms was
launched by the ninnaji temple chiba university and sumitomo forestry group companies sumitomo forestry
sumitomo forestry landscaping and the former sumirin base techno co ltd the omurozakura are a cluster of
satozakura cherry trees measuring only two to three meters tall that grow inside the ninnaji temple compound the
former omuro imperial palace in kyotos ukyo ward

the trees had been weakening in recent years indicated by prominent dead branches and late blossoming this
prompted a threetofiveyear study to survey and analyze soil and root conditions and devise recovery methods
studies from 2007 had already determined that the clayrich soil did not have enough carbon and nitrogen to nurture
trees making it difficult to retain moisture in 2009 the study confirmed that the roots of the trees were only about one
meter long less than half the normal length attributable to the difficulty in growing below this hard layer of earth
following on these surveys biotechnology in the form of tissue culturing was used successfully for the first time to
propagate seedlings in february 2010 which will pass on to future generations the doubleblossom characteristic for
which the trees are renowned

to enable the passing on of this precious variety sumitomo forestry will conduct further research and investigation
aiming to explain the growing conditions for seedlings propagated through tissue culturing establish dna analysis
technology for matching the strain and explore the use of cultivated seedlings at nurseries to supplant stumps of trees
that have withered and died

overseas reforestation consultancy
sumitomo forestry provided consulting services to roland corporation regarding a reforestation project roland has
been importing wood from indonesia for the cabinets of its electric pianos and in fiscal 2007 it commissioned
indonesias stateowned forest enterprise perum perhutani to carry out reforestation to produce the raw materials for
the cabinets as well as environmental reforestation which is a type of reforestation that does not harvest trees to
contribute to the environment and the local community

the industrial reforestation project began in january 2008 with the planting of trees across a total of 724 hectares the
planted trees are growing well and are on track to be harvested beginning in january 2012 the project timeframe is
eight years until march 2015

environmental reforestation accelerates the cultivation of water resources contributes to local economies through the
cultivation of fruit trees and medicinal plants and contributes to the prevention of global warming through the
absorption of co2 as the trees grow with these objectives in mind a total of 306 hectares were planted in january
2009 supplemental planting was conducted for plantation trees that had dried out the project timeframe is planned for
five years

plantation forest operation using satellite information
plantation forest operations in developing countries require information about the natural environment such as the
geography vegetation soil and climate but in many cases this kind of environmental data and even accurate maps are
often unavailable in developing economies without such data however it is impossible to develop plantations that are
optimally suited to the location inevitably in the absence of such data the plantation will fail potentially causing severe
damage to the environment thus it is necessary to devote much time and effort to the collection of basic data

accordingly sumitomo forestry is developing a plantation forest operation model using information from landobserving
satellites by using satellite information environmental data of the planned site stretching across a broad area can be
obtained or estimated with a high degree of accuracy which is extremely valuable for conducting reforestation projects
in developing countries

in cooperation with the hiroshima institute of technology and kyoto university sumitomo forestry proposed this
plantation forest operation model to the fiscal 2008 space open lab and it was selected as an afforestation business
model for developing nations using satellite data the industrial collaboration department1 of the japan aerospace
exploration agency jaxa an independent administrative organization administers the space open lab project the
project is being conducted jointly with jaxa through the current fiscal year

largescale industrial plantations established in degraded forests in tropical zones would help control global warming and
contribute to local economies through the creation of new jobs further the establishment of a stable supply of timber
resources from plantation forests is expected to reduce dependence on timber resources from natural forests thus
contributing to the preservation of natural forests the clean development mechanism cdm2 reforestation project
which is currently garnering significant attention and redd monitoring3 will also play major roles

in order to establish this plantation business model the company has begun to develop and test a plantation
development support tool using satellite information in the companys largescale industrial plantation operation in
plantation forest areas of west kalimantan in indonesia technological development will be completed by fiscal 2010
with full operations expected from 2011

research on germination of yoshino cherry trees using koda
in february 2009 shiseido co ltd and sumitomo forestrys joint research led to the discovery that ketol
octadecadienoic acid koda a natural plant fatty acid promotes rooting of the yoshino cherry tree when propagating
the tree from cuttings

observations of growth after stem cuttings of the yoshino cherry tree were sprayed with koda revealed that the
development rate was two to three times higher than normal
when koda was used with cutting technology on the japanese camellia tree at reiganji temple in kyoto as well as the
sasanqua tree at ankokuronji temple in kamakura remarkable root development and enhanced growth were observed
and the cultivation was a success going forward the company will aim for commercialization of koda while validating
its effects on endangered plants

koda itself does not induce rooting but rather interrupts dormancy after buds and seeds are complete and stimulates
the cells original functions the company will conduct further research to fully explain this process

that have a low environmental impact office product and company vehicle purchasing guidelines were established in
2006 laying down a clear set of standards for progressing with green purchasing

leased vehicles operated by group companies are being replaced with select highfuelefficiency vehicles based on group
standards in july 2009 the reevaluation of the highfuelefficiency vehicles was set forth in the guidelines the
reevaluation of the highfuelefficiency vehicles will be conducted at least once a year from the perspective of both cost
and environmental considerations

to increase the share of highfuelefficiency vehicles across the sumitomo forestry group in fiscal 2009 the group
publicized the guidelines comprehensively and communicated with business units whose vehicle leases were due to
expire as a result of these efforts the share of fuelefficient standard models among new vehicles leased was 797
an improvement from 636 the previous fiscal year the share of highfuelefficiency vehicles among the groups total
vehicles including existing vehicles was 452 as of march 2010 from october 2009 the group began switching to
highfuelefficiency tires whenever leased vehicles undergo scheduled maintenance

efforts to increase green purchasing in the future

     comment from president kawanami

rpi has planted 58 million trees across approximately 3000 hectares as of
january 2010 the majority of the plantation forests will provide raw
materials for our businesses and the remainder will be environmental
plantation forests that will never be harvested weve distributed seedlings
free of charge as part of our csr activities but the scale of this
reforestation is unprecedented this is a fitting way to commemorate the
20th anniversary of our founding and we believe it will be linked with
enhancement of corporate environmental value




     comment from director djunarko

rpis plantation forests are based on a system whereby seedlings are
distributed to the community free of charge and then five years later we
buy back the plantation trees theyve grown at market prices this
provides our business with raw materials but also creates employment
opportunities the implementation of this environmental plantation forestry
system in the gobon area also helps local residents who previously cut
down trees secretly to burn as fuel to appreciate the environment

we will continue to strive to be a company that contributes to the local
community




                  171

    rpi to commemorate 20 th anniversary with 100hectare environmental
    forestry plantation
rpi will establish environmental plantation forests on approximately 100
hectares of land as part of the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of
its founding

the joint project with perhutani the national forestry public corporation
will take place on devastated land in central javas gobon district
previously a teak plantation the land became arid after years of local
residents illegally cutting down trees and exposure of the soil to salt air
with the result that no plants could grow



                                                                                       gobon site of the planned plantation

                                      the trees to be planted are of the nyamplung calophyllum inophyllum species
                                      nyamplung is an ideal tree for establishing water resources in an area that is
                                      suffering from severe water shortages further the oil extracted from the seeds can
                                      potentially be used for bioenergy local residents will sell the seeds from trees
                                      planted and cultivated by rpi to perhutani providing the basis for development of
                                      the local economy

                                      contributing to the community is integral to rpis action plan and we will continue to
                                      engage in activities that contribute to the local community

                                         soccer is by far the most popular sport in indonesia because many people
                                         can have fun with just one ball futsal is also popular because it requires
                                         less space to play than soccer and if you have 10 people you can start a
                                         game every friday after work is done teams comprised of people from
                                         different departments gather to play futsal and refresh their spirits and
                                         recharge their stamina after a long week of work and its a great
                                         opportunity to meet people and make friends from other departments that
                                         you dont normally have contact with in the course of daily business going
                                         forward we hope to increase cooperative and friendly relationships by
                                         arranging futsal matches with our neighbors suppliers and other japanese
                                         companies
