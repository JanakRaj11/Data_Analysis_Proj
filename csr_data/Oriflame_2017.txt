     water is an important part of our environmental impact today water security                                                        across our value chain                  of our business

     our world demand for water is increasing and analysis suggests that by 2030
     the world will face a 40 gap between what we need and what is available
                                                                                                                                                                                   packaging for cosmetics
         water issues are therefore a global challenge but because we operate
     in waterscarce countries it is important for us to consider the implications
     on a local level too looking specifically at our business there are two main
     challenges we need to address water contamination and water scarcity
         to understand these challenges better we conducted a water impact study
     of the lifecycle of a representative selection of our key products in 2013                                                                                                    45
         the results of this study have helped us define the focus areas for our                                                                                                    plastic

     learned just how much of our water footprint comes from customers using
     our products  and how much higher the impact of this is in waterscarce
     countries like india because of this we are looking at how we can engage our    freshwater withdrawal
     customers around more sustainable water use
                                                                                       life cycle stages shampoo
         we know that the water impact from our manufacturing sites is a limited
     part of the life cycle impact however for local communities this impact may                                                                                                  8                                                                    6

         another important focus area raised by the study is the biodegradability

     strengthen this commitment further for example by phasing out specific
