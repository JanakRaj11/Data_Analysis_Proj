waste and recycling
waste and recycling were identified by quadras stakeholders as being one of the most important aspects of the
organizations sustainability program
expired or damaged food products were previously disposed of as chemical waste in 2012 partnerships were
formed with pork producers which allowed quadra to divert a portion of food waste for animal feed quadra will
continue to use these and other best practices to reduce environmental impact on landfills
overall the amount of waste as a percentage of total products handled continues to remain a very low 003 in
2016 as a result of efficient inventory management initiatives and thus fewer expired products                           aspect energy
