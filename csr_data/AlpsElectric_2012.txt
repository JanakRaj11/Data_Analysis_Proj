alps electric considers csr as business itself ever since our founding many years ago we have based
business decisions on societal contribution and building trust which are expressions taken from our
original founding precepts then in our 50th year after establishment we defined our corporate
philosophy as alps creates new value that satisfies stakeholders and is friendly to the earth and
forged our business approach with five statements acting to realize this philosophy by observing this
business approach and integrating our social responsibilities with business activity we are able to fulfill
stakeholder expectations and pursue mankinds coexistence with the natural environment

pursuit of value




alps electric fuses mechatronic analog and other technologies
to create new sophisticated highquality and high valueadded
devices modules and system products in our ongoing pursuit to
perfect the art of electronics
this perfection of products is founded upon three core values
right unique and green right products are light compact
made with highly sophisticated technology have the right
appearance at the right price and possess the right functions
performance and quality unique products display alps
creativity and originality and green products exhibit
environmental consideration over their entire lifecycles including
their recyclability and energy efficiency when used in final
consumer products
a marketoriented perspective is essential for alps to perfect
products using these three core values which is why we                                      director
maintain strong relationships with customers and share ideas          new  consumer module business
about product development right from the early stages we                            general manager
define exactly what functions our components ought to possess
and develop the necessary technology accordingly materializing
our three core values in the process

pursuit of value

perfecting the art of electronics
by perfecting the art of electronics alps electric is committed to developing new value that contributes
to the prosperity of society and brings convenience to peoples lives electrical and electronic
equipment have become an indispensable part of our lives these devices are increasingly becoming
highperformance multifunctional and compact and are dependent upon the even smaller electronic
components inside them which carry out a variety of highly specific functions alps electronic
components are incorporated into all kinds of products including automobiles home appliances cellular
phones pcs printers and game consoles in this way our electronic components contribute to making
peoples lives safer more convenient and comfortable

developing products to meet customers needs
in our daily lives we are surrounded by various kinds of radio waves used for broadcasting and
communication with television and mobile phones the condition in which these radio waves interfere
with each other causing communication problems such as difficulty in receiving proper data between
devices is known as noise noise can even occur in the inside of digital devices themselves including
mobile phones as a countermeasure for this problem alps electric developed a magnetic sheet
liqualloy for noise suppression based on proprietary technology cultivated through rd of magnetic
materials
besides suppressing noise magnetic sheets are also used to efficiently catch radio waves they help
stabilize rfid system communication in noncontact ic cards such as suica1 rechargeable
prepaid travel passes and osaifu keitai2 mobile phones equipped with electronic money by
catching radio waves and improving antenna sensitivity
we will continue to support the digital society through utilizing our proprietary technologies to develop
products that use this magnetic material

1 suica is a trademark of east japan railway company
2 osaifu keitai is a trademark of ntt docomo inc




ceatec japan 2011
each year alps electric participates in ceatec
japan asias largest general it and electronics
exhibition showcasing the latest products services and
technologies the theme for alps exhibit at ceatec
japan 2011 was paving the way to the future with
smart components a demonstration showed how a
current sensor installed inside a television or other
electronic appliance could be combined with a wireless
lan module to allow wireless transmission of current
data detected by the sensor which would then appear                     alps booth at ceatec japan 2011
on a display visualizing power consumption by the
appliance visitors to the alps booth were able to learn about alps products and technological
capabilities through handson exhibits and feedback received is being applied to the creation of new
value




conveying alps core technology and product value while also listening to visitor feedback

pursuit of value

creating value to benefit lowcarbon societies
alps electric is making companywide efforts to cultivate its green device business in order to benefit
lowcarbon societies a part of these efforts has lead to the formation of alps green devices co ltd a
corporation established on may 17th 2010 with the innovation network corporation of japan incj to
develop compact power control devices and highly efficient power conversion devices by applying the
magnetic powder material liqualloy and thinfilm process technology the company has developed
unique reactors and power inductors with low power loss it also offers uniquely structured compact
current sensors that can be used in smart meters and hybrid  electric vehicles the new green devices
company will seek open innovation as the entire alps electric group aims to become the global
standard in green devices

creating new value
the electronics industry is everchanging and to remain competitive companies must constantly
develop and market cuttingedge products customers have diverse requirements and among them
consistent quality is especially important minimal lead times in product development are also essential
in order to remain competitive in markets that change so often however insufficient time allocation to
designing and testing may also result in products of inadequate quality being released into the market
to solve this dilemma alps electric in fiscal 2002 created a development process termed ippatsu
kando which conceptualizes manufacturing products that work perfectly the first time in short
ippastukando means to provide products consistent in quality to implement this concept alps electric
employs various methods which utilize quality engineering qe
anticipating the needs of customers comes first with the quality function deployment qfd method
alps electric looks at customer needs and resources then sets up projects to create products which are
sure to be in demand in the near future next while utilizing it as much as possible and with the
subsequent aid of 3dimensional computer aided design 3dcad and computer aided engineering
cae alps electric develops functions and product quality on a digital basis this process minimizes
costs and time used for creating and testing prototypes product evaluations are implemented early on
from product development phases through utilizing qe to check on quality and reliability preventing
inferiorquality products from entering the market
the introduction of these methods for evaluation allows alps electric to swiftly produce reliable and
highquality products along with creating products which the market will need in the future alps will
continue to perfect these methods with the aim of shortening the time used in developing and producing
more reliable products of consistent quality

initiatives in fiscal 2008

evaluating product performance off the production line

during the final phases of development that precede
massproduction quality assurance departments need
to carry out evaluations the departments must
examine products thoroughly for reliability in the
shortest time possible to make sure that all customers
will be satisfied in the past alps electric used a
conventional specification evaluation method which
tested whether products conformed to certain
specifications however we have recently introduced a
                                                             evaluating reliability through designated tools
new functionality evaluation system which tests the
functional reliability of products this new method lets
alps electric evaluate products based on the actual way customers would use them additionally the
new method takes less than one third of the time than the previous method of evaluation




realizing ippatsukando in molds

in the past the conventional process for manufacturing
molds relied upon continual modification of prototypes
until the desired shape was eventually achieved now
however when alps electric develops new molds a
new manufacturing process based on the ippatsu
kando concept is utilized this method also has the
added benefit of keeping processing costs down in
introducing a new approval system for molds and while
improving process precision we use digital design
methods computer aided engineering cae and
quality engineering qe to verify functional stability in
the development phases as a result of these steps for
increasing accuracy alps was able to bring
manufacturing time down while achieving a significant
improvement in quality

shortening product development time and realizing functional stability

one of alps electrics major products is the switch
however the market for switches changes rapidly and
in order to respond to customer needs the company
has to develop new and reliable products with speed
along with high precision technologies that allow
smaller product dimensions alps electrics unique
digital manufacturing dm initiative helps the
company stay competitive in this changing market dm
is used in designing products with functions the market
is expected to demand before raising their functional
consistency through multiple simulations alps electric
applies this method to every process in product
development from design phases to manufacture
preparation to mass production itself applying the dm

initiative has made it possible for alps electric to
shorten product development timeframes considerably thereby allowing the company to provide reliable
products with speed

harmony with nature




at alps electric where our main line of business is
manufacturing environmental conservation is an extremely
important aspect of our csr green has always been a
precondition for the art of electronics facilitating our
production of smaller and lighter components with higher energy
and material efficiency and our aggressive promotion of energy
saving and zeroemissions initiatives in production processes
we have also progressed with our mediumterm action plans
for environmental preservation in parallel which integrate
individual division activities in order to lower environmental
impact even more efficiently and effectively
a company such as alps electric that is involved in worldwide
business needs its existence as a crew member of spaceship
earth to be accepted in the global community in order to
increase our value as a global citizen of sound judgment we will             senior managing director
maintain our balance of global business and environmental                            general manager
activities in keeping with a management that is in harmony with            administration headquarters
the environment
furthermore we hope to promote environmentally friendly
lifestyles throughout our employees homes we could realize individual contributions to environmental
preservation by around 100000 people by including family members of group company employees in
our initiatives the realization of harmony with nature depends on the environmental awareness of
each and every employee

harmony with nature

environmental management
alps as a crew member of spaceship
earth considers conservation of the global
environment an important management
responsibility in 1994 we established a
companywide environmental charter and a
mediumterm plan with the objective of
becoming more proactive and preventive in
environmental preservation
since 1994 our environmental preservation
plans have expanded to include a global
management structure and a corporate
turn towards green products lowering the
impact our business activities have on the
environment is a necessary step in
perfecting the art of electronics




environmental management system
alps recognizes that iso 14001 the international
standard for environmental management systems is
an important criterion in environmental management
all our domestic and overseas production facilities
have acquired 14001 certification and every certified
location performs internal environmental audits at least
once a year in accordance with the iso 14001
standards

                                                           an audit in progress by a thirdparty auditor
mediumterm action plans for environmental
preservation have been formulated ever since
implementation of our inaugural action plan in 1994 each site additionally creates and implements its
own independent plan fiscal 2009 marked the beginning of environmental activity based on the sixth
mediumterm action plan for environmental preservation




legal compliance
part of alps electrics commitment to and full compliance with laws and regulations related to the
environment includes a voluntary standard that is more stringent than legally required in each country in
fiscal 2011 there were three environmentrelated statutory violations two relating to wastewater
standards one relating to noise presumed to be consequences of the great east japan earthquake
these violations were acted upon in a prompt and appropriate manner

environmental management structure
policies and measures relating to environmental management are finalized in the environment
conference comprising representatives of business locations in japan and chaired by the director in
charge of the environment finalized policies and measures are implemented in japan through the
environment conference and outside japan by representatives and environmental management
representatives of overseas affiliates as secretariat of the environment conference the csr
department falls under the supervision of the director in charge of the environment and is charged with
advancing environmental management through the formulation of companywide environmental
measures gathering of information and other duties working groups reporting to the environment
conference have also been established to examine specific issues such as global warming and waste
emissions

environmental management structure as of september 2012




environmental education
alps headquarters conducts environmental training for
new recruits and new managers according to their
qualification grades employees at each plant also
receive environmental training specific to their jobs

harmony with nature

environmental impact
alps electric has provided material balance reports since fiscal 2000 since fiscal 2003 information from
offshore facilities has also been included in these reports however data on certain issues from
overseas has taken longer to obtain due to some difficulties in the information collection procedure
total material input and output of offshore facilities have both increased due to recent production
expansion subsequently contributing more to the material balance of alps electric globally


in light of this we will improve the information collection system of offshore performance data and
utilize the collected data to continue to reduce total environmental impact

harmony with nature

earthfriendly product design
the shift to a green economy has received much attention in recent years the aim of such a shift is
the establishment of a sustainable society where there is balance between environmental preservation
and economic growth alps electric intends to comply with this social demand through sustainable
product development product assessments are geared toward reducing restricted chemical content in
products ensuring efficient use of resources by making products smaller thinner and lighter and
preventing global warming by cutting power consumption and improving the efficiency of manufacturing
processes initiatives are also in place to enable a swift response to new chemical substance
regulations like reach related company alps green devices too is dedicated to the development of
components for power conversion control and metering equipment which will facilitate the realization of
a lowcarbon society




monozukuri with life cycle assessments
all aspects of product design must also be considered in terms of environmental impact the different
stages of a products life cycle include procurement of materials and parts production transportation
and final use in fiscal 2005 we began life cycle assessments lca for our products to assess 1
the environmental impact of products during each stage of their life cycle evaluations are based on
parameters identified for each stage with products assessed in terms of an overall rating assessments
currently cover parts and materials used in products and our own manufacturing processes and we are
working to establish a system that allows regular assessments we are also coordinating with the
industry on life cycle inventory lci analysis 2

1 product assessments are a way of evaluating the environmental impact of a product during its development appropriate
measures for reducing the impact are then built into the product
2 life cycle inventory lci analysis involves a detailed study of substance and energy inputs and outputs for each process
during a products life cycle

global management of chemical substance content in products
regulations and other restrictions placed on chemical substance content in products have become
increasingly stringent it will be more important than ever before to meet societys demands in this area
for example by responding to customer requests for information on chemical substances in products


in answering that call alps electric promotes design of products that do not contain hazardous chemical
substances furthermore we have constructed a global management system designed to eliminate
hazardous substances from all processes from materials procurement to assembly and shipping
for example information on chemical substance content in materials purchased from suppliers is
managed by a database accessible from any domestic or overseas alps base it provides uptodate

can be conveyed to customers as required




compliance with reach
the eus reach regulation which came into effect in
2007 requires companies to register notify and submit
information concerning certain chemicals to the eu
and supply chains to ensure complete compliance
with the reach regulation alps electric has identified
all substances it handles that require registration and
notification to the eu as of march 2011 in terms of
communicating chemical substance content in
products substances that are candidates to be made
subject to authorization svhc are promptly included
in internal management standards and to enable            a sheet used to submit information concerning chemical
smooth communication of information to customers          substances contained in products
we adopt measures conforming to the formats of
individual industries like the automotive and electronics industries




promotion of green procurement
we use green procurement to provide our customers
with safer and environmentally friendly products
suppliers with proven management systems supply
alps electric with materials and parts that contain no
hazardous substances we deploy our green
procurement standard to suppliers to follow and
conduct the following two evaluations an
environmental corporate evaluation  our evaluation
of the suppliers efforts towards environmental
conservation  and a materials evaluation  for
assuring that substances specifically prohibited by alps
electric are not present in raw material and parts
we have also created the alps green procurement            global deployment of our green procurement standard in
system which allows worldwide access to our                japanese english and chinese

earthfriendly logistics
in cooperation with alps logistics a core company of
the alps group we are pursuing earthfriendly
logistics
we have for example reduced the amount of waste
generated in shipping by switching to
returnablereusable containers and by discontinuing
the use of wrapping film originally to prevent stacked
loads from toppling over by standardizing shipment
packaging and consistently reviewing transportation
                                                          using returnable and reusable containers
routes we have also been able to reduce transportation
costs we have also adopted a modal shift where we
have begun to use japan railways freight containers
in transportation leading to reduced truck shipments
and a significant decrease in co2 emissions
furthermore we have created 10 ecodrive rules
that are now standard operation during driving in order
to lessen the environmental impacts from our vehicles


                                                          container used in our modal shift

preventing global warming
alps electric reduces its co2 emissions through improvements to facilities like the introduction of highly
efficient systems and upgrading of energyefficient production facilities and by conducting regular
energy conservation patrols to achieve operational improvements such as improvement of compressor
and air conditioning system operation and reduction of nonessential lighting during the power crunch
last year in japan we set a big target to reduce electricity usage at peak hours by 25 measures
introduced to improve our power supply and demand balance included rotational operation at plants
and at alps headquarters an early bird initiative whereby working hours were brought forward by one
hour


our co2 emissions totaled 44457 tons in fiscal 2011 continuing our yearonyear achievements in
emissions reduction emissions per unit of output also decreased




25 companywide peak power reduction target achieved
combined peak hour power consumption of all plants during the period in question in 2011 was
approximately 12700kw compared to approximately 19000kw in 2010 a peak power reduction far
exceeding the 25 target


from june 27 to september 10 a period of around two and a half months plants operated on a
rotational basis plants also cooperated on electricity management for example by accommodating
power requirements of other plants based on power usage forecasts and monitoring other efforts
involved turning off nonessential lighting energyefficient operation of systems and locating operations
in the same areas


inhouse generators were made available but were used only at one plant and in consideration of
employee health it was ensured that air conditioning systems on manufacturing floors stayed on

initiatives at bases

alps headquarters

alps headquarters implemented an early bird initiative from july 1 to september 15 2011
bringing forward one hour the start of the working day and peak power time in response to the
power shortage in regions supplied by tokyo electric power company in office areas fans were
used to cut back operation of air conditioning systems and employees were encouraged to wear
light attire other measures included energyefficient use of lighting and air conditioning and power
saving efforts by the entirely electric cafeteria eg integration of some menus and suspension of
dinner provision


as a result of these efforts average peak power consumption for 2011 was approximately 385kw
and maximum consumption was 531kw thus consumption did not exceed 596kw the value
representing the upper limita 25 reduction compared to peak power consumption in 2010on
any day during the period in question


ningbo alps electronics co ltd

ningbo alps electronics china carries out a number of initiatives aimed at reducing energy
consumption at its plant during winter the energy requirement for air conditioning was reduced by
drawing in cold air from outside free cooling another initiative involved recycling residual heat
from air compressors using heat exchangers allowing boilers to be turned off improvements were
also made such as operating clean room fan filter units according to the conditions combined
these initiatives reduced annual electricity and heavy fuel consumption by 2 million kwh and 150
kiloliters respectively



                           we are tackling energy conservation from the perspectives of both
                           cost reductions and environmental protection at the start we had
                           trouble working out what we could do to save energy we discussed
                           the various approaches to energy conservation gathered knowledge
                           from various sources such as the internet and formulated an overall
                           energy conservation plan now we use free energy which has led to
   human resources 
                           notable energy savings we will continue looking into applications of
   general affairs dept

reducing waste
since fiscal 2001 alps electric has implemented a zero emissions 1 initiative aimed at recycling all
wastes from offices and production plants this target was successfully achieved by the end of fiscal
2004 at all divisions in japan


during the sixth mediumterm action plan for environmental preservation we will continue to reduce
waste volumes and we also aim to improve our recycling rate by starting recycling of some waste types
previously excluded from our initiatives


in fiscal 2011 although our recycling rate improved the volume of waste increased as did waste per
unit of output

1zero emissions a recyclingoriented social system that eliminates all kinds of waste by effectively recycling them into raw
materials and other useful purposes advocated by the united nations university in 1994

alps electric czech carries out activities aimed at
improving waste management efficiency to
reduce waste volume boxes used for delivery of
parts are replaced with reusable boxes or for
example sold to local ceramics manufacturers for
reuse the company thus prioritizes reuse over
recycling which entails turning waste back into

travel inhouse and transportation costs have
been reduced due to fewer truck loads since a
compressor was introduced to reduce the cubic volume of waste



                           when we first introduced the compressor the opening was too small
                           and cartons would get stuck so a worker had to be on hand with the
                           help of the equipment provider we made the opening bigger allowing
                           smooth insertion of the cartons we also managed to cut labor costs
                           because we no longer required an additional person on hand now we
                           are examining how we might be able to use the equipment to

countermeasures for environmental risk

alps electric takes steps to abate the risk of
environmental damage occurring as a result of
unforeseen accidents or disasters


environmental risk maps have been drawn up for
each plant and are updated on a regular basis these
maps specify on plant plans where chemical
substances and waste are handled areas prone to
accidents are indicated along with areas where risk
                                                             verifying response and measures practicality and efficiency
events have occurred in the past sharing the                for a hypothetical spillage of heavy oil at our nagaoka plant
information lessens the risk to the environment risk is     niigata prefecture
also alleviated through improvements to facilities
including replacement of underground pipelines with aboveground doublewalled pipelines construction
of containment dikes at tanker stops and installation of spill sensors to ensure readiness emergency
response plans have been formulated and are tested through regular drills

partnership with customers

improving product quality
before our products land into the hands of the end user they are incorporated into the products of
assembly manufacturers  our direct customers  where they are given important roles in the functions of
the end products of those independent makers in order to supply the art of electronics and services
that satisfy our customers and the end user every alps employee is working to improve the quality of
our products in addition we diligently anticipate customer needs and work on developing and
evaluating technologies and products that we foresee as being potentially required by the customer




quality control policy
each fiscal year quality management policies are established in line with the fundamental quality
control policy quality management systems are established implemented and continually improved
in order to facilitate improvements in global quality performance qualityrelated achievements and
issues are not only shared within individual plants but also reported regularly to the board of directors
to be shared companywide

quality management system
international standards for quality management systems are essential for business as they ascertain
that all departments contribute to customer satisfaction through elements of quality assurance every
alps electric production plant including overseas had been certified iso 9001 compliant by fiscal 2005
furthermore plants producing automotiverelated products have also been certified isots 16949
compliant our efforts toward further improving our quality management systems are never ending




efforts to improve quality
originally the principle behind quality inspections was
to confirm conformance of products with specification
sheets agreed upon with individual customers
however that confirmation alone did not prevent
defects occurring in processes performed by
customers or during use by end users


for that reason alps electric adopted a new
evaluation method based on quality engineering qe
                                                           basic training in qe for employees
the method involves verifying whether individual
products function correctly and is effective when used
together with techniques for evaluating the consistency of functions in a short period of time in
preventing output of defective products education about qe provided to employees besides teaching
skills fosters a strong commitment to preventing defects alps will continue these efforts to ensure
customers receive products of the highest possible quality

partnership with customers

improving customer satisfaction
our customers are either assembly manufacturers who deliver final products to consumers or are the
manufacturers of parts that are required for assembling these final consumer products in order to
satisfy our customers demands we must closely observe consumer and market needs and always be
prepared for the future products and technologies customers may demand
our global sales personnel believe we can contribute to customers business scenarios by
communicating with them directly and therefore enabling us to make suggestions regarding products
and technologies from a customer perspective by realizing this concept we aim to contribute to society
through our customers products




ways to improve customer satisfaction
to anticipate customer needs in technology or certain
product areas alps electrics sales departments create
product roadmaps of trends and characteristics for
each major market and propose research plans
designs and development of products to meet market
demands providing customers with their desired
solutions and newly developed products in a timely
manner is one of the key roles we have additionally a
global sales  marketing conference is held
                                                          a global sales  marketing conference held at our

  when requests for investigation and
  complaints are received they are
  entered into the gqis by sales
  personnel and then shared with
  domestic and overseas production bases
  to respond accordingly the information
  entered can be examined closely by
  managers and relevant personnel at any
  time in order to monitor the progress of a prompt response we also utilize the information for
  future sales promotion and quality improvements by analyzing trends in the information

employee training to heighten customer satisfaction

mutual development with suppliers
cooperation with suppliers is an essential element in meeting customer needs in aspects such as
quality assurance timely delivery price environmental conservation and corporate social responsibility
based on our own purchasing approach and purchasing policies we work at strengthening
partnerships with our suppliers and fulfilling our responsibilities in the supply chain

conflict minerals
armed conflict is being intensified as forces in the democratic republic of the congo and neighboring
countries 1 gain access to large quantities of arms these purchases are financed by the sale of
cassiterite gold and other minerals used to produce rare metals which may have been obtained
through inhumane activity such as mining using forced or child labor a provision on conflict materials
included in united states financial reform law enacted in 2010 defines these minerals as conflict
minerals 2 and obligates corporations listed on american stock exchanges to disclose information
related to the use of conflict minerals in their products with the ultimate goal of eradicating the use of
minerals that are financing conflict


alps electric while not obligated by the law understands and agrees with the purpose of the law from a
human rights perspective and acts based on a policy of not purchasing or using minerals financing
conflict sourced from the democratic republic of the congo or neighboring countries with the
cooperation of suppliers we are determining if any such minerals are contained in existing products and
establishing a framework to ensure they are not used in new products

csr in the supply chain
there is a current need in the electronics industry to
progress with csr not only as individual corporations
but throughout the entire supply chain of suppliers and
partners however as approaches to csr differed
between companies many found it difficult
communicating and formulating a common

incidents where other companies have violated laws
and regulations we do this to raise employee
awareness concerning the importance of compliance in
daily business in fiscal 2010 we published 18 news
reports for employees to read however rather than
just simply reporting information about the cases we
suggest measures the subjects should have taken to
avoid violation and how alps own internal regulations
cover areas similar to those in the reported cases we
also point out the potential risks with in our own
company the news items are released through the
intranet bulletin board or shared by email

response organization and
specific action to be taken
during an outbreak in fiscal
2009 we then formulated a         action plan for new types of influenza

on network security and created new information security regulations in their place in order to improve
the security of our overall information system we educate all domestic employees through inhouse
elearning courses to improve their understanding about information security

security system for the new headquarters building
in 2008 when we constructed our new headquarters
building we adopted a security system that uses id
cards as a measure against all types of potential risks
in the office in order to protect our employees and
company property including materials information and
assets
for crime prevention purposes an id card system
controls who may pass through gates and enterexit
offices that handle confidential information we also
post security guards and have installed mechanical         security system using id cards
surveillance systems such as cameras and human
detection sensors in and around the building
we have installed a secure printing system in the office which reduces risk of information leaks resulting
from illegal access to information failure to retrieve documents from printers and so forth id cards are
used to record which documents have been printed and can trace when and where employees have
accessed information
by adopting this kind of security system alps electric is making the best possible efforts to provide a
sense of security and trust for its business partners and to create a safer working environment for its
employees

realtime information exchange are available for employees to use in the workplace furthermore alps
electrics global nature requires that employees from diverse backgrounds respect each others cultures
and customs while feeling a sense of unity under a one alps ethos alps is committed to creating
events and tools that develop information and cultural exchanges which foster this sense of unity among
employees




promoting facetoface communication
as businesses are globalizing rapid decisionmaking
is increasingly required by our customers around the
world overseas affiliates and alps electrics sales
engineering and development departments however
our headquarters had been plagued by a variety of
problems including a shortage of teleconferencing
terminals which are essential for remote
communication low function and quality of
teleconferencing systems a shortage of employees
                                                         mobile teleconferencing system operable regardless of
skilled in using teleconferencing systems and           location
teleconferencing systems that were incompatible
between business locations
our aim was to develop a competitive workplace when we rebuilt our headquarters building in 2008
under the keywords communication and speed we reformed our teleconferencing system
improving it to allow forty business locations around the world to connect simultaneously the sound
and picture quality of the system have improved enabling reference materials and speakers video on
both sides to be transmitted and received very smoothly more employees have been taking advantage
of the new system as it allows for easy booking and handling as well
teleconferencing is indispensable to us and as such we encourage information sharing and rapid
decisionmaking through interactive facetoface communication as alps continues to pursue
productivity improvements through swift communication

enhancing communication tools
since april 2007 we have published an inhouse
magazine called feel one spirit  alps which is used
as a communication tool for employees throughout the
alps group
we had previously produced the magazine mainly
covering alps electric and alpine electronics but with
the expansion of the alps group we needed to
develop a greater sense of unity among the entire
group in response we have enhanced the magazine
to include content from each of the three core
companies of the group  alps electric alpine
electronics and alps logistics and their respective
affiliates it is the group employees that plan write
and edit the content keeping with the publications
tradition as a magazine for employees by employees
we also distribute a separate newsletter focusing on
managerial messages to all alps electric employees
and publish its english version called alps globe for
our overseas subsidiaries we first published alps
globe on paper in 1991 but decided to begin                alps globe

distributing it in electronic form instead in 1999 alps
globe comprises a selection of articles taken from the
japanese newsletter mentioned above and includes
managerial information and grouporiented topics that
are relevant to our global locations

csr management




integrating business and csr activity

alps electric believes csr is the heart of management and that it is important to integrate business and
csr activity

company president and we proceeded to establish a platform for promoting global alps and alps group
csr activity


in conjunction with the companys structural reforms in april 2009 the csr committee was dissolved to
make way for a new csr department that would take the lead in advancing csr activity with other
fixed departments the csr department is now working with other departments to further integrate
business and csr activity in line with the 2nd csr midterm plan which was launched in april 2010
