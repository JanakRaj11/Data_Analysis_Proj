    traditionally we have conducted business activities                                  structure allows us to control such downside risks as
    separately by division based on the vessel type there are                            fluctuations in exchange and freight rates using this
    opportunities however to make dry bulk shipping proposals                           structure we must continually analyze ways of meeting
    to customers we originally developed in the chemical tanker                           our operating profit targets even amid severe operating
    field in order to make effective proposals responsive to such                        circumstance all new investment proposals are vetted
    shipping demand we need to promote crossfunctional                                  by the risk management committee which conducts
    business activities which engage all the divisions                                   a comprehensive evaluation covering the investments

    in which we shifted from a groupteam structure to a                                  quantitative targets of step forward 2020 is to reduce
    departmentsection structure as part of the reorganization                          the de ratio to below 15x by the fiscal year 2020 we can
    we merged the oil tanker and gas carrier divisions in                                 effectively use risk management for sustaining a sound
    order to reinforce energy shipping business activities the                           balance between investment and financial discipline

    the iino group bolstered its risk management framework                                we aim to raise the motivation of each and every employee
    by setting up the risk management committee in april                                  and create a corporate spirit enabling challenge and growth

     at the time japanese vessels were manned exclusively by
     japanese seamen but japanese shipping companies began
     considering the hiring of nonjapanese seamen to offset the
     impact of yen appreciation on the global competitiveness
     in 1974 iino lines was quick to establish iino marine service
     co ltd to accelerate the hiring and development of non
     japanese seamen and in 1975 we began the first voyages

     typically spent their free time together playing japanese chess     indonesia and qatar while collaborating with other
     or tossing a ball back and forth to communicate effectively the    shipping companies to become a joint lng tanker owner
     cooks were also japanese then and the ships raised their own       in 2003 we built sk sunrise to realize our longawaited

thirdparty opinion


 the iino report 2014 features two defining events the                       from the extensive amount of nonfinancial value iino lines
 companys 115th anniversary and the formulation of the new                   offers this benefit is even clearer in this years report with the
 mediumterm business plan step forward 2020                              framework described above for example in response to yen

 two pillars of shipping and real estate through this report                 with its business expansion and the recent active adoption of

 not represent a break from the past but rather it impressively              to further strengthen the reports character i would like to

 by providing a clear framework of continuity and new                         i believe there is a limitation to simply adding fresh qualitative
 challenges extending from past achievements the contents                    information about recent efforts with each year s publication
 of other sections in the iino report are also more clearly                   as safety is a result of patient efforts representing the value
 defined than in past years as an example in the segmental                  of safety in terms of kpi and tracking annual changes in
