                       foreword

                       dear readers

                       the united nations 17 sustainable development goals comprise
                       a broad range of global targets among them no poverty quality
                       education and universal healthcare the sdgs were introduced in
                       2016 and are to be achieved by 2030


                       the aims of enabling the entire global population to lead a life of
                       dignity of promoting progress and of protecting the environment
                       are central points of orientation for politics and business as well
                       as for bosch since 2004 we have been a member of the un
                       global compact and are thus committed to observing the uns
                       international guidelines with regard to human rights labor
                       standards environmental protection and the fight against
                       corruption this report describes the progress we have made in
                       each of these areas the sdgs have provided us with a frame of
                       reference for our activities they allow us to assess the ways in
                       which our solutions contribute to lasting social change we
                       strongly believe that with innovative products and services that
                       are invented for life we can make an important contribution to
                       society while at the same time securing our companys future


                       we see major opportunities in the areas of connectivity
                       electrification and energy efficiency moreover thanks to our
                       systematic sustainability management we can tackle the risks that
                       climate change and resource scarcity have brought forth our core
                       business determines which of the global sustainability goals
                       bosch supports first and foremost in particular our activities
                       focus on health and safety sdg 3 sustainable cities and
                       communities sdg 11 and reducing co2 emissions sdg 13 in
                       addition to this our commitment to social wellbeing includes
                       improving access to education sdg 4 and promoting peace and
                       justice sdg 16


                       the structure of this years sustainability report is based on the un

daylong event that focused on improvement they attended short                         at the company and provided an outlook about how to shape cip

2016 using an app customers can locate reserve and pay for an

with fleet users bosch is now further developing its offer based on
a test and learn method in cooperation with bosch vietnam three
vietnamese universities have also offered a similar service since
november 2016 as part of the green challenge competition in
2015 students also developed a free escooter sharing system for
university students


in addition to congested roads the limited number of parking spots
poses a problem in many cities one solution could be the flexible
use of different forms of transport a service that bosch has been

material be reduced or replaced and can the material be recycled                  in order to ensure a seamless return process in 2016 bosch founded
