         practical support to promote supply chain sustainability



we also emphasize environmental and csr requirements to our suppliers in order to
promote and propagate csr throughout the supply chain however as some suppliers do
not have sufficient resources to satisfy the requirements we devise means of providing
substantial assistance for their deployment of csr systems one successful example of such
efforts is doosan corporation industrial vehicles project to enhance the competitiveness of
its suppliers and improve their workplace safety and environment last year

                                                             we often fall into the dilemma of choosing between longterm sustainability and short

                                                             help enhance our business values in the long term as such we keep our promises even if

      in 2016 we toughened the requirements of our supplier evaluation program with the addition of educational training for audits and evaluations a pilot test of the revised program
        was carried out on some of our critical suppliers this action temporarily reduced the number of suppliers that were deemed qualified for partnership renewals however we intend
        to gradually increase the number of suppliers in our evaluation pool when we select a supplier it takes into consideration the nature of the business of each bg and its analysis of
        the suppliers according to the following six factors 1strategic importance 2negotiationdiscussion group 3company size whether the size exceeds a minimum level 4where it
        supplies its products 5availability of alternative suppliers and 6whether it is a subsupplier more detailed information regarding the partnership renewal evaluation is described on
