further water recycling  reuse is being
practiced at our unit in a big way the data for
water recycle  reuse at our units is shown in
the gure below the water is mainly being
recycled in the processes and reused for
horticulture purposes
as can be seen from the gure there has
been a signicant increase in recycling 
reuse of water in the reporting period this is
mainly because of heightened emphasis on
using recycled  reused water in the bigger
units like trichy bhopal and haridwar which
taken together account for almost 86 of

uses of ozone depleting substances in
refrigerators and chillers are being phased
out from our units and at many a places it
has been stopped altogether the quantity of
ods used was 282 kg cfc11 equivalent
which was lesser than the amount of ods
used 30788 kg cfc11 equivalent during
201213 the new machines purchased in
many of our units are using refrigerants like

management at bhel
responsible waste management has always
been a thrust area in bhel the principles of
3r reducerecyclereuse is practiced very
rigorously in our organization at planning
stage itself efforts are made to minimise the
waste company has an institutionalised
mechanism to recycle wastes inhouse to the
extent feasible for example each mt of the
molten steel produced at our cffp unit
contains 54 of the recycled scrap of cffp
and 45 of ms scrap from other bhel
units thus making it an almost a 100
