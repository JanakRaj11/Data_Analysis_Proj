 technology for a better society

        a challenging year
                                         2015 was a challenging year for the sintef group as is clearly illustrated by
                                         the figures presented in this annual report
                                         for many key businesses in norway 2015 came close to being a year of crisis
                                         this has impacted on many of our clients and resulted in the cancellation
                                         and postponement of planned research projects especially in the oil and gas
                                         energy and maritime sectors
                                         fortunately sintef has a healthy balance sheet and good liquidity which is
                                         reassuring in times like these however the revenue stream from our ongoing
                                         operations was too weak in 2015 and this is unsatisfactory
                                         we need to show a profit in order to invest in laboratories and new research
                                         which are essential if we are to deliver the high levels of technical quality on
                                         which sintef has built its name in 2015 the entire organisation has been
                                         focusing intensively on reducing costs operational efficiency sales and the
                                         maintenance of close contact with our clients
        but we have also been investing for the future one of last years highlights was the opening of the sintef
        energy lab this is one of europes most advanced laboratories of its kind and is where we are developing the
        environmentallyfriendly energy solutions of the future
        in research terms 2015 was a good year we received excellent feedback from our clients and business partners
        one of the highlights was our successful building of robust client consortia that helped us win through in the
        competitive race to achieve participation in the nine newlyestablished centres for researchbased innovation
        these centres represent a major and longterm investment on the part of the research council of norway with
        the aim of encouraging close collaboration among businesses and leading research centres to promote innovation
        as sintefs new group president i can see that the organisation with its crossdisciplinary expertise and wide
        ranging networks with norwegian business and community life has both an opportunity and an obligation to
        make a major contribution to the essential restructuring now taking place in the norwegian economy digitisation
        reindustrialisation and the need for a green shift provide the key incentives for this process only then will
        we be able to fulfil our vision to provide technology for a better society
        i am looking forward to getting on with this work
