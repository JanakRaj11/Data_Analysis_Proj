a good year despite slow economic growth
sampo performed very well in 2014 despite slow economic growth low
interest rates and ever increasing regulation unfortunately one cannot say
the same for europe as a whole



i have my doubts as to whether the european model              an example of this let us take the fast growth of
will perform well in a global economy its recent track        sovereign debt in the eurozone the total amount of
record does not make for good reading the eurozone            debt is approximately eur 4700 billion of which over
countries have on average a 12 per cent                        25 per cent trades at negative interest rates and yet
unemployment rate and youth unemployment stands                the regulatory framework continues to stipulate this
at a staggering 23 per cent on top of this the                asset class as risk free and it is not consuming any
eurozone countries have raised over eur 1000 billion          capital on the balance sheets of financial institutions
in new debt over the last five years as a remedy for          that is truly remarkable and unsustainable
this politicians offer tax increases and more

as a result of this we are currently seeing a                  economic growth low interest rates and ever
combination of very low economic growth and most               increasing regulation
likely a buildup of bubbles in several asset classes as

managements best estimates of both historical evidence and economic conditions such as volumesinterest rates margins
capital structure and income and cost development the value in use model for mandatum life is greatly influenced by the long
term development of insurance liabilities affecting eg the required solvency capital and thus the recoverable amount that is
why the forecast period is longer for mandatum life 10 years the derived cash flows were discounted at the pretax rates of the
weighted average cost of capital which for if was 77  and for mandatum life 83  these are somewhat lower than last year
due to the decrease in interest rates


forecasts for if approved by the management cover years 2015  2016 the cash flows beyond that have been extrapolated
using a 2  growth rate a 2  growth rate for years beyond 2024 has been used for the for mandatum life as well as it is
believed to be close to the anticipated inflation


in mandatum life the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by some eurm 450 with the calculation method used
eg an increase of about 27  in the weighted average cost of capital could lead to a situation where the recoverable amount of
the entity would equal its carrying amount


as for the if group the management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would not
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount

17 determination and hierarchy of fair values

a large majority of sampo groups financial assets are valued at fair value the valuation is based on either published price
quatations or valuation techniques based on market observable inputs where available for a limited amount of assets the value
needs to be determined using other techniques the financial instruments measured at fair value have been classified into three
hierarchy levels in the notes depending on eg if the market for the instrument is active or if the inputs used in the valuation
technique are observable


on level 1 the measurement of the instrument is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities


on level 2 inputs for the measurement of the instrument include also other than quoted prices observable for the asset or
liability either directly or indirectly by using valuation techniques

increase recognised in profitloss of eurm 30 12 and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 13 11 in life
insurance 10 percentage point depreciation of all other currencies against eur would result in an increase recognised in profit
loss of eurm 35 14 and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 94 68 in holding 10 percentage point
depreciation of all other currencies against eur would have no impact in profitloss but a decrease recognised in equity of

the anticipated retirement age in connection with lifelong pension is 65 years for sweden and 67 years for norway in sweden
lifelong oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 10 percent of the pensionable
salary between 0 and 75 income base amounts 65 percent of salary between 75 and 20 income base amounts and 325 percent
between 20 and 30 income base amounts in norway lifelong oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at
a rate of approximately 70 percent of the pensionable salary up to 12 norwegian base amounts together with the estimated
statutory oldage pension paidup policies and pension payments from the swedish plans are normally indexed upwards in an
amount corresponding to the change in the consumer price index however there is no agreement guaranteeing the value and
future supplements in addition to the contractual pension benefit could either rise of fall pension payments from the norwegian
plans are indexed upwards in an amount corresponding to the change in the consumer price index to the extent of 80  100 


the pensions are primarily funded through insurance whereby the insurers establish the premiums and disburse the benefits ifs
obligation is primarily fulfilled through payment of the premiums should the assets that are attributable to the pension benefits
not be sufficient to enable the insurers to cover the guaranteed pension benefits if could be forced to pay supplementary
insurance premiums or secure the pension obligations in some other way in addition to insured pension plans there are also
unfunded pension benefits in norway for which if is responsible for ongoing payment


to cover the insured pension benefits the related capital is managed as part of the insurers management portfolios in such
management the characteristics of the investment assets are analyzed in relation to the characteristics of the obligations in a
process known as asset liability management new and existing asset categories are evaluated continuously in order to diversify
the asset portfolios with a view to optimizing the anticipated riskadjusted return any surplus that arises from management of
the assets normally accrues to if andor the insured and there is no form of transfer of the asset value to other members of the
insurance collective


the insurers and if are jointly responsible for monitoring the pension plans including investment decisions and contributions
the pension plans are essentially exposed to similar material risks regarding the final amount of the benefits the investment risk
associated with the plan assets and the fact that the choice of discount interest rate affects their valuation in the financial
statements


when applying ias 19 the pension obligations are calculated as is the pension cost attributable to the fiscal period using
actuarial methods pension rights are considered to have been vested straight line during the service period the calculation of
pension obligations is based on future anticipated pension payments and includes assumptions regarding mortality employee
turnover and salary growth the nominally calculated debt is discounted to the present value using an interest rate based on
current market interest rates adjusted to take into account the duration of the companys pension obligations as a basis for
determining the discount interest rate for the swedish obligation if uses liquid covered mortgage bonds issued by a mortgage
institution covered mortgage bonds are also used for the norwegian obligation after a deduction for the plan assets a net
asset or net liability is recognised in the balance sheet


the following tables contain a number of material assumptions specifications of pension costs assets and liabilities and a
sensitivity analysis showing the potential effect on the obligations of reasonable changes in those assumptions as at the end of
the fiscal year the carrying amounts have been stated including special payroll tax in sweden 2426 and a corresponding fee
in norway 141
