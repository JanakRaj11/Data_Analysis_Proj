     sustainability challenges and approach




     s
12

egypt has faced numerous social and economic challenges following the egyptian revolution mhcfi was among many businesses
negatively affected by economic instability yet has managed to continue growing as the economic situation began to stabilize one of
the most significant challenges mhcfi faced after the revolution was the overall lack of security particularly evident with increased
robberies while robbery risks then dropped significantly in 2013 and 2014 mhcfi faced new challenges highlighted below

main challenges

over the past few years lack of security has been an issue of concern nationwide  in 2013 mhcfi was still struggling with the
repercussions of low security levels that resulted in losses for the company however mhcfi managed to improve security in 2014
reporting a significant decrease in the number of robberies affecting the business  predictably new challenges have emerged
which we are planning on facing this upcoming year

the economic challenge

as of 2015 egypt continues to experience many economic challenges one of the most persistent problems is the steady increase
in inflation this increase reflects directly on the purchasing power of the consumer putting pressure on affordable brands more
appropriate to decreased consumer purchasing power despite the problems posed by increasing inflation egypt still lacks effective
policies to counter this particular threat

there is also the issue of lack of availability of usd in the formal currency markets  this kind of situation forces businesses like
ours that require usd to purchase imported goods to deal with the informal or black market this affects profitability due to the
added cost of buying dollars at higher rates than those officially quoted

the energy challenge

electricity blackouts and fuel shortages represent a challenge to every business in mhcfis case the problem of energy supply
affects all the production and distribution phases of our industry the increase in the cost of diesel and gasoline naturally affects
both transportation and manufacturing costs this in turn translates into an increase in the prices of products directly impacting
the consumers ability to purchase those products increases in the cost of water and electricity also affects our capacity to
manufacture while maintaining a profit margin




                                                                                                                                         13

 switching partnerships

 on july 1st 2014 amidc ended a longterm partnership with philip morris international pmi and cemented a new partnership
 with imperial tobacco group itg the new partnership brought in a tobacco manufacturing market share of 002 which rose
 to 06 market share by end of 2014

 this represents a challenge as the partnership with pmi entailed a share amounting to 24 of the tobacco market to fill in
 the revenue gap mhcfi has been looking into adding new tobaccorelated businesses and retaining the workforce
 as a first step we are looking at restructuring the tobacco business to ensure more effective business management

 management approach

 the volatile situation in egypt over the past few years appears to have subsided and the country is now turning its attention
 towards stabilizing the national economy one strategy being actively implemented by the current leaderships is to stress a more
 attractive and supportive investment climate accordingly mhcfi is committed to supporting the growth of the national economy
 through new investments and expansion we are hopeful that the election of a new parliament will provide clear public policies
 regarding the types of investment needed for the economy to stabilize

 while the company is aware that we remain in a transitional period where uncertainties are present mhcfi is equipped with
 a team of experienced professionals implementing a business plan designed to help us adapt to the challenges that lie ahead  
 this includes the installation of a new risk assessment mechanism that will enable mhcfi to foresee upcoming risks and develop
 effective strategies to minimize them

 our main priority focus is to capitalize on mhcfis manpower this is reflected by a management approach that seeks to
 address employees individual wellbeing seen as of equivalent importance to that of the companys own mhcfi is committed
 to maintaining a solutionoriented approach to our management strategies focusing on sustainable management techniques
 designed to help protect our employees  our main asset and the stakeholders of mg

 in terms of environmental sustainability we are determined to look for solutions to the energy crisis egypt is facing this comes
 hand in hand with the development of our own energy conservation and management plan and the adoption of new approaches
 to how energy is used in all our activities in our offices outlets and production facilities  the following table summarizes our
 sustainability approach by performance area

     performance area                 approach

     economic sustainability          we are currently focused on maximizing efficiency reducing production costs and
                                      securing affordable and sustainable energy resources

     social sustainability            we continue to support an array of civil society organizations and social enterprises
                                      across the country our mansour foundation for development has pioneered a locally
                                      driven and bold approach to social investments as it focuses on key social needs including
                                      research and programmatic interventions in the areas of education poverty alleviation
                                      civic engagement social entrepreneurship among others in neighboring communities
                                      and beyond we plan on maintaining and expanding our social investment portfolio in an
                                      effort to contribute to egypts sustainable development  

     human capital                    our employees are one of our primary stakeholders we continue to invest in their growth
                                      and development to further their growth and the growth of the company we plan
                                      on achieving a more genderbalanced managerial team by investing in the leadership
                                      potential of female middle management  

     human rights                     we continue to be committed to a zerotolerance policy towards child labor and are
                                      committed to the adoption of a minimum wage policy

     environmental sustainability     the program focus this year revolved around mitigating the environmental impact of our
                                      operations the scaling of usage for biodegradable plastic bags and energy reduction have
                                      been the center focus of this years program

     product  client                 together with our employees our clients are other key stakeholders we continue to
     responsibility                   focus on client satisfaction and safety through stringent safety and quality management
                                      systems we also maintain an open communication system with our clients through
                                      multiple feedback mechanisms

     about this report




     g
16

mhcfi is pleased to present our fourth sustainability report covering activities over the period from 2013 to 2014 the purpose
of this report is to keep both the public and our family shareholders engaged in and informed about our achievements and
development we have managed to overcome hardships affecting our business over the past few years and we plan on moving
forward by being mindful of our stakeholders and business partners this report presents these updates against the measures and
indicators of the global reporting initiative grig31 level b

we have compiled the report at hand with a dual purpose in mind to update the public about our performance and to use the
assessments and conclusions of the report to improve our performance in the future we committed ourselves to undertake this
reporting exercise on a biennial basis back in 2010 and have succeeded in publishing three reports to date

in the current report we have made every effort to improve our analyses and expand the scope of the information covered and
we hope to continue improving our disclosure level in the future

scope and data

the scope of this report is limited to al mansour holding company for financial investments mhcfi including the aggregate
activities of the eight companies comprising mhcfi accordingly the analysis presented here focuses on the direct community and
stakeholders of mhcfi the report thus addresses neither the practices of the rest of mansour group to which mhcfi belongs nor
the universes of mhcfis suppliers and outsourced operations on which we have little influence at the moment we hope to be
able to extend our monitoring and disclosure capacity to parts of these universes by the next reporting cycle

in compiling the data and the calculations disclosed below we followed basic international measurement standards the information
that we provide here is extracted from our databases bills internal reports and externally audited statements some information
has also been extracted through interviewing relevant personnel from mhcfi this allows us to cover most of the information that
reflects on mhcfis indicators as per the requirements of gri level b disclosure standards and the general gri reporting tradition

in reporting on the joint performance of the eight companies comprising mhcfi we relied mostly on our consolidated statements
and reports the compilation of these statements and reports progressed smoothly as these companies share several central
departments and are governed by a common top management please see the governance section for more information in other
words mhcfis companies utilize the same top management reporting system




                                                                                                                                       17

 despite the tremendous challenges mhcfi faced since the revolution we are proud to say that we managed not only to maintain
 but also to expand our sustainability reporting efforts like most companies however we are able to report only partially on some
 of the gri indicators we have highlighted these indicators in a summary disclosure table at the end of this report and we hope
 to be able to report on them more systematically by the next report in 2016  nevertheless this is unlikely to pose problems for
 future performance comparisons for two main reasons first the report labels estimates as such and explains the basis upon which
 we arrived at them second we have not undergone any major restatements of information provided in earlier reports the only
 significant change from previous reporting periods in this regard lies perhaps in the fact that we have expanded our reporting
 initiative by providing more detailed information in several fields including energy consumption and gender representation

 furthermore although our sustainability case requires rather straightforward measurements a number of environmental
 indicators require capacities we have not yet acquired nevertheless in comparison to previous reports environmental data has
 been expanded this includes the steps taken to counter any negative effects of mhcfi operations on the environment

 information disclosed on employee movement inside the company has also been greatly expanded compared to previous reports
 the hiring and resignation disclosure is more detailed likewise information on employee training conducted in 20132014 is also
 more detailed

 materiality and level requirements

 we designed this report to satisfy gri level b disclosure requirements this disclosure level requires a company to report on all
 gri profile indicators in addition to reporting fully on a minimum of any 20 performance indicators these performance indicators
 include at least one from each of economic environment human rights labor society and product responsibility indicators

 in addressing these requirements we undertook a materiality exercise as per the gris methodology the nature of the
 sustainability challenges that we are currently facing and the volatile business environment that we live in led us to believe that
 some performance areas are of paramount relevance to us overshadowing others

 the gri summary disclosure table summarizes the results of our materiality exercise at the end of this report

 our team

 our sustainability department compiled this report with the support of an external consulting firm to develop this years report
 we developed a number of reporting mechanisms to monitor some of the basic indicators on a regular basis we hope that by
 doing so we will be able to institutionalize our sustainability monitoring and improvement efforts at a deeper level our corporate
 affairs manager seif el batanouni is happy to provide any additional information and elaborations on request

 resulting in greater profitability visàvis mhfcis performance during egypts instability over the past couple of years  this report
 dedicates a detailed chapter above to the challenges that have emerged since the political upheavals of january 2011 began for
 the purposes of this section however we would like to outline our main financial results and highlight the impact of this political
 and social climate on them

 mhcfi assets are balanced in part by 198 billion egp worth of equity on the other hand our consolidated revenues reached 95
 billion egp in 2014 and our profit reached 270 million egp for the same year


                year 2014                                                                                                      egp millions

mansour international distribution mid accounted for the bulk of our sales and profit  other mhcfi companies experienced
mixed performance while some companies demonstrated a trend of high sales and profitability other companies experienced a
drop in sales and by extension profitability

the table below illustrates our consolidated income statement for the year 2013 broken down by business unit

         year 2013                                                                                                                 egp millions

as the above table shows our companies paid about 11968 million egp in income taxes in the year 2014 we are more proud
of these payments than any other payments we previously made the egyptian government is suffering from an immense deficit
problem and we are happy to have contributed to narrowing it down by such an amount

value added

mhcfi analyzes the valueadded components of its operations along two different dimensions first we divide our commodities
into 1 merchandise and services that experience some manufacturing andor services transformation and 2 merchandise and
services that add only retail value we can then classify our cost of goods sold cogs according to these two categories the table
below summarizes our cogs classification by business unit into valueadded and retailbased for the year 2014

               year 2014                                                                                                    egp millions

               value added cogs            5266                         245                                                        

               retail based cogs                          1966         1155       20              40           06                  104

               total                       5266           1966         1400       20              40           06                  104


the second valueadded dimension that we also track is our ability to add value to our production capacity we generally reduce
this type to our capital investments in a given timeframe  the following tables compare our capital investments in the year 2014
with their equivalent in the year 2013

our total capital investments in 2014 and 2013 were 2065 million egp and 112 million egp respectively while the economic
downturn has seen many companies considering exiting from egypt we continue to pride ourselves on our commitment to
investing in our economy

     governance  approach




     a
24

mansour group is a private family business and its shares are not listed in the stock exchange as such it is not obligated to any
minority shareholders however mansour group is engaged in a number of joint ventures and therefore needs to address the
interests of its partners

although these ventures do not necessarily affect mhcfi the mansour group implements a system of forming a board of directors
to govern each of its different divisions and the companies that comprise them in such a way that a given board always contains
independent members the philosophy adopted is that independent board members bring a wider perspective and varied
viewpoints into the governance of the group as a whole and this includes mhcfi moreover mansour group has standardized
a single management approach across all of its companies thus while the approach listed below governs mansour group as a
whole it governs mhcfi by extension  mansour groups board members and managers are listed below

in running its companies mhcfi also adopts a matrix structure organizing the management of the company along two levels on
the one hand the holding company centralizes several support functions that all companies share including human resources
policy formulation and control supply chain management audit administration security and legal and corporate affairs on the
other hand each company has its own operational structure and when needed its own support functions for example security
is organized in metro market on the company level but corporate security deals with the security affairs of all the remaining
companies

previous section is laid out in a way that supplies our companies with the independence that they need while simultaneously
assuring a reasonable level of corporate control

and help us operate in a corruptionfree environment these standards are deployed and assured by rigorous internal and external

mhcfi is currently studying the development of anticorruption policies given that all of our activities are carried out in transparent
environments that provide little space for corruption we generally didnt consider such policies urgent in the past   since the
revolution however combating corruption has become one of the main aspirations of egyptian society and mhcfi is planning to
honor this national goal with renewed vigour

associations and lobbies

before the protests began in january 2011 egyptian government bodies used to meet regularly with business associations and
representatives to discuss options for dealing with their regular problems back then we used to suffer from the complications and
bureaucracy of procedures for obtaining permits and licenses this mechanism collapsed after the protests and currently there is
another system in the making we are hopeful that after the election of a new parliament we will be able to regain our position as
active members in the meetings between the private and the public sector

as of today we stand as active members in several business associations including the following

our people

at mhcfi we believe in our employees and staff and regard them as the companys most important assets we are proud to have
developed over time a robust mechanism for attracting the high caliber workforce that we need and to have developed a system
that safeguards their interests and builds their capacities

as a matter of principle we seek to develop our people from the moment they join mansour group preparing them to eventually
become a part of our senior management we have therefore developed a high quality capacity building system that has been
proven effective over the years

our recruitment system is based firstly on a pull system whereby recruitment ensues whenever a need for a certain position
emerges in our companies secondly we adopted a salary scheme that pegs our pay according to the middle pay in the market
while honoring our minimum wage policy when we find that the middle market pay is too low thirdly we are committed to
safeguarding the interests of our employees and this is ensured through our specially designed human resources hr policies
and formal contracts finally we intensively train our employees and staff to build their careers with the aim of keeping them
indefinitely if possible or to qualify them for excellent jobs in the market if keeping them proves impractical we are also adamant
on providing our workforce with fair transparent and periodic performance evaluations


recruiting our people

mansour group advertises for vacancies through national and local media and through appropriate communities relevant staff
members in cooperation with the hr department then screen all job applications jobs are awarded to those applicants most
qualified all our recruitment activities are governed by publicized policies and procedures

with respect to pay we determine salaries according to market surveys of the fastmoving consumer goods sector fmcgs our
main field conducted by third parties and specialized firms we generally target a salary scale in the middle of the market spectrum
for the same position as per these external studies

these salaries are then modified according to the level of experience of the candidate and our minimum wage policy given that
egypt doesnt apply a minimum wage law mhcfi went on to adopt a minimum wage of 1000 egp which is 400 egp more than the
minimum wage in the governmental sector



                                                                                                                                         35

 benefits

 in addition to our competitive salaries mhcfi provides its staff and employees with added benefits always trying to exceed the
 minimum requirements set forth by egyptian law egyptian laws regulate the minimum medical insurance for workers as well as
 their pension schemes mhcfi honors these laws and provides its staff with further benefits including

            mansour medical care unit  an internal health insurance system for mansour employees
            meals or allowance for meals for manufacturing workers
            transportation allowance when traveling and a company car according to grade
            company transportation for our factories
            mobile phone allowance according to grade and
            special rewards for outstanding performance

 in accordance with our policy mhcfi provides all its employees with formal contracts this provides our workers with a level of job
 security that many lack in egypt where working informally without a contract has been endemic in recent years

 mhcfi also follows the relevant labor laws providing its female staff with three months maternity leave awarding all employees
 with a onemonth notice period and following egyptian law with respect to penalties

 employment level and turnover

 mhcfi currently employs 8723 employees up from 8400 employees mentioned in the last report making a turnover of 500
 employees during the last year the metro market  kheir zaman company operates a laborintensive activity based on regular
 entry of transient labor it therefore accounts for 61 of our employment even though it accounts for only 13 of our profits most
 of the 500 that left the company were workers at our supermarket chains metro market and kheir zaman

 the turnover rate in the supermarket business is generally high in egypt as it is worldwide as many treat these jobs as temporary
 or transitional until they locate a more stable or long term job with the exception of our supermarket chains we have otherwise
 been able to retain our employees

 career advancement

 mhcfis commitment to employee development is perfectly illustrated by our investment in our supermarket chain employees  
 employee training was designed to address the high turnover in this sector and to show our employees that we care about
 their longterm careers all of our current store managers started out at entry level as store workers that demonstrated high
 performance received extra training gained experience excelled and were eventually promoted to store manager positions we
 dont need to recruit new store managers from outside our operations they are all internally promoted workers

 to do so not only do we need to train our workers but we also need to provide them with objective kpis and appraise their
 performance periodically and transparently our end of year appraisals inform our staff about their strengths and weaknesses and
 provide us with the main instruments by which we determine annual staff bonuses and promotions

 safety

 all our employees are trained in evacuation steps and in facing crisis situations the majority of employees have also been trained
 in firefighting although our activities generally do not put our employees at risk we have nonetheless identified 36 jobs that
 require high safety precautions workers in these positions received special training and were all provided with safety wear like
 goggles gloves helmets and safety shoes

 mhcfi currently monitors only medium and serious work injuries of which we have had none during the past two years we are
 currently investigating the expansion of a monitoring system to include mild injuries as well

gender

while we do not have   a written antidiscrimination policy
salaries are decided based upon qualifications leaving no room
for gender biases  nevertheless there is a significantly larger
number of males than females across our companies which is
something we are looking to address the reason behind the
predominance of males in mhcfi is not a result of discriminatory
policies on the part of our company but rather reflects a cultural
value system that dictates that females are not suited to work in
heavy industries  we are currently working towards enhancing
the management gender ratio but achieving a more balanced
gender balance at the bluecollar level requires longerterm shifts
in sociocultural values  

the following graphs show gender distribution figures across a
number of our companies

mansour group is highly committed to responsible business practices it undertakes many activities to promote the welfare and
socioeconomic development of egyptian society through a variety of mechanisms one of these is the mansour foundation for
development mfd which is dedicated to the eradication of illiteracy poverty and disease by effectively working with and
contributing to the development of local communities

our communityrelated work has undergone a process of evolution over the years the following section briefly highlights some of
the milestones with regards to our community development initiatives

historical milestones on our communityrelated work
mansour foundation for development is an independent legal entity that is fully funded by the mansour family it has a separate
budget from the mansour group and does not accept any financial aid from national or international donors mfd also has a
separate board of directors fully dedicated to philanthropic activities   mfd works to centralize the community development
efforts of all mansour group in order to maximize their impact mfd is an expression of the gratitude felt by mansour group
towards the people of egypt and we expect no taxdeductible returns

mfds strategy of sustainable management is based on shared value creation the corporate success of mansour group and the
social welfare of egypt are interdependent in an effort to sustain our foundation we invest in the creation of a healthy educated
workforce and in sustainable resources  both of which guarantee effective governance of the organization for society to thrive
competitive businesses must be developed to create income wealth and tax revenues and practice philanthropy

mfd is dedicated to philanthropy as a grantmaking and coexecuting foundation the foundation undertakes many activities to
promote the welfare and socioeconomic development of egyptian society deploying to this end a variety of methods to eradicate
illiteracy poverty and disease while raising the public awareness of active citizens mfds team identifies concrete goals and
objectives prioritizes issues to be addressed and develops defined budgets for program implementation

our strategic high priority areas in the field of human development are


                       education              capacity building             arts  culture            social entrepreneurship


                                     health                 academic research                human relief



                                                                                                                                       47

 we have also identified four priority segments that we want to focus on which are as follows


                                                                                                   inhabitants of

                                                                                                   remote areas

corporate volunteerism

at mfd we engage community members in volunteerism as one of the most important cornerstones of promoting corporate
citizenship employee volunteers are perhaps the greatest asset companies can leverage when seeking to affect surrounding
communities corporate volunteerism provides great benefits to a community while generating business value in the form of
increasing employee engagement and expanding opportunities for teambuilding

civic education

in its broadest definition civic education means all the processes that affect peoples beliefs commitments capabilities and
actions as members or prospective members of any given community for civic education to achieve its utmost potential the
institutions present in the community need to act and behave in a certain manner that can later be transmitted to the remaining
members of the community over time civic education is certainly not limited to schooling or the education of children and youth
families governments religious institutes and mass media are just some of the institutions involved in the process of civic
education which we at mfd understand to be an ongoing process

 suez canal investment certificates worth 10 million egp for the poorest families in luxor

 the ministry of social solidarity and mansour group launched an initiative to support the people in the luxor governorate the
 initiative comes in line with the implementation of a memorandum of understanding signed between the ministry and mansour
 group under the patronage of youssef mansour the chairman of the mansour group aimed at activating the partnership initiative
 to support the poorest families in the governorate

 minister ghada waly indicated that the ministry is adopting an approach that targets the sustainable development of the most
 marginalized of areas through partnerships with the private sector she added that the memorandum of understanding signed with
 the mansour group is a successful implementation of such an approach and emphasized its success




50

the mansour group has financed the purchase of one thousand new suez canal investment certificates at egp 10000  certificate
with a total value of 10 million egp through the ministry of social solidarity which will distribute these certificates to the poorest
families in the luxor governorate especially targeting widows who provide for children below 16 years of age and persons with
special needs

the social solidarity directorate in luxor determined the target families based on its records and it selected armant and esna
districts for being the closest to banque misr from which the certificates were bought

youssef mansour said that the initiative is a part of the mansour groups strategy to contribute to sustainable development and
finding prompt solutions for poverty he added that luxor was selected because it has been struck very hard by the dramatic
decline in tourism in recent years he also noted that it needs massive and continuous efforts to combat poverty illiteracy and
other social challenges in order to rise up to its deserved position both locally and globally

     our environment and product responsibility




     d

this section presents our environmental and product responsibility performance we divided the section into two parts dedicating
one part to each of the two topics we also structured our exploration of these two areas around the relevant material gri
performance as in the previous chapter

environment

our environmental footprint is not among our high impact areas much of the gri indicators that cover this area are therefore of
moderate to low materiality for us most of our operations do not pose any threat to biodiversity or endanger listed species are
not located within or near protected or restored habitats and produce little nonrecyclable waste moreover our operations are
generally not energy intensive nor do they emit large quantities of cfcs or greenhouse gases the aspects of our environmental
performance that might be of high materiality to our operations are essentially our waste and transportation activities

waste

all of our companies deploy waste management systems that collect their waste and separate it by type an external contractor
usually the supplier of the original material then buys the majority of this waste from us since most of the waste generated acts
as inputs in other industries

the type of waste that we produce includes plastic bottles which are sold to plastic factories paper wood dust tobacco rolling
paper and unsold supermarket commodities we also produce other productionrelated waste but in very small quantities our
indirect waste includes the packaging material that we use in our production or distribution mainly paper and aluminum cans
and plastic bottles

to date we monitor the aggregate waste in our supermarket chains only and we calculate the numbers in terms of a percentage of
sales rather than by weight and volume we also do not monitor the portion of materials used that are recycled by us or by others
we have developed a comprehensive wastemonitoring framework that is being rolled out over the next two years

waste management

metro and kheir zaman successfully adopt 100 biodegradable plastic bags

one of the key objectives of the corporate affairs department is to adopt environmentally sustainable practices in the areas of
energy consumption waste management water use and paper consumption in order to minimize environmental degradation  

                                                                                                                                        53

 in line with this objective the corporate affairs department in cooperation with the procurement department at metro market
 began to examine ways to minimize environmental degradation through practical applications in 2013 they began by looking at
 the use of plastic bags at all 99 metro and kheir zaman stores  the stores located in 12 governorates use approximately 80 million
 plastic bags per year accordingly efforts began to convert all plastic bags to recyclable plastic bags

 through cooperation with symphony environmental ltd based in the uk the d2w technology was adopted to convert old
 fashioned plastic bags into 100 biodegradable plastic bags the d2w mark was affixed on all plastic bags to encourage competitors
 to adopt the same technology in order to reduce the collective harmful effects that plastics have on the environment

 future plans

 we are currently putting in place a new wastemonitoring system that monitors waste by type weight and volume this should
 supply us with crucial information that we still lack we are also moving to expand this waste management system to the whole
 company furthermore we have been offering products that we remove from our inventories well before their expiry dates to our
 employees at heavily discounted rates

 energy

 electricity remains our primary source of energy with all of our companies operating on electricity and connected to the national
 electricity grid  our hayat company is the only exception as it generates all of its electricity inhouse because it operates in an
 area that lacks access to the national grid  furthermore to overcome issues of blackout we have secured a number of generators
 for companies to operate on when the power is out  while all of our companies operate on electricity and many of them own and
 operate emergency generators to cover electricity blackouts we dont have generators in our supermarket stores

 we have expanded our reporting on all of our direct and indirect energy consumption we still need to further expand the relevant
 data from our various databases we have also started working on reducing our energy consumption by studying the advantages
 of converting all our conventional lights to leds in addition we aggregate most of the fuel consumed by the fleets of our different
 companies which represents our largest environmental impact the following table summarizes our fuel consumption in egp

 the table illustrates our increased fuel bill which amounts to roughly 18 over the past year this increase this year was caused
 by an increase in the price of fuel

 emissions

 our emissions are mostly limited to the fuel consumed by our transportation fleets and the fuel used to generate electricity in our
 hayat factory in addition to the electricity consumption of our 99 metro and kheir zaman supermarkets we have expanded our
 monitoring on greenhouse gas emissions compared to our previous report the following tables show the total expenses for our
 diesel water and electricity consumption in 20132014

product responsibility

mansour group enforces all the necessary precautions in order to ensure the safety and quality of our products

one of our companies  seclam dairy factory  produced a comprehensive quality policy document that defined the international
hygiene standards that are material and applicable to seclams manufacturing sites these standards focused strongly on minimizing
any risks of product contamination and ensuring that the products meet the high standards that customers expect from any of
the mansour group companies thereby avoiding any manufacturing deficiencies that might damage the quality of the products
or that of the health of our customers the associates of seclam share the objective of manufacturing safe wholesome and high

   premises must be located away from environmentally                    processed products to avoid contamination and products must
   polluted areas areas subject to flooding areas prone to pest        have an appropriate shelflife control with expired materials
   infestations or areas where wastes cannot be effectively             being segregated and scrapped furthermore all raw materials
   managed adequate measures must be in place to protect the            must be purchased from approved suppliers in accordance to

    the premises must be designed in a way so that it can be             for food safety a risk assessment procedure haccp is used
   easily cleaned adequately ventilated and has sufficient pest        to define food safety critical control points ccp moreover
   control procedures also staff facilities must be designed           recipes production operating procedures and specifications
   and operated in a way that minimizes the risks of product             have to be controlled and available for reference in appropriate
   contamination the factory must have regularly updated and            areas of the sites
   documented cleaning programs
                                                                          environmental and process monitoring programs must be in
    there must be an adequate system for the collection and             place to trace microbiological contamination all facilities for
   disposal of wastes which will not be allowed to accumulate           heating cooling freezing or any other process must also meet
   in food handling storage or other working areas inside or           the specified conditions for ensuring food safety
   outside the factory defined waste areas have to be established
   and segregated from production activities and waste disposal
   must meet legislative requirements and thus be disposed of by
   licensed contractors


food safety checks are performed in accordance to biological chemical and physical specifications with transport and storage
quality specifications also existing for all finished products finished products are stored separately from raw materials and rejected
products or returned goods are labeled and stored separately furthermore vehicles that move products must be appropriately
temperaturecontrolled hygienic and clean

pest control

activity is frequent and regularly reviewed and pest control audits and treatments are recorded incoming raw materials are also
thoroughly checked for pests

personnel

each site has qualified personnel with the necessary education training background and experience to ensure that all activities
including hygiene and protective clothing are correctly performed procedures are established to identify training competency
requirements for all associates to carry out their responsibilities managers and supervisors have sufficient knowledge of food
hygiene to be able to judge potential risks and take the appropriate preventative measures and corrective actions while ensuring
that effective monitoring and supervision is taking place this ensures that all personnel entering manufacturing areas have an
appropriate level of training in basic food hygiene and company hygiene procedures furthermore all personnel are made aware
of their contribution to the quality and food safety of the finished products and of the possible consequences of errors or lack of
attention to details

customer satisfaction

our customer care unit has a call number dedicated to receiving customer feedback and complaints all received complaints are
