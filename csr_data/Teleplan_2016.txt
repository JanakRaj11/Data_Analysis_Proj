     initiating engagement
     on ethical practices in
     the supply chain
10            teleplan provides its customers with service solutions which range from simple
              repairs to highly sophisticated technological and electronic solutions
              the units and components required to undertake these service solutions are
              purchased primarily from the original equipment manufacturer oem or
              from a supplier designated by the oem in these instances the bulk of teleplans
              activity teleplan does not determine the supplier or source of the component
              in other instances teleplan purchases industry standard parts teleplan does not
              subcontract the manufacturing of any units or components

              whilst a material part of the supply chain is determined by the customer teleplan
              nonetheless expects its major suppliers to be aligned with and meet the social
              environmental and ethical standards of the eicc code of conduct which has been
              adopted by many of its customers

              with the objective of engaging with suppliers to ensure that its ethical standards
              are met teleplan has an ethical supply chain policy in 2015 the ethical supply
              chain engagement strategy has been further developed and the initial stage of
              evaluation focussed on the positioning of its major suppliers on csr has been
              completed major suppliers are those which represented 75 of total spend in
              2015 membership of the eicc certification to international health safety and
              environmental standards such as ohsas18001 and iso14001 and the location of
              operations in highrisk countries are all considerations which have been included
              in the evaluation

              in 2016 teleplan will undertake further engagement with its major suppliers in the
              implementation of its ethical supply chain policy
