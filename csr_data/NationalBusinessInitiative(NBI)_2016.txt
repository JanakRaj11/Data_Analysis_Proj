our strategy
    south africa faces many challenges including high unemployment widespread inequality a failing education system
    skills shortages endemic corruption and a fractured labour relations framework these issues are exacerbated by weak
    local and global economic growth and an increasingly complex political environment longterm solutions will require
    all sectors of the country to work together

    our strategy review was ﬁnalised after the nbis 2015 ﬁnancial yearend but before the date of publication of this
    report as an integrated report is intended to be a forwardlooking document this section describes the organi
    sations strategy in its ﬁnal form and the rest of the report is structured to align with this

    the nbis strategy is underpinned by fundamental beliefs

    we believe that

                      a sustainable society is possible
                      the social contract between business and society needs to be renegotiated
                      business success is inextricably linked to a thriving society building trust and relationships with
                       government and other key stakeholders
                      collective action between business government and civil society will support large scale system change
                       in a sustainable way

    we believe in

                      the role of business as a key enabler shaping a sustainable future

    the nbi aims to drive business participation in an economic transformation and social transition driving a conversation
    that leads to action through three areas

               1      strategic thought leadership that uncovers areas of shared risk and opportunity these opportunities
                       and risks form the basis for designing collective action programmes and understanding implementation
                       approaches
               2      build the capacity of all stakeholders with a focus on business to engage in potential collective action
                       programmes building parity in knowledge understanding and capacity across partners enhances the
                       potential success of collective projects
               3      design and implement collective projects that lead to businessled solutions which unlock
                       developmental outcomes that drive sustainable growth underpinning business being able to engage in
                       courageous conversations with multiple stakeholders

    the nbis work is divided into three core work streams with the overarching strategic objective of economic transition and
    social transformation projects within the work streams are strongly inﬂuenced by the local and international guidance
    provided by south africas ndp and the united nations sdgs the core work streams are discussed in more detail in the
    sections starting on page 30




    the core work streams are supported by various engagements that enable market delivery through communications
    including

                    courageous conversations
                    the thought leadership series
                    digital communications including infographics
                    project reports and project speciﬁc training
                    executive dialogues on social transformation and cohesion

              quick briefs
              on a clear day weekly newsletters and
              oneonone member engagement

our strategy and ways of working aim to achieve three key outcomes
              nbi members are recognised as a source of innovation and positive action and as trusted implementation
               partners
              nbi members have actively implemented collective action projects and inﬂuenced policy through
               businessled solutions
              nbi members are suﬃciently respected to speak out through directed courageous conversations
               against mis management poor practice and corruption in both the public and private sectors

we also provide signiﬁcant shortterm value to members through
              thought leadership we mitigate member risk and enhance opportunity through deep thinking from
               smart experienced staﬀ not saddled with a day job and who can aﬀord to think along a longer timeline

sustainability and the six capitals

 the nbi was established to maximise value for our members by facilitating a society and business environment that sup
 ports sustainable business we achieve this by

                   leveraging the intellectual capital developed within the nbi as well as that arising from our close
                    partnerships with global institutions such as the ungc and wbcsd the input of our members and
                    through our collaborations with academic institutions and industry thought leaders and
                   building social and relationship capital through our standing in the business community and our
                    established partnerships with regional and national government

 by building intellectual social and relationship capital we support the longterm sustainability of south africa and south af
 rican business by creating an economic environmental social and governance context in which all stakeholders can thrive
 as a public beneﬁt organisation our core focus is not the creation of ﬁnancial capital however sourcing suﬃcient funds is
 essential to enable us to continue to add value to our members through our projects training initiatives thought leadership
 and ongoing engagements with stakeholders this is one of the most critical challenges to the longterm sustainability of
 the nbi as an organisation

 the nbis human capital comprises the organisations employees including management and work stream heads that im
 plement our programmes and support the activities of the organisation as a relatively small organisation the nbis reliance
 on manufactured capital largely relates to the oﬃces we occupy and their contents this also means that our direct input
 on natural capital  the environment around us  is similarly not signiﬁcant however environmental issues particularly
 climate change and energy eﬃciency are core focus areas of the organisation and we consequently report on our own
 environmental impacts in recognition of their signiﬁcance

 our most material sustainability issues

 the table below summarises those risks and opportunities that have the most signiﬁcant potential impact on the organisa
 tions longterm sustainability these were identiﬁed and prioritised through our risk processes board and management
 deliberations membership engagement strategic planning sessions and the reporting process

 our most material issues include both ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial considerations as an organisation established around
 the principles of sustainability we appreciate that environmental social and governance risks and opportunities ultimately
 translate into ﬁnancial risks and opportunities and equally aﬀect our ability to generate sustainable value for our stakehold
 ers over the long term

 these issues are analysed in more detail in the relevant sections of the report

as an organisation are at a point where we have to make some diﬃcult choices in the year ahead our surveys show that
our members see value in what we do and that the nbi remains relevant however we need to run a leaner more focused
organisation that can hone in on the key projects which best meet the needs of our member base we also have a respon

we are proactively identifying and addressing our challenges and have taken the hard decisions needed to remain relevant
and sustainable once these changes have been embedded in the organisation we will be well set to continue doing what
we do best  building relationships between business and government to drive economic transition and social transforma

 south african business is currently experiencing sig         fectively addressing the issues facing our country the

 and uncertain outlook which has been worsened by the         leadership our ability to contribute meaningfully to

financial sustainability
 as a nonproﬁt organisation the nbi depends on membership donations and project funding to cover the costs of its core
 operations and programmes to make a measurable contribution to societal objectives and deliver tangible value to its mem
 bers the organisation needs to raise suﬃcient funding to secure sustainability for the core operations of the organisation
 and continuity for the longterm projects we implement

 membership fees comprised 57 of total revenue for 201415 20132014 50 they tend to come under pressure dur
 ing challenging economic times such as those experienced in south africa over the last several years membership fees
 covered approximately 80 of core operational costs with the balance coming from donor funding and project recoveries
 several of the organisations projects are funded out of core funding and the organisations funding and business model was
 one of the six major risks identiﬁed in the risk process programme funding for several of the projects is expected to come to
 an end by the end of calendar 2015 there is an urgent need to develop a more sustainable business model for the organisa
 tion

 the revised operating model aims to ensure that membership fees are used to cover core costs and projects will be imple
 mented on a selffunded basis the current restructuring aims to ensure that organisational expenses are aligned to mem
 bership income

 membership income will be supported by ensuring that the nbi remains relevant to current and potential members strength
 ens its reputation as an eﬀective business organisation and demonstrates the value of membership through the principle
 of membership exclusivity we are beginning to negotiate threeyear agreements with members continuing to build in an
 inﬂationary increase for fees at the request of the nbi board and continuing to request one years notice of cancellation of
 membership to support improved ﬁnancial planning while the concept of a years notice of cancellation of membership has
 already been implemented it would be prudent to have this contained within the three year agreements we have identiﬁed
 prospective members particularly in sectors where the nbi is underrepresented and engaged the services of a fundrais
 ing specialist to develop an integrated fundraising strategy that supports longterm sustainability membership is remaining
 constant with few losses experienced in the year under review

 membership income has been supported by ensuring close alignment of the nbis value proposition and strategy with
 member companies interests and demonstrating our ability to deliver on this strategy this alignment of interests and the
 increasing interest in collective action has proved successful in encouraging lapsed members to return

 staﬀ costs make up around two thirds of the nbis total costs which is appropriate given the service nature of the organisa
 tion however in order to right size the organisations cost base staﬀ numbers will need to be reduced while ensuring that
 we retain suﬃcient personnel to ensure delivery on our strategic programmes over the last three years core operating costs
 have been signiﬁcantly reduced and further reductions will be challenging to realise

 financial performance in 2015

 membership donations increased by 1 to r131 million 2014 r130 million while project cost recoveries decreased by
 28 to r80 million 2014 r111 million due to the timing of receipts on the psee project at year end total revenue de
 creased by 11 to r229 million 2014 r259 million

 the increase in total costs for the organisation was limited to 3 with personnel costs increasing by 4 and other adminis
 tration costs growing by 1 personnel costs represent 66 of total costs the same as the prior year

 the deﬁcit after investment revenue and ﬁnance costs was r271 502 compared to a surplus of r34 million in the prior
 year

 progress on 2015 goals

         1      membership income to be increased through retention and new member acquisition as well as project
                 income to ensure the implementation of the nbis strategy as well as the rebuilding of the nbis reserves
                 and therefore the nbis ﬁnancial stability
                 membership income increased 1 during the year under review while project funding decreased 28 due
                 to the timing on receipts in the psee project the revised strategy aims to address the nbis shortterm
                 funding challenges and address longterm ﬁnancial security

                 cost increases were limited to 3 overall for the year

goals for 2016

       1        membership income to continue to be increased through retention and new member acquisition as well as
                 project income to ensure the ongoing implementation of the nbis strategy and the rebuilding of the nbis

strategic positioning
 there are a number of business organisations and a multitude of socioeconomic development projects in south africa
 it is important that the nbis actions projects and programmes clearly distinguish it from other business organisations
 and opportunities and that our unique value proposition is clear in the minds of our members the business community
 and broader society

 we aim to ensure that we remain relevant to south african business by focusing our key programme streams on areas
 that have the greatest potential to develop scale to positively impact both beneﬁciaries and our members the nbi holds a
 unique position among south african business organisations given its focus on implementation and sustainability

 our key programme streams are
                 integrating strategic projects
                 a social sustainability focus and
                 an environmental sustainability focus
 the organisations media strategy customer relations and online proﬁle are extremely important to support understanding
 of the organisation the value it oﬀers to members and the eﬀective delivery on our projects encouraging participation of
 members in the organisation in its committees and at its events strengthens a sense of ownership of the organisation by
 members

 one of the unique value propositions of the nbi in its role as a nonmandated collective action movement of companies is
 that it enables us to put forward their views and provide government with a platform to engage with them on their views

 wherever possible we work closely with other business organisations to ensure that projects and programmes are com
 plementary and to minimise duplication these include business unity south africa busa business leadership south
 africa blsa and the black business council bbc demonstrating the intellectual capital and thought leadership de
 veloped in our focus areas also helps to demonstrate the value of the nbi to members and project funders we partner
 with other thought leaders to ensure that members beneﬁt from broader insights into key issues these partners include
 amongst others kpmg green economy work accenture reimagining africa report and pwc water

 eﬀective communication with our stakeholders helps to ensure that members potential members and project funders un
 derstand the nbis strategic focus value proposition and achievements these engagements also help to ensure that we
 understand our members strategic objectives to align the actions of the nbi to support these goals

goals for 2016 to 2018

       1     align and integrate the organisations programme work in relation to the themepurpose of economic
              transition and social transformation with integrating strategic projects cross cutting and two core
              programme areas ie an environmental programme and a social programme
       2     develop a focus on understanding and managing business risk and opportunity through integrating this
              into the thematic areas and programme work
       3     bring knowledge of international business trends to south african companies through
              interpreting the relevance and signiﬁcance of the work done by organisations such as the wbcsd the
              ceo water mandate and the cdp for south africa
       4     build a strong focus on sharing company best practice experiences between companies and on
              communicating these experiences broadly

project execution

 the nbi combines the conceptual aspects of strategic thinking and thought leadership with the practical implementation
 of projects and programmes that support sustainable development in our focus areas this hands on approach makes us
 unique amongst business organisations however it is imperative that the projects we implement deliver on their targeted
 outcomes and achieve these targets within budget and deadline

 good project implementation demonstrates that funding is allocated eﬀectively and spent wisely which helps to build
 trust with our member base and partners and supports the nbis strong reputation as an organisation that delivers the
 ﬁnancial sustainability of the organisation requires that staﬀ levels operational structure and cost base are appropriate to
 ensure project delivery

 our project management system ensures that projects and costs are eﬀectively managed and is being rolled out across the
 organisation the restructuring aims to reduce core costs and also ensure that additional resources are added for speciﬁc
 projects as required

 progress on 2015 goals

         1       keep regular reports
                  the nbi has produced project reports on a regular and routine basis

         2       regular reﬁned and robust reporting to be improved for the speciﬁc programmes
                  signiﬁcant progress has been made in this area however we will have to use the 2016 ﬁnancial year to
                  take this goal forward and to implement it organisationwide

         3       to reﬁne procurement processes for better functioning systems
                  we have over several years continued to reﬁne our procurement systems we are conﬁdent that our
                  processes and systems adhere to the highest standards the systems are tested annually through an
                  external audit and are found to be functioning well

         4       continue to improve contract management
                  we have made signiﬁcant improvement in this area through the implementation of a revised contract
                  management function however there are still improvements that we aim to implement in 2016

         5       review and improve legal processes as required
                  the nbi works closely with an external legal team on legal issues we have looked at how this external
                  legal function can be used more eﬀectively and hope to improve the legal processes even further

         6       project management and execution to continue improving through regular reviews and reporting
                  the nbi has improved project management and execution in the current year through regular reviews and
                  reporting however the improvements have not yet been implemented across the entire organisation and
                  we aim to show improvements by 2016

 goals for 2016

         1       regular reﬁned and robust reporting to be improved across the entire organisation
         2       continued improvements to the contract management system
         3       project management and execution to continue improving through regular reviews and reporting across
                  the entire organisation

governance

 we believe that good governance is essential for the sustainability of any organisation and we are committed to the princi
 ples of good governance described in king iii through the progressive leadership and advocacy roles the nbi holds it is
 critical that we both demonstrate this commitment in our own operations and support members and the broader business
 community to entrench good corporate governance in theirs we support the development of a governance culture through
 our role as the local host of the ungc and through several initiatives that are discussed in more detail in the social sus
 tainability section on page 40 of this report

 the nbis governance architecture aligns the organisation with the requirements of the companies act and king
 iii this structure and its activities during the year are reported in the governance report on page 45

 an externally facilitated values workshop was held as part of the process to identify the core values of the organisation
 and these will be used to underpin the revised messaging and logo refresh various key policies including the conditions
 of employment transport anticorruption retrenchment and leave policies were updated and aligned with developments
 in legislation there is a formal staﬀ training programme in place to communicate all policy revisions and training on the
 fraud and anticorruption policy was rolled out across the organisation

 the external review of our procurement system was completed and the recommendations arising have been implemented
 strengthening the overall system we are continuing work on developing a formalised code of conduct and have im
 proved our induction process

 progress on 2015 goals

 1      to build on and continue to strengthen the improved communication
         the internal communications strategy needs to be examined and a proposal developed to improve the lines of
         communication to staﬀ communications and human resources are working proactively on this issue which is
         being actively focused on

 goals for 2016

 1      ensure that all staﬀ are included in the policy review process and trained on updated policies
 2      conduct more robust induction processes for new staﬀ to ensure they are aware of the policies and procedures
         in the organisation
 3      review the values process and engage with staﬀ on living and demonstrating the values in the organisation
         behaviourally



human capital

 the human capital embodied in the nbis employees enables us to deliver on our many projects oﬀer training host events
 and engage with members government and our other stakeholders the skills and experience built up enhances the intel
 lectual capital available to the organisation a vital asset in creating the thought leadership that is a key diﬀerentiator for
 the nbi

 our human capital is both one of our most valuable assets and our single largest operating cost achieving a balance
 between the skills necessary to eﬀectively implement our projects while managing costs represents a critical challenge in
 ensuring ﬁnancial sustainability project execution and strategic positioning

 the human resources hr department manages the nbis human capital in terms of our hr policies and established
 practices the delegation of authority policy was revised and the recommendations identiﬁed in this process as well as in
 the procurement review were implemented during the year an internal audit of hr processes was conducted and areas
 for improvement identiﬁed will be implemented the contract management system was also reviewed to ensure eﬀective
 and eﬃcient management of contracts there was also a review and update of all hr policies

 headcount remained broadly unchanged at 38 at the end of the 2015 ﬁnancial year 2014 39 staﬀ turnover increased
 to 7 compared to 5 in 2014 due to resignations in the prior year staﬀ costs increased 4 rising to 73 of total
 revenue earned 2014 57 due to the 11 decline in revenue for the year

 transformation and employment equity are important priorities for the nbi and are incorporated in our hiring processes

 days 2014 none while we are concerned about the signiﬁcant impact of hivaids on individuals and communities in
 south africa we do not believe it poses a direct threat to the longterm sustainability of the nbi

 other hr initiatives during 2015 included

        training on the anticorruption policy
        consultation updating and amendment of the leave it transport and retrenchment policies
        performance management training for the leadership team and management
        finalisation of performance contracts that link into organisational values to support eﬀectiveness and
         accountability of staﬀ and
        an indepth process was held to identify organisational values and deﬁne the behaviours necessary to
         implement the values these values will be embedded in the processes and systems of the organisation

 human capital challenges and opportunities

 the nbis ability to attract retain and develop its human capital is a key strategic consideration concerns around the ﬁnan
 cial sustainability of the organisation and the recent restructuring inevitably aﬀected staﬀ morale although this is improving
 with the ﬁnalisation of staﬃng levels and the revised strategy career planning is challenging given the relatively small size
 of the organisation low staﬀ turnover and ﬂat management structure
 retention is particularly important as it relates to key staﬀ and this has been identiﬁed as a key risk for the organisation
 information management and systems are being reviewed to ensure that these embed institutional memory to manage this
 risk
 the appointment of a head of operations is a priority should the funding be available to free the ceo from daily opera
 tional involvement and allow her to play a more strategic role this position will also have a core responsibility to help with
 fundraising strategies and resourcing capacities to contribute to the development of a more comprehensive and integrated
 funding strategy
 while skills development initiatives are an important aspect of human capital development this area did not receive a great
 deal of attention during the restructuring and will be a focus in the year ahead during 2015 skills development mainly took
 the form of attendance at conferences study support and inhouse training

transformation
 social transformation is one of the nbis key strategic objectives and the principles of transformation promote the nbis
 goal of creating and supporting a sustainable equitable and thriving society the nbis ability to create value relies on
 building strong relationships between business government and communities in order to remain relevant to our stakehold
 ers it is important that we demonstrate our commitment to transformation within our own organisation

 we measure our transformation progress against the department of trade and industry codes of good practice dti

 the nbis hr policies and hiring procedures align with the targets stipulated in our employment equity plan which aims
 to achieve increased representation from historically disadvantaged groups this continues to be a challenge given the
 premium in salaries for equivalent positions in government and corporates we also recognise that we need to improve the
 representation of people with disabilities in the organisation

 progress on 2015 goals

 1      retention of new staﬀ and identifying development gaps
         the staﬀ required for the psee were retained until the end of the project and development goals were identiﬁed
         however resources were limited
 2      completion of training as required and upskilling staﬀ
         skills development initiatives were limited to internal programmes and conferences during 2015 and study
         assistance was provided for two staﬀ members furthermore there was continued support for study assistance
         and training but it was limited to internal training due to limited resources

 environmental considerations have a signiﬁcant impact on the overall sustainability of every business and organisation
 and environmental sustainability is one of the nbis core work streams while the quantum of our direct environmental
 impacts is not material due to the size and nature of the nbi we record and report these as part of our commitment to
 sustainable business practices

 we facilitate responsible environmental stewardship on a much bigger scale through our environmental projects and initia
 tives which are discussed in the section starting on page 31 of this report

 internal environmental awareness initiatives highlight the importance of reducing consumption of resources such as elec
 tricity water and paper our ability to reduce our electricity and water consumption is limited as our usage is allocated
 by the landlord according to the oﬃce space we use our landlord is implementing certain technologies to reduce the
 energy consumption of the building and ultimately the oﬃce park

 the nbi has been voluntarily responding to the cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project since 2013 while the nbis
 direct emissions are very small responding to the cdp enables us to monitor our progress on measuring and report
 ing our carbon emissions and the actions we are taking to reduce emissions the 2015 cdp response was our ﬁrst that
 was scored and we are pleased to report that the nbi scored 94b

 the majority of our carbon emissions come from purchased electricity we estimate that roughly half of the electricity
 we consume is used in heating ventilation and air conditioning around a third in lighting roughly 20 is used by oﬃce
 equipment with the remainder split between refrigeration and water heating

 the organisation consumed 98 570 kwh of electricity in 2015 a 1 decrease on 2014 99 202 kwh despite the of
 ﬁce space added during the reporting year for the psee project

 we withdrew 966 m3 water during the year 2014 411 m3 which represents an increase of 135 in the 2015 ﬁnancial year
 the nbi had additional oﬃce space to house the psee programme for a full year in comparison to 6 months of the previ
 ous ﬁnancial year this additional space housed 17 additional contracted staﬀ members most of these staﬀ members only
 started working at the nbi towards the end of the 2014 ﬁnancial year and several other short term contractors the nbis
 landlord allocates the water based on share infrastructure costs

 while we aim to reduce unnecessary travel wherever possible and reduce our carbon footprint the implementation of the
 psee project required increased travel and travel costs therefore rose by 60 on 2014

 progress on 2015 goals

 1     we aim to further reduce our scope 2 carbon emissions by 4 through the green addendum that was signed
        between the nbi and our landlord and through an awareness raising programme in the oﬃce
        despite the psee oﬃce being fully operational in 2015 our scope 2 carbon emissions declined by 1 in 2015
 2     we aim to reduce air travel in 2015 by encouraging staﬀ to use skype and other teleconferencing options available
        in order to eﬀectively engage with our members face to face interaction and meetings are necessary further
        more the psee programme requires our staﬀ to travel to meet with businesses as a result our emissions
        associated with air travel increased this reporting year
 3     to further engage with our landlord to determine the weight of the waste that is recycled so that we can monitor
        progress going forward we hope to build on this relationship to explore opportunities for further reductions in
        energy usage through the installation of motion sensor lighting
        our oﬃce airconditioning units were upgraded which will improve the eﬃciency of our hvac system and
        reduce our electricity consumption

 goals for 2016

 1     given that our carbon emissions are immaterial and we have already signiﬁcantly reduced emissions we
        anticipate that our emissions will plateau and remain relatively constant for 2016
 2     in 2016 we aim to explore opportunities for high quality teleconferencing which will enable us to reduce our air
        travel
 3     we intend to continue with identifying energy eﬃciency opportunities and to explore ways to further reduce
        consumption through the installation of motion sensor lighting

core work stream review

 the nbis revised strategy divides our work into three core work streams

        integrating strategic projects
        an environmental sustainability focus and
        a social sustainability focus

 our work in these areas aims to lead to businessled solutions which unlock developmental outcomes that drive sustain
 able growth and support business to engage in courageous conversations with multiple stakeholders

 we approach each project with the intention of producing core assets including models data sets reports deepened
 stakeholder relationships and various training and communication sets these assets beneﬁt the nbi through providing a
 basis for replication expert insights and recognition access to policy leaders and thought leaders custom scenarios a
 basis for engagement and custom data views

 this assetfocused approach to projects also creates important beneﬁts for members including

        informed and eﬀective legislation
        protected opinion communication
        improved capacity
        strategic insight
        implementation insight

 we believe that environmental sustainability is a critical part of business sustainability and that the past and present ill
 treatment of the environment will be felt through inﬂationary pressure on business our environmental work stream and
 projects aim to drive more sustainable resource management by business integrate eﬃcient natural resource manage
 ment into the strategic agenda of companies enable business to radically innovate the way they manage natural resources
 throughout their value chains and inform public policy to enable the proactive move towards a green economy

 the environmental sustainability work stream incorporates the three focus areas in which the nbi has been active for a
 number of years  water climate change and energy  as well as two new areas which are currently under development
 waste and biodiversity and food security the sections that follow highlight the key projects in each of the current areas
 of activity

 water

 water is a social and economic issue that aﬀects the competitiveness of our economy and individual companies while
 south africa has come a long way in providing access to potable water for all water supply interruptions water quality
 concerns and a degrading water infrastructure represent major challenges for south african society and the economy
 there is an urgent need for companies to play a leading role in addressing our national water challenges to avoid the con
 straints to economic growth that problems related to water supply and access could cause

 our water programme expansion is a great success story and we have raised the proﬁle of water substantially with our
 members through a series of expert dialogues across the country developed strong ties with the department of water
 and sanitation dws and assisted with the rollout of the alliance for water stewardship aws standard in south africa
 our work on water pricing is progressing well although not at the pace we would like a predominant challenge is the com
 plexity of the issue and its interconnectedness with other challenging areas like municipal revenue management working
 with member company pwc we have produced a solid draft that we will use as a basis for another round of discussions
 with members in the coming year

 the nbi has a range of solutions to support companies to eﬀectively account for and manage risks at the facility water
 shed or river basin level these include workshops in our recently launched thought leadership series and information
 and beneﬁts regarding the various tools available for water accounting the nbi also worked with members to build capac
 ity and a number of networking events were held during the year

 key projects

        cdp water
 the nbi partnered with the cdp incite and irbaris to produce the 2014 cdp south africa water report which was released
 in november 2014 the report is drawn from the responses to questionnaires sent to 58 companies on the johannesburg
 stock exchange that have the greatest potential to impact on or be impacted by water resources
 the continued participation by south african business in the cdp water programme reﬂects a growing appreciation by
 local business of the strategic importance of water the leading responding companies are demonstrating that companies
 working together with civil society and government stakeholders are having a signiﬁcant impact on water stewardship in
 south africa

environmental sustainability work stream
water  climate change

        water pricing
 the nbi is researching water pricing in south africa to produce a thought leadership report supported by expert interviews
 with key water stakeholders a water tool is being developed to enable companies to engage with how they are managing
 their own water issues based on the work around the cdp water project and the challenges companies reported

         water stewardship
 shortterm water impacts such as drought tend to be top of mind for the media government and public in south africa
 however while droughts and ﬂoods are important shortterm risks there are more critical systemic issues in the water sec
 tor that need to be addressed to ensure longterm sustainability of supply in south africa these systemic issues include
         municipal water supply challenges driven by infrastructure and institutional capacity issues
         water cost increases in part in response to poor asset management and inadequate revenue collection but also
          to address future infrastructure needs
         the need for integrated and longterm strategic planning of human settlements water resource management and
          water services
         declining water quality with a resultant increase in the need for dilution and associated higher treatment costs
         potential regulatory incoherence in water licencing and
         complex water institutions with potentially conﬂicting objectives

 as a result of these systemic issues many of the key water risks facing industry cannot be adequately solved through
 company operational measures an eﬀective response to these risks therefore involves the concept of water stewardship
 a process whereby companies work collaboratively with other partners to manage shared water resources water steward
 ship is therefore an important component to mitigating corporate water risk and facilitating business growth

 since 2014 the nbi has run a number of workshops seminars and events focused on water stewardship with an emphasis
 on building understanding of water stewardship approaches and best practices the nbi has also begun to actively work
 to facilitate new collective action projects on water in south africa as well as formed a partnership with the ceo water
 mandate to advance water stewardship practice across southern africa

        waste water treatment
 the nbis thought leadership work has seen failing or ineﬀective wastewater treatment works consistently raised as an
 area of strong concern for business and wider stakeholders in south africa for example improving wastewater treatment
 has emerged as a key priority within the nbis green economy project as implemented under the south african green
 fund between 2014 and 2016

 improved wastewater treatment in south africa will require collaboration by a set of priority partners that includes the pri
 vate sector all spheres of government and key civil society organisations to ensure that the country has wellfunctioning
 wastewater facilities staﬀed by competent managers and technicians

 climate change

 the nbi has been successful in securing funding and resourcing for key strategic projects in the climate work a ﬁveyear
 review of the cdp is being done in partnership with kpmg the nbi was part of the international business organisa
 tion coalition we mean business that was established in the run up to cop 21 where we participated fundamentally to
 give an emerging economy perspective on the climate issue

 work was done in climate policy and climate change several reports including one on greenhouse gas ghg reporting
 guidelines and the cdp climate change report were released policy and awareness raising sessions have been held
 as well as ghg accounting training the nbi is investigating the possibility of institutionalising this training so that it be
 comes an accredited course that is run through a number of universities around the country

 through the we mean business campaign the nbi was asked to become friends of the business and climate summit
 this is a business summit that looks at how the international business community understands the potential solutions to
 the climate challenge the deliberations focused around solutions

 the nbi has agreed with the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd to host a climate technology
 solutions dialogueworkshop in south africa at the beginning of september 2015 looking at particular technologies and
 solutions that may be of key relevance to south africa this will be done in partnership with the department of environmen

 shown positive outcomes

 key projects

        cdp climate

 the cdp is a mobilising framework that seeks information on the business risks and opportunities presented by climate
 change as well as greenhouse gas emissions data it is an international independent notforproﬁt organisation that in
 volves more than 767 institutional investors with combined us92 trillion of assets under management the project focuses
 on governance risk and opportunity identiﬁcation and emissions management and has encouraged greater investor focus
 on climate change

 the nbi is the south african partner to the cdp and south africa is the only country in africa participating among more
 than 60 other countries internationally cdp response rates were stable in the 2014 reporting cycle and we incrementally
 improved our analysis of the data both climate change and water reports were well received and continue to be a pri
 mary reference on the positive action business is taking on climate change and water

 critically with the support of the prosperity fund we have consolidated all seven years of cdp climate data that we
 hold into a single database to enable a far greater depth of analysis

 the 2014 report was launched in october 2014 with the average response rate increasing to 85 2013 83 and
 nine south african companies were included in the global climate performance leadership index cpli

        greenhouse gas ghg accounting

 our ghg accounting programme continued in 2015 and we are investigating the possibility of introducing our material into
 university curricula we hosted a train the trainer session focused on university lecturers in support of this goal we have
 also released a number of quick briefs to support our members in tackling some of the trickier issues in reporting chief
 amongst these is a report on how to translate ghg protocol footprints into ipcc guidelinedriven footprints this was done
 in support of our members having to comply with mandatory reporting requirements with potential connections to the
 carbon budgeting and carbon tax systems

        we mean business

 a key additional project started in 2014 is the nbis participation in the we mean business global coalition we will use
 this partnership to highlight south african business best practice on a global stage and also keep south african companies
 informed of progress in the build up to cop21 in support of we mean business and our members we participated in the
 business and climate summit in paris in may 2015

 energy

 the goal of the energy focus of the nbi is to support continuous energy eﬃciency improvement to facilitate resource use
 and reduce carbon emissions the nbi has a strong history of leading and being the secretariat to collective action to
 encourage and support the implementation of energy eﬃciency and policy implementation especially among its members

 the energy security challenge that unfolded towards the end of 2014 made the nbis energy eﬃciency work more relevant
 for strategic engagement between business and government through the war room eﬀorts towards stabilisation of energy
 supply and demand for the country the case studies from the energy eﬃciency leadership network eeln produced in
 2014 were particularly important in presenting examples of what is possible in reducing demand oﬀ the grid the further
 electricity price hikes and load shedding that threatened the economic sustainability of businesses were additional driv
 ers for energy eﬃciency

environmental sustainability work stream
energy


 the nbis excellent track record of work done over many years led to the organisation attracting dfid funding to enable
 the rollout of energy eﬃciency initiatives across the country through the private sector energy eﬃciency psee project
 the eeln has been a key stakeholder group to champion the psee with a number of its members buying into the large
 company oﬀering of psee

 drawing on the work of the eeln and the psee the nbi is well positioned to play a leading role in supporting both the
 private sector and government in addressing the energy challenge but in order to continue to play this important role
 securing further funding for both projects is crucial

 that gives government and business an opportunity to speak and engage openly about energy eﬃciency as well as energy
 strategy and policy implementation
 the networks objective is to drive continuous improvements in energy eﬃciency initiatives across member companies
 and thus south africa through the sharing of best practice upskilling and providing a platform for business to engage
 constructively with government to provide leadership in energy eﬃciency
 signatories have committed to setting internal eﬃciency targets and to reporting on those internally the eeln functions
 as a network which allows the people in companies who are responsible for energy eﬃciency to learn from each other
 to build their capacity and to identify particular areas where the work of the nbi can support them

 activities during 2015

 the eeln achieved the majority of its objectives despite not securing additional external funding resources generated
 by the psee including publications and training are also available and accessible to the eeln

 signiﬁcant strides have been made in extending the nbis network amongst industry associations companies and munici
 palities and developing the brand publicity and proﬁle of the work of the nbi and the psee

 a great deal of the work in the past year has been capacity building work where companies had volunteered themselves
 as learning centres to other members of the network this proved to be a very useful and valuable way for companies to
 learn from each other and created a community of practice and understanding

 during 2015 the eeln reﬁned its focus on technologies and partnerships to support members in selecting the most ap
 propriate energy eﬃciency technologies for their operations and ensuring sustained energy eﬃciency and conservation
 into the future

 the third set of energy eﬃciency case studies were released which enabled the nbi to supply hard data on what can be
 achieved through demand side management measures and energy eﬃciency in the government processes that are look
 ing at addressing the energy supply crisis the case studies are available on the website at request from steve nicholls

 the eeln also did work around the 12l tax incentives providing input for the debate that ended up increasing the sub
 sidy from 45 to 95 cents per kilowatt hour the eeln remains a vehicle to drive continuous private sector energy eﬃ
 ciency improvement and to enhance understanding of what is possible into the future around energy eﬃciency

 capacity building is a priority area for the network network events have enabled members of the network to see the work
 of other members thereby building a community around technology the network has requested a technology roadmap
 around energy eﬃciency in order to create some kind of criteria and categorisation for diﬀerent technologies there is
 ongoing engagement with government at a number of levels including participating in the process where government is
 reviewing the countrys energy eﬃciency strategy

 progress on 2015 goals  eeln

 1      measure results via a survey to report on progress made by companies establish a reporting working group to
         report on progress in achieving commitments companies made which include development of energy baselines
         targets and management plans

        establishing a reporting working group was superseded by the publication of the draft regulations regarding
        registration reporting on energy management and submission of energy management plans companies re
        quested to obtain clarity on the requirements of the incoming legislation ﬁrst in order to better align their
        reporting activities

 2     provide capacity building workshops on topics that members have indicated from the survey results that they
        need more training on one training workshop per quarter
        based on the outcomes of a company survey conducted in 2014 eeln workﬂows were successfully partitioned
        into themed quarterly activities yeartodate the eeln has successfully completed two capacity building work
        shops on building eﬃciency in partnership with gbcsa and enms  energy auditing both of which were well
        attended by eeln company representatives

 3     conduct followup meetingsworkshops to clarify incoming energy policyregulations burning issues on a needs
        basis
        the nbi eeln secretariat facilitated the attendance of various sectors at workshops to develop the 201630
        national energy eﬃciency strategy nees led by the international energy agency

        energy security remained a burning issue for business and the energy war room was the most signiﬁcant
        development in 2015 to address energy challenges in sa through busa representation the nbi directly fed
        informationcompany data to the war room through various nbi publications and market intelligence submitted
        as evidence of company interventions meetings with the likes of eskom the doe sanedi busa and the
        eeln advisory committee were held to form a collaborative campaign to advocate for energy eﬃciency
        interventions as a contributor to curbing the electricity supply constraints experienced by eskom the eeln
        remains a key reference point and implementation partner for government on various strategic action plans as
        well as a resource centre for multiple business sectors

 4     conduct meetings to align the department of energys doe mandatory energy reporting requirements to the
        actions of the eeln facilitate strategic dialogues on pressing issues on a needs basis
        in partnership with the doe the eeln conducted three insightful workshops in gauteng western cape and
        kwazulunatal to clarify the requirements of the draft energy reporting regulations for business

 goals for 2016  eeln

 1     use projectlevel information to provide indicative progress on developing baselines targets and management
        plans engage with the doe to proposeinitiate a process of joint vetting of energy management plans
        collaborate with the doe to develop a guideline document for mandatory energy reporting requirements
        establish a pilot for submitting energy management plans to the doe for preliminary vetting

 2     conduct workshops on pumps metering and controls ghg emission regulation requirements for electricity
        consumers and renewable energy to explore existing opportunities across the spectrum of renewable energy
        and learn lessons from implementers documentarchive lessons from all capacity building workshops as learning

the psee is a countrywide programme of support to improve energy eﬃciency in small medium and large south african
businesses the project is funded by the uk governments department for international development dfid through the
uksa bilateral relationship and is aligned with the south african governments strategy for reducing energy demand the
multistakeholder steering committee that governs the project is led by the department of energy the nbi psee team
works closely with the uks carbon trust which has over 10 years of experience in rolling out similar projects in the uk

activities in 2015
there was material progress in the delivery of the psee in 2015 energy eﬃciency workshops were held providing in
formation for small companies and helping them to build their awareness and understanding as to why energy eﬃciency
is important there was a strong emphasis on ﬁnance because ﬁnances restrained the ability of companies to imple
ment against the set of recommendations they were given

nearly 100 accredited consultancies delivered on the programme with large companies participating on a costsharing
basis while the longer contracting process in large companies slowed implementation a number of the large compa
nies having seen the value that the work delivered wanted to bring their value chains and suppliers into the process

most of the participating companies were in the major centres and plans are in place to extend the work in other provinces
in the next year the energy crisis has oﬀered an opportunity to demonstrate that companies can achieve much more with
their energy spend and that this is in their interest as well as the national interest




while the programme is unlikely to hit its original log frame output targets for medium and large companies dfid and
the programme agreed to reduce these in the last quarter based on the pipeline having been depleted towards the end
of 2014 and it taking time to reﬁll despite the follow up service commencing late a good pipeline is in place and the pro
gramme is on track to not only meet the revised targets but exceed them

in terms of the monitoring and reporting function we are pleased to report that the programme continues to identify high
levels of energy and carbon savings potential within companies and that these are often low or nocost interventions
this continues to prove that support services such as those provided by the psee are desperately needed and could
have a real and direct impact on the present energy crisis at latest count the programme has successfully identiﬁed 7
317gwh of lifetime energy savings oﬀ a target of 2 576gwh which represents 53 mtco2e oﬀ a target of 20 mtco2e and
r 1278m of investment potential from a target of r750m the average payback period of the interventions identiﬁed to date
remains a very low 23 years

while the dfid funding came to an end in november 2015 the programme has continued to tackle the challenge of future
sustainability especially in the context of a programme which is seeing increasing demand and outputs we continue to
approach a wide range of stakeholders and funders both domestic and foreign and both public and private

progress on 2015 goals  climate change water and the green economy

1      in addition to the cdp programme and continuing our work on green economy finance we intend to expand our
        work through the launch of a thought leadership series a report on water pricing and working with partner
        organisations and government to enhance business access to scientiﬁc research the thought leadership
        series will be part capacity building and part an opportunity for our members to engage with experts on a
        speciﬁc topic and to discuss the implications for their business
        2014 was an excellent year for the climate change water and the green economy team we delivered well
        against our intended goals and expanded our work in some signiﬁcant areas beyond our original plan we have
        therefore raised funding exceeding our plan and expectations refer to progress made in the cdp programme
        page 33 the thought leadership series page 44 the green economy page 43 water pricing page 32
        and the reimagining africas future report page 43

2      we will support our members in much the same way and continue to oﬀer thought leadership technical reports
        information sessions and quick briefs on topics most relevant to business we will continue our ghg accounting
        programme and will be issuing a report to assist companies who are subject to mandatory reporting deros
        desired emission reduction outcomes and the carbon tax we will continue to support oﬀsets which span
        the work areas of climate change water and air quality and waste key to our eﬀorts will be the launch of the
        thought leadership series a component of which is capacity building
        refer to progress made in the sections on the thought leadership series page 44 greenhouse gas
        accounting page 33 water pricing page 32 and the we mean business coalition page 33

3      we will continue to provide a conduit for safe conversations between business and government we will continue
        to support government technical working groups and intensify our quiet conversations expanding on topics
        covered in both
        members of the team continue to sit on over 15 technical advisory committees in support of government
        including on carbon budgeting oﬀsetting national industrial symbiosis water and greenhouse gas accounting
        we have hosted a number of quiet conversations especially on adaptation we will continue to focus on
        hosting discussions between key practitioners within government and business the adaptation case study
        report is in ﬁnal draft and will be released early in fy 2015

        we have also focused on hosting events that drive conversations on economic transition these events have
        been attended by senior business and government people and the quality of the conversations has been
        excellent key amongst these was a session on economic transition where lord hastings cbe and colin
        coleman md of member company goldman sachs and nbi board member were keynote speakers we will
        also continue to include broader economic discussions as we did with the future of coal debate in our thought
        leadership series

4      we will expand our water and adaptation programmes and build on our green economy ﬁnance work
        we will launch a series of discussions intended to bring stakeholders to the science researchpracticepolicy
        nexus together to improve the uptake and eﬀectiveness of research outputs we will explore how to establish a

       in the context of cop21 in paris in december 2015 adaptation is particularly important continuing our partner
       ship with the ungc caring4climate campaign we have produced a case study report on adaptation measures
       being taken by south african companies we had a fantastic response from our member companies and would
       like to particularly thank eskom for their continued support and encouragement of this programme

       we hosted a very successful event with our member company exxaro partnering with the department of sci
       ence and technology the purpose of this session was to bring together the business and government research
       communities to explore how we could align better while the event was a tremendous success we must unfort
       nately report that the nbi was not able to allocate the time and resource to progress this it is something we co
       tinue to monitor and would like to take forward in the future

 goals for 2016  climate change water and the green economy

 1    we will continue to focus on delivering on the nbis strategic goals coordinating our members to join a
       conversation on economic transition to an economy that meets the needs of both our people and the
       environment and highlighting their existing positive contribution will form the basis of our work

       we will be working to ensure closer alignment with the other work areas within the nbi to acknowledge the
       linkages between environmental social and governance issues core to this will be work we do on the business
       role in implementing the national development plan a key goal for 2015 is to expand the thought leadership
       series to include all of nbis programmes

       we will complete the current phase of the green economy work and integrate this work into international and
       regional platforms we will also gather input from each of the participating stakeholder groups as to where they
       believe we should be investing to scale up a transition to a green economy our initial goal is to support the work
       the wbcsd are doing on their low carbon technology partnership initiative lctpi programme we will be
       presenting our results at local and international conferences fundamental to our future green economy work will
       be continuing to work with stakeholders on unlocking investment opportunities leading to balanced economic
       growth

       we hope our work on cdp water and ﬁnalising our water pricing paper will provoke a more
       sophisticated conversation on water and higher response rates to the cdp water programme

       we will be shifting how we present cdp data to be more visual in the hope that this will highlight the signiﬁcant
       contribution of south african companies to climate mitigation but also encouraging further debate and ambition
       ultimately we hope to make the data and the cdp results more accessible we will use the database to build
       research programmes that will be led by partner universities

       all of our above work in conjunction with several discussions built around the reimagining africa report will
       contribute to an intimate member conversation around economic transition

 2    we have formulated a partnership with member company promethium carbon and will advance our support to
       our members on policy by with promethiums support issuing brieﬁngs on key policy issues we will still
       include key policy and technical issues in our thought leadership series programme

       we will continue with our support for we mean business and encourage member companies to sign up for
       the we mean business commitments we will also drive a conversation around economic transition through a
       monthly newsletter that will include comments from prominent member company ceos we will provide input to
       we mean business conversations at both the climate week in new york and cop21 in paris continuing
       this activity after cop21 to ensure that outcomes are well understood by our members and incorporated in our
       conversations about the need for economic transition

       we will still run our ghg training workshops although we will scale these back to one workshop in
       each of johannesburg cape town and durban

 3    we will continue to oﬀer our support to government in technical working groups we will sustain our quiet
       conversations programme and expand it to include more speciﬁc conversations on water waste and climate
       mitigation

 4        in line with our broader nbi strategy we will focus on bringing stakeholders together to take concrete action and
           scale up investment this will take place in water industrial symbiosis and climate change through our energy
           programme issues and will incorporate our learning on green economy and ﬁnance
           within our water focus area we are concentrating our eﬀorts on helping members to understand the beneﬁts and
           limitations of the various water tools available in the market ﬁnalising our research on the future of water pricing
           as well as building up our water stewardship programme in collaboration with a number of partners including the
           wbcsd

           a key focus area is to enhance our use of business language and understanding of business risk through
           running a memberdriven risk process using methodologies similar to those developed by the wef to produce
           their global risk report these outputs should strengthen our conversations on economic transition and identify
           clear areas where business needs to take collective action

 the role that the nbi plays in skills development is one of implementing and anchoring the work currently underway be
 tween business and government to facilitate cooperation and understanding and support inclusive growth this role
 also positions the organisation to identify ways to pull all the work from the various projects together and use the learn
 ing and value achieved to inﬂuence the system as a whole

 the various projects aim to improve businesss ability to access the skills necessary to achieve their strategic goals with a
 focus on building employability in technical college leavers guided by the overarching pathways to employability frame
 work this ensures that technical college graduates are equipped with the skills to study further start their own business
 or enter employment

 projects aim to support meaningful partnerships between employers and technical vocational education and training
 tvet colleges to enhance college institutional capacity and improve their responsiveness to employer needs business
 is encouraged to create opportunities for workplace learning and to provide practical support for structured workplace
 learning

 this work requires extensive engagement with a wide range of stakeholders including the national planning commission
 the department of higher education and training senior business leaders of companies and other business organisations
 such as busa blsa and the bbc regular engagement is essential to ensure that our programmes remain relevant to
 business and align with the national development plan
