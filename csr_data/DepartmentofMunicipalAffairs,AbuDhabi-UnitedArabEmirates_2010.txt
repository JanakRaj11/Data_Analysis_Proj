                                      of the international building codes for the emirate of abu dhabi to provide safer greener and
                                      more economical places in which to live and work the codes emphasize the emirates need of
                                      greener and more sustainable buildings the codes provide minimum standards for buildings fire

                                      future sustainable cities

                                      the international building codes have been developed in a manner that they have taken
                                      global best practices working in collaboration with the international code council icc the
                                      dma has taken the stringent standards that are meant to be implemented in the usa in 2012
                                      and customized the codes to fit abu dhabis culture and extremely hot climate to be ready for
                                      implementation in 2010 the iccs mission is to provide the highest quality of codes standards
                                      products and services for all concerned with the safety and performance of the built environment
                                      key areas of ecological focus underlying the international building codes include the reduction
                                      of emiratewide co2 emissions through the construction of energy and water efficient buildings
                                      increase in quality of the buildings themselves and the optimization in the use of wastewater the
                                      building codes also directly support fire safety accessibility durability ozone depletion reductions
                                      enhanced air quality and quality of life through enhancing indoor air quality and natural lighting


                                       targeted benefits of the icodes
                                       expected energy savings                              125 kwh per square meter per year

                                      the international building codes are comprised of 8 codes in total an overall building code will
                                      improve construction quality durability and safety which include antiseismic and flood prevention

                                      emirate these codes also incorporate 100 universal accessibility criteria minimum standards for
                                      the quality of construction materials and require natural ventilation and daylighting standards
                                      to be met the energy conservation code will ensure energy conservation and drive down co2
                                      emissions with extensive energy modeling and metering and is expected to meet the united
                                      nations green building targets for energy efficiency the plumbing codes will ensure water and
                                      energy conservation through its standards the fire codes will regulate safeguards for fire hazards
                                      thereby enhancing safety across the emirate the mechanical codes will improve indoor air quality
                                      following ashrae standards and reduce co2 emissions by requiring building temperatures to be
                                      set to 24 degrees celsius which reduce energy consumption significantly across the emirate the
                                      fuel and gas codes will enhance safety and efficiency of fuel piping systems
