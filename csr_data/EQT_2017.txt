                                                 report produced under the global reporting initiative gri guidelines and the first
                                                 during my tenure as ceo i am proud to lead a company with such a strong
                                                 commitment to sustainability we understand that actively managing the effects of
                                                 our activities drives continuous improvement enabling us to learn every step of the
                                                 way this years report theme bridging growth  success naturally grew out of
                                                 the collaboration between our production and midstream business units and is
                                                 also a nod to our western pennsylvania heritage as we continue to promote cross
                                                 functional operations we are better positioned to innovate and become leaders in
                                                 our industry

our commitment to sustainability positively affects our employees as well as the numerous communities and natural environments
where our daily operations take place as we streamline processes and promote efficient operating practices we also work hard to
help improve and sustain communities to minimize our environmental footprint and to deliver shareholder value innovative ideas
engagements with local communities and partnerships with collaborative environmental groups inspire and support our
sustainability efforts

we experienced significant change in 2016 through the strategic focused work of the entire eqt team despite facing pricing
challenges production sales volume was 26 higher than in 2015 we are very proud to have become a top five natural gas
producer  fourth in the united states and first in appalachia  in 2016 and have every intention to maintain that status far into the
future to that end our consolidation strategy has promoted sustainable growth through contiguous acreage acquisitions that
complement our existing footprint in fact in 2016 we increased our marcellus acreage position by acquiring approximately 145500
net acres these acquisitions will lead to more efficient economical and environmentally friendly development in southwestern
pennsylvania and northern west virginia



as we continue to promote crossfunctional operations we are better
positioned to innovate and become leaders in our industry

in march 2016 our appalachian basin operations received certification from the center for responsible shale development crsd
upon passing a rigorous evaluation and verification process  confirming that our appalachian operations are in conformance with
all 15 of crsds performance standards for air climate water and waste management finally we achieved our lowest
occupational safety  health administration recordable injury rate and lowest preventable vehicle accident rate in more than 10
years  reinforcing our commitment to safety and setting the bar high to maintain safe operations

looking forward we will remain committed to safety operational improvements and increased collaboration and transparency
while we continue to strategically expand we will incorporate lessons learned and best practices into new operations we are
excited to continue building bridges as we adapt and grow as a company on behalf of eqt thank you for the opportunity to share
our commitment as a responsible natural gas exploration production and transmission company with you

  about this report



key topics  boundary




our process
g418

early in 2017 eqt conducted a materiality assessment to strategically guide our sustainability reporting this assessment used the
global reporting initiative gri steps of identification prioritization and validation to define the environmental social and
governance topics most critical to the company and our external stakeholders throughout this report eqt uses the gri definition
of material to reference topics that reflect the companys significant economic environmental and social impacts or that
substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders eqt did not use the us securities and exchange
commissions concept of materiality within the context of this report

to first identify a universe of relevant topics we benchmarked peer reports regulatory and industry trends reporting frameworks
and other stakeholderrelated sources we prioritized these topics by conducting interviews with leaders of eqts business units and
functional groups as well as analyzing internal financial documents and peer investor community regulatory industry association
and media documents for evidence to support the relative importance of each topic a customized weighting process demonstrated
the importance of each source our corporate communications team validated the customized weighting and topics most critical for
eqt to manage and report

although we will continue to monitor and manage all topics raised through the assessment this report focuses on the 11 highest
ranking or material topics shown below plus the topics of climate strategy and technological innovation which we also believe
are important to our stakeholders

ethics  integrity at eqt




doing the right thing
g456

at eqt we believe that the maintenance and enhancement of our good reputation is dependent upon the conduct of each individual
employee we communicate our expectations for responsible and ethical conduct to all eqt employees and vendors through our
codes of business conduct and ethics  for eqt and eqmeqgp these codes act as guides and resources related to personal
responsibilities compliance with law and the use of good judgement while working on behalf of the company they cover such
topics as environment health and safety avoiding conflicts of interest communicating and cooperating with regulators and
investigations and honest and ethical dealing to ensure that our codes reflect the everchanging work environment and legal and
regulatory landscape we update them regularly in conjunction with subject matter experts senior management at eqt egqp and
eqm approve changes to the codes

we require all new employees to receive inperson compliance and ethics training during orientation in addition to an online training
regarding the codes of business conduct and ethics and other compliance and ethics topics appropriate for their work
responsibilities additionally all employees annually certify as to their continued understanding and compliance with our codes and
related policies

g457 g458

although our codes of business conduct and ethics provide strong guidance for our employees and vendors they cannot be all
inclusive to provide an additional resource for advice about ethical and lawful behavior we established the compliance network
which consists of seniorlevel employees from internal audit employee relations governance and enterprise risk and
environment and safety the compliance network also serves as a means for employees to report misconduct employees may
also report misconduct to their supervisor or through a nationally recognized independent service provider that hosts our 247 eqt
compliance hotline a third way for employees and stakeholders to express concerns is directly to the board of directors of eqt
eqgp and eqm via each organizations website we do not currently track the number of requests for advice the request
descriptions or level of satisfaction for those using the advice mechanisms

  generation intentional management of our positive impacts enables us to build strong relationships with our communities and lessen the united states reliance
  on foreign energy




our approach
g4dma

eqt tracks the indirect economic impacts of our business operations to better understand and communicate how our operations
positively contribute to the economy we annually commission an independent analysis of the direct and indirect economic impacts
of our activities on both local and us economies in 2016 fti consulting inc analyzed our yearend 2016 data and compiled the
results into a study entitled economic benefits of eqt corporations 2016 investment and operations activities

supporting national  local economies
as a domestic energy company eqt provides abundant easily accessible affordable natural gas to the united states lessening
the countrys reliance on other nations for energy this reduces overall energy prices and helps to increase national security

we also generate revenue for the communities and states where we live and work through job and wealth creation our operations
 all in the us  support local economies via taxes paid road infrastructure improvements local hiring of personnel and through
use and support of local service establishments we also provide millions of dollars in royalty payments to our mineral owners and
sustain local jobs for employees direct contractors and suppliers to support our daily operational activities

supporting local  diverse suppliers
our board of directors and management team support a strategic sourcing approach in which we seek out small and diverse local
suppliers whenever possible we consider diverse suppliers as those that are certified minority business enterprises mbe
womens business enterprises wbe or veteran owned businesses vob we identify these suppliers through collaboration with
regional and national councils such as the african american chamber of commerce of western pennsylvania and the national
minority supplier development council we also work with coalitions such as the womens business enterprise national council

further we encourage our top vendors to consider diverse subcontractors as it helps these businesses develop relevant experience
and expand business opportunities that may not be directly possible with eqt our targeted procurement initiatives include

   encouraging top suppliers to seek out and include diverse businesses as part of their proposed solution
   giving greater consideration to vendors who complete and submit a subcontracting document with their proposal identifying
   where and how they will utilize diverse vendors as part of the bidding process
   conducting meetings with our top contractors to provide supplier diversity education outline reporting requirements for
   subcontracting with diverse suppliers and identify specific products purchased by the top contractors to help align them with
   diverse firms selling those products
   tracking diverse vendor usage by asking our top contractors to provide their monthly spend with diverse subcontractors and local
   suppliers

we also work with our current local and diverse suppliers to identify opportunities to expand their scope of service this directly
boosts the local economy through job growth and business expansion

  climate strategy

  topic definition
  addressing current and potential regulations on greenhouse gas ghg emissions the increasing market demand for renewable energy sources and the
  potential impacts of the changing climate on eqts operations


  why managing it matters
  as the effects of climate change on our planet become increasingly apparent the potential for regulation and the demand for lowercarbon energy are
  increasing eqt must remain informed and proactive while upholding a responsibility to provide cleaner energy alternatives




our approach
g4dma

current legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions are in various phases
of discussion or implementation eqt keeps abreast of these measures to remain compliant and understand how they may affect
our operations for more information about climaterelated legislation and our company see pages 1718 in our 2016 form 10k

climate change policy
eqt is developing a policy on climate change strategy which will outline our position on climate change economic policies as more
regulations are adopted to moderate climate change eqt understands the benefits of developing a strategy to address the
ramifications of the regulations adopted the development of a climate change policy that addresses potential legislation will benefit
the company by ensuring both regulatory compliance and preparedness to meet future ghg emission requirements

emissions reduction
eqt strives to continuously improve equipment and operating systems in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which in turn
increases overall efficiency we work to improve our processes in response to and in advance of regulatory change  via emissions
reduction technologies  to minimize our impact on climate change quantifying and managing ghg emissions protects the
environment while also minimizing regulatory risk eqt is confident in its current air quality management however we must
continue to anticipate potential climate change regulations and be prepared for future compliance challenges for more information
on our processes and operational emissions see the technological innovation and energy  ghg emissions sections of this report

technological innovation




  technological innovation

  topic definition
  incorporating innovation into eqts business strategy to increase operational efficiencies and reduce costs in a safer and more environmentally conscious
  manner


  why managing it matters
  eqts commitment to innovation allows us to maintain our position as a leader in the use of advanced horizontal drilling technology  designed to minimize the
  impact of drillingrelated activities and reduce our overall environmental footprint




our approach
g4dma

our commitment to innovation enables eqt to adapt to the fluctuating commodity price of natural gas changes in the regulatory
environment and advances in technology innovation creates efficient costeffective processes that increase production and
improve the safety and environmental impact of our operations our dedication to technological innovation will help us maintain our
status as a top five natural gas producer in the united states

we strongly encourage innovation throughout the organization as it is fundamental to every aspect of our operations all employees
are assessed on eqts core competencies  including innovation  in formalized annual selfassessments

governance
in 2014 eqt established a formalized innovation group our senior managers of internal and external innovation lead their
respective innovation teams these leaders and their teams report to our corporate director of tax planning and innovation who in
turn reports directly to the eqt senior vice president and chief financial officer we evaluate and enhance our innovation program
based on feedback from our yearend employee surveys and we share the results of this survey as well as a yearend recap of the
program with eqts management team we will continue to expand the innovation program across the organization through 2017

innovation processes
we use two separate processes for our internal and external innovation management our specialized innovation management
software platform enables us to collect and analyze innovative ideas from employees any eqt employee or group of employees
can submit an idea through this platform to improve a process or apply a researched technology we route the ideas to a
governance committee for review then invite the employee or group to present a formal pitch of the idea and business plan if
accepted we use a standard stage gate process to pilot the innovation and implement it if successful this process empowers our
employees by providing a vehicle for them to contribute ideas

our external innovation group manages our external processes they assess and screen new technologies and startup service
companies that could prove useful in eqts operations we then take companies and technologies deemed valuable to the
appropriate internal business group for evaluation testing and eventual implementation into operations contingent on viability



innovation creates efficient costeffective processes that increase
production and improve the safety and environmental impact of our
operations

innovative thinking for solutions
coaches within the internal innovation group trained in design thinking lead sessions to help employees use alternative human
centered designoriented thinking and tools for solutions to identify problems we use these tools and innovative thinking skills
learned from our design coaches to address eqts impact on the communities in which we work each year we prioritize two or
three organizational opportunities and launch an innovation challenge to encourage employees to identify creative solutions we
choose teams with the best solutions to present to peers and the governance committee we invite all finalists to dine with the
executive team and the winning team receives a trophy eqt allocates specific funds and resources to advance the winning idea to
a pilotable solution




our performance
over the past two years winning ideas from the innovation challenge have focused on how to optimize returntopad drilling
reducing time from well staking to turninline and how eqt can operate more safely and efficiently in more densely populated
areas we evaluated the implementation of two ideas for safer urban drilling locations in 2016 which included

   a proposal to explore technology that might be implemented to reduce the audio footprint of our operations without impacting the
   operations themselves
   a datadriven social media strategy powered by cognitive computing technology to
      comb social media content for early identification of specific community concerns
      identify and assess threats from activist groups
      generate effective social media content to proactively engage stakeholders and dispel myths of detractors
      measure our social license to operate using community feedback


in 2016 we implemented 45 out of the 133 innovation ideas submitted

internal innovation ideas generated

                                                                                              2015                             2016

we began our external innovation program at the end of 2015 and evaluated only five external innovation opportunities  or
technologies relevant to the production business unit  that year in 2016 we evaluated 117 opportunities in 2017 we will begin
evaluating innovation submissions for our gathering and transmission operations going forward we hope to extend our tracking
beyond program participation and the number of ideas generated to capture total value created by these innovative project ideas

occupational health  safety




  occupational health  safety

  topic definition
  ensuring safe working conditions supplying personal protective equipment and providing resources to maintain and improve employees and contractors
  physical and emotional health


  why managing it matters
  our workers  employees and contractors alike  deserve to return home safely at the end of each day further safeguarding the health and welfare of eqts
  workers contributes to the success and longevity of the company




our approach
g4dma

safety is eqts number one priority and we are committed to achieving superior performance we will provide a safe and healthful
workplace for our employees and contractors and through continuous improvement will work to create and maintain a zeroinjury
culture we will not compromise safety to gain a business advantage

governance
g4la5


every worker  regardless of title or work responsibilities  has the
full authority and responsibility to stop any unsafe work activity

eqt conducts our active business operations in accordance with the applicable health and safety requirements established by the
us occupational safety and health administration osha and other regulatory bodies as we continue striving to improve we
work to integrate proper safety and health practices into the companys operations

the deputy general counsel environmental safety and public policy implements and manages our health and safety programs
eqt personnel conduct quarterly meetings with the companys executive safety council to review safety issues monitor trends
and provide direction to enhance overall performance

employees play a critical role in making sure that their coworkers return home safely each day as part of the companys overall
corporate social responsibility performance objective which is an annual metric all employees have an individual workplace safety
performance objective

further every worker  regardless of title or work responsibilities  has the full authority and responsibility to stop any unsafe work
activity

eqt encourages employees to communicate with management about issues or initiatives that could help improve overall
performance removing the need to establish formal joint managementemployee committees however some safety committees do
exist throughout the organization for example within the midstream business unit the field safety technician program enables
employees to take greater ownership of their own personal safety as well as demonstrate safety leadership to coworkers the
program also enables employees to identify and prevent situations that could cause harm to themselves or those around them

environment health  safety policy
to emphasize the importance of occupational health and safety eqts environment health and safety ehs policy underscores
the principles that will guide us toward superior ehs performance health and safety highlights from our policy include

   eqt will provide and foster leadership to ensure all employees and contractors understand their responsibilities and that all
   employees are provided with the training and support necessary to integrate ehs principles into their work
   we will manage our business to prevent incidents that could result in harm to people communities property or the environment
   we will commit the resources necessary for successful implementation of our ehs policy


safety training
g4la8

training risk mitigation and performance monitoring form the core of eqts workplace safety initiatives since eqt does not have
any agreements with trade unions no formal labor agreements define specific health and safety training topics instead every eqt
employee receives core safety training annually along with more frequent specialized training tailored to the work performed and the
types of issues faced eqt customizes specialized training subjects and delivery methods as needed for example monthly safety
meetings held with field employees cover issues such as

   personal protective equipment
  stop work authority
  incident investigation
  safe driving
  industry specific technical safety training

contractor safety
our safety focus includes the numerous contract workers who perform work at eqt  both in the field and in the office to ensure
that our job sites remain safe every company providing contract workers must mirror eqts commitment to safety we expect each
contractor and its subcontractors and agents to adhere to eqts relevant policies as well as all applicable laws and regulatory
requirements for health safety employment and other human rights as established for employers operating within the united
states

eqt relies on isnetworld  an industry recognized platform for monitoring safety metrics and performance  to prequalify
contractors before they obtain authorization to begin work for eqt the isnetworld database provides vital information regarding
a contractors performance in the following key areas

   safety management systems
   injury and illness statistics
   department of transportation dot inspection compliance
   dot motor carrier safety rating
   written safety programs and safety training
   experience modification rating
   fatality history

a contractor expecting to perform services in drilling construction maintenance or other operationrelated activities must pass the
prequalification process and must agree to adhere to eqts contractor safety standard and safe work rules these safety
requirements apply to all work performed by the contractors employees and the employees of their subcontractors or agents
existing contractors who fail to meet the rules and standards cannot continue to work on an eqt job site

we deeply regret that an employee of one of eqts contractors was fatally injured during a onevehicle public highway incident in
2016 this incident was thoroughly investigated and eqt is aggressively pursuing steps to prevent a similar incident

in 2017 eqt plans to refine its contractor safety management program to facilitate improved contractor safety incident performance

   track contractor safety statistic incident rates injury and preventable vehicle accidents in addition to the review of the self
   reported information provided by contractors in the isnetworld database
   incorporate a contractor safety auditing process within eqts contractor safety qualification program




our performance
g4la6

eqt closely monitors our health and safety performance challenges and statistics to ensure safe worksites proper employee
training and motivation to work safely and the continuous identification and evaluation of opportunities to improve

when a safety incident does occur eqt records the nature of the event as prescribed by the osha injuryillness recordkeeping
guidelines after each incident we also conduct a thorough incident review with senior management to clarify possible causes
identify options to prevent recurrences and highlight opportunities to improve training processes and procedures

during 2016 the most frequently recorded injury and incident types involved employees working outdoors insect bites sliptripfall
incidents and struckby incidents such as hand tool use were the most commonly observed incidents with expanded training risk
assessment and other preventive measures eqt experienced a decline in osharecordable incidents restricted duty incidents
losttime accidents and preventable vehicle accidents in 2016 as part of our continuous improvement efforts refinement of the
training and incident management programs is helping to guide eqt towards ongoing sustainable incident improvement for
example the rate of company vehicles striking stationary objects declined significantly after we implemented mandatory supervisor
observations of new and experienced drivers with this new practice in place the rate remained fairly constant increasing only
slightly in 2016

local communities




  local communities

  topic definition
  managing impacts on and relations with the communities in which eqt operates including addressing resettlement issues transportation of materials and
  impacts on roads noise pollution and community complaints or concerns


  why managing it matters
  local communities continue to be essential to the success and longterm growth of eqts business operations our operations can and do affect nearby
  communities so it is important that eqt conduct operations with the support trust and cooperation of our local communities




our approach
g4dma

eqt values the communities where we operate and we focus on three areas to support and engage with them managing our
impacts various forms of investment and upholding a positive reputation as eqt strives to grow responsibly we work to build trust
by sharing information associated with our current planned and proposed operations through public engagement education
corporate giving and volunteerism we are better able to uphold our reputation as a responsible natural gas company and operate in
a manner that is conducive to the needs and addresses the concerns of our local communities and governments

addressing local community concerns  public perceptions
g4so2

the traffic road impacts noise dust and lights associated with eqts operations can evoke community concern to better
understand these concerns our local government and community affairs specialists  regionally based eqt employees  are
responsible for establishing and maintaining relationships with civic organizations elected officials emergency response personnel
business owners residents and other local stakeholders these specialists work closely with eqts land permitting construction
and legal departments among others to report concerns and engagement outcomes the group headed by the manager of local
government and community affairs is part of the government affairs team which ultimately reports to the general counsel

we use our awareness of community concerns to establish policies and procedures designed to minimize or eliminate most
operational issues before they become disputes for example during the past two years we evaluated issues and concerns related
to how our operations might affect nearby residents and businesses in more densely populated areas we also collaborate with
counties affected by truck traffic and associated road impacts from eqt operations to mitigate the burden on local economies

eqt maintains an internal database that tracks all concerns raised via the local government and community affairs specialists and
includes elements from identification through resolution the database enables eqt to avoid issue recurrence by assessing lessons
learned annually we analyze the results to identify trends in performance benchmark against previous data and help determine
any required procedural changes we also conduct an annual survey targeted to local elected officials and community leaders to
gauge performance and reputation

our conscious efforts to understand and work with local communities support our desire to expand responsibly and develop positive
relationships and reputation with our communities we strive to improve the publics perception of our company as well as of the
natural gas industry our local government and community affairs specialists protect and maintain eqts corporate reputation by

   gathering information to help eqt identify local concerns before they inconvenience neighbors
   advocating for the community by ensuring that issues or concerns are addressed at the appropriate level within the company and
   ultimately achieve resolution
   acting as a conduit for suggesting ways to strengthen eqts processes and procedures
   providing a local point of contact for residents to learn about current or future projects and how they may affect their communities
   building relationships prior to the start of activity in new areas


evaluating development opportunities
eqt continues to evaluate issues andor concerns related to our natural gas development opportunities before commencing
activities in an area we work closely with our land permitting and construction departments to review activity in similar locations
and evaluate direct stakeholder feedback as part of our preconstruction planning eqt utilizes criteria to help determine potential
mitigation and in some cases can even eliminate the site from development consideration

criteria include determining

   distance from schools places of worship shopping centers and other public gathering spaces
   existing condition of roads leading to the proposed site
   existing competitor projects near the site that might be sharing the same roads and community resources
   local political climate including ordinances restricting drilling activity or organized opposition from neighbors

we will work to continuously improve these processes considering feedback and effectiveness through all stages of engagement
as an element of continuous improvement and with a desire to expand business operations in a responsible manner eqt will
continue to consider stakeholder needs and concerns as we further refine our approaches to local community engagement

giving back to our communities
eqt and the eqt foundation  a separate 501c3 organization  support our communities through their local giving and
philanthropic efforts charitable contributions from both eqt and the eqt foundation are restricted to organizations primarily within
those communities near eqts active operations

all corporate donations to local communities are approved at the corporate director level by leaders of the corporate
communication andor government affairs teams a routine review and preapproval process is followed in an effort to avoid support
of illegal or otherwise inappropriate activities and the appearance of impropriety that could arise if contributions were made to
individuals or local authorities with decisionmaking responsibilities regarding eqts current or future operations eqt donations
support a variety of organizations ranging from small local nonprofits to municipalities seeking additional support for community
projects that exceed their budgets other types of corporate support include sponsorships of county fairs community festivals and
other local events through our support we can bond with our neighbors enhance the quality for life for residents educate residents
about our company and provide an opportunity for our fellow community members to meet eqt employees

the eqt foundation also provides funding for communities in and near eqts operating areas eqt foundations executive
operating committee reviews all grant applications which applications must be submitted by a nonprofit organization and comply
with us laws and regulations applicable to corporate foundations and provides a funding recommendation regarding each request
to the eqt foundations board of directors the eqt foundation board of directors approves all funding decisions in 2016 the
eqt foundation supported local programming in four main funding priority areas

   arts  culture
   community  economic development
   education
   environment

the foundation periodically adjusts its funding priorities to ensure that its funding strategy matches the evolving needs of the
communities where eqt and our affiliates operate

  political involvement  public policy

  topic definition
  engaging in political activity providing corporate contributions to political candidates and organizations and contributing to public policy


  why managing it matters
  eqt serves as an informed resource to policymakers on issues directly affecting the activities of eqt and those of the natural gas industry in general this
  engagement supports fair and balanced laws and regulations that benefit all of eqts stakeholders




our approach
g4dma

to benefit local communities and protect the interests of eqt we engage with state and local politicians regarding issues that affect
our operations and communities our expertise in natural gas production and transportation enables us to have meaningful
discussions around energy policy we disclose our political engagement activities on our website to support transparency for our
stakeholders

governance
eqt conducts our public policy activities in compliance with local state and federal laws and in addition the eqt public policy and
corporate responsibility ppcr committee of the eqt board of directors periodically reviews these activities the ppcr
committee reviews and receives reports regarding the approach eqt takes with respect to matters of public policy including
corporate political spending diversity environment health and safety and energy policy eqt has internal policies that help manage
our interactions with regulatory agencies and elected officials and that require among other things that no employee engage in
lobbying activity on behalf of eqt nor use corporate treasury dollars for political purposes without permission from our corporate
director of government affairs or general counsel annually the ppcr committee reviews all contributions made to political
candidates and discusses public policy issues that affect the company

political spending  policy issues
eqt complies with laws and regulations in every operational jurisdiction where we plan to strategically spend on political
contributions this includes federal and state campaign finance laws regarding political spending in support of political parties
politicians and related institutions we do not engage in political activity or make financial or inkind contributions to political parties
politicians or related institutions outside the united states we fund our political spending through

   eqt employees federal political action committee pac sourced solely from the voluntary contributions of eqt employees

   federal pac
   eqt corporate treasury dollars

we also work to support federal state and local policies that promote stable investment climates for natural gas exploration
production storage and transportation these may include policies governing environmental protection taxes natural gas
production and transportation and expanding the use of natural gas in sectors such as transportation manufacturing and electricity
generation when engaging with policymakers we consider the impacts to eqt our stakeholders communities and the

  public safety  emergency preparedness

  topic definition
  ensuring the health and safety of the communities in which eqt operates through careful well and pipeline construction production activity and lifecycle impact
  assessments anticipating and having programs in place for crisis or emergency situations


  why managing it matters
  safety is a number one priority at eqt and we will not compromise on this to gain a business advantage our communities rely on our maintenance of well and
  pipeline integrity employee safety training and regular communications to minimize safety incidents




our approach
g4dma

in addition to eqts commitment to provide a safe and healthful workplace for our employees and contractors see occupational
health  safety for information we maintain and operate equipment responsibly to create a safe environment in the communities
where we operate this includes providing safety awareness and emergency response protocols to communities establishing well
and pipeline designs and processes that prioritize safety managing traffic and providing safe driver training our formal
environment health and safety policy updated in april 2017 outlines safety procedures for our employees and contractors

pipeline safety
it is important that community members where eqt operates know that we operate with their safety in mind therefore we have
established safety protocols procedures and processes that we review as needed the careful design construction and operation
of wells and pipelines is essential in protecting our communities when designing constructing and operating natural gas pipelines
and facilities we integrate preventive measures to ensure employee resident and community safety along the entire pipeline route
we carefully design the pipelines that transport natural gas from the well to the marketplace and maintain them regularly prioritizing
public safety and environmental protection we meet or exceed safety standards and practices through




design

   comply with local state and federal regulations
   design facilities consistent with industry standards and best practices
   optimize routes to avoid sensitive areas

construction

   inspect construction activities to verify safe and proper installation measures
   test pipelines prior to placing them inservice to certify integrity
   examine welds to ensure safety

operations

   monitor control and analyze natural gas flow via 247 gas control center
   mitigate corrosion through maintenance of cathodic protection systems fluid sampling and flow control
   maintain rightsofway for aerial patrols and routine onsite inspections
   sustain comprehensive operating and maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of the assets and minimize the potential for
   thirdparty damage

integrity management

   identify highconsequence areas along the transmission lines based on population and landbuilding use
   create a risk model that prioritizes the high consequence areas for integrity assessment
   complete specific evaluations such as corrosion investigations and pressure testing to assure integrity of the pipelines

security

   provide onsite security through electronic monitoring fences buildings locks and surveillance

community awareness

   mail safety brochure annually to residents and businesses located near pipelines
   participate in annual meetings for first responders and excavators to provide pipeline safety information
   promote national 811  call before you dig program to prevent accidents
   participate in and sponsor pa 811 safety day

we dedicate resources to adhere to gas transmission pipeline integrity federal regulations subpart o as well as other public safety
assessments such as pipeline assessments excavations and material testing these additional elements  although not federally
required  contribute to ongoing safe operations in 2016 we spent approximately 2 million on pipeline safety initatives through
these established routines and regulations we limit the likelihood of pipeline incidents and protect our workers and communities

public safety awareness
eqt understands that our operations can affect the communities in which we operate we uphold safety as our number one priority
by regularly communicating with our communities to increase awareness of our activities and address potential safety concerns we
work closely with emergency response personnel public works employees elected officials school districts and other key
community members to engage them in the process educate and learn from them and build relationships

most often the awareness and subsequent conversations surround

   identification of the activity occurring at a local job site
   the types of equipment being used
   the most appropriate response for various scenarios
   eqts emergency or crisis response plan

through these interactions eqt and our communities are more prepared to jointly respond to safetyrelated incidents if they
happen local officials and first responders become familiar with eqts operations and feel more comfortable contacting eqt should
an incident occur our conversations educate them on what they should and should not do to help eqt resolve an incident quickly
and safely in addition to streamlining the response process to a potential safety incident these engagements build trust and
establish lasting relationships

road safety
a common local community concern is the impact of increased vehicle traffic on municipal roads from our operational vehicles over
the years we established routines and trainings to mitigate these concerns and reduce safety incidents when designing
construction routes to job sites we carefully consider the locations of schools recreation areas and heavily populated regions we
base all our initial route considerations on safety which can necessitate longer drives on local roads used by residents often route
options are limited to reach a site so we work with local governments and school districts to maximize the communitys safety and
protection we curtail traffic on roads traveled by school buses and place custom signs along our active truck routes alerting our
drivers and contractors that truck travel is prohibited during school bus pick up and drop off times these signs also alert the
community to slow down and watch for children

vehicle safety is included in both our employee and contractor safety expectations at all established marcellus and utica job sites
we develop a mandated traffic control plan which we distribute to employees contractors and subcontractors these plans outline
our specified speed limits curfews and route restrictions we actively monitor compliance with our traffic control plans and take
prompt action to address reported violations we utilize private road monitors with law enforcement backgrounds to continuously
surveil our truck traffic once construction begins the road monitors use radarequipped vehicles and take necessary corrective
action if eqtrelated traffic creates unsafe driving conditions they also investigate community complaints regarding any violations
from employees or contractors to ensure contractor accountability we may require contractor vehicles to have gps systems in their
vehicles so we can access their data

our safe driving leadership team consisting of representatives from human resources and business unit leaders developed
policies that uphold the safety of our employees and local communities eqt acts to limit vehiclerelated accidents by requiring
employees assigned to a company vehicle to complete a comprehensive set of driver training programs and procedures regarding
potential hazards and how to avoid them during orientation employees learn how to operate a vehicle safely how to be aware of
common road hazards and the best methods to avoid the most common types of accidents both new and experienced drivers must
demonstrate their safe driving skills through a periodic supervisor observation session upon passing new employees undergo a
series of computerbased training programs and behindthewheel training including a defensive driving module we provide
additional instruction for those employees operating specialty vehicles or haul trailers performing offroad travel or driving
construction vehicles on public roads one such course is a us department of transportation training enabling drivers to cross
state lines and remain in compliance

in combination our safety routines traffic control plans and trainings limit safety incidents and help us respond to the needs and
concerns of the communities where eqt operates

  topic definition
  minimizing water use increasing use of recycled water and protecting local water sources


  why managing it matters
  todays natural gas production process is sophisticated and relies on water for its innovative procedures eqt must meet stringent regulatory safeguards to
  protect water resources and ensure that production activities have no significant lasting negative effects




our approach
g4dma

natural gas development activities are water intensive understanding this eqt is dedicated to protecting fresh water by operating
responsibly we employ water use measurement and monitoring controls to minimize our impact to nearby water or other natural
resources and we comply with local state and federal laws governing the monitoring and withdrawal of fresh water

governance
eqts environmental department led by our corporate director environmental affairs is responsible for the oversight and
management of all aspects of our environmental footprint this department reports to the deputy general counsel environmental
safety and public policy and is ultimately guided by the companys executive environmental council each quarter we share
environmental progress including water withdrawals and any violations with our public policy and corporate responsibility
committee additionally regulatory agencies in pennsylvania ohio texas and west virginia receive quarterly reports regarding
eqts water usage

hydraulic fracturing
to increase the productivity of shale formations natural gas extraction relies on the process of hydraulic fracturing which is the use
of fluid to create pressure to crack shale formations underground that release the natural gas this fracturing fluid is composed of
significant amounts of water mixed with sand and a small percentage of chemical additives to reduce the likelihood of groundwater
or aquifer contamination our wells have multiple layers of steel and cement  a process known as triple casing

further demonstrating our commitment to protecting water resources eqt is proud of being a charter participant of fracfocus an
independent educational website created by the ground water protection council and the interstate oil and gas compact
commission through fracfocus eqt regularly updates our public disclosure of the chemicals added to our hydraulic fracturing
fluid for each site additionally we continuously explore safer or more environmentally friendly alternatives for our fluids we do not
use diesel additives in our fracturing fluid and significantly reduced the amount of other chemicals over the past few years for
example we replaced traditional biocides with nonchemical alternatives to demonstrate our commitment to protecting water quality

we strive to protect the fresh water in our communities by complying with applicable regulatory requirements investing in new
technology leveraging best industry practices reusing water whenever possible and disclosing the chemical makeup of our
fracturing fluid

water sources

eqt complies with individual state regulations and limits regarding water withdrawal and wastewater see effluents  waste for
additional information our water withdrawal in 2016 did not significantly affect any water sources eqt uses the following
definitions to describe water usage

 water withdrawal                                     recycled water                                          water intensity

 the water obtained from sources such as lakes       the water that is reused by eqts operations this      the ratio of water consumed in cubic meters or
 rivers reservoirs or municipal spigotshydrants   includes flowback drilling water and produced water   m3  to barrels of oil equivalent per day boe
                                                      collected from drilling operations                     produced by the company this metric normalizes
                                                                                                              freshwater withdrawal


our primary sources of fresh water are surface and municipal water this held true in 2016 eqts freshwater withdrawal varies each
year due to




   the location and seasonal availability of fresh water may not match the location and timing of drilling and completions activity
   the completion of more hydraulically fractured wells results in greater total water usage

the use of longer laterals  the horizontal portion of the well  requires more water for each completion while at the same time
reduces the number of drilling pads which minimizes surface disturbance in 2016 we increased our usage of wastewater from
recycling plants and other producers which enabled us to decrease our groundwater use by 141589 cubic meters and increase
wastewater use by 74487 cubic meters

rainwater continues to have a minimal effect on eqts water usage many of our water storage facilities and pits passively collect
rainwater for use in our operations however accurately measuring total usage is difficult due to low volumes and other variables

energy  ghg emissions




  energy  ghg emissions

  topic definition
  carefully managing methane and other greenhouse gas ghg emissions from operations and promoting energy conservation and the use of renewable clean
  energy throughout operations


  why managing it matters
  slowing climate change is a global concern however eqts ability to find ways to reduce energy consumption in the office on the job site and on the road has
  a positive impact on the environment our employees and our bottom line




our approach
g4dma

eqts greenhouse gas ghg emissions and energy consumption originate from three sources  facilities transportation and
operations we drive continuous improvement and seek innovative ways to conserve energy reduce our emissions and lessen our
footprint in these three areas

facilities
we track energy consumption in eqts owned and leased facilities on a regular basis we work to improve energy efficiency at our
leased facilities via preventative maintenance and equipment upgrades such as motion sensor lighting energyefficiency fixtures
temperature controls and weekend power down displays for computers at owned facilities we seek to increase efficiencies by
making capital improvements to permanent building controls such as boilers thermostats and lighting systems

eqts facilities use electricity primarily generated by coal natural gas and nuclear power in 2016 our total energy consumption
across facilities was 51569 gj an 8 increase from 2015 the increased consumption was partially the result of 14 more cooling
days  days that required extra energy to cool buildings  as compared yearoveryear more than half of eqts total energy
consumption is derived from the use of electricity which powers lighting cooling computers audiovideo and other support
equipment

in 2016 our direct energy usage totaled 19460 gj and was primarily generated by natural gas our consumption of direct energy
increased in 2016 due to increased occupancy levels at eqt facilities and the corresponding increase in heating and cooling needs

transportation
eqt has operations in multiple states requiring us to rely upon trucks and other fleet vehicles for the transportation of workers and
materials to job sites eqt vehicles drive millions of miles annually therefore we actively pursue efficient cleanerburning
alternatives to carbon rich fuels such as compressed natural gas cng we significantly reduced our overall emissions through the
increased use of cng in our fleet vehicles since 2012 using cng our total fleet emissions remain consistent despite increased
vehicle count in addition we continue to identify ways to reduce our total number of fleet vehicles overall

operations
eqts operational greenhouse gas air emissions vary greatly depending on the type and amount of field activity occurring yearto
year we monitor and report on air emissions relevant to our business operations as well as those required by state and federal
regulations and seek continuous improvement capabilities in areas that provide the most opportunity for ghg reductions we gather
operational data and calculate emissions annually to comply with the emissions inventory requirements of each state where we have
operations

eqt emissions data is based on stack test data manufacturers data andor us environmental protection agency epa
published emission factors eqt has no biogenic co2 emissions to report all data in this report reflects required air emissions
inventory submittals and includes all eqt production eqt gathering and eqt transmission operations eqt does not measure or
report air stack and fugitive emissions for persistent organic pollutants we have no plans to measure or report this data in the
future as there is no business or regulatory reason to do so eqt also does not maintain records of equity basis emissions or track
indirect greenhouse gas emissions from outside the company scopes 2 and 3

eqts levels or amount of operational activity largely influence reported emissions thus fluctuating with increases or decreases in
drilling and completions additionally changes in reporting requirements may also cause reported emissions to appear higherlower

  biodiversity  ecosystem health

  topic definition
  using land management systems to reduce the likelihood of land contamination and protect soil quality biodiversity animal welfare and habitats including
  during reclamation and decommissioning


  why managing it matters
  with approximately 36 million gross acres owned or leased land plays a huge role in eqts daily activities exploration production gathering and
  transmission activity all impact the surrounding landscapeincluding areas with high biodiversity value




our approach
g4dma

eqt actively works to minimize our impact on the land and wildlife where we operate both because it is the right thing to do and
because we understand that our reputation depends on it our daily activities including exploration production gathering and
transmission of natural gas inevitably alter the land to some degree and we create plans from which we make careful decisions to
minimize this impact

once operations are complete at a site we work with property owners to restore their land  as closely as possible  to its original
condition we reestablish contours and revegetate with stateapproved seed mixes native seed mixes andor vegetation requested
by landowners these techniques support local flora and fauna by allowing wildlife movement restoration of preexisting habitat and
prevention of invasive species eqt works with landowners to successfully accommodate their preference for returning their land to
its preconstruction condition all while meeting the regulatory requirements set forth by the state this enables us to maintain
positive relationships with landowners and communities while supporting biodiversity and habitat protection

governance
eqts environmental department led by our corporate director environmental affairs is responsible for the oversight and
management of all aspects of our environmental footprint this department reports to the deputy general counsel of environmental
safety and public policy and is ultimately guided by the companys executive environmental council

we assess and monitor 100 of our business segment operations 
production gathering and transmission  for biodiversity risks

we do not drill on legally protected lands in our owned or leased properties these include wetlands federal lands and national
parks when drilling on land adjacent to protected areas we leverage our horizontal drilling expertise to extract natural gas from
underground without disturbing the surface or any species native to the area additionally we use horizontal drilling techniques to
drill multiple gas wells from one pad avoiding the need to disturb multiple land areas




prior to operations in any area we conduct studies to determine whether endangered species exist in that region we also use
various domestic environmental registries to identify potential impacts to threatened endangered and special concern species or
resources near possible areas of operation we make it a priority to avoid disturbing these species and habitats but if this is not
possible we work with appropriate state agencies to develop and execute protection plans

eqt also conducts thorough environmental surveys prior to constructing new pipelines across our operating area an integral
element of the routing process these surveys include many levels of study that provide invaluable information on the region eqt is
committed to building pipelines in a safe environmentally responsible manner therefore we conduct these surveys to identify and
protect our natural resources indigenous species and cultural and historic resources eqt strives to restore the land to as near its
original condition as possible

eqts most prevalent byproducts from the drilling process are wastewater from hydraulic fracturing see water for more
information and solid wastes such as drill mud and cuttings we pursue various strategies to recycle or reuse water and are
committed to identifying safe waste disposal methods that reduce ecological impact and organizational costs additionally to ensure
the safety and health of our workers communities and environment we abide by policies and procedures designed to minimize and
mitigate liquid spills and releases

governance
eqts corporate director of environmental affairs heads our environmental department which oversees and manages all aspects
of our environmental footprint this department reports to the deputy general counsel of environmental safety and public policy
and is ultimately guided by the executive environmental council each quarter we share environmental progress with our public
policy and corporate responsibility committee additionally regulatory agencies in pennsylvania ohio texas and west virginia
receive quarterly reports on eqts water usage as required we submit chemical analysis of residual waste reports to the
pennsylvania department of environmental protection annually to satisfy regulatory waste reporting requirements for the state

wastewater  solid waste
eqt tracks all waste to landfill waste from routine operations and waste from nonroutine activities on a projectbyproject basis as
these are our most significant waste streams examples of nonroutine operations may include spill cleanup equipment
decontamination and pipeline cleaning

for our appalachian basin operations eqt follows the center for responsible shale development crsd performance standards
including maximizing water recycling to decrease wastewater volumes safe wastewater disposal and effluent monitoring we
recycle wastewater after the completion of a well by collecting flowback drilling and produced water to reuse when fracturing new
wells we do not permit the discharge of any produced water to surface water and dispose of water that is no longer suitable for
recycling at state and federalpermitted facilities eqts appalachian basin operations received full certification from the crsd in
2016 we are the fourth of the founding members to meet or exceed all 15 crsd performance standards of environmental
stewardship and continuous improvement for air and water protection

eqts drill mud and cuttings are processed using solids control equipment that efficiently separates the drilling fluids from the solids
drying agents then remove any residual moisture and the dried cuttings are containerized and trucked to landfills that are pre
approved to accept these solids in their permitted disposal cells eqt continues to improve the efficiency of its solids management
program by using higher efficiency systems that create better separation of drilling fluid and drill cuttings reducing the overall weight
of the disposed product using more effective drying agents decreases the amount of these agents needed which also decreases
the weight of the disposed product



while disposal methods for our solid waste vary we always seek the
most efficient responsible and costeffective methods possible

while disposal methods for our solid waste vary we always seek the most efficient responsible and costeffective methods
possible our priority is to reuse or recycle but we also use landfills deep well injection or other approved methods when
appropriate in doing so we comply with all regulatory requirements for the state or region including de minimis thresholds for waste
reporting

spill prevention  management
to reduce the likelihood and impact of significant spills we maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure spcc plans
for every worksite that stores fluid these comprehensive plans based on regulation established by the united states environmental
protection agency epa guide our employees and contractors to minimize the chance for a release and dictate the actions required
should a spill occur the plans define training programs inspection protocols secondary containment monitoring and repair
programs required at each of our natural gas wells and compressor stations

if an incident occurs our typical emergency response and preparedness program outlines the following steps to take

   determine the source and type of spill and begin taking corrective action
   evacuate any employees requiring medical attention
   isolate the area and stop the spill as soon as possible using appropriate methods
   contain the spill with available resources including containment ditches diking and spill kits complete with absorbent booms
   pads pillows and personal protective equipment eqt does not use chemical dispersants
   notify the immediate supervisor or area manager and the environmental coordinator of all spills and complete an environmental
   incident investigation form
   perform or observe proper cleanup measures as directed by the environmental coordinator

in the event of a spill eqt uses appropriate cleanup techniques to mitigate its effects including removal of effluents from soil
we promptly remove and dispose of cleanup materials according to prevailing federal state and local regulatory requirements
minimizing impact on the environment and local community we then evaluate the cause of the spill to identify and implement
corrective action we work to prevent repeat accidents by integrating improved techniques and protocols into design standards
operations and future spill prevention plans we share these with employees and contractors to continuously improve our operations

eqt does not discharge any produced water to surface water therefore no strategies or criteria are necessary for disposal and
treatment no report standards for produced water quality are required and eqt has no volumes of hydrocarbon discharged in
produced water to report

  air quality

  topic definition
  managing and minimizing air emissions vocs nitrogen oxides etc across eqts value chain


  why managing it matters
  our operational emissions can affect local air quality in the areas where we operate a compliant emissions record enables eqt to maintain a positive
  reputation with local communities and regulators which can streamline permitting for new facilities




our approach
g4dma

eqt monitors our operational air emissions to comply with relevant regulations eqt implemented an environmental management
system ems that collects data for every station and calculates emissions based on monthly data and we seek to continuously
improve our processes and procedures inventories of such data tracking are generally required by each individual permit and in
some cases we have actively tracked inventories dating back to 1991

governance
eqts environmental department led by our corporate director environmental affairs is responsible for the oversight and
management of all aspects of our environmental footprint this department reports to the deputy general counsel of environmental
safety and public policy and is ultimately guided by the companys executive environmental council within the environmental
department within this department the air quality team is responsible for air quality permitting and reporting we report
environmental progress  including emissions reports notices of violations and obtained permits  to the eqt public policy and
corporate responsibility committee several times a year

permits  monitoring
eqt must obtain operational permits including air quality permits prior to construction and operation in new locations a strong air
quality compliance record can streamline this process once obtained our operations group reviews the permit and notes any future
compliance responsibilities we communicate the requirements to our field workers to ensure appropriate data is collected and
uploaded into our ems which tracks our emissions obligations limits and air quality requirements our environmental department
reviews the system monthly and identifies improvement processes for tracking and inputting information on an ongoing basis

compliance personnel in each state inspect our work site locations regularly including compressor stations and drilling sites to
evaluate air quality compliance they also meet with state regulators to ensure we are aligned to state air quality regulations and we
conduct periodic leak detection and repair we benchmark our air emissions against our peers to identify potential improvement
areas and evaluate what drives internal emissions across our operating regions

audits  reporting
third party audits occur annually for a random selection of operating facilities including compressor stations and well pad locations
every facility receives a multimedia safety or environmental audit within a fiveyear period our environmental group also conducts
internal inspections on our facilities and sites our corporate auditing group periodically selects internal programs or processes to
audit which often includes environmental process auditing such as data collection of air emissions we submit emissions reports
annually to the state in which the facility or site operates and send overview reports to the us environmental protection agency




our performance
g4en21

we strive to maintain 100 facility compliance with all permit requirements and emissions limitations and we review any operational
incidents and notices of violation
