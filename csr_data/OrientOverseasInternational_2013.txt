     stakeholder engagement




         our engagement

         the benefits of stakeholder engagement are tremendous for our business as it helps us identify the key issues that should be
         addressed and prioritised towards the shaping of our corporate sustainable development strategies over the years we
         engaged with a wide spectrum of stakeholders through a variety of pathways tackling climate change and improving fuel
         efficiency we will continue to reinforce our stakeholder engagement process and communication with them regarding our
         sustainable development initiatives going forward the following are some specific areas on our agenda for 2013


               participating in the voluntary speed reduction program to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions


               participating in the fuel switching schemes to lower sulphur emissions


               supporting the academic community in oceanographic research


               collaborating with industry bodies and environmentfocused organisations on responsible business practices


               sharing of our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas ghg emissions data in a credible and transparent manner


               offering the oocl carbon calculator for customers to estimate the carbon footprint in their supply chain


               adopting high energy efficient vessels equipment and machineries


               monitoring of responsible sourcing practices from our suppliers


               enhancing environmental performance indicators for all global business units


               studying feasible initiatives and technologies in our operations to address climate change


               working with the environmentalfocus organizations to improve the carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxides calculation methodologies


               employing the external checker to verify the major environmental data disclosure


          the emissions of six main greenhouse gases ghg are addressed by the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc namely

         carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and sulphur hexafluoride sf6

         one way that we can burn less fuel is by maintaining the
         optimum trim and minimise the use of ballast an                   container shipping is the most environmentally sound
         optimum trim is the balance of cargo on board a vessel             way to transport large volume of goods across the
         and if the load is too heavy at one end the imbalance can         world most of the worlds manufactured goods and
         result in more fuel being used to sail hence we devise           products travel by container ship and when this
         and implement sophisticated cargo loading plans to                 startling fact is considered the relative impact upon
         achieve the optimum trim                                          the environment is low in comparison to other modes
                                                                            of transport
         moreover the minimal use of ballast water can also help
         achieve a lighter vessel load and better trim of ship              for example for every kilometre that a container ship
         draughts by good stowage thereby burning less fuel
                                                                            carries a ton of cargo it is far more energy efficient

         oocl adopts extended speed reduction

         since 2005 oocl adopted the voluntary speed reduction
         program at the port of long beach and the port of los
         angeles to help reduce emissions when sailing into port                                                      20 nautical
         initially the speed reduction program encouraged vessels                                                     miles
         to reduce their speed within 20 nautical miles of the ports
         and subsequently the revised program extended the                                        40 nautical
         radius to a 40 nautical miles zone oocl had adopted the                                 miles

         the qualship 21 program is an initiative that has been
         implemented by the united states coast guard since 2001
         its aim is to recognise highquality vessels and provide
         them with the incentive to maintain best practices in
         vessel operations and management


         this program also has one of the most rigid safety and
         antipollution standards in the world for nonus flagged
         vessels for example an eligible vessel is required to be a
         nonus flagged vessel with no embracement of
         substandard vessel detentions marine violations andor
         serious marine casualties in the us within the past 36
         months once qualified each vessel must pass the us
         port state control safety exam within the previous 12
         months


         to maintain the highest safety security and
         environmental standards oocls policy is to ensure that             the basic premise of the atlantic merchant vessel

         hong kong voluntary observing ships scheme


         under the voluntary observing ships scheme by the hong
         kong observatory hko our ship officers would make
         regular weather observations and report the conditions to
         the hko for analysis


         these observations can provide vital information about the
         weather conditions at sea and are particularly important
         for the timely preparation of warnings of hazardous
         weather to highly populated areas


         there are over 30 oocl vessels participating in this
         voluntary scheme
