how did the political and
economic turmoil in brazil
affect the company
strictly speaking we must make an observa
tion for the first time in our history corrup
tion is being addressed now we dont have
a scenario where everything else is bad and
you are doing fine to a certain extent when
the country is unstable the exchange rate
rises and favors exporting companies such
as ours but this is within very narrow limits

since a situation of economic downturn
aggravated by corruption scandals causes            forests protect and
an enormous disaster in terms of reliability in
brazil                                                regulate rainfall

reaffirmed our position as the worlds largest
pulp producer at an extremely delicate time       environment favoring
for investment in the country we retained
our investment grade and kept the horizonte         biodiversity and food

limit of indebtedness the company has the
necessary cash to honor its commitments up
to 2018 we have a very competitive cost
of capital resulting from recognition of the

origins has established a conservative and
responsible management supported by
good governance policies transparency and

order to help them avoid or minimize water
shortage this includes analysis of the type
of water withdrawal and use in their lands
tips for reducing consumption simple and
lowcost irrigation and recycling techniques

the objective is to strengthen the dialogue
and promote integrated action in these loca

use by eucalyptus forests in the watersheds
fibria intends to mitigate possible conflicts
related to overlapping of water use in addi
tion to setting quantitative goals in 2019
