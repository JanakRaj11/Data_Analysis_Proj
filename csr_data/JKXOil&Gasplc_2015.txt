the greenhouse gas emissions directors reports regulations 2013

global emissions not just those in the uk

all emissions sources owned operated or controlled by the reporting company are included not just those in the uk this means
reporting companies will have to have efficient data collection systems for gathering information from global operations as well
as a set of global emission factors


all greenhouse gases not just co2

the requirement is for all kyoto greenhouse gases greenhouse gas is defined in section 92 of the climate change act 2008 c
27 as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and
sulphur hexafluoride sf6


scopes 1 and 2 only
the reporting requirements are only for direct emissions also known as scope 1 and indirect emissions from purchased
electricity heating and cooling also known as scope 2 this makes reporting relatively simple and avoids the issue of different
companies using different boundaries for their other indirect emissions scope 3


in force 
annual reports published in 2014 will have to include greenhouse gas information this means that companies need to think
about collecting data and their method for calculating emissions now  consultghgregulations20131pdf
