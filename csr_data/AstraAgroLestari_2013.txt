                                                                                                sustainability report 2012 pt astra agro lestari tbk   04

      introduction from the director of
      environment and social responsibility 12




         the company first published a report specifically on the implementation of its social responsibility in 2006 entitled community
         development report for 2005 which was limited to reporting on the community development programs carried out by the company
         for nearby communities

         from 2006 the company consistently published reports in the same format until in 2010 the company published its report in a
         different format called sustainability report for 2009 which reported on the implementation of the companys responsibility in the
         areas of community development environment health and work safety and biodiversity in the plantations

         the company again revised its reporting format in the sustainability report for 2010 sharing nature for prosperity and sustainability
         when the company started to use a report theme with broader content covering reports on the companys responsibility to its
         stakeholders consisting of government public employees consumers and environment

         in the sustainability report for 2011 reflection for the future for the first time the company used the reporting standard of the global
         reporting initiative gri so that the sustainability report would present even more complete information and meet the needs of
         stakeholders on a global scale

         the sustainability report for 2012 is again presented using the global reporting initiative reporting standard so that stakeholders
         can receive adequate information in line with global reporting standards in this introduction to the report we would like to describe
         several significant impacts produced by the company during 2012

         the company has continued implementing the community revenue enhancement program based on both oil palm and nonoil
         palm commodities in 2012 the company conducted 14297 hours of training together with direct assistance to upgrade the
         knowledge and skills of oil palm farmers in both the plasma program and the community revenue enhancement program to enable
         them to improve the productivity of their plantations and thereby increase their revenue through these training and assistance
         activities the farmers have gained knowledge about caring for oil palm trees harvesting oil palm fresh fruit bunches and management
         of farmers groups as of 2012 roughly 30000 households are participating in the plasma program and over 8000 households are
         participating in the community revenue enhancement program based on oil palm plantation enterprises in the provinces of aceh
         riau central kalimantan east kalimantan west sulawesi and central sulawesi

         one important achievement in 2012 is that the company purchased 2559786 tons of oil palm fresh fruit bunches from the public
         with a total transaction value of 3497 trillion rupiah which we paid to the oil palm farmers most of whom reside near the companys
         plantations this fact demonstrates several aspects with high value first these transactions truly reflect the pulse of the economy
         in the regions which is made possible by the presence of the oil palm industry and the local communities participation in it second
         it also reflects the productivity of the local communities located near the companys plantations the oil palm industry has an
         advantage through the involvement of community participation in that the community does not simply stand by and watch but
         also helps to produce third this fact proves that the company engages in fair business practices with the farmers that supply the
         raw material of fresh fruit bunches who generally live near its plantations

         capital remains a constraint for some residents who wish to develop their businesses for this reason the company also provides
         capital support to 234 households to pioneer and develop various types of nonoil palm enterprises such as farming of tiger prawns
         and milkfish bandeng in aceh jaya regency aceh a fresh water fish cultivation business in merangin regency jambi fresh water




05 sustainability report 2012 pt astra agro lestari tbk

fish farming and nonrice staple food businesses in hulu sungai selatan and tabalong regencies south kalimantan horticulture
and fresh water fishery businesses in penajam paser utara regency east kalimantan and a blacksmithing handicraft business in
mamuju utara regency west sulawesi obviously the company can only provide limited assistance so this capital support is
intended mainly to help small enterprises that will provide an inspiration to those around them

in the education sector the company has taken the initiative to promote education in the regions by operating and upgrading the
quality of 15 schools owned by the company and also supports the operations of nine state primary schools sd negeri located
at the plantations as well as carrying out a foster school program that provides various types of assistance to 72 schools outside
the plantations in the form of subsidies for teacher salaries scholarships facilities and infrastructure and training programs to
enhance teacher competence in 2012 the company distributed scholarships to 1165 students consisting of elementary school
students junior high school scholarships senior high school scholarship and scholarships for university students including
scholarships with ser vice commitments for students studying at the astra manufacturing polytechnic

the areas near the plantations which are generally in rural or even remote interior regions typically still lack facilities and infrastructure
for health care the company has tried to address this problem by providing 43 facility units of plantation polyclinics poliklinik
kebun polibun and integrated service posts pos pelayanan terpadu posyandu which provide health care services to employees
and to local residents who need them

since 2011 the company has been conducting a posyandu integrated service post revitalization program for villages near the
plantations in 2012 this program facilitated 376 posyandu in 255 villages by carrying out training aimed at enabling the health
care cadres in the villages to provide limited health care services for mothers and children and to carry out activities promoting
health and the family planning program

the companys productivity was achieved with the support of 51305 employees the dynamic labor management during 2012
can be seen from among other matters the number of new employees recruited 5991 persons and the number of employees
who were promoted 3947 persons the company also strives to upgrade the competencies of its employees including through
training which came to 85250 training hours in 2012

with regard to its commitment to conserve the environment the company manages and develops conservation areas covering
around 26000 hectares before clearing any land for new planting the company performs an evaluation of the natural ecosystem
and important habitats with high conservation value so that conservation areas can be designated before planting activities begin
evaluation of important habitats with high conservation value is also performed in areas under land use rights that have already
been planted the company has developed a model for management of conservation zones and biodiversity in the oil palm
plantations which comprises the activities of assessment development monitoring and sustainable use in a model area covering
roughly 6500 hectares

the conservation areas of pt astra agro lestari tbk are of great importance for the preservation of species according to studies

as endangered and 26 species categorized as vulnerable a further 78 species are listed in the cites appendix as well as 107 species

                                                                                                        sustainability report 2012 pt astra agro lestari tbk   06

risk management 49 411

from the results of discussions during the reporting period several matters need to be noted in risk management prevention of
these risks is undertaken by formulating the companys activity plan and budget apb at the start of each year accompanied by
evaluation of implementation of the previous years apb

commodity price risk
since the prices of commodities tend to fluctuate in the world market to manage this risk the company develops a business model
based on high quality and low cost through a program of controlled intensification and expansion in addition strict oversight is
maintained over both revenues and costs in line with developments in the cpo market

financial risk
much of the companys business depends on conditions in the cpo commodity market to support stability in operating finances
the company provides implementation guidelines for cash transactions and financial planning policies to ensure diversification
of financial risk in addition the company also carries out a cost preservation program investment analysis and appointment of
project supervisors as well as managing funding facilities based on work plan priorities

operational risk
one factor that could impede the companys operations is a time gap between volatility in fertilizer prices visàvis cpo prices
sometimes when the price of fertilizer is high the price of cpo is not at a profitable level the company anticipates this risk by
evaluating the fertilizer application methods so that no fertilizer is spilled or wasted and procuring fertilizer through a centralized
system to ensure that the price and quality of fertilizer are affordable as well as guaranteeing procurement

legal risk
certainty regarding the ownership and control of land will affect the companys operational performance for this reason the
company obtains all licensing and land ownership documents in accordance with the prevailing legal provisions in addition
partnership cooperation programs are undertaken with the communities in the plantation locations as one effort to prevent the
emergence of territorial conflicts or land disputes if a case does go to court the company will form a special internal team and
use the services of legal professionals to settle the dispute

catastrophic risk
catastrophic risk includes natural disasters such as earthquakes floods tsunamis or fires the company has performed analysis of
these risks and their potential impacts and formulated mitigation in the form of improvement to business processes a business
continuity plan bcp sharing the risk with insurance companies and managing its own risk

         material aspects

         use of materials
         the companys activities are cultivation of oil palm plantations and processing the crops into crude palm oil in oil palm cultivation
         the materials used are fertilizer and pesticide while in the processing the material used is oil palm fresh fruit bunches ffb the
         company uses fertilizer purchased from official producers and importers and pesticides that are licensed and registered with the
         ministry of agriculture en1

         use of recycled materials
         the management and utilization of waste produced by the companys plantation and factory operations is based on the principles
         of protecting and improving the environment economically feasible and acceptable to the community and in accordance with
         laws and regulations

         the company uses byproducts from its oil palm factory in the form of empty fruit bunches and liquid waste as organic fertilizer
         which helps maintain soil moisture improve soil structure and increase plant nutrients the amounts of empty fruit bunches and
         liquid waste used as organic fertilizer are as follows en2

         energy aspect

         use of direct energy en3
         in its oil palm processing factory the company also maximizes electric power generation by using steam turbines that employ oil
         palm husks and fibers as fuel in this way the use of fossil fuels for dieselpowered generating plants can be minimized and limited
         to the start of the processing process

         the company uses direct energy derived from primary energy sources in the form of diesel fuel and gasoline as fuel for vehicles
         that transport the oil palm fresh fruit bunches from the fields to the factory as fuel for the processing process in the factory and
         as fuel for vehicles that transport crude palm oil from the factory to the port or to consumers
         use of indirect energy en4

         electricity for the operational needs of factories and for offices and housing located near the factories comes from steampowered
         generators at the palm factories electricity generated using diesel fuel is used at housing that is relatively far from the palm oil
         factories and when the steampowered generating plants are not yet functioning

         energy savings en5
         saving of energy in the production process at the plantations is achieved through the use of steampowered electric power
         generators as the main source of electricity for the needs of factories offices and housing near the palm oil factory locations
         savings are also achieved through the use of oil palm fiber and husks as fuel for the steampowered generators at the factories in
         this way the use of fossil fuels can be reduced



                                                                                                        volume used

         several efforts have been undertaken to reduce energy use through improvisation of electric power generation equipment in the
         following ways

              1 increasing boiler capacity from 20 tons to 40 tons
              2 increasing boiler pressure from 20 to 30 bars
              3 replacing singlestage turbines with multistage

         the company also strives to reduce the use of diesel fuel by adapting the dieselpowered generators in housing by adding gasifier
         equipment that uses oil palm husks as fuel thus reducing the use of diesel fuel en2 en5 en6

         savings in electricity usage are also sought by using energyefficient lighting using lights powered by solar cells and controlling
         the usage of electricity in housing by installing devices that limit the electric current mcb so that electricity usage can be optimized
         and more efficient en7

water aspect

water is needed in various operational activities in the plantation and in the processing process activities in the factories the
company uses water applying the principles of water conservation and efficiency through reforestation and water management
in 2012 there was an increase in the quantity of water used in the processing process in the factory to 42 cubic meters per ton of
cpo due to the addition of four new factory units as mentioned earlier the use of surface water for the needs of the production
process in the oil palm factory is as follows en8

the surface water used for the processing process in the oil palm factories comes from rivers or streams at the plantations the
company applies water management to optimize the use of surface water in the plantations from the results of monitoring
conducted regularly throughout the reporting period there are no indications of impact or disturbance to surface water sources
en9

the company strives to achieve efficiency in the use of water by minimizing water and steam leakage in the oil palm processing
process the company also reuses condensate in the process of processing oil palm fresh fruit bunches into crude palm oil en10

biodiversity aspect

all the oil palm plantations operated by the company are located in nonforest areas apl  areal peruntukan lain other designated
use areas or nonforestry cultivation zones kawasan budidaya non kehutanan knbk and are outside the conservation zones
designated by the government through law no 5 of 1990 on conservation of natural resources nature reserves wildlife preserves
national parks forest parks hunting parks and natural tourism parks the company ensures that its oil palm plantation management
activities do not produce any significant impact on conservation zones en11

the oil palm plantations operated by the company do not have any significant impact on conservation zones because the plantations
are located relatively far from the conservation zones designated by the government in addition the company also manages its
oil palm plantations with an emphasis on ecological values including the application of integrated pest control the company
appreciates the importance of the biodiversity found within the plantations or that interacts with the plantation areas by dedicating
a part of the area for conservation as well as undertaking efforts to conserve the wildlife living in the conservation areas en12

habitat protection and restoration
the company manages and develops conservation areas covering around 26000 hectares before clearing any land for new planting
the company performs an evaluation of the natural ecosystem and important habitats with high conservation value so that
conservation areas can be designated before planting activities begin evaluation of important habitats with high conservation
value is also done in areas under land use rights that have already been planted

the company has performed identification of biodiversity and dedicates part of its land for conservation the area of land identified
as containing biodiversity varies between subsidiaries as of the end of 2012 the company had completed 92 of the hcv
assessments in its existing plantations with a total area of 26697 km2 en13

habitat protection and restoration is a program currently being developed by the company which has started with planning and
consolidation of conservation areas by 1 mapping the boundaries of the conservation areas and then installing boundary markers
2 restricting activities likely to damage the ecosystem such as felling of trees 3 development of information media to educate
the public on the importance of conservation areas 4 monitoring and oversight development of the systems and operations of
the protection and restoration program still requires further efforts to achieve the desired results en14

habitat restoration is done based on the results of analysis of the status of the natural ecosystems in the conservation areas analysis
of the status of these zones is done through surveys of the conditions of vegetation and wildlife the data obtained is then used
to determine the status of a given area gather data on the plant and animal species still present estimate their numbers measure
the availability of natural food supplies for the wildlife and so on if the vegetation is still good and native the effort undertaken
is supervision rather than restoration but if the vegetation has changed with very few native trees and it is mostly covered with
invasive plant species such as macaranga sp what is needed is replanting of native trees and plants bearing forest fruits as food
for the wildlife

           this rehabilitation is an effort by the company to restore natural habitat and at the same time safeguard and ensure that the process
           of natural succession proceeds properly

           rehabilitation starts with efforts to obtain seedlings of native plants which usually involves the local community but if the quantity
           is insufficient the company buys seedlings from companies that specialize in providing seedlings of forest plants or tries to obtain
           them from the local forestry service the planting activity is followed by maintenance in the form of watering and fertilizing for a
           certain time in line with the amount of rainfall soil conditions and growth of the plants insertion is done if any plants have died

           biological elements and their ecosystems are mutually interdependent and influence one another so damage or extinction of one
           element will disrupt the ecosystem as a whole conservation is needed to maintain biological diversity and proper conservation
           rests on three pillars save it study it and use it

           the company carries out conservation by developing a model of conservation zone and biodiversity management in its oil palm
           plantations management of biodiversity is done in line with government policy with reference to law no 5 of 1990 on management
           of biological resources and their ecosystems the management of biodiversity in conservation zones within the companys
           cultivation rights areas includes activities of protection preservation and sustainable use

           the company applies five stages in its biodiversity management as follows 1 identification of biodiversity status including the
           wealth of species abundance distribution of species vegetation structure and overall condition of the area 2 land use planning

     environment




        in the implementation the programs developed at the field level include the following 1 analysis of biodiversity status 2
        consolidation of conservation areas 3 safeguarding of conservation areas 4 management of species and their habitats 5
        rehabilitation and restoration 6 conservation education 7 ecotourism development 8 management of biological resource
        utilization

        the company has a policy to use conservation zones responsibly by placing humans as the central point making use of science
        and technology and optimizing their social and environmental functions the utilization of conservation zones is carried out with
        a longterm orientation so that their existence can be enjoyed sustainably by future generations

        the use of natural resources always takes heed of the concepts of sustainable development and employs an environmental
        perspective preserving a given conservation zone involves not just protecting it but also utilizing the resources within it so that
        it continues to function as a unitary ecosystem

        analysis of biodiversity status
        biodiversity status is determined on the basis of number of species abundance distribution vegetation structure and overall
        landscape condition this biodiversity status then serves as the basis for development of overall conservation programs the
        biodiversity profile is developed using data obtained from preliminary surveys biodiversity monitoring regular inventories and
        indepth research

        biodiversity studies
        in more detail the analysis of biodiversity status is structured in a research program which includes both longterm and shortterm
        studies the longterm studies use a permanent plot to obtain time series data the shortterm studies are typically done in
        collaboration with universities or other research institutions the results of these studies will serve as a reference for management
        of the conservation zones

        the activities of the longterm studies include the following

             1 measurement of the diversity of types of plants trees shrubs herbs palms ferns rattan bamboo epiphytes lianas grasses
                and underbrush in the permanent plot with the aim of knowing the potential of the flora within the conservation zone
                the measurement uses a vegetation analysis method to study the composition of types and the structure of the vegetation
                or community of plants
             2 measurement of the diversity of mammalian species with the aim of collecting data and information to support management
                of wildlife in the conservation zone done through field observation in the permanent plot
             3 measurement of diversity of bird species in the permanent plot
             4 measurement of diversity of herpetofauna species reptiles and amphibians
             5 measurement of population and distribution of flagship species
             6 measurement of habitat of flagship species
             7 creation of a herbarium as reference material
                a herbarium consists of preserved specimens or parts of plants which are used to identify or determine the species of plants
                and also as evidence or documentation of the types of plants found in a certain locality the herbarium is collected at the
                environmental laboratory in the research centre unit rcu building

    8 preparation of preserved collection specimens
       the creation of a collection of preserved specimens is still focused on types of reptiles and amphibians that cannot be
       identified in the field the preparation of the specimens follows the standards and code of ethics of wildlife research and
       welfare
    9 study of cave environments

inventory and monitoring
management of the conservation zones starts with an inventory of wildlife and their habitat through surveys and observation to
know the conditions of the populations and types of plants and animals the purpose of the observation is to recognize the trends
in populations of plant and animal species over time the inventory and observation enable availability of important information
about the conservation zones such as data on populations including their biological status maps of distribution of species and
their habitats and habitat conditions

periodic observation is focused on the following species that are protected species that are traded commercially species that are
under pressure from hunting and species that are experiencing pressure on their habitats the inventory and observation of
biodiversity includes the following activities 1 periodic collection of data on species of flora and fauna 2 identification of food
plant species and animals nesting places and their distribution 3 recording and documentation of findings in the field fallen
trees dead animals nests eggs tracks and feces and 4 collection of data on invasive species and exotic species

program for consolidation of conservation zones
the consolidation of conservation zones is divided into two activities

    1 installation of conservation zones boundary markers to provide certainty about the extent of a given zone followed by
       preparation of a map of the boundary markers which is verified by the plantation management maintenance and evaluation
       of boundary markers is carried out periodically to keep them functioning optimally

    2 installation of information boards identifying the conservation zones so that the public is aware of the boundaries of the
       companys conservation zones these information boards contain information on the status of the forests or locations
       designated as conservation zones and are posted at the boundaries of conservation zones susceptible to disturbance

program for safeguarding of conservation zones
protection and safeguarding of zones in the context of conservation of natural resources are two activities that are interrelated but
also have slight differences in their implementation

       protection activities are perceived as an effort to maintain the zones integrity and potential for example by protecting
        them from the dangers of fire pests and disease unauthorized herding activities the growth of exotic species and genetic
        pollution protection from exotic species and the like falls under the program for fostering of habitats and populations

       safeguarding of the zones is defined as efforts to protect the integrity of the zones from human disturbance such as theft
        of wood illegal hunting shifting cultivation human habitation and damage resulting from nature tourism activities the
        efforts for safeguarding zones take the form of preventive actions such as surveillance guard duty system observation
        and patrols routine patrols surprise patrols joint patrols

         management of species and their habitat
         wildlife management is a science and an art of human activities to regulate wildlife both their populations and their habitats in
         order to achieve conditions in line with the objective of the management ie sustainable population conditions alikodra 2002
         wildlife management through an approach of activities of developing a database of fauna as data on potential is an essential part
         of the management of conservation areas as the essence of conservation activities is how the managers can maintain the integrity
         of the fauna existing within the conservation area and increase their populations numbers of individuals wildlife management
         activities entail the creation of detailed plans including tools instruments techniques and methods these four terms constitute
         a single mutually supporting unit to make wildlife management effective

         habitat management activities for landdwelling organisms include regulation of the following food productivity flow of water
         resources sources of mineral salt places to take shelter prevention of pollution prevention of erosion and damage caused by other
         damage factors and control of forest fires alikodra 1993 habitat management is influenced by the objectives of the management
         the types of wildlife and the types of habitat

         rehabilitation and restoration
         rehabilitation programs are implemented through replanting of forests or other lands that have become barren or damaged so
         that they will be green again with plants appropriate to the soil and climate of the locality concerned and not exotic species in
         the hope of repairing the damaged wildlife habitat planting of trees in the companys conservation zones is focused mainly on
         riparian and marshland ecosystems

         rehabilitation programs include the following activities
            1 macro biophysical analysis of the zone to be rehabilitated
            2 planning and design of rehabilitation zone
            3 planting of seedlings
            4 safeguarding and maintenance of rehabilitation zone
            5 monitoring and evaluation of zone rehabilitation activities

         conservation education programs
         the company conducts special education programs to enhance the participation of the plantation community in conservation
         education of the community both within and outside the plantations is an effort to transform knowledge about the environmental
         services that the forest can provide this knowledge raises the publics awareness to not damage wildlife habitats such as through
         illegal logging but instead to help preserve biodiversity

         the community is also helped to enhance their own welfare and quality of life so as to reduce their dependence on forest resources
         the community revenue enhancement program based on both oil and nonoil palm resources is one form of the companys
         assistance to local communities that provides both social and environmental benefits

the conservation education programs conducted by the company began with the internal community  the pupils in the schools
owned and run by the company the conservation education programs consist of

     1 inclass material
        the provision of inclass material story telling is a semiformal activity carried out the classes that provides pupils with an
        overview general knowledge about the biodiversity existing in the oil palm plantations

     2 knowledge from the field outbound and games
        outward bound activities and games are a continuation from the story telling that provides knowledge about biodiversity
        directly in the field the participants get to interact directly with the objects they are learning about

management of sustainable utilization of natural resources
this program is aimed at providing benefit from the existence of the companys conservation areas to both the plantation and the
surrounding community this is a multistakeholder involvement program

aids in biodiversity management
in conducting biodiversity management the company has created ten technical guidelines the creation of these technical guidelines
is intended to create certainty regarding the rules expressed in the form of a commitment to implement them so as to achieve

studies of conservation priority species en15
a conservation priority species is a species that serves as an icon or umbrella species in a certain conservation area within the
companys plantations the designation of conservation species is based on the criteria of protection status indonesian government
regulation cites and iucn red list and its role in the ecosystem the application of the conservation priority species program is
intended as an effective conservation strategy in the conservation area concerned carrying out conservation that is directed and
focused on a priority species provides a positive value for other species and their habitats

through the biodiversity management carried out up to december 2012 we have monitored and identified 415 species of woody
plants 78 mammal species 280 bird species 39 reptile species and 36 amphibian species living in conservation locations in the
oil palm plantations managed by the company all of these species are distributed throughout sumatra kalimantan and sulawesi
some of them are identified as protected species based on regulations set by the government of the republic of indonesia the
red list of the international union for conservation of nature iucn and the list of the convention on international trade in
endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites as of 2012 the company has conducted surveys of flora and fauna in 32
subsidiaries

in all there are 50 species which are in the iucn red list including five species categorized as critically endangered 19 species
categorized as endangered and 26 species categorized as vulnerable 78 other species are listed in the cites appendix and 107
species are protected under government regulation no7 of 1999 on preservation of plant and wildlife species

         atmospheric emissions
         the company measures the quality of atmospheric emissions at the oil palm factories twice a year the parameters measured are
         sox and nox minister of the environment regulation number 7 of 2007 sets the quality standard for sox at 600 mgm3 while the
         quality standard for nox is set at 800 mgm3 the results of this measurement show that the content of nox and sox emissions at
         the 20 oil palm factories owned by the company are still below the quality standards set by the government as shows in the

         waste water
         the liquid waste produced from the oil palm factories contains a high level of nutrients so it can be used as a liquid fertilizer
         pursuant to minister of environment decision no 28 of 2003 the utilization of liquid waste must comply with these requirements
            a bod no greater than 5000 mgliter
            b ph value in the range of 69

         the use of liquid waste as organic fertilizer in the companys oil palm plantations complies with the requirements set by the
         government en21

         waste disposal methods
         liquid waste from the palm oil factories can be used as a liquid fertilizer after first being processed at the waste water processing
         installation ipal followed by a cooling process in the cooling pond a mixing process in the mixing pond an anaerobic process
         in the anaerobic pond and storage in the contact pond liquid waste that has been processed in the ipal ponds is then piped into
         a storage tank at the oil palm plantation the piping of liquid waste to the oil palm plantation uses pipes made of highdensity
         polyethylene which is relatively hard strong and resistant to high temperatures in 2012 the volume of liquid waste used as organic
         fertilizer came to 3562287 m3 or 24 m3 per ton of cpo equivalent to 2000 tons of urea clearly this is a great saving of natural
         resources since the raw material for urea is natural gas en22

management of toxic and hazardous waste thw
every oil palm plantation will obviously produce some materials that are toxic and hazardous waste thw both liquid and solid
such as used motor oil and used vehicle batteries in the companys oil palm plantations thw is stored at a temporary storage site
licensed by the regency government the thw is then sent to parties that wish to reuse it or collectors with a license from the
ministry of environment transportation of thw may only be done by a party with a license from the ministry of environment and
a transportation license from the transportation service in 2012 the thw generated by the companys plantation operations
comprised 86360 liters of used motor oil and 657 used vehicle batteries en24

there were no spills of toxic and hazardous waste in 2012 the company treats its thw in accordance with the procedures set by
and with reference to government regulations en23

the company applies food safety standards and employs hazard controls by applying the hazard analysis and critical control
points haccp system to ensure that everything from raw materials to products received by consumers is safe and suitable for
consumption the company strives to prevent impact from transportation by applying a regulation regarding transport equipment
whereby dedicated trucks are used to transport the oil palm fresh fruit bunches and if they are to be used for any other purpose
they must be washed thoroughly afterwards in accordance with the washing standards in the haccp system the transport of
crude palm oil from the factory to the port is also done using dedicated crude palm oil transport trucks which are kept in roadworthy
condition safe and free from contamination en29

     integrated pest control guided by maintenance of
     ecological balance in the oil palm plantations

     the company applies good agricultural practices that help preserve biodiversity by maintaining the balance of the ecosystem
     within the oil palm plantations integrated pest control is one example of this

     in applying integrated pest control the company monitors the conditions of pests and of their natural enemies and applies a
     reporting system integrated between the plantation and the main office decision making on the control of a given pest is based
     on considerations of the economic threshold of the pest population with priority on the carrying capacity of the biological agents
     existing in the plantation




     each plantation has personnel who monitor the
     presence of pests and of their natural enemies as
     part of the early warning system

control of field rats
field rats rattus tiomanicus are a major pest that damages oil palm plants whether already producing or not yet producing failure
to control rats can lead to losses of up to 5 of the total palm oil production per year from producing plants since 1996 the
company has engaged in integrated control of field rats by employing their natural enemy the barn owl tyto alba as a biological
agent as of december 2012 barn owls have been developed at 24 plantations with a population now reaching 11722

the use of barn owls in controlling the field rat population enables the company to reduce or minimize its use of dangerous chemical
rodenticides as well as barn owls the company also uses a biorodenticide with an environmentally friendly protozoon sarcosystis
singaporensis as its active ingredient when the intensity of rat attacks could potentially exceed the economic threshold this bio
rodenticide controls the rat population without threatening the survival of barn owls so it is used mainly in plantation areas that
already have barn owls

despite prioritizing the control of rats in environmentally sound ways through the use of natural biological agents and bio
rodenticide the company still used chemical rodenticides in limited quantities at plantations that were not yet conserving barn
owls and in plantations undergoing replanting of oil palm plants in 20102012

         control of caterpillars that eat oil palm leaves
         leafeating caterpillars are another major pest of oil palm plants failure to control leafeating caterpillars can lead to major losses
         due to decline of production in certain periods depending on the intensity of the attacks bagworms ulat kantong and nettle
         caterpillars ulat api are two leafeating species that often cause problems in oil palm plantations outbreaks of these pests can
         occur from imbalance in the ecosystem including from the use of contact chemical insecticides in quantities and frequencies
         exceeding the correct limits

         the company controls leafeating caterpillars in the oil palm plantations by paying attention to balance in the ecosystem while
         enhancing the functions of biological agents and seeking environmentally friendly breakthroughs pest populations are monitored
         through routine monthly detection followed by evaluation of the presence of beneficial insects to balance them beneficial plants
         are also conserved to increase the carrying capacity for parasitoid insects and natural predators in order to develop and expand
         the diversity of biological agents conservation of beneficial plants is carried out mainly in areas that are pockets of pest attacks
         the presence of beneficial plants correlates positively with the presence of parasitoid insects thus increasing the diversity and
         extent of beneficial plants will enhance the biodiversity of parasitoid insects

         the system for reporting and evaluation of the populations of pests and their natural enemies is updated to obtain more detailed
         information about the presence of pests and their natural enemies in a given area detailed baseline information is needed as a
         consideration before deciding to undertake a control action and also as a guide to maintain the ecological balance in the oil palm
         plantations

         conservation has been undertaken for several species of beneficial plants such as turnera subulata turnera ulmifolia euphorbia
         heterophylla and antigonon leptopus exploration in the form of applied research has also been done for various plants which
         encourage the presence of predator insects that are the natural enemies of caterpillars so that they can be conserved and maintain
         the density of predator insects in a population balanced with that of the pests

the company has undertaken several efforts to increase biodiversity particularly of parasitoid insects and predators of caterpillars
that eat oil palm leaves as follows
    1 developing the mononuclear polyhedral virus mnpv against the caterpillars setora nitens and those asigna in 2012 mainly
        at pt sari lembah subur to later be gradually developed in other plantations
    2 breeding pupae of nettle caterpillars obtained from collection activity the parasitoid insects that emerge from the pupae
        are then rereleased and used as natural pest control
    3 propagating and distributing beneficial plants
    4 cultivating ferns nephrolepis sp so as to always be present in the rows between oil palm plants
    5 employing stem or root injections in the use of chemical insecticides and prioritizing the use of biological insecticides such
        as bacillus thuringiensis
    6 maintaining beneficial plants that grow naturally between the oil palm rows such as ageratum conyzoides asytasia intrusa
        and other plants with small flowers that attract the presence of parasitoid insects and predators as the insects like the
        flowers and their nectar content

control of stem rot ganoderma boninense
stem rot caused by the fungus ganoderma is an endemic disease in certain areas characterized by the heavy and intensive spread
of the disease and the existence of several alternative hosts monitoring is carried out consistently and continuously to obtain
information and mapping of the distribution of the disease the strategy for control of ganoderma is communicated to all relevant
sections so that they also understand the disease and can help in monitoring it each plantation is asked to provide capable personnel
to do this monitoring in this way the level of attacks and potential losses can be reduced
the integrated control undertaken by the company starts with land sanitation before carrying out replanting activities by eliminating
the source of infection  oil palm basal stems infected with the spores mycelia and fruit bodies of ganoderma together with their
hosts next organic material containing antagonist microbes such as trichoderma spp and mycoriza is applied in the oil palm
nurseries and at the time of planting in the plantations to prepare plants that are partially resistant to ganoderma attacks especially
in regions where such attacks are endemic efforts to restore the health of diseased plants by creating trenches containing certain
microbial materials to reduce fungus infections are still in the stage of applied research

control of rhinoceros beetles oryctes rhinoceros
the application of a zero burning policy is a good thing from an environmental perspective but it can be a disaster for the oil palm
plantation business because it creates an opportunity for rhinoceros beetles to reproduce these beetles are a pest that can cause
serious damage if the oil palm plantation fails to control them

the company applies an integrated control strategy that starts by sanitizing the breeding area where the beetles lay their eggs
and the preadult stages develop the next step is collection of larvae and monitoring the population of infested plants while
capturing beetles in the adult stage using pheromone traps

various forms of applied research are being employed to discover biological pest control methods using the right formulation
including the use of an entomopathogenic fungus metharizium anisopliae combined control including the use of chemical
insecticides may be used when the level of the attacks is quite severe with innovations in the application method so as to be more
environmentally friendly more effective and more efficient

             use of pesticides
             the growing resistance of various species of pests weeds and diseases is a critical issue in the use of pesticides these days
             furthermore using pesticides also entails the risk of killing various beneficial species of biological agents that are not the target
             of the pesticides such as barn owls parasitoid insects and predators which affects the balance of the ecosystem in the oil palm
             plantations food safety and human health are other important issues associated with the use of pesticides

             the company limits the use of synthetic chemical pesticides in order to reduce their negative impacts and supports research to
             discover new more effective ways of handling organisms that disturb oil palms so as to create models or systems of control suited
             to each particular ecosystem the objective is to reduce the use of and dependence on synthetic chemical pesticides

         as suppliers of goods and services needed for the operations or for the employees of the plantations

         in the pioneering phase of the plantation in west sulawesi the community of tikke village provided the service of transporting
         oil palm seedlings using their oxcarts as well as providing labor and supplying agricultural products for the employees needs as
         time went on the partnerships between the company and the community grew and developed the community later started
         providing various other goods needed by the company including raw material oil palm fresh fruit bunches work equipment
         office equipment fuel and lubricants spare parts rice and various other goods for the companys operations or the needs of its
         employees the community was also able to provide a range of services for the companys needs such as transportation of oil palm
         fresh fruit bunches transportation of crude palm oil transportation of empty bunches civil works health care and various other
         services ec7

         the development of the plantations has increased and expanded partnership with the community partnerships have produced
         fostered and developed new productive enterprises which create new jobs in the regions this has been made possible by the
