   about half a year has passed since the csr promo                                activities i think we have much work to do nonetheless in
tion committee and your wgs were formed what                                        discussions with employees at our plants ive felt people are
changes do you think wg formation has brought about                                 beginning to realize the importance of volunteer activities
jzbjgv we had been carrying out ci control before our wg
was formed but with the csr promotion committees                                   raising the csr awareness of all employees is
establishment reporting to top management and promoting                             an important task
activities internally and at group companies can be done much                           how do the rest of you feel employees are reacting to
more smoothly                                                                       your efforts
nvbvcvv i feel the same one result weve already achieved                         dch i think the importance of disaster preparedness is
through the wg is issuance of the compliance standard page 11                     gradually being understood when i visit plants i sometimes see
which all employees can access by the companys online database                     that measures have been implemented to prevent parts from
bvzvlv disaster preparedness activities used to focus on                           falling off shelves or light fixtures from falling during earthquakes
earthquake countermeasures but since starting the wg we                            and that encourages me that awareness is growing
have focused on preparedness for other disasters as well wg                         nvbvcvv i feel that compliance awareness is growing as well
inauguration also has clarified our function and roles and                           for example we established the jtekt business ethics
allowed us to carry out work more speedily                                          consultation service page 11 and are receiving reports and
dch i can agree with that now that our roles and                               inquiries from employees on legally questionable conduct by
responsibilities have been clarified it is easier to carry out the                  means of this system

vhbdid i think all of us were involved in our respective                         disaster preparedness activities we still havent reached the
activities even before our wgs were formed but wg formation has                     overall level of employee awareness we desire we want to
enabled us to identify issues and promote improvement activities                     keep working toward that
with much greater speed i think that is the biggest change

bvzvlv my aim is to make jtekt a company that is trusted                                 how do the rest of you view csr
by all stakeholders as one well prepared for disasters to do                            nvbvcvv i believe the essence of csr is respect for people
that we must continue efforts to deepen awareness regarding                             meaning people related to jtekt and in turn people in general
disaster preparedness                                                                   dch i think csr is envisioning where we need to be 100 years
chviv i want to make jtekt a company that community                                 from now and pursuing policies of coexistencecoprosperity and
residents are happy to live nearby also if participation in                            sustainability in order to get there
volunteer activities grows it will promote communication
between employees and put more smiles on peoples faces
my hope is to contribute to creating such a corporate
atmosphere
nvbvcvv i think the major task for us is to increase employee
awareness regarding compliance i must say that now theres a
big difference in awareness between departments our role is
to work steadily and resolutely to raise overall awareness
jzbjgv awareness is also important regarding ci control the
content of ci control differs by department and i feel we must
increase awareness by activities suited to each department
 it seems raising employee awareness is an important

common task for all wgs                                                                 bvzvlv the word coexistence is easy to understand
jzbjgv i dont think theres any magic formula for raising                              people may not respond to calls for csr activities but
awareness we simply need to continue explaining and                                     when we position these as activities in order for organizations
stressing it over and over                                                              and people to coexist in harmony with society and local
nvbvcvv i feel the same we want to continue steady efforts                            communities people can understand that thats how i believe
to raise awareness                                                                      they should be positioned
vhbdid regarding ci control and compliance even a single                            jzbjgv it will be good if jtekt can construct a relationship of
legal violation or leakage of ci in the jtekt group or its supply                        strong trust with society and grow together with it
chain can cause an immediate loss of trust in jtekt that                                chviv i view csr as activities to enable people to live
makes preventive measures in these areas crucial                                        abundant lives i came to that view through considering our
jzbjgv our hope is to establish a system of ci control that                             corporate philosophy i never thought about it deeply before
can be trusted with confidence by all stakeholders the ideal                            but being a wg member has caused me to realize it truly is a
situation is that ci control measures are seen as natural and                            good philosophy
that ci control is achieved without employees paying any                                 vhbdid most employees dont have the opportunity to
special attention to it                                                                 consider and discuss the meaning of the corporate philosophy
                                                                                         deeply but i think that our efforts as part of csr wgs will
planning csr activities caused us to consider                                            inspire them to do so and in turn to think about social
the meaning of the corporate philosophy                                                  responsibility this will come to shape the natural thinking of
vhbdid listening to everyones comments has reminded me                              jtekt employees our csr activities will be the basis of this
of how important raising employee awareness is to successfully                           growth
promoting csr activities but i think csr must be seen in light of                        thank you for your comments

the differing cultures and customs of countries and in that
sense csr can mean different things to different people so i
                                                                                         the moderator for this roundtable discussion was masayuki funatsu public
think the beginning point is for people to consider what csr                             relations group leader in the general administration dept who also is respon
means to them from their own vantage point                                              sible for preparing this csr report

production and transport                              divisions since beginning fh1250sx production
the first problem we faced was whether our            in 2008 jtekt has received numerous orders
plant was capable of producing such a machine         particularly from makers in america and europe
tool jtekt had mainly produced small and             of parts for windmill power generators and other
mediumsized machine tools and our produc           energyrelated parts this machine won the main
tion people had doubts as to whether it was           prize at the top 10 new product awards because
possible the development team began working          of its worldclass performance in machining
with the production engineers and resolved            parts for environmental products and contribution

 reduction of local community environmental risks
jtekt strives to minimize environmental risk to local communities such as the risk of
environmental accidents or environmental law violation by formulating preventive
measures we review cases that had the potential to lead to an accident or violation
identify causes implement countermeasures and communicate these throughout
the company so that no such accident or violation will actually occur we also carry
out training for responding to environmental emergencies once a year

situation regarding legal compliance
with environmental laws and regulations
in fy2008 jtekt did not receive any fines or penalties and was not the subject of any
lawsuits related to environmental matters

environmental complaints and accidents
jtekt has established internal standards 1 regarding amounts of plant wastewater                  1 internal standards
                                                                                                     jtekt has set its internal standards at 80 of the
discharge and substances released into the atmosphere that are stricter than regulatory              regulatory requirements
amounts and strives to prevent environmental accidents and complaints while jtekt
had no accidents and received no complaints regarding environmental matters in
fy2008 there were four cases in which plant wastewater discharge cod tadomisaki
plant and nitrogen content hanazono plant exceeded internal standards and that
potentially could have resulted in problems we thoroughly investigated the causes and
took corrective measures for each of these cases and expanded these measures to all
of our plants we will continue to promote preventive activities on a continual basis

internal audits
although the 2008 internal audit revealed that certain log content was insufficient and
the action plan was partly unclear no deficiencies were recorded also workshops
were held for employees qualified to carry out internal environment audits in order to
confirm their auditing capability and raise their skills based on such activities we will
continue efforts to improve our pool of employees capable of conducting these audits

 reduction of materials usage
jtekt mainly through its energy saving subcommittee one of several specialized
environmental committees strives to reduce the amounts of primary materials such as
raw materials and secondary materials such as cutting tools and grinding wheels that it
uses by improving material types machining methods etc we have steadily reduced
usage amounts

    as noted above jtekt pursued csr activities in fy2008 despite a                    we worked to disclose statistical data for a number of new items and
very harsh business environment just as last year we invited mr                      improve ease of understanding we believe these improvements led to
yamaguchi to participate in meetings this year to exchange views with                   certain aspects of our report being commended and our proactive
jtekt and provide us with a thirdparty opinion                                        stance toward csr being clearly conveyed
    last year mr yamaguchi presented us with the two main challenges                      at the same time mr yamaguchi presented us with new challenges
of clarifying jtekt csr and enhancing our social report in regard                    for future reports such as pursuing activities and preparing a report
to the first in february 2009 we started a csr promotion committee                    that will reflect the true face of the company and the dynamism of
issued a csr policy and began working to identify problems and                         activities and to disclose information as a truly global company we will
pursue improvements through the activities of specialized working                       consider these comments seriously and have many discussions about
groups in areas such as compliance confidential information control                   how to proceed toward next year utilizing the pdca cycle we hope to
disaster preparedness and social contribution regarding the second                   gain the further trust of society by actively promoting csr activities
