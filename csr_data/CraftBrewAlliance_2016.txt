in fact we care so deeply about making a positive impact  not just in the way our beers taste but in the way we brew
them  that every year we commit to sharing our sustainability goals and progress

for our 3rd annual sustainability report weve outlined some of our biggest highlights and achievements over the last
year it was a busy one as well as identified some top priorities for 2016 because theres always room to improve

in 2015 we set out to continue building on our sustainability track record which includes keeping our portland water
usage well below industry average increasing renewable energy usage and diverting more than 98 of our waste from
landfills through innovative recycling programs last year we also increased our investment in our local communities
with a new program designed to encourage our employees to get involved and support the local causes that matter most
to them

each of our breweries in hawaii new hampshire oregon and washington contributes to our overall sustainability
program in unique ways that align with their local communities and environments  from our widmer brothers brewery
in portland partnering with oregon wild to preserve our natural water ways to our kona brewery in kailuakona setting
out to build hawaiis first craft brewery with a resource recovery center
