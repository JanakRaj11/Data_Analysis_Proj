     not including the hannover re group with just under 12500 physical workspaces and for last year to our four largest german locations hannover cologne
     hilden and hamburg with just under 10000 physical workspaces this means that the figures cannot be compared directly the information provided for

     figures relate to our four largest german locations hannover cologne hilden and hamburg as a result the figures are not directly comparable

     the number of office workspaces is used as the basis because the buildings also house external workers such as audit firm employees

     this includes not only the core workforce but also vocational trainees etc in order to be able to show the figures in relation to the number of users

      he figures for hdi assicurazioni cover roughly 70 of actual energy consumption since in the case of leased locations this is included in the rental costs
