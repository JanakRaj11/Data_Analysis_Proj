regulatory own funds
in the following erste group fulfils the disclosure requirements according to the capital requirements regulation crr in detail arti
cles 436 b  e crr and articles 437 1 a d e and f crr

the information presented in this chapter relates to the disclosed and audited figures in note 52 in the financial statements references to
chapters refer to the financial statements

regulatory requirements
since 1 january 2014 erste group has been calculating the regulatory capital and the regulatory capital requirements according to basel 3
the requirements were implemented within the eu by the capital requirements regulation crr and the capital requirement directive
crd iv that were enacted in national law in the austrian banking act aba as well as within various technical standards issued by the
european banking authority eba

all requirements as defined in the crr the aba and the aforementioned technical standards are fully applied by erste group for regula
tory purposes and for the disclosure of regulatory information

accounting principles
the financial and regulatory figures published by erste group are based on ifrs regulatory capital components eligible capital compo
nents derive from the balance sheet and income statement which were prepared in accordance with ifrs adjustments to the accounting
figures are considered due to the different definitions in the scopes of consolidation further details are explained in the section regula
tory scope of consolidation the uniform closing date of the consolidated regulatory figures of erste group is the 31 december of the
respective year

comparison of consolidation for accounting purposes and regulatory purposes
disclosure requirements article 436 b crr

scope of consolidation
further details regarding the ifrs scope of consolidation are disclosed in chapter b significant accounting policies under the section
scope of consolidation

the regulatory scope of consolidation is used as a synonym for the scope of consolidation that follows the regulatory requirements for
consolidation as defined by the crr and the aba which introduces the requirements of the crd iv into national law

regulatory scope of consolidation
the regulatory scope of consolidation is defined in part one title ii chapter 2 section 3 of the crr the definition of entities to be
consolidated for regulatory purposes are mainly defined in article 4 1 3 and 16 to 27 crr in conjunction with the articles 18 and
19 crr and article 30 aba based on the relevant sections in article 4 crr entities to be consolidated are determined based on the
business activity of the relevant entities

main differences between the ifrs and the regulatory scope of consolidation based on the different requirements as defined
in ifrs and crr as well as the aba
  _ based on the crr and aba mainly credit institutions pursuant to article 4 1 1 crr investment firms pursuant to article 4 1
    2 crr ancillary services undertakings pursuant to article 4 1 18 crr and financial institutions pursuant to article 4 1 26
    crr have to be considered within the regulatory scope of consolidation under ifrs all other entities not required to be consolidated
    under crr such as insurance undertakings must be included in the ifrs scope of consolidation
  _ exclusion of entities from the regulatory scope of consolidation can be applied based on article 19 crr according to article 19 1
    crr entities can be excluded from the regulatory scope if their total assets and offbalance sheet items are less than the lower amount
    of either eur 10 million or 1 of the total amount and offbalance sheet items of the parent company erste group applies article 19
    1 crr
  _ according to article 19 2 crr entities can also be excluded if the limits defined in article 19 1 crr are exceeded but are not
    relevant for regulatory purposes exclusion of entities based on article 19 2 crr needs the prior approval of the competent authori
    ties for entities that exceed the limits as defined in article 19 1 crr by insignificant amounts erste group applies article 19 2
    crr and follows the requirements for the approval process as defined within this article erste group does not apply article 19 2
    crr for credit institutions and investment firms




                                                                                                                                         97

consolidation methods
main differences between the ifrs and the regulatory consolidation method considering regulatory adjustments
for the calculation of consolidated own funds erste group generally applies the same consolidation methods as used for accounting
purposes the difference relates to article 18 4 crr only which requires proportional consolidation of entities and financial institutions
managed by an undertaking included in the consolidation together with one or more undertakings not included in the consolidation where
the liability of those undertakings is limited to the share of the equity held by the institution based on article 18 4 crr erste group
applies proportional consolidation for two entities

consideration of consolidation methods for the calculation of consolidated own funds according to the crr
the amounts used for the calculation of the own funds derive from the balance sheet according to ifrs the amounts that are used as the
basis for the calculation of own funds are recalculated based on the definition of the regulatory scope of consolidation according to the
crr the difference between the ifrs balance sheet and the regulatory balance sheet arises from the different scopes of consolidation
see table regarding balance sheet reconciliation amounts that relate to the own shares as well as to the minority interests in fully consol
idated entities are therefore determined based on the regulatory scope of consolidation according to crr minority interests are calculated
based on the requirements as defined in articles 81 to 88 crr minority interests that relate to entities other than credit institutions are
excluded from the own funds minority interests that relate to credit institutions are limited to capital requirements that relate to the mi
nority interests in the relevant credit institutions erste group applies article 84 crr according to austrian transitional provisions 40
of the noneligible minorities have to be excluded from consolidated own funds in 2015 as erste group applies the austrian transitional
provisions on grouplevel this percentage has been applied to the exclusion of minority interests in own funds as of 31 december 2015
amounts that relate to minority interests in other comprehensive income are neither included in the consolidated own funds of erste
group according to the final crr provisions nor during the transitional period

consideration of nonconsolidated financial sector entities and deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability arising from
temporary differences within the calculation of consolidated common equity tier 1 of erste group
carrying amounts representing the investments in financial sector entities as defined in article 4 27 crr that are not fully consolidated
or considered by using the at equity method for regulatory purposes have to be deducted from the own funds based on the requirements as
defined in articles 36 1 h 45 and 46 crr for nonsignificant investments and articles 36 1 i crr article 43 45 47 and 48 crr
for significant investments for these purposes nonsignificant investments are defined as investments in financial sector entities in which
the participation is equal to or less than 10 of common equity tier 1 cet 1 of the relevant financial sector entities while significant
investments are defined as investments that are above 10 of the cet 1 of the relevant financial sector entities to determine the partici
pation in the relevant financial sector entities these participations are calculated based on the direct indirect and synthetic holdings in the
relevant entities

according to article 46 1 a crr holdings in nonsignificant investments have to be deducted only if the total amount for such in
vestments including additional tier 1 items according to article 56 c and 59 crr and tier 2 items according to article 66 c and 70
crr exceeds a defined threshold of 10 in relation to cet1 of the reporting institution the deduction shall be applied to the amount
that exceeds the 10 threshold amounts that are equal to or less than 10 of the cet1 of the reporting institution are considered with
the applicable risk weights according part 3 title ii chapter 2 respectively chapter 3 and if necessary according to the requirements of part
3 title iv within the rwas based on the requirements according to article 46 4 crr

for the deduction of significant investments in the cet1 of financial sector entities a threshold is defined in article 48 2 crr accord
ing to article 48 2 crr significant investments in the cet1 of financial sector entities have to be deducted only if they exceed 10 of
the cet1 of the reporting institution if the 10 threshold is exceeded the deduction is limited to the amount by which the defined
threshold is exceeded the remaining amount has to be considered within the calculation of the rwas the risk weight rw is defined at
250 according to article 48 4 crr

in addition to the aforementioned threshold a combined threshold for the deduction of significant investments according to article 36 1
i crr and for deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability and arise from temporary differences according to article 36 1 c
crr as well as according to article 38 crr is defined in article 48 2 crr the combined threshold according to article 48 2 crr is
defined at 1765 of the cet1 of the reporting institution if the threshold is exceeded the exceeding amount has to be deducted from the
cet1 of the reporting institution the remaining amount has to be considered within the rwas a 250 risk weight rw shall be ap
plied for the amount not exceeding the 1765 threshold according to article 48 4 crr

beside the 1765 combined threshold a 10 threshold related to the cet1 capital of the reporting institution is applied for deferred tax
assets that rely on future profitability arising from temporary differences according to article 48 3 crr in case the amount for deferred


98

tax assets that rely on future profitability and which arise from temporary differences exceeds the threshold of 10 of cet1 of the report
ing institution the exceeding amount has to be deducted from the cet1 of the reporting institution the amount that is equal to or less
than the threshold as defined in article 48 3 crr has to be considered within the calculation of rwas with a 250 risk weight rw
according to article 48 4 crr

at the reporting date erste group did not exceed any of the aforementioned thresholds hence direct indirect and synthetic investments
in financial sector entities were not deducted from the consolidated own funds of erste group and therefore are considered in rwas

trading and fair value result interest incomeexpense related to derivatives in fair value hedges is reported in the income statement in the
line item net interest income

the effective part of changes in the fair value clean price of derivatives in cash flow hedges is reported in other comprehensive income
in the line item cash flow hedge reserve the ineffective part of changes in the fair value clean price of derivatives in cash flow hedges
is recognised in profit or loss under the line item net trading and fair value result interest incomeexpense from hedging derivatives in
cash flow hedges is disclosed in the income statement in the line item net interest income

v financial assets and financial liabilities  held for trading
financial assets and financial liabilities  held for trading comprise derivatives and other trading assets and liabilities treatment of deriv
atives  held for trading is discussed above in iv

other trading assets and liabilities are nonderivative instruments they include debt securities as well as equity instruments acquired or
issued principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term in the balance sheet they are presented as other trading
assets or other trading liabilities under the heading financial assets  financial liabilities  held for trading 

changes in fair value clean price for debt instruments resulting from other trading assets and liabilities are reported in the income state
ment under the line item net trading and fair value result interest income and expenses are reported in the income statement under the
line item net interest income dividend income is shown under the line item dividend income
if securities purchased under agreement to resell or borrowed through securities lending transactions are subsequently sold to third parties
the obligation to return the securities is recorded as a short sale within other trading liabilities

vi financial assets or financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss
financial assets or financial liabilities classified in this category are those that have been designated by management on initial recognition
fair value option

erste group uses the fair value option in the case of financial assets managed on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented
investment strategy the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and regularly reported to the management board the portfolio contains
mostly items of asset backed securities predominantly mortgage backed securities funds financials and sovereigns


                                                                                                                                            123

financial assets  designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value under the line item finan
cial assets  designated at fair value through profit or loss with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement under the line
item net trading and fair value result interest earned on debt instruments is reported under the line item net interest income dividend
income on equity instruments is shown under the line item dividend income

furthermore erste group uses the fair value option in the case of some hybrid financial liabilities this is relevant when
 _ such classification eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch between the financial liability otherwise measured at
    amortised cost and the related derivative measured at fair value or
 _ the entire hybrid contract is designated at fair value through profit or loss due to the existence of an embedded derivative

the amount of fair value change attributable to changes in own credit risk for financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or
loss is calculated by the method described by ifrs 7 this amount is the difference between the present value of the liability and the
observed market price of the liability at the end of the period the rate used for discounting the liability is the sum of the observed
benchmark interest rate at the end of the period and the instrumentspecific component of the internal rate of return determined at the
start of the period

financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are reported on the balance sheet under the line item financial liabilities
designated at fair value through profit or loss further broken down into deposits both from customers and banks debt securities
issued and other financial liabilities changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement under the line item net trading and
fair value result interest incurred is reported under the line item net interest income

vii financial assets  available for sale
availableforsale financial assets include debt and equity securities as well as other interests in entities with lower than significant influ
ence equity investments classified as available for sale are those that are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value
through profit or loss debt securities in this category are those that are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time and that may
be sold in response to needs for liquidity or in response to changes in market conditions

availableforsale financial assets are measured at fair value on the balance sheet availableforsale financial assets are disclosed under
the line item financial assets  available for sale

unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and reported in the available for sale reserve until the finan
cial asset is disposed of or impaired if availableforsale assets are disposed of or impaired the cumulative gain or loss previously recog
nised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss and reported in the line item gainslosses on financial assets and
liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss net in the case of sale or in the line item net impairment loss on financial
assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss in the case of impairment

interest income on availableforsale financial assets is reported under the line item net interest income dividend income is reported
under the line item dividend income

if the fair value of investments in nonquoted equity instruments cannot be measured reliably they are recorded at cost less impairment
this is the case when the range of reasonable fair value estimates as calculated by valuation models is significant and the probabilities of
the various estimates cannot be reasonably assessed there is no market for such investments

viii financial assets  held to maturity
nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as heldtomaturity and reported
on the balance sheet as financial assets  held to maturity if erste group has the intention and ability to hold them until maturity after
initial recognition heldtomaturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost amortised cost is calculated by taking into account
any discount premium andor transaction costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate

interest earned on financial assets held to maturity is reported in the income statement under the line item net interest income losses
arising from impairment of such financial assets are presented as net impairment loss on financial assets not measured at fair value
through profit or loss occasional realised gains or losses from selling are recognised in the income statement under the line item
gainslosses on financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss net

ix loans and receivables
the balance sheet line items loans and receivables to credit institutions includes financial instruments which are allocated to financial
instrument category loans and receivables with a contractual maturity of more that 24 hours the balance sheet line items loans and
receivables to customers includes financial instruments which are allocated to financial instrument category loans and receivables with a
contractual maturity of more that 24 hours furthermore finance lease receivables that are accounted for using ias 17 are presented under
these balance sheet line items

loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets including debt securities with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market other than
 _ those that erste group intends to sell immediately or in the near term and those that erste group upon initial recognition designates as
   at fair value through profit or loss
 _ those that erste group upon initial recognition designates as available for sale or
 _ those for which erste group may not recover substantially all of its initial investment other than because of credit deterioration

after initial recognition loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost finance lease receivables are subsequently measured as
specified in the chapter leasing interest income earned is included under the line item net interest income in the income statement

impairment losses arising from loans and receivables are recognised in the income statement under the line item net impairment loss on
financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss 

x financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost unless they are measured at fair value through profit or loss

for presentation on the balance sheet the line item financial liabilities measured at amortised cost is used the liabilities are further
broken down by deposits from banks deposits from customers debt securities issued and other financial liabilities

interest expenses incurred are reported in the line item net interest income in the income statement gains and losses from derecognition
mainly repurchase of financial liabilities at amortised cost are reported under the line item gainslosses from financial assets and liabili
ties not measured at fair value through profit or loss net

furthermore two additional classes of financial instruments which are not presented in the table above are part of ifrs 7 disclosures
these are financial guarantees and irrevocable credit commitments




                                                                                                                                                                      125

embedded derivatives
erste group as part of its business is confronted with debt instruments containing structured features structured features mean that a
derivative is embedded in the host instruments embedded derivatives are separated from the host debt instruments if
 _ the economic characteristics of the derivatives are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host debt instruments
 _ the embedded derivative meets the ias 39 definition of derivative and
 _ the hybrid instrument is not a financial asset or liability held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss

embedded derivatives that are separated are accounted for as standalone derivatives and presented on the balance sheet under the line
item derivatives in financial assets  held for trading and financial liabilities  held for trading

at erste group derivatives that are not closely related and are separated are predominantly embedded in issued host debt instruments
recognised as liabilities the most typical cases are issues of bonds and deposits that contain interest caps floors or collars in the money
cms bonds without appropriate cap contractual features linking payments to noninterest variables such as fx rates equity and com
modity prices and indices or thirdparty credit risk

in december 2014 as well as during the first half of 2015 some important benchmark interest rates became negative in the financial year
2015 erste group issued floating rate loans especially interest rates based on euribor and libor benchmarks with a zero percent
interest rate floor in the area of customer business hence these contracts were analyzed in greater detail the further investigation re
vealed that a separation of embedded derivatives from the underlying transaction is not needed

reclassifications of financial assets
ias 39 provides various possibilities to reclassify financial assets between categories of financial instruments it also places restrictions
on some reclassifications erste group makes use of reclassification alternatives only in the case of heldtomaturity financial assets if a
significant credit deterioration in a heldtomaturity financial asset results in a change in the intention and ability to hold the asset until
maturity the asset is reclassified into the availableforsale financial assets category furthermore reclassifications are done in case of
sales which are performed closed to the maturity date such reclassifications are not included in the limit that triggers automatic reclassi
fication of the entire heldtomaturity portfolio

derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
a financial asset or where applicable part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised when

 _ the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or
 _ erste group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset
   or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a passthrough ar
   rangement and either
   _ it has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards connected with the ownership of the asset or
   _ has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards connected with the ownership of the asset but has trans
     ferred control of the asset

a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged cancelled or expires

repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements
transactions where securities are sold under an agreement to repurchase at a specified future date are also known as repos or sale and
repurchase agreements securities sold are not derecognised from the balance sheet as erste group retains substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership because the securities are repurchased when the repo transaction ends furthermore erste group is the beneficiary
of all the coupons and other income payments received on the transferred assets over the period of the repo transactions these payments
are remitted to erste group or are reflected in the repurchase price

the corresponding cash received is recognised on the balance sheet with a corresponding obligation to return it as a liability under the line
item financial liabilities measured at amortised cost subitems deposits from banks or deposits from customers reflecting the trans
actions economic substance as a loan to erste group the difference between the sale and repurchase prices is treated as interest expense
and recorded in the income statement under the line item net interest income and is accrued over the life of the agreement financial
assets transferred out by erste group under repurchase agreements remain on the groups balance sheet and are measured according to
the rules applicable to the respective balance sheet item



126

conversely securities purchased under agreements to resell at a specified future date are not recognised on the balance sheet such trans
actions are also known as reverse repos the consideration paid is recorded on the balance sheet under the respective line items loans
and receivables to credit institutions or loans and receivables to customers reflecting the transactions economic substance as a loan by
erste group the difference between the purchase and resale prices is treated as interest income and is accrued over the life of the agree
ment and recorded in the income statement under the line item net interest income

securities lending and borrowing
in securities lending transactions the lender transfers ownership of securities to the borrower on the condition that the borrower will
retransfer at the end of the agreed loan term ownership of instruments of the same type quality and quantity and will pay a fee deter
mined by the duration of the lending the transfer of the securities to counterparties via securities lending does not result in derecognition
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by erste group as a lender because the securities are received at the end
of the securities lending transaction furthermore erste group is the beneficiary of all the coupons and other income payments received
on the transferred assets over the period of the securities lendings

securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet unless they are then sold to third parties in this case the obligation to return
the securities is recorded as other trading liability

impairment of financial assets and credit risk losses of contingent liabilities
erste group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
impaired a financial asset or group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if and only if there is objective evidence of impairment
as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event
or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably
estimated

erste group uses the crr definition of default as a primary indicator of loss events default as a loss event occurs when
 _ the obligor is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation
 _ as a result of specific information or an event the obligor is unlikely to fulfil its credit obligations in full without recourse to actions
    such as realising security
 _ the obligor is subject to distressed restructuring ie a change in contract terms for clients in financial difficulties resulting in a mate
    rial loss
 _ the obligor is subject to bankruptcy or similar protection proceedings

for assessment at portfolio level erste group uses the incurred but not reported losses concept it identifies the time period between the
moment of the loss event causing future problems and actual detection of the problems by the bank at the moment of default

credit risk losses resulting from contingent liabilities are recognised if it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources to settle a
credit risk bearing contingent liability that will result in a loss

i financial assets carried at amortised cost
erste group first assesses individually for significant loans and heldtomaturity securities whether objective evidence of impairment
exists if no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset erste group includes the asset in a group
of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment assets that are individually as
sessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of
impairment

if an impairment loss has been incurred the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and
the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate the calculation of the present value
of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset also reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less
costs for obtaining and selling the collateral

impairment losses on financial assets carried at amortised cost are recognised as loss allowance on the balance sheet loss allowances
decrease the value of the assets ie the net carrying amount of the financial asset presented on the balance sheet is the difference between
the gross carrying amount and the cumulative loss allowance this treatment holds for loss allowances for loans and receivables and for
incurred but not reported losses ie portfolio allowances on heldtomaturity financial assets reconciliation of changes in these loss



                                                                                                                                              127

allowance accounts is disclosed in the notes however individual loss allowances for held to maturity financial assets are treated as direct
reduction of the asset carrying amount and therefore reconciliation of changes is not disclosed in the notes

in the income statement impairment losses and their reversals are presented in the line item net impairment loss on financial assets
loans together with the associated allowance are removed from the balance sheet when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery
and all collaterals have been realised by erste group

if in a subsequent year the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases the previously recognised impairment loss is
increased or reduced by adjusting the loss allowance

ii availableforsale financial assets
in cases of debt instruments classified as available for sale erste group assesses individually whether there is objective evidence of im
pairment based on the same criteria as used for financial assets carried at amortised cost however the amount recorded for impairment is
the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the amortised cost and the current fair value less any impairment loss on that
asset previously recognised in the income statement on recognising impairment any loss retained in the other comprehensive income
item available for sale reserve is reclassified to the income statement and shown as an impairment loss under the line item net impair
ment loss on financial assets

if in a subsequent period the fair value of a debt instrument increases which can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
impairment was recognized impairmnet loss is reveresed thorugh the income statement under the line item gainslosses impairment
losses and their reversals are recognized directly against the assets on the balance sheet

in cases of equity investments classified as available for sale objective evidence also includes a significant or prolonged decline
in the fair value of the investment below its cost for this purpose at erste group significant decline means a market price below
80 of the acquisition cost and prolonged decline refers to a market price that is permanently below the acquisition cost for a
period of nine months up to the reporting date

where there is evidence of impairment on equity investments the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost
and the current fair value less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the income statement is shown as an
impairment loss in the income statement under the line item net impairment loss on financial assets any loss previously recognised
under the other comprehensive income item available for sale reserve has to be reclassified to the income statement as part of an im
pairment loss under the line item net impairment loss on financial assets

impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the income statement increases in the fair value after impairment are
recognised directly in other comprehensive income impairment losses and their reversals are recognised directly against the assets on the
balance sheet

for investment in unquoted equity instruments carried at cost because their fair value cannot be determined reliably the amount of the
impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future
cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset such impairment losses shall not be reversed

iii contingent liabilities
provisions for credit losses of contingent liabilities particularly financial guarantees as well as credit commitments are included under
the balance sheet line item provisions the related expense or its reversal is reported in the income statement under the line item other
operating result

hedge accounting
erste group makes use of derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk at inception of a
hedge relationship the bank formally documents the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument including the
nature of the risk the objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the
hedging relationship a hedge is expected to be highly effective if the changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk
during the period for which the hedge is designated are expected to offset the fair value changes of the hedging instrument in a range of
80 to 125 hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and throughout the term of each hedging relationship exact conditions for
particular types of hedges and for testing the hedge effectiveness by erste group are specified internally in the hedge accounting policy



128

i fair value hedges
fair value hedges are employed to reduce market risk for qualifying and designated fair value hedges the change in the fair value clean
price of a hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement under the line item net trading and fair value result interest income
and expenses on hedging derivatives are reported under the line item net interest income the change in the fair value of the hedged
item attributable to the hedged risk is also recognised in the income statement under the line item net trading and fair value result and
adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item

erste group also uses portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk as regulated by ias 39ag114ag132 currently only interest rate
risk from issued bonds is being hedged ie no assets are included as hedged items the change in the fair value of the hedged items
attributable to the hedged interest risk is presented on the balance sheet under the line item changes in fair value of portfolio hedged
items erste group does not make use of the relaxation of hedge accounting requirements provided for portfolio fair value hedges by the
eu carveout

if the hedging instrument expires is sold is terminated or is exercised or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge account
ing the hedge relationship is terminated in this case the fair value adjustment of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement
under the line item net interest income until maturity of the financial instrument

ii cash flow hedges
cash flow hedges are used to eliminate uncertainty in the future cash flows in order to stabilise net interest income for designated and
qualifying cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive
income and reported under the cash flow hedge reserve the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recog
nised in the income statement under the line item net trading and fair value result for determination of the effective and ineffective
portions the derivative is considered at its clean price ie excluding the interest component if the hedged cash flow affects the income
statement the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is reclassified from other comprehensive income on the corresponding income or
expense line item in the income statement mainly net interest income as far as accounting for hedged items in cash flow hedges is
concerned there is no change compared to the situation when no hedging is applied

when a hedging instrument expires is sold is terminated is exercised or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting
the hedge relationship is terminated in this case the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other
comprehensive income remains in cash flow hedge reserve until the transaction occurs

offsetting financial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported on the balance sheet if and only if there is a currently
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously since second quarter of 2015 erste group undertakes interest rate derivative transactions via london clearing
house by fulfilling all offsetting requirements according ias 32 the offsetted amounts are disclosed in note 13 derivatives  held for
trading and note 22 derivatives  hedge accounting

determination of fair value
fair value is the price that would be received if an asset were sold or paid if a liability were transferred in an orderly transaction between
market participants on the measurement date

details on valuation techniques applied for fair value measurement and on the fair value hierarchy are disclosed in note 46 fair value of
assets and liabilities

leasing
a lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time in return for a pay
ment or series of payments a finance lease at erste group is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of an asset all other lease agreements at erste group are classified as operating leases

erste group as a lessor
the lessor in the case of a finance lease reports a receivable from the lessee under the line item loans and receivables to customers or
loans and receivables to credit institutions the receivable is equal to the present value of the contractually agreed payments taking into
account any residual value interest income on the receivable is reported in the income statement under the line item net interest income



                                                                                                                                             129

in the case of operating leases the leased asset is reported by the lessor in property and equipment or in investment properties and is
depreciated in accordance with the principles applicable to the assets involved lease income is recognised on a straightline basis over
the lease term in the income statement under the line item rental income from investment properties  other operating leases

lease agreements in which erste group is the lessor almost exclusively comprise finance leases

erste group as a lessee
as a lessee erste group has not entered into any leases meeting the conditions of finance leases operating lease payments are recognised
as an expense in the income statement on the line item other administrative expenses on a straightline basis over the lease term

business combinations and goodwill
i business combinations
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting goodwill represents the future economic benefits
resulting from the business combination arising from assets that are not individually identified and separately recognised goodwill is
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred the amount of any noncontrolling interests and the fair value of the
previously held equity interest over the net of the acquisitiondate amounts of the identifiable assets acquired as well as the liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are generally recognised at their fair values

if after reassessment of all components described above the calculation results in a negative amount it is recognised as a bargain pur
chase gain and reported in the income statement under the line item other operating result in the year of acquisition

noncontrolling interests that are present ownership interests in the acquiree are measured at the proportionate share of the acquirees
identifiable net assets other types of noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value or when applicable on the basis specified in

ii goodwill and goodwill impairment testing
goodwill arising on acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established as of the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated
impairment losses if any goodwill is tested for impairment annually in november or whenever there is an indication of possible im
pairment during the year with any impairment determined recognised in profit or loss the impairment test is carried out for each cash
generating unit cgu to which goodwill has been allocated a cgu is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash in
flows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets

goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each cgu to which goodwill has been allocated with its car
rying amount the carrying amount of a cgu is based on the amount of net asset value allocated to the cgu taking into account any
goodwill and unamortised intangible assets recognised for the cgu at the time of business combination

the recoverable amount is the higher of a cgus fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use where available the fair value less
costs of disposal is determined based on recent transactions market quotations or appraisals the value in use is determined using a dis
counted cash flow model dcf model which incorporates the specifics of the banking business and its regulatory environment in de
termining value in use the present value of future earnings distributable to shareholders is calculated

the estimation of future earnings distributable to shareholders is based on financial plans for the cgus as agreed by the management
while taking into account the fulfilment of the respective regulatory capital requirements the planning period is five years any forecast
ed earnings beyond the planning period are derived on the basis of the last year of the planning period and a longterm growth rate the
present value of such perpetual earnings growing at a stable rate referred to as terminal value takes into consideration macroeconomic
parameters and economically sustainable cash flows for each cgu values for the longterm growth rates are disclosed in note 27 intan
gible assets in the subsection development of goodwill

the cash flows are determined by subtracting the annual capital requirement generated by a change in the amount of riskweighted assets
from the net profit the capital requirement was defined through the target tier 1 ratio in light of the expected future minimum regulatory
capital requirements

the value in use is determined by discounting the cash flows at a rate that takes into account present market rates and the specific risks of
the cgu the discount rates have been determined based on the capital asset pricing model capm according to the capm the dis
count rate comprises a riskfree interest rate together with a market risk premium that itself is multiplied by a factor that represents the


130

systematic market risk beta factor furthermore a countryrisk premium component is considered in calculation of the discount rate
the values used to establish the discount rates are determined using external sources of information discount rates applied to determine
the value in use are disclosed in note 27 intangible assets in the subsection development of goodwill

where the recoverable amount of a cgu is less than its carrying amount the difference is recognised as an impairment loss in the income
statement under the line item other operating result the impairment loss is allocated first to write down the cgus goodwill any
remaining impairment loss reduces the carrying amount of the cgus other assets though not to an amount lower than their fair value
less costs of disposal no impairment loss is recognised if the recoverable amount of the cgu is higher than or equal to its carrying
amount impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods

the goodwill included in the acquisition cost of investments in associates and joint ventures is not tested separately by performing the
recurring impairment assessments applicable to goodwill instead the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment as
a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount higher of fair value in use and fair value less costs to sell with its carrying amount
after application of the equity method whenever relevant objective evidence of impairment is identified such evidence includes infor
mation about significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological market economic or legal environ
ments in which associates and joint ventures operate indicating that the cost of the investment may not be recovered

property and equipment
property and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment borrowing costs for qualifying
assets are capitalised into the costs of property and equipment

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method to write down the cost of property and equipment to their residual values over
their estimated useful lives depreciation is recognised in the income statement on the line item depreciation and amortisation and
impairment under the line item other operating result

the estimated useful lives are as follows
                                                                                                                            useful life in years

land is not depreciated

property and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use any gain or loss
arising on disposal of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is
recognised in the income statement under the line item other operating result

investment properties
investment property is property land and buildings or part of a building or both held for the purpose of earning rental income or for
capital appreciation in the case of partial own use the property is investment property only if the owneroccupied portion is insignificant
investments in land and buildings under construction where the future use is expected to be the same as for investment property are
treated as investment property

investment property is measured initially at cost including transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition investment property is
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment investment property is presented on the balance sheet in the line item
investment properties

rental income is recognised in the line item rental income from investment properties and other operating leases depreciation is pre
sented in the income statement in the line item depreciation and amortisation using the straightline method over an estimated useful
life the useful lives of investment properties are identical to those of buildings reported under property and equipment any impairment
losses as well as their reversals are recognised under the income statement line item other operating result




                                                                                                                                           131

property held for sale inventory
the group also invests in property that is held for sale in the ordinary course of business or property in the process of construction or
development for such sale this property is presented as other assets and is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value in
accordance with ias 2 inventories

the cost of acquiring inventory includes not only the purchase price but also all other directly attributable expenses such as transportation
costs customs duties other taxes and costs of conversion of inventories etc borrowing costs are capitalised to the extent to which they
directly relate to the acquisition of real estate

sales of these assetsapartments are recognised as revenues under the income statement line item other operating result together with
costs of sales and other costs incurred in selling the assets

intangible assets
in addition to goodwill erste groups intangible assets include computer software and customer relationships the brand the distribution
network and other intangible assets an intangible asset is recognised only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that
the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to it will flow to the bank

costs of internally generated software are capitalised if erste group can demonstrate the technical feasibility and intention of completing
the software the ability to use it how it will generate probable economic benefits the availability of resources and the ability to measure
the expenditures reliably intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost following initial recognition
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses

the cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as of the date of acquisition in the case of erste group
these are brands customer relationships and distribution networks and they are capitalised on acquisition if they can be measured with
sufficient reliability

intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives using the straightline method the amortisation period
and method are reviewed at least at each financial yearend and adjusted if necessary the amortisation expense on intangible assets with
finite lives is recognised in the income statement under the line item depreciation and amortisation

the estimated useful lives are as follows
                                                                                                                             useful life in years
computer software                                                                                                                            48
customer relationships                                                                                                                     1020
distribution network                                                                                                                         55


brands are not amortised as they are assumed to have an indefinite useful life an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life if there are
no legal contractual regulatory or other factors limiting that useful life brands are tested for impairment annually within the cash
generating unit to which they belong and impairment is recognised if appropriate furthermore each period brands are reviewed as to
whether current circumstances continue to support the conclusion as to indefinite life in the event of impairment impairment losses are
recognised in the income statement under the line item other operating result

impairment of nonfinancial assets property and equipment investment properties intangible assets
the bank assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that a nonfinancial asset may be impaired testing for impairment
is done at individual asset level if the asset generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets the typical case
is investment property otherwise the impairment test is carried out at the level of the cashgenerating unit cgu to which the asset
belongs a cgu is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
from other assets or groups of assets for specific rules related to impairment of goodwill and impairment allocation rules for cgus
please see the chapter business combinations and goodwill part ii goodwill and goodwill impairment testing

if any indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required the bank estimates the assets recovera
ble amount an assets recoverable amount is the higher of the assets or cgus fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use if the
carrying amount of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recovera
ble amount in measuring value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset


132

at each reporting date an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no
longer exist or may have decreased if such an indication exists the bank estimates the assets or cgus recoverable amount the previ
ously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised the reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its
recoverable amount or does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation had no impairment loss
been recognised for the asset in prior years

impairments and their reversals are recognised in the income statement under the line item other operating result

noncurrent assets and disposal groups held for sale
noncurrent assets are classified as held for sale if they can be sold in their present condition and the sale is highly probable within 12
months of classification as held for sale if assets are to be sold as part of a group that may also contain liabilities eg a subsidiary they
are referred to as disposal group held for sale

assets classified as held for sale and assets belonging to disposal groups held for sale are reported under the balance sheet line item as
sets held for sale liabilities belonging to the disposal groups held for sale are presented on the balance sheet under the line item liabili
ties associated with assets held for sale

noncurrent assets and disposal groups that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell should the impairment loss in a disposal group exceed the carrying amount of the assets that are within the scope of ifrs 5
measurement requirements there is no specific guidance on how to treat such a difference erste group recognises this difference as a
provision under the balance sheet line item provisions

financial guarantees
in the ordinary course of business erste group provides financial guarantees consisting of various types of letters of credit and guaran
tees according to ias 39 a financial guarantee is a contract that requires the guarantor to make specified payments to reimburse the
holder for a loss it incurs in case a specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of
a debt instrument

if erste group is in a position of being a guarantee holder the financial guarantee is not recorded on the balance sheet but is taken into
consideration as collateral when determining impairment of the guaranteed asset

erste group as a guarantor recognises financial guarantees as soon as it becomes a contracting party ie when the guarantee offer is
accepted financial guarantees are initially measured at fair value generally the initial measurement is the premium received for a guar
antee if no premium is received at contract inception the fair value of a financial guarantee is nil as this is the price that would be paid to
transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants subsequent to initial recognition the financial guarantee con
tract is reviewed for the possibility that provisioning will be required under ias 37 such provisions are presented on the balance sheet
under the line provisions

the premium received is recognised in the income statement under the line item net fee and commission income on a straightline basis
over the life of the guarantee

defined employee benefit plans
defined employee benefit plans operated by erste group are for pensions severance and jubilee benefits from ias 19 categorisation
perspective pension and severance benefits qualify as postemployment defined benefits plans whereas jubilee benefits are other long
term employee benefits

the defined benefit pension plans relate only to retired employees the pension obligations for current employees were transferred to
external pension funds in previous years remaining with erste group is a definedbenefit obligation for entitlements of former employ
ees who were already retired as of 31 december 1998 before the pension reform took effect and for those former employees who retired
only in 1999 but remained entitled to a direct pension from erste group under individual agreements also included are entitlements to
resulting survivor pensions

severance benefit obligations exist in relation to austrian employees who entered the groups employment before 1 january 2003 the
severance benefit is onetime remuneration to which employees are entitled when their employment relationship ends the entitlement to


                                                                                                                                             133

this severance payment arises after three years of employment definedbenefit plans include jubilee benefits jubilee payments payments
for long service andor loyal service are remuneration tied to the length of an employees service to the employer the entitlement to jubilee
benefits is established by collective agreement which defines both the conditions and amount of the entitlement

obligations ensuing from defined employee benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method future obligations are
determined based on actuarial expert opinions the calculation takes into account not only those salaries pensions and vested rights to
future pension payments known as of the balance sheet date but also anticipated future rates of increase in salaries and pensions

the liability recognised under a definedbenefit plan represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the
plan assets available for the direct settlement of obligations for all plans the present value of the obligation exceeds the fair value of the
plan assets the resulting defined benefit liability is reported on the balance sheet under the line item provisions at erste group the
plan assets consist of qualifying insurance policies purchased to back severance and jubilee benefit provisions

remeasurements consist of actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit obligations and the return on plan assets remeasurements of
pension and severance definedbenefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive income remeasurements of jubilee definedbenefit
plans are recognised in the income statement under the line item personnel expenses

provisions
provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event it is probable that an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation
on the balance sheet provisions are reported under the line item provisions they include credit risk loss provisions for contingent
liabilities particularly financial guarantees and loan commitments as well as provisions for litigation and restructuring expenses or
income related to provisions are reported under the line item other operating result

taxes
i current tax
current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the
taxation authorities the tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amounts are those enacted by the balance sheet date

ii deferred tax
deferred tax is recognised for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts as of the
balance sheet date deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences deferred tax assets are recognised for all
deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
the deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised deferred taxes are not recognised on tempo
rary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill

the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised unrecognised deferred tax assets are
reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the
deferred tax asset to be recovered

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the temporary difference is
reversed or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at balance sheet
date and are expected to apply when the temporary differences are reversed for the subsidiaries local tax environments apply

deferred tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the
income statement

deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right to offset exists and the deferred taxes relate to the
same taxation authority

treasury shares and contracts on treasury shares
equity instruments of erste group that it or any of its subsidiaries acquire referred to as treasury shares are deducted from equity con
sideration paid or received on the purchase sale issue or cancellation of erste groups own equity instruments including transaction

d significant accounting judgements assumptions and estimates

the consolidated financial statements contain amounts that have been determined on the basis of judgements and by the use of estimates
and assumptions the estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors such as planning as well as
expectations and forecasts of future events that are currently deemed to be reasonable as a consequence of the uncertainty associated
with these assumptions and estimates actual results could in future periods lead to adjustments in the carrying amounts of the related
assets or liabilities the most significant uses of judgements assumptions and estimates are as follows

control
ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements defines the investors control over an investee in terms of the investor having all of the
following


136

 _ power to direct the relevant activities of the investee ie activities that significantly affect the investees returns
 _ exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and
 _ the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investors returns

hence assessing the existence of control under this definition may require considerable accounting judgements assumptions and esti
mates notably in nonstandard situations such as
 _ power stemming both from voting rights and from contractual arrangements or mostly from the latter
 _ exposure stemming both from onbalance investments and from offbalance commitments or guarantees or mostly from the latter or
 _ variable returns stemming both from readily identifiable income streams eg dividends interest fees and from cost savings econo
   mies of scale andor operational synergies or mostly from the latter

in the case of erste group such accounting judgements assumptions and estimates have been primarily relevant for the assessment of the
following cases

i the savings bank members of the austrian crossguarantee system haftungsverbund
erste group bank ag is a member of the haftungsverbund crossguarantee system of the austrian savings bank sector as of the bal
ance sheet date all of austrias savings banks in addition to erste group bank ag and erste bank der oesterreichischen sparkassen ag
formed part of this crossguarantee system the provisions of the agreement governing the haftungsverbund are implemented by the
steering company haftungsverbund gmbh erste group bank ag always holds directly and indirectly at least 51 of the voting rights of
the steering company through erste bank der oesterreichischen sparkassen ag and through savings banks in which the group holds the
majority of voting rights

for all savings banks in which erste group holds less than 50 of the voting rights an assessment of whether control is achieved through
the provisions of the haftungsverbund agreement has been performed

based on the contractual agreement haftungsverbund gmbh as the steering company is vested with the following substantive rights
related to the savings banks
  _ participation in the appointment of board members
  _ approval of budgets including capital decisions
  _ provision of binding guidelines in the areas of risk and liquidity management as well as internal audit
  _ determination of thresholds for capital requirement including the payout of dividends

furthermore taking into account the magnitude of erste groups involvement with the member banks  whether in the form of synergies
investments commitments guarantees or access to common resources  the group has significant exposure to each of the member banks
variable returns as haftungsverbund gmbh is able to affect the variable returns through its power it has been assessed that haftungsver
bund gmbh has control over the savings banks

as erste group bank ag controls the steering company it exercises control over the members of the crossguarantee system

ii investment funds under own management
the group has assessed whether the investment funds it manages through its asset management subsidiaries are controlled and hence
shall be consolidated this assessment has been made on the basis that power over such investment funds is generally conferred based on
the contractual arrangements appointing an erste group subsidiary as fund manager without any substantive removal rights the by funds
investors furthermore erste group made the conclusive judgement that its exposure to such ownmanaged funds variable returns is
basically considered as significant if additionally to the exposure through management fees the group is also exposed in the form of at
least 20 investment in the fund furthermore in its capacity as fund manager erste group is also able to affect the returns of the funds
through its power following this assessment investment funds under own management in which the group  directly or through its sub
sidiaries  has significant unit holdings are deemed to be controlled and included in the scope of consolidation

iii pension funds under own management
the group has assessed whether the contractual arrangements appointing an erste group subsidiary as pension fund manager with no
substantive removal rights by the funds participants are generally expected to confer power over such funds followed by an assessment
of the groups exposurerights to the pension funds variable returns the relevant legal requirements regulating the activities of such
pension funds in their respective jurisdictions were also considered notably in assessing the significance of the rights to variable returns
from management fees as well as of the exposure to losses from any guarantees that the fund manager may be legally bound to


                                                                                                                                        137

as a result of this review the czech pension fund transformovaný fond penzijního připojištění se státním příspěvkem česká spořitelna 
penzijní společnost as the transformed pension fund has been deconsolidated with effect from with 2014 as a result of significant
statutory changes in the funds articles of incorporation these changes resulted in the narrowing of the fund managers investment man
date limiting the scope of the fund managers decision making authority and restricting the managers and therefore erste groups
exposure to the funds variability of returns and other interests including guarantees

joint control and classification of joint arrangements
ifrs 11 joint arrangements defines joint control as a contractual sharing of control whereby decisions about the relevant activities
require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control furthermore ifrs 11 distinguishes between joint operations and joint ven
tures joint operations are defined as joint arrangements whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the
assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the parties that have
joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement

hence assessing either the existence of joint control or the type of joint arrangement or both under these definitions may require con
siderable accounting judgements assumptions and estimates

in the case of erste group such accounting judgements assumptions and estimates have been primarily relevant for the assessment of the
groups involvement in partnerships and ventures in the commercial real estate sector development management leasing notably
through erste group immorent ag

as a result of such assessment only one company has been identified as a joint arrangement in force as at 31 december 2015 this com
pany is structured as a separate vehicle qualifying for treatment as a joint venture under the terms of the aforementioned definitions and it
has an immaterial carrying amount below eur 10 million for the ensuing ifrs 12driven disclosure requirements please refer to note
23 equity method investments

for the ensuing ifrs 12driven disclosures applicable to joint ventures and associates please refer to note 23 equity method investments

significant influence
ias 28 investments in associates and joint ventures defines significant influence as the power to participate in the financial and operat
ing policy decisions of the investee without having control or joint control of those policies furthermore ias 28 indicates that if an
entity holds directly or indirectly 20 or more of the voting power of the investee it is presumed that the entity has significant influence
unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case

in the case of erste group all equity method investments are direct or indirect investments in associates and joint ventures over which the
group exercises significant influence or joint control stemming from voting power higher than 20 up to 50

interests in structured entities
ifrs 12 interests in other entities defines structured entities as entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not
the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity such as when any voting rights relate to the administrative tasks only and the
relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements ifrs 12 defines the interests as contractual and noncontractual
involvements exposing an entity to the variability of returns from the performance of the other entity

hence assessing which entities are structured entities and which involvements in such entities are interests may require considerable
accounting judgements assumptions and estimates

in the case of erste group such accounting judgements assumptions and estimates have been primarily relevant for assessing involve
ments with securitisation vehicles and investment funds in respect to securitisation vehicles erste group assessed that onbalance or off
balance exposures to entities involved in securitisation activities meet the definition of interests in structured entities for investment
funds erste group concluded that such investment funds would typically satisfy the characteristics of a structured entity  irrespective of
whether they are ownmanaged funds or third party managed funds moreover the group reached the conclusion that direct group in
vestments higher than 0 and management fees varying in relation to the assets under management and are not distributed full to third
parties would typically indicate an interest in these structured entities in alignment with the accounting judgement described under the
paragraph investment funds under own management above interests below 20 are not consolidated due to lack of control




138

all onbalance or offbalance exposures to investment funds managed by third parties mostly in the form of units held in such funds
were considered as being interests in structured entities

for the ensuing ifrs 12driven disclosures applicable to structured entities please refer to note 24 unconsolidated structured entities

fair value of financial instruments
where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets they
are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models the inputs to these models are de
rived from observable market data where possible but where observable market data is not available judgement is required to establish
fair values disclosures for valuation models the fair value hierarchy and fair values of financial instruments can be found in note 46 fair
value of assets and liabilities

for the valuation of otc derivatives no funding value adjustment fva was considered erste group is analyzing the different devel
opments on the market the observations will be considered in the future methodology

impairment of financial assets
erste group reviews its financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss at each balance sheet date to assess whether an
impairment loss should be recorded in the income statement in particular it is required to determine whether there is objective evidence
of impairment as a result of a loss event occurring after initial recognition and to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows
when determining an impairment loss

disclosures concerning impairment are provided in note 44 risk management in the credit risk subsection entitled  nonperforming
credit risk exposure risk provisions and collateral the development of loan loss provisions is described in note 21 impairment loss for
financial instruments

impairment of nonfinancial assets
erste group reviews its nonfinancial assets at each balance sheet date to assess whether there is an indication of impairment loss that
should be recorded in the income statement furthermore cashgenerating units to which goodwill is allocated are tested for impairment
on a yearly basis judgement and estimates are required to determine the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal by estimating
the timing and amount of future expected cash flows and the discount rates assumptions and estimates used for impairment on non
financial asset calculations are described in the parts business combinations and goodwill and impairment of nonfinancial assets
property and equipment investment property intangible assets in the accounting policies inputs used for goodwill impairment testing
and their sensitivities can be found in note 27 intangible assets in the section development of goodwill

deferred tax assets
deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that
can be recognised based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies for this
purpose a planning period of 5 years is used disclosures concerning deferred taxes are in note 28 tax assets and liabilities

defined benefit obligation plans
the cost of the defined benefit pension plan is determined using an actuarial valuation the actuarial valuation involves making assump
tions about discount rates expected rates of return on assets future salary increases mortality rates and future pension increases assump
tions estimates and sensitivities used for the defined benefit obligation calculations as well as related amounts are disclosed in note 34 a
longterm employee provisions

provisions
recognition of provisions requires judgement with respect to whether erste group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and
whether it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation furthermore
estimates are necessary with respect to the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining the amount of provisions provisions
are disclosed in note 37 provisions and further details on provisions for contingent credit liabilities in note 445 credit risk legal pro
ceedings that do not meet the criteria for recognition of provisions are described in note 49 contingent liabilities

leases
from erste groups perspective as a lessor judgement is required to distinguish whether a given lease is a finance or operating lease based
on the transfer of substantially all the risk and rewards from the lessor to the lessee disclosures concerning leases are in note 39 leases

ating income for a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be antici
pated before the specified minimum threshold is reached retrospective application is required for ifric 21 this interpretation has no
impact on the group as it has applied the recognition principles under ias 37 provisions contingent liabilities and contingent assets

ifrs 9 financial instruments iasb effective date 1 january 2018 ifrs 9 was issued in july 2014 and is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018 ifrs 9 addresses three main areas of accounting for financial instruments classification and
measurement impairment and hedge accounting

ifrs 9 introduces two classification criteria for financial assets 1 an entitys business model for managing the financial assets and 2 the
contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets as a result a financial asset is measured at amortised cost only if both the
following conditions are met a the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely pay


140

ments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and b the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows measurement of a fair value through other comprehensive income is applicable to finan
cial assets that meet condition a but the business model applied to them is focused both on holding the assets to collect contractual cash
flows and selling the assets all other financial assets are measured at fair value with changes recognised in profit or loss for investments
in equity instruments that are not held for trading an entity may make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to measure them at fair
value with changes recognised in other comprehensive income

ifrs 9 does not change classification and measurement principles for financial liabilities compared to ias 39 the only change is related
to financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss fair value option the fair value changes related to the credit risk of
such liabilities will be presented in other comprehensive income

the standard provides a uniform impairment model applied to both financial assets and offbalance sheet credit risk bearing exposures
loan commitments and financial guarantees at initial recognition of financial instruments loss allowance to reflect credit loss is recog
nised in the form of 12month expected credit losses lifetime expected credit losses are to be recognised for all instrument whose credit
risk increases subsequently after initial recognition furthermore the standard brings new rules for accounting for losses resulting from
modification of contractual conditions of financial assets

the objective of the new hedge accounting model is to reflect in accounting actual risk management practices of entities hedging risks
for erste group the following areas are expected to be relevant to achieve this objective only the prospective effectiveness test is re
quired and the retrospective effectiveness test with the 80125 corridor was abandoned when options are used as hedging instru
ments the volatility of the time value is recognised through oci rather than profit or loss the possibility of hedging synthetic items con
taining derivatives

during the year 2015 erste group proceeded with the development of master business concepts and business requirements documenta
tion addressing the changes in policies procedures processes and systems assessed as necessary in preparation for transition to ifrs 9
on 1 january 2018 as part of this effort iterative financial impact studies notably with regards to classificationmeasurement and im
pairment of financial assets were started across the group and are planned to continue throughout 2016 along with gradually moving
from the concept phase to the implementation phase of the documented business requirements

on this basis erste group upholds its original expectations that this standard will have a significant effect on balance sheet items and
measurement methods for financial instruments thus in the area of classification and measurement erste group identified a risk that
part of its loan portfolio will have to be remeasured at fair value through profit or loss due to the contractual cash flow characteristics in
the same time this risk is already actively managed notably by mitigation activities which have been planned and partly started across the
group in respect of the lending products assessed as being at risk of such remeasurement on the other hand some debt securities cur
rently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income may be measured at amortised cost due to the heldtocollect contrac
tual cash flows business model applied to them in the area of impairment loss allowances are expected to increase more than insignifi
cantly for some nondefaulted exposures also the group expects that the structure of the financial statements both main components
and explanatory notes will be have to be adapted notably in the light of the new reporting and disclosure requirements of ifrs7 as
triggered by ifrs9 such adaptions would also consider any new regulatory reporting requirements notably finrep related which eu
or national regulators may contemplate as part of preparing for initial application of ifrs 9 at the level of the wider european and nation
al banking sector

ifrs 9 provides an accounting policy choice in the area of hedge accounting thus upon adoption of ifrs9 entities can either a start
with full application of the hedge accounting requirements of ifrs9 b start with limited application of the hedge accounting require
ments of ifrs9 by continuing to apply ias39 to the specific case of fair value hedges of interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial
assets or financial liabilities or c continue with full application of the hedge accounting requirements of ias39 erste group plans to
implement the third choice however some actions are expected to be necessary in order to address additional disclosures that will be
required based on ifrs7 after adoption of ifrs9

ifrs 14 regulatory deferral accounts iasb effective date 1 january 2016 ifrs 14 regulatory deferral accounts permits an
entity which is a firsttime adopter of international financial reporting standards to continue to account with some limited changes for
regulatory deferral account balances in accordance with its previous gaap both on initial adoption of ifrs and in subsequent financial
statements the european commission has decided not to launch the endorsement process of this interim standard and wait for the final
standard



                                                                                                                                             141

ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers iasb effective date 1 january 2018 ifrs 15 was issued in may 2014 and
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018 ifrs 15 specifies how and when an entity recognises revenue from
contracts with customers it also requires such entities to provide users of financial statements with more informative and more relevant
disclosures the standard provides a single principles based fivestep model to be applied to all contracts with customers also in the
areas of variable considerations and capitalisation of cost ifrs 15 provides modified regulations as the standard is not focused on recog
nition of revenues from financial services application of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on erste groups finan
cial statements

amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28 sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture
iasb effective date 1 january 2016 amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28 were issued in september 2014 and are effective for annu
al periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016these amendments deal with the sale or contribution of assets or subsidiaries in a transac
tion between an investor and its associate or joint venture the main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognised
only when the assets or the subsidiaries constitute a business as defined in ifrs 3 application of these amendments is not expected to
have a significant impact on erste groups financial statements

amendments to ifrs 10 ifrs 12 and ias 28 investment entities applying the consolidation exception iasb effective
date 1 january 2016 the amendments confirm that the exemption from preparing consolidated financial statements for an intermediate
parent entity is available to a parent entity that is a subsidiary of an investment entity even if the investment entity measures all of its sub
sidiaries at fair value also they clarify that when applying the equity method to an associate or a joint venture a noninvestment entity
investor in an investment entity may retain the fair value measurement applied by the associate or joint venture to its interests in subsidiar
ies application of these amendments is not expected to have a significant impact on erste groups financial statements

tributions from employees or third parties that are linked to service must be attributed to periods of service using the same attribution
method as used for the gross benefit however the contribution may be recognised as a reduction in the service cost if the amount of the
contributions is independent of the number of years of service application of these amendments is not expected to have a significant
impact on erste groups financial statements

financial statements

amendments to ias 1 disclosure initiative iasb effective date 1 january 2016 disclosure initiative makes the following
changes
 _ materiality the amendments clarify that 1 information should not be obscured by aggregating or by providing immaterial infor
   mation 2 materiality considerations apply to the all parts of the financial statements and 3 even when a standard requires a specif
   ic disclosure materiality considerations do apply
 _ statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income the amendments 1 introduce a clar
   ification that the list of line items to be presented in these statements can be disaggregated and aggregated as relevant and additional


142

   guidance on subtotals in these statements and 2 clarify that an entitys share of oci of equityaccounted associates and joint ventures
   should be presented in aggregate as single line items based on whether or not it will subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss
 _ notes the amendments add additional examples of possible ways of ordering the notes to clarify that understandability and compa
   rability should be considered when determining the order of the notes and to demonstrate that the notes need not be presented in the
   order so far listed in paragraph 114 of ias 1 the iasb also removed guidance and examples with regard to the identification of sig
   nificant accounting policies that were perceived as being potentially unhelpful

corresponding lease liability on the credit side of the balance sheet except for immateriality in cases of short term leasing arrangements
and small ticket leasing arrangements for lowvalue assets by contrast accounting changes for the lessor are only minor compared to

es can lead to deductible temporary differences the amendments also clarify that not the carrying amount but the tax base of an asset is
the relevant base for the estimate of future taxable profits and that the carrying amount is not the ceiling to be used for the calculation
when comparing deductible temporary differences with future taxable profits the future taxable profits exclude tax deductions resulting
from the reversal of those deductible temporary differences

the impact on the group financial statements will be evaluated but it is not expected that these amendments will have a significant impact

2014 impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
banca comercială română sa bcr significantly lowered its expectations of recovery for several large packages of nonperforming
loans in addition based on the instructions of the romanian national bank the sale of such nonperforming portfolios has been accelerated
in the light of the low price offers received for benchmark sales during the second quarter of 2014 the collaterals for such loans had to be
reassessed this subsequently led to a significant rise of the risk costs and a decrease in the planned interest income on such nonperforming
loans due to these developments the residual goodwill as well as the customer list and the brand were fully impaired in the first half of
2014 in the course of the preparation of the annual report 2014 the underlying assumptions from the first halfyear of 2014 have been
reviewed this did not lead to any changes erste bank croatia ebc had to accommodate local regulations introduced in 2014 regarding
higher capital requirements therefore indicating a potential decrease in ebcs future cashgenerating capacity and distributable dividends
this indication was deemed as potentially further affecting the cash generating unit of steiermärkische bank und sparkassen aktiengesell
schaft stmk which holds a significant participation in erste bank croatia as a result the goodwill erste bank croatia ebc as well
as the goodwill allocated to steiermärkische bank und sparkassen aktiengesellschaft stmk has already been fully impaired in the first
half of 2014 the goodwill allocated to girocredit was fully impaired in 2014 as a result of the impairment test performed

the deferred tax positions presented above at the granularity level of their respective underlying sources these are temporary differences
between the ifrsaccounting and the tax values of assets and liabilities and accumulated tax losses are measured prior to subsidiary

tion effects also except for the deferred tax assets attributable to tax loss carryforward and to amortisation of investments in subsidiaries
taxeffective in subsequent years that the impacts of the impairment recordings of the aforedescribed recoverability assessments could
be distinctly allocated to the amounts presented above are before those impacts of impairment recordings on the respective potential
deferred tax asset positions that are calculated at entity level

the remaining effects of impairment that could not be distinctly allocated to the issuerelated deferred tax positions in the table above and
also the consolidation effects are included in the row other together with the other deferred tax positions not being shown separately in
the table above

out of the total net amount of eur 12 million 2014 eur 359 million representing the yearonyear variance in the groups consoli
dated net deferred tax position an amount of eur 4 million 2014 eur 209 million is reflected as net deferred tax expense in the
groups income statement for the year 2015 whilst an amount of eur 2 million 2014 eur 143 million represents the impact in the
grous other comprehensive income for the year the remaining eur 6 million 2014 eur 7 million is attributable to other categories
of variances in the consolidated net deferred tax position notably due to direct movements in equity foreign exchange differences and
changes in the consolidation scope




                                                                                                                                                            165

the groups consolidated deferred tax asset position in amount of eur 310 million as at 31 december 2015 2014 eur 301 million is
expected to be recoverable in the foreseeable future in spite of losses in the current or prior period for the components of the group af
fected this recoverability is also expected to be the case for their amounts of deferred tax assets which are exceeding their deferred tax
liabilities by an amount of eur 218 million as at 31 december 2015 2014 eur 180 million these expectations result from yearend
recoverability assessments undertaken by the groups entities either at individual level or at relevant tax group level such assessments
are comparing net temporary deductible differences and available fiscal losses at yearend  after offsetting with deferred tax liabilities at
individual level or at relevant tax group level  with fiscal profit forecasts for a groupwide unified and unchanged time horizon of a max
imum 5 years depending on the fiscal jurisdiction and applicable facts and circumstances if the result of these assessments is negative
the deferred tax asset positions are correspondingly not recorded and the already existing deferred tax asset positions are correspondingly
depreciated

in 2015 for the group as a whole there was a slight increase in the deferred tax assets in comparison to 2014 the effect mainly results
from an increase in the austrian tax group and in croatia as well as from an adverse effect in romania the increase in the austrian tax
group is based on a better forecast for the 5 yearplanning period in croatia it was possible to capitalize additional deferred tax assets
for tax losses  based on a one time effect in 2015  due to a still positive forecast this one time effect is caused by a change in legislation
hence it was compulsatory to convert chfloans into eurloans in romania tax losses in 2015 were consumed due to the positive
result therefore the deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforward decreased

investment strategy
the primary investment strategy of erste group is the continuous optimization of plan assets and the effective coverage of existing enti
tlements the group works with professional fund managers for the investment of plan assets the investment fund act applies as a
requirement with respect to specific investment guidelines relating to the investment of plan assets

additionally the investment committee which is composed of senior staff in the financial sector and representatives of the
sversicherung and erste asset management meets once a year

erste groups severance payments and jubilee provisions are partially covered by the fair value of plan assets while defined benefit pen
sion plans are not financed with segregated assets defined benefit pension plans only exist for already retired employees more than 90
of the pension plans are dedicated for former employees of austrian entities of erste group in total the majority of plans are not matched
with dedicated assets



                                                                                                                                      171

for the yearly pension provisions of the unfunded defined benefit plans and the unfunded part of severance payment provisions erste
group generally takes care within its assetliability management strategy covering the funding plan and interest rate risk position of the
group the payments for 2016 are expected with eur 77 million for both plans

the average duration of these provisions are assumed to be 1117 years for severance payment provisions and 805 years for defined
benefit pension provisions

control and risk
the effective allocation of plan assets is determined by the administering body including the relevant existing economic and market con
ditions as well as considering specific risks of the individual asset classes and the risk profile moreover the investment committee is
responsible for monitoring the mandate guidelines and the investment structure the supervision which may arise from regulatory or other
legal requirements as well as the monitoring of demographic changes as an additional steering tool the fund management generates a
report which is transmitted on a quarterly basis to the group

overall the group tries to minimize the impact caused by market movements on the pension plans

collateral or noncash financial collaterals the effects are disclosed in columns cash collateral receivedpledged and noncash financial
collaterals receivedpledged respectively

443 groupwide risk and capital management
as in prior years erste groups risk management framework has been continuously strengthened in particular enterprisewide risk
management erm has continued to strengthen its comprehensive framework this includes as its fundamental pillar the internal capital
adequacy assessment process icaap as required under pillar 2 of the basel framework

the erm framework is designed to support the banks management in managing the risk portfolios as well as the coverage potential to
ensure that the bank holds at all times adequate capital for the nature and magnitude of the banks risk profile erm is tailored to the erste
groups business and risk profile and it reflects the strategic goal of protecting shareholders and senior debt holders while ensuring the
sustainability of the organisation

erm is a modular and comprehensive management and steering system within erste group and is an essential part of the overall steering
and management instruments the erm components necessary to ensure all aspects in particular to fulfil regulatory requirements and to
provide an internal added value can be clustered as follows
  _ risk appetite statement
  _ portfolio  risk analytics including
    _ risk materiality assessment
    _ concentration risk management
    _ stress testing
  _ riskbearing capacity calculation
  _ risk planning  forecasting including
    _ riskweighted asset management
    _ capital allocation
  _ recovery and resolution planning

in addition to the icaaps ultimate goal of assuring capital adequacy and sustainability at all times the erm components serve to sup
port the banks management in pursuing its strategy

risk appetite
erste group defines its risk strategy and risk appetite statement ras through the annual strategic planning process to ensure appropri
ate alignment of risk capital and performance targets the group ras represents a strategic statement expressing the maximum level of
risk that erste group is prepared to accept in order to achieve its business objectives it consists of a set of core metrics providing quanti
tative direction for risk steering from which a topdown boundary for target and limit setting is derived creating a holistic perspective on
optimising capital funding and riskreturn tradeoffs and qualitative statements in the form of key risk principles that form part of the
strategic guidelines for managing risks the key objective of the ras is to
  _ ensure that erste group has sufficient resources to support its business at any given point in time and absorb stress events
  _ set boundaries for the groups riskreturn target setting
  _ preserve and promote the markets perception of the groups financial strength and the robustness of its systems and controls

in 2015 the group ras framework was enhanced to 1 streamline core capital common equity tier 1 ratio solvency ratio economic
adequacy ratio leverage ratio liquidity survival period analysis liquidity coverage ratio net stable funding ratio and riskearnings
metrics risk earnings ratio 2 reinforce key risk principles that form part of guidelines for managing risks 3 strengthen internal gov
ernance responsible for oversight of the risk profile development 4 embed ras into strategic planning and budgeting processes as well
as daytoday management and 5 ensure timely management actions in case of adverse developments

the group sets its ras on a forwardlooking basis to foster riskreturn steering and ensure proactive management of the risk profile
external constraints such as regulatory requirements form the ultimate boundary for the ras and the amount of risk the group is willing
to accept however in order to avoid any breach of the regulatory requirements the group defines triggers early warnings and limits
which allow for appropriate lead time to enact effective countermeasures a trigger amber in ras describes a level or event that if
breached requires an escalation to the designated governance and discussion of potential remediation actions a limit red in ras defines
a level or event that if breached requires an immediate escalation to the designated governance and immediate implementation of remedi
ation actions

in addition strategic risk limits and principles are defined by material risk type based on the group ras in the group risk strategy
these support implementation of the mid to longterm strategy risk management governance ensures full oversight of risk decisions and



                                                                                                                                          199

sound execution of the group risk strategy mitigating actions are undertaken as part of the regular risk management process to ensure
that the group remains within its ras

moreover stress triggers are defined for selected core metrics and integrated into the assessment of the stress testing results which are
reported to the management board to provide early warning signals and support proactive management of the risk and capital profile

the group ras is also broken down to local entities under consideration of the approved proportionality guidelines the local ras is
approved by the management board to ensure alignment with group ras the group may also decide to include further compulsory
constraints and limits in the local ras to ensure alignment with the group ras and group risk strategy

in 2015 core capital liquidity and riskearnings metrics were developed within the tolerances defined in the group ras consistent
followup on the group ras and limits with management actions implemented as part of the regular risk management and decision
making processes resulted in an improved group risk profile

portfolio and risk analytics
erste group uses dedicated infrastructure systems and processes to actively identify control and manage risks within its portfolio portfo
lio and risk analytics processes are designed to quantify qualify and discuss risks in order to raise awareness to management in a timely
manner

risk materiality assessment
the risk materiality assessment is an annual process with the purpose of systematically identifying new and assessing existing material
risks for erste group the process uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors in the assessment of each risk type

this assessment represents the starting point of the icaap process as identified material risk types need to be considered either directly
by dedicating economic capital or indirectly through adequate consideration within other icaap framework elements insights generated
by the assessment are used to improve risk management practices and further mitigate risks within the group the assessment also serves
as an input for the design and definition of erste groups risk strategy and risk appetite statement key outputs and recommendations
of the risk materiality assessment are used in the scenario design and selection of the comprehensive and reverse stress tests

risk concentration analysis
erste group has implemented a process to identify measure control and manage risk concentrations this process is essential to ensure
the longterm viability of erste group especially in times of an adverse business environment and stressed economic conditions

the risk concentration analysis at erste group covers credit risk market risk operational risk liquidity risk and interrisk concentrations
identified risk concentrations are considered in the scenario design of the comprehensive stress test and measured under stressed conditions

the output of the risk concentration analysis additionally contributes to the identification of material risks within the risk materiality
assessment as well as to the risk appetite statement and to the settingcalibration of erste groups limit system

stress testing
modelling sensitivities of the groups assets liabilities and profit or loss provide management and steering impulses and help in optimis
ing erste groups riskreturn profile the additional dimension of stress tests helps to factor in severe but plausible scenarios and provide
further robustness to the measuring steering and management system risk modelling and stress testing are vital forwardlooking ele
ments of the icaap finally sensitivities and stress scenarios are considered within the groups planning and budgeting process as well
as in the riskbearing capacity calculation

erste groups most complex stress test is a scenario stress test that takes comprehensive account of the impact of various economic sce
narios including secondround effects on all risk types credit market liquidity and operational and in addition impacts on the associated
volumes of assets and liabilities as well as on profit and loss sensitivities in addition to the standard stress testing exercises reverse stress
tests are used to identify a scenario or a combination of scenarios in which viability of the current business model can be questioned

erste group has developed specific tools to translate macroeconomic variables eg gdp unemployment rate development into risk
parameters in order to support the stress testing process which combines bottomup and topdown approaches in addition erste group
leverages the specific knowledge of its professionals located in the different regions to further calibrate the modelbased stress parame



200

ters special attention is given to taking into account adequate granularity and special characteristics when defining the stress parameters
eg the particular developments in the respective region industry product type or segment

results from all of erste groups stress tests are assessed with regard to their explanatory power in order to decide on appropriate
measures taking into account the progressive implementation of the capital requirements according to basel iii phasein cet1 ratio all
stress tests performed in the reporting period indicated sufficient capital adequacy

riskbearing capacity calculation
the riskbearing capacity calculation rcc defines the capital adequacy required by the icaap within the rcc all material risks are
quantified aggregated and compared to the coverage potential and the banks own funds the integral forecast risk appetite limit and a
traffic light system support management in its discussions and decision processes

the traffic light system embedded in erste groups rcc helps to alert the management in case there is a need to decide on plan and
execute actions either to replenish the capital base or to take measures for reducing risk

the management board and risk management committees are briefed on a quarterly basis in relation to the results of the capital adequacy
calculation the report includes movements in risks and available capital and coverage potential after consideration of potential losses in
stress situations the degree of the risk limit utilisation and the overall status of capital adequacy according to the traffic light system the
group risk report also includes a comprehensive forecast of riskweighted assets and capital adequacy

besides the pillar 1 risk types credit market and operational risks in the context of pillar 2 interest rate risks in the banking book
foreign exchange risks arising from equity investments credit spread risks in the banking book risks from foreign currency loans as well
as business and strategic risks are explicitly considered within the economic capital requirement via internal models during 2015 the
utilisation of the economic capital was between 58 and 64 the methodologies that are applied for the different risk types are diverse
and range from historic simulations and other value at risk approaches to the regulatory approach for residual portfolios moreover calcu
lations for portfolios under the standardised approach for credit risk are extended by risk parameters from the internal ratingsbased ap
proach in order to give a better economic view

in addition to the riskbearing capacity calculation liquidity concentration and macroeconomic risks in particular are managed by means
of a proactive management framework that includes forwardlooking scenarios stress testing trigger levels and traffic light systems

credit risk accounts for approximately 70 of the total economic capital requirement reflecting erste groups conservative risk manage
ment policy and strategy the group does not offset diversification effects between these three risk types the economic capital requirement
for unexpected losses is computed on a oneyear time horizon with a 9995 confidence level which reflects the implied default risk con
sistent with a longterm credit rating of aa as well as erste groups conservative approach and high risk management standards

the capital or coverage potential required to cover economic risks and unexpected losses is based on basel iii fully loaded regulatory
own funds adjusted by heldtomaturity reserves and the yeartodate profit the coverage potential must be sufficient to absorb unex
pected losses resulting from the groups operations at any point in time

risk planning and forecasting
the responsibility for risk management within the group and each subsidiary includes ensuring sound risk planning and forecasting pro
cesses the forecasts determined by risk management are the result of close cooperation with all stakeholders in the groups overall plan
ning process and in particular with group controlling asset liability management and the business lines the risk planning and forecast
ing process includes both a forward and backwardlooking component focusing on both portfolio and economic environment changes

riskweighted asset management
as riskweighted assets rwa determine the actual regulatory capital requirement of a bank and influence the capital ratio as a key per
formance indicator particular emphasis is devoted to meeting targets and to the planning and forecasting capacity for this parameter
insights from monthly rwa analyses are used to improve the calculation infrastructure and the quality of input parameters and data as
well as the most efficient application of the basel framework there is a process in place for tracking compliance with rwa targets fore
casting their future development and thereby defining further targets deviations are brought to the attention of the board within a short
time frame in addition to discussions in group erm committee germc the groups management board is regularly informed about
the current status and findings are taken into account in the context of erste groups regular steering process furthermore rwa targets
are included in the risk appetite statement


                                                                                                                                            201

capital allocation
an important task integral to the risk planning process is the allocation of capital to entities business lines and segments this is done
with close cooperation between risk management and controlling all insights from the icaap and controlling processes are used to
allocate capital with a view to riskreturn considerations

erste groups aggregate capital requirement by risk type
the following diagrams present the composition of the economic capital requirement according to type of risk

other risks include the risk from foreign currency loans and the business and strategic risk



leverage ratio
the leverage ratio represents the relationship between core capital tier 1 and leverage exposure according to article 429 crr essential
ly the leverage exposure represents the sum of unweighted on and offbalancesheet positions considering valuation and risk adjustments
as defined within the crr

based on the revised framework for the calculation and disclosure of the leverage ratio published by the basel committee on banking
supervision bcbs in january 2014 the european commission prepared a delegated regulation eu 201562 of 10 october 2014
which was published in the official journal of the european union on 17 january 2015 the revised requirements for calculation and
disclosure of the leverage ratio within the european union were implemented in erste group during the course of 2015

recovery and resolution plans
in compliance with the austrian banking recovery and resolution law bundesgesetz über die sanierung und abwicklung von banken
 basag in force since 1 january 2015 erste group has submitted an updated group recovery plan to ecb in september 2015 the
group recovery plan identifies options for restoring financial strength and viability if erste group comes under severe economic stress
the plan specifies potential options for the replenishment of capital and liquidity resources of the bank in order to cope with a range of
scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide stress

erste group collaborates with the newly established resolution authorities in the drawing up of resolution plans as required by basag
and eu regulation no 8062014 establishing the single resolution mechanism srm regulation

444 credit risk
definition and overview
credit risk arises in erste groups traditional lending and investment businesses it involves losses incurred as a result of default by bor
rowers and the need to set aside allowances as a result of the deteriorating credit quality of certain borrowers as well as due to counterpar
ty risk from trading in instruments and derivatives bearing market risk country risk too is recognised in the calculation of credit risk
operative credit decisions are made by the credit risk management units in each of the banking subsidiaries locally and by group credit
 market risk management and group egi real estate risk management at group level a detailed explanation of the role and respon

sibilities of group credit  market risk management and group egi real estate risk management is covered in the section risk
management organisation

the central database used for credit risk management is above all the group data pool all data relevant to credit risk management per
formance management and determination of riskweighted assets and the regulatory capital requirement is regularly loaded into this data
base relevant subsidiaries not yet integrated into the group data pool regularly deliver reporting packages

the group risk data and reporting department uses mainly the group data pool for centralised credit risk reporting this ensures central
ised analysis and application of ratios according to unified methods and segmentation across erste group as a whole credit risk reporting
comprises regular reports on erste groups credit portfolio for external and internal recipients and permits continuous monitoring of credit
risk developments thus enabling management to take control measures inhouse recipients of these reports include above all the supervi
sory and management boards of erste group bank ag as well as the risk managers business unit directors and internal audit staff

the credit limit system organisational unit which is part of group credit  market risk management is in charge of operating supervis
ing and continuously improving the groupwide online limit system for the control of counterparty credit risk arising from treasury transac
tions as well as for the monitoring of credit risk from exposures in the asset classes corporates financial institutions and sovereigns

internal rating system
erste group has business and risk strategies in place that govern policies for lending and credit approval processes these policies are
reviewed and adjusted regularly at a minimum on an annual basis they cover the entire lending business taking into account the nature
scope and risk level of the transactions and the counterparties involved credit approval considers individual information on the credit
worthiness of the customer the type of credit collateral covenant package and other risk mitigation factors involved

the assessment of counterparty default risk within erste group is based on the customers probability of default pd for each credit
exposure and lending decision erste group assigns an internal rating which is a unique measure of the counterparty default risk the
internal rating of each customer is updated at least on an annual basis annual rating review ratings of workout customers are reviewed
with higher frequency

the main purpose of the internal ratings is to support the decisionmaking for lending and for the terms of credit facilities internal ratings
also determine the level of creditapproval authority within erste group and the monitoring procedures for existing exposures at a quan
titative level internal ratings influence the level of required risk pricing risk allowances and riskweighted assets under pillar 1 or 2

for entities of erste group that use the internal ratingsbased irb approach internal ratings are a key input into the riskweighted assets
calculation they are also used in the groups assessment of the economic capital requirement according to pillar 2 for these purposes a
distinct pd value is assigned to each rating grade for its irb portfolios within a calibration process that is performed individually for each
rating method pd values reflect a 12month probability of default based on longterm average default rates per rating grade the bank
assigns margins of conservatism to the calculated pds

internal ratings take into account all available significant information for the assessment of counterparty default risk for nonretail borrow
ers internal ratings take into account the financial strength of the counterparty the possibility of external support flexibility in corporate
financing general company information and external credit history information where available for retail clients internal ratings are based
mainly on payment behaviour versus the bank and where applicable credit bureau information supplemented with information provided
by the respective client and general demographic information rating ceiling rules on credit quality are applied based on membership in a

internal specialist teams develop and improve internal rating models and risk parameters in cooperation with risk managers model devel
opment follows an internal groupwide methodological standard and utilises relevant data covering the respective market in this way
erste group ensures the availability of rating models with the best possible predictiveness across its core regions

all rating models and their components scorecards whether retail or nonretail are regularly validated by the central validation unit
based on a groupwide standard methodology validation uses statistical techniques to evaluate the accuracy of default prediction rating
stability data quality completeness and relevance and reviews the quality of documentation and degree of user acceptance the results of
this validation process are reported to the management and regulatory bodies in addition to the validation process the group applies a
regular monitoring process on the performance of rating tools reflecting developments in new defaults and early delinquencies



                                                                                                                                            203

a holding model committee is established as the primary steering and control body for the model development and validation process
the holding model committee reports to the group risk executive committee grec all new models model changes and changes to
risk parameters in the group as well as groupwide methodology standards are reviewed by the holding model committee and require its
approval this ensures groupwide integrity and consistency of models and methodologies furthermore the holding model committee
organises the groupwide validation process reviews validation results and approves remedial actions all development and validation
activities are coordinated by the risk methods and models division with responsibility for validation in the independent group validation
unit

risk grades and categories
the classification of credit assets into risk grades is based on erste groups internal ratings erste group uses two internal risk scales for
risk classification for customers that have not defaulted a risk scale of 8 risk grades for private clients and 13 risk grades for all other
segments is used defaulted customers are classified into a separate risk grade

for the purpose of external reporting internal rating grades of erste group are grouped into the following four risk categories

low risk typically regional customers with wellestablished and rather longstanding relationships with erste group or large interna
tionally recognised customers very good to satisfactory financial position and low likelihood of financial difficulties relative to the re
spective market in which the customers operate retail clients having long relationships with the bank or clients with a wide product pool
use no relevant late payments currently or in the most recent 12 months new business is generally done with clients in this risk category

management attention vulnerable nonretail clients that may have overdue payments or defaults in their credit history or may encoun
ter debt repayment difficulties in the medium term retail clients with possible payment problems in the past triggering early collection
reminders these clients typically have a good recent payment history

substandard the borrower is vulnerable to short term negative financial and economic developments and shows an elevated probability
of failure in some cases restructuring measures are possible or already in place as a rule such loans are managed in specialised risk
management departments

nonperforming one or more of the default criteria under article 178 of the crr are met among others full repayment unlikely inter
est or principal payments on a material exposure more than 90 days past due restructuring resulting in a loss to the lender realisation of a
loan loss or initiation of bankruptcy proceedings as from 2015 erste group applies the customer view for all customer segments in
cluding retail clients if an obligor defaults on one deal then the customers performing transactions are classified as nonperforming as
well furthermore nonperforming exposures also comprise nonperforming forborne transactions even in cases where the client has not
defaulted until 2014 the product view was used in the retail segment in some subsidiaries in cee so that only the product actually in
default is counted as a nonperforming exposure whereas the other products of the same customer are considered performing this
amendment had no significant impact for erste group

credit risk review and monitoring
in order to manage the credit risk for large corporates banks sovereigns and country risk credit limits are established to reflect the max
imum exposure that erste group is willing to have towards a particular customer or group of connected clients an upper boundary for
such limits is given by the entityspecific maximum lending limit mll which is derived from the respective group and local risk ap
petite statement ras all credit limits and the transactions booked within the limits are reviewed at least once a year

for smaller enterprises micro and retail customers the monitoring and credit review are based on an automated early warning system in
retail risk management the following early warning signals indicate potential adverse portfolio developments if left unaddressed
  _ deterioration of new business quality and
  _ decreasing collections efficiency

the early warning signals are monitored at group level by group retail and sme risk management and locally by local retail
riskcollections management adverse developments identified during the monitoring are discussed and the need for risk mitigation is
addressed jointly

credit portfolio reports for asset classes and business lines are prepared on a regular basis watchlist meetings and remedial committee
meetings are held on a regular basis to monitor customers with a poor credit standing and to discuss preemptive measures to help a par
ticular debtor avoid default

the general principles and standards for credit risk provisions within erste group are described in internal policies credit risk provisions
are calculated
  _ for financial assets carried at amortised cost loans and receivables financial assets held to maturity in accordance with ias 39 and
  _ for contingent liabilities financial guarantees loan commitments in accordance with ias 37

credit risk provisions are created in a process performed on customer level the process includes the identification of default and impair
ment and the type of assessment individual or collective to be applied on customer level means in this context that if one of the cus
tomers exposures is classified as defaulted typically all of this customers exposures are classified as defaulted depending on the char
acteristics of the exposure and the respective expected cash flows eg considering collateral some exposures may not be impaired

the bank distinguishes between
 _ specific allowances calculated for exposures to defaulted customers that are deemed to be impaired and
 _ collective allowances allowances for incurred but not reported losses calculated for exposures to nondefaulted customers or de
   faulted customers that are not deemed to be impaired

for the calculation of specific allowances the discounted cash flow method is applied this means that a difference between gross carry
ing amount and net present value npv of the expected cash flows leads to an impairment and defines the amount of any allowance
requirement all estimated interest and redemption payments as well as estimated collateral recoveries and costs for selling and obtaining
collateral are considered as expected cash flows the effective interest rate is used as the discount rate in the calculation of the npv of the
expected cash flows

the calculation of specific allowances is performed either on an individual basis or as a collective assessment rulebased approach in
the case of significant customers expected cash flows are estimated individually by workout or risk managers a customer is considered
as significant if the total exposure defined as the sum of all on and offbalancesheet exposures exceeds a defined materiality limit oth
erwise the customer is considered as insignificant and a rulebased approach is used for the calculation of the specific allowance under
this approach specific allowances are calculated as the product of carrying amount and loss given default lgd where lgd depends on
relevant characteristics such as time in default or the stage of the workout process


                                                                                                                                               215

collective allowances are calculated on on and offbalancesheet exposures to nondefaulted customers for which a default has not been
detected or reported the level of collective allowances depends on the gross carrying amount the probability of default pd the loss
given default lgd the credit conversion factors ccf in case of offbalancesheet exposures and the loss identification period lip
the lip corresponds to the average period between the occurrence and the detection of the loss and ranges from four months to one year
the result of discounting future cash flows to their present values is taken into consideration in the lgd calculation

generally risk parameters used in the calculation of collective allowances may be different to the basel iii pillar 1 or pillar 2 risk parame
ters if the properties of the respective portfolio in combination with iasifrs standards necessitate this

collective allowances are also calculated in case of exposures to defaulted customers that are not identified as impaired for these cus
tomers no specific allowances are allocated collective allowances are calculated based on the historical loss experience for the relevant
customer segment

erste group regularly reviews its specific and collective allowances these exercises comprise the parameters and methodologies used in
its provision calculation adjustments can take place in the context of specific reviews in view of specific allowances routine mainte
nance of parameters such as regular calibration or in the case of specific events eg improved knowledge about recovery behaviour
backtesting results in 2015 no material adjustments were made due to validation results

restructuring renegotiation and forbearance
restructuring means contractual modification of any of the customers loan repayment conditions including tenor interest rate fees
principal amount due or a combination thereof restructuring can be business restructuring in retail and commercial renegotiation in
corporate or forbearance in line with eba requirements in both segments

business restructuring and renegotiation
restructuring as business restructuring in the retail segment or as commercial renegotiation in the corporate segment is a potential and
effective customer retention tool involving repricing or the offering of an additional loan or both in order to maintain the banks valuable
good clientele

forbearance
the definition of forbearance is included in regulation eu 2015227 a restructuring is considered forbearance if it entails a con
cession towards a customer facing or about to face financial difficulties in meeting their contractual financial commitments a borrower is
in financial difficulties if any of the following conditions are met
  _ the customer was more than 30 days past due in the past 3 months or
  _ the customer would be 30 days past due or more without receiving forbearance or
  _ the customer is in default or
  _ the modified contract was classified as nonperforming or would be nonperforming without forbearance or
  _ the contract modification involves total or partial cancellation by writeoff of the debt on any of the customers credit obligations
     while at customer level open credit exposure still remains

forborne exposure is assessed at loan contract level and means only the exposure to which forbearance measures have been extended and
excludes any other exposure the customer may have as long as no forbearance was extended to these
concession means that any of the following conditions are met
 _ modificationrefinancing of the contract would not have been granted had the customer not been in financial difficulty
 _ there is a difference in favour of the customer between the modifiedrefinanced terms of the contract and the previous terms of the
    contract
 _ the modifiedrefinanced contract includes more favourable terms than other customers with a similar risk profile would have obtained
    from the same institution

forbearance can be initiated by the bank or by the customer on account of loss of employment illness etc components of forbearance
can be instalment reduction tenor extension interest reduction or forgiveness principal reduction or forgiveness revolving exposure
change to instalment andor others

forbearance measures are divided and reported as
 _ performing forbearance incl performing forbearance under probation that was upgraded from nonperforming forbearance and
 _ nonperforming forbearance incl nonperforming forbearance and defaultedimpaired forbearance

forborne exposures are considered performing when
 _ the exposure did not have nonperforming status at the time the extension of or application for forbearance was approved and
 _ granting the forbearance has not led to classifying the exposure as nonperforming or default

performing forborne exposures become nonperforming when during the monitoring period of a minimum of 2 years following forbear
ance classification
 _ an additional forbearance measure is extended and in the past the customer was in the nonperforming forbearance category or
 _ the customer becomes more than 30 days past due on forborne exposure and in the past the customer was in the nonperforming for
    bearance category or
 _ the customer meets any of the default event criteria defined in the default definition

the performing forbearance classification can be discontinued and the account can become a nonforborne account when all of the fol
lowing conditions are met
  _ a minimum of 2 years have passed from the date of classifying the exposure as performing forbearance probation period
  _ under the forborne payment plan at least 50 of the original preforbearance instalment has been regularly repaid at least during
    half of the probation period in the case of retail customers or
  _ regular repayments in a significant amount during at least half of the probation period have been made in the case of corporate cus
    tomers
  _ none of the exposure of the customer is more than 30 days past due at the end of the probation period

the nonperforming forbearance classification can be discontinued and reclassified as performing under probation when all of the follow
ing conditions are met
  _ one year has passed from the date of classifying the exposure as nonperforming forbearance
  _ the forbearance has not led the exposure to be classified as nonperforming
  _ retail customers the customer has demonstrated the ability to comply with the postforbearance conditions by either of the following
    _ the customer has never been more than 30 days past due during the last 6 months and there is no delinquent amount or
    _ the customer has repaid the full past due amount or the writtenoff amount if there was any
  _ corporate customers analysis of the financial development which leaves no concern about future compliance with postforbearance
    terms and conditions furthermore the customer has never been more than 30 days past due during the monitoring period and there is
    no delinquent amount

in the corporate segment recognition of forbearance measures typically leads to the involvement of the responsible local workout unit
the largest part of the forbearance measures are set within the responsibility of the local workout units and the affected clients are man
aged and monitored according to the internal regulations and standards for the workout involvement forbearance measures are defined as
trigger events for carrying out impairment tests according to the internal regulations and standards based on the ifrs requirements

the above rules and definitions were defined in erste group in q3 2014 and the related itimplementation was completed throughout
erste group in 2015

collateral
recognition of collateral
the collateral management department is a staff unit within the group workout division the group collateral management policy
defines among other things uniform valuation standards for credit collateral across the entire group it ensures that the credit risk deci
sion processes are standardised with respect to accepted collateral values

all collateral types acceptable within the group are contained in the group collateral catalogue locally permitted collateral is defined by
the respective bank in accordance with applicable national legal provisions the valuation and revaluation of collateral is done according
to the principles defined in the group collateral catalogue broken down by class and based on the internal work instructions in accord
ance with the individual supervisory requirements whether a type of security or a specific collateral asset is accepted for credit risk miti
gation is decided by enterprisewide risk management after determining if the applicable regulatory requirements are met adherence to
the standard work processes stipulated for assigning the acceptable collateral assets to the categories available is monitored by operational
risk management

main types of collateral
the following types of collateral are the most frequently accepted
 _ real estate this includes both private and commercial real estate
 _ financial collateral this category primarily includes securities portfolios and cash deposits as well as life insurance policies
 _ guarantees guarantees are provided mainly by governments banks and corporates all guarantors must have a minimum credit rating
    which is reviewed annually
other types of collateral such as collateral in the form of movable property or the assignment of receivables are accepted less frequently
protection by credit default swaps is only marginally used in the banking book

collateral valuation and management
collateral valuation is based on current market prices while taking into account an amount that can be recovered within a reasonable
period the valuation processes are defined and their itsupported technical application is performed by collateral management at group
level and by authorised staff in each country with the assistance of software applications the allocated collateral values are capped by the
amount of the secured transaction imputed excess collateral values are therefore not possible only independent appraisers not involved


                                                                                                                                         219

in the lending decision process are permitted to conduct real estate valuations and the valuation methods to be applied are defined for
quality assurance purposes the real estate valuations are validated on an ongoing basis

the methods and discounts used for valuations are based on empirical data representing past experience of the workout departments and
on the collected data on recoveries from realising collateral the valuation methods are adjusted regularly  at least once a year  to re
flect current recoveries financial collateral assets are recognised at market value

the revaluation of collateral is done periodically and is automated as far as possible in the case of external data sources the appropriate
interfaces are used the maximum periods for the revaluation of individual collateral assets are predefined and compliance is monitored
by risk management using software applications apart from periodic revaluations collateral is assessed when information becomes avail
able that indicates a decrease in the value of the collateral for exceptional reasons

concentration risks resulting from credit risk mitigation techniques may affect a single customer but also a portfolio defined by region
industry or type of security erste group is a retail bank and due to its customer structure and the markets in which it operates it does not
have any concentrations with respect to collateral from customers concerning other areas of a potentially detrimental correlation of risks
the collateral portfolios are analysed using statistical evaluations for among other things regional or industryspecific concentrations
within the scope of portfolio monitoring the response to those risks identified includes above all the adjustment of volume targets
setting of corresponding limits and modification of the staffs discretionary limits for lending

collateral obtained in foreclosure proceedings is made available for sale in an orderly fashion with the proceeds used to reduce or repay
the outstanding claim generally erste group does not occupy repossessed properties for its own business use the main part of assets
taken onto its own books is commercial land and buildings in addition residential real estate properties and transport vehicles are taken
into erste groups possession as of 31 december 2015 the carrying value of these assets amounted to eur 148 million 2014
eur 86 million

445 market risk
definition and overview
market risk is the risk of loss that may arise due to adverse changes in market prices and to the parameters derived from them these
market value changes might appear in the profit and loss account in the statement of comprehensive income or in hidden reserves at
erste group market risk is divided into interest rate risk credit spread risk currency risk equity risk commodity risk and volatility risk
this concerns both trading and banking book positions

methods and instruments employed
at erste group potential losses that may arise from market movements are assessed using the value at risk var the calculation is done
according to the method of historic simulation with a onesided confidence level of 99 a holding period of one day and a simulation
period of two years the var describes what level of losses may be expected as a maximum at a defined probability  the confidence
level  within a certain holding period of the positions under historically observed market conditions

backtesting is used to constantly monitor the validity of the statistical methods this process is conducted with a oneday delay to moni
tor if the model projections regarding losses have actually materialised at a confidence level of 99 the actual loss on a single day
should exceed the var statistically only two to three times a year 1 of around 250 workdays this shows one of the limits of the var
approach on the one hand the confidence level is limited to 99 and on the other hand the model takes into account only those market
scenarios observed in each case within the simulation period of two years and calculates the var for the current position of the bank on
this basis in order to investigate any extreme market situations beyond this stress tests are conducted at erste group these events in
clude mainly market movements of low probability

the stress tests are carried out according to several methods stressed var is derived from the normal var calculation but instead of
simulating only over the two most recent years an analysis of a much longer period is carried out in order to identify a oneyear period
that constitutes a relevant period of stress for the current portfolio mix according to the legal framework that oneyear period is used to
calculate a var with a 99 confidence level this enables erste group on the one hand to hold sufficient own funds available for the
trading book even in periods of elevated market volatility while on the other hand also enabling it to incorporate these resulting effects
into the management of trading positions

in the extreme value theory a pareto distribution is fitted to the extreme end of the loss distribution in this manner a continuous function
is created from which extreme confidence levels such as 9995 can be evaluated furthermore standard scenarios are calculated in
which the individual market factors are exposed to extreme movements such scenarios are calculated at erste group for interest rates
stock prices exchange rates and volatilities historic scenarios are a modification of the concept of standard scenarios in this case risk
factor movements after certain events such as 911or the lehman bankruptcy form the basis of the stress calculation in order to
calculate historical probabilistic scenarios the most significant risk factors for the current portfolio are determined and their most adverse
movement during the last years is applied for the probabilistic scenarios shifts of important market factors are determined for various
quantiles of their distributions and these values are then used to calculate stress results these analyses are made available to the man
agement board and the supervisory board within the scope of the monthly market risk reports

the var model was approved by the financial market authority fma as an internal market risk model to determine the own funds
requirements of the trading book of erste group pursuant to the austrian banking act

erste group is upgrading the internal market risk model with respect to infrastructure and methodology the application of the changes
in calculation of own funds requirement for market risk is subject to a regulatory approval process

methods and instruments of risk mitigation
at erste group market risks are controlled in the trading book by setting several layers of limits the overall limit on the basis of var for
the trading book is allocated by the management board in the risk appetite statement while taking into account the riskbearing capacity
and projected earnings a further breakdown is done by the market risk committee on the basis of a proposal from the market risk
control  infrastructure unit

all market risk activities of the trading book are assigned risk limits that are statistically consistent in their entirety with the overall var
limit the var limit is assigned in a topdown procedure to the individual trading units this is done down to the level of the individual
trading groups or departments additionally in a bottomup procedure sensitivity limits are assigned to even smaller units all the way
down to the desk level these are then aggregated and applied as a second limit layer to the var limits

limit compliance is verified at two levels by the appropriate local decentralised risk management unit and by the market risk control 
infrastructure unit the monitoring of sensitivity limits is performed on both intraday and end of day basis on demand limit reports can
also be triggered by individual traders or chief traders on an ad hoc basis the var is calculated every day at group level and made avail
able to the individual trading units as well as to the superior management levels all the way up to the management board

banking book positions are subjected to a monthly var analysis in this manner the total var is determined with exactly the same meth
odology as for the trading book in addition to var a longhorizon risk measure is used to gauge the interest rate risk credit spread risk of


                                                                                                                                           229

the banking book and foreign exchange risk of equity participations for this purpose a historical simulation approach looking back five
years and with a oneyear holding period was chosen the result of these calculations is presented in the monthly market risk report that is
made available to the management and supervisory boards

interest rate risk in the banking book
interest rate risk is the risk of an adverse change in the fair value of financial instruments caused by a movement in market interest rates
this type of risk arises when mismatches exist between assets and liabilities including derivatives in respect of their maturities or of the
timing of interest rate adjustments in order to identify interest rate risk all financial instruments including transactions not recognised on
the balance sheet are grouped into maturity bands based on their remaining terms to maturity or terms to an interest rate adjustment
positions without a fixed maturity eg demand deposits are included on the basis of modelled deposit rates that are determined by means
of statistical methods

the current low or in certain countries even negative interest rate environment poses a challenge for the interest rate risk measurement of
banks until 2015 a floor at 0 was applied in interest rate risk calculations nevertheless this approach was revised during the year
consequently from the first quarter of 2016 the floor will be abandoned in the internal risk calculations while according to the guide
lines on the management of interest rate risk arising from nontrading activities issued by the european banking authority for the calcu
lation of the regulatory interest rate risk measure it has to be kept

credit spread risk
credit spread risk is the risk of an adverse movement in the fair value of financial instruments caused by a change in the creditworthiness
of an issuer perceived by the market erste group is exposed to credit spread risk with respect to its securities portfolio both in the trading
as well as in the banking book

in order to identify credit spread risk all securities are grouped into maturity bands based on their remaining terms to maturity or terms to
an expected call date on the one hand and assigned to risk factors reflecting the riskiness of their issuer on the other hand

exchange rate risk
the bank is exposed to several types of risks related to exchange rates these concern risks from open foreign exchange positions and others

risk from open foreign exchange positions is the risk related to exchange rates that derives from the mismatch between assets and liabili
ties or from currencyrelated financial derivatives these risks might originate from customerrelated operations or proprietary trading
and are monitored and managed on a daily basis foreign currency exposure is subject to regulatory and internal limits the internal limits
are set by the market risk committee

erste group separately measures and manages other types of risks relating to the groups balance sheet and earnings structure the trans
lation risk related to the valuation of the balance sheet items earnings dividends and participationsnet investments in local currency or
foreign exchange has an impact on consolidated earnings and consolidated capital erste group is also reducing the negative impact relat
ed to volatility of foreign exchange rates on asset performance for example as a result of foreign exchange lending in the cee countries
that was stopped for clients not having sufficient regular income in the respective loan currency

in order to manage its multicurrency earnings structure erste group regularly discusses hedging opportunities and takes decisions in the
group asset liability committee alco asset liability management alm uses as the usual source of information the current finan
cial results and the financial budget prepared for the upcoming period to obtain as much information as possible on the future foreign
currency cash flows the proposal which mainly includes the volume hedging level hedge ratio and timeline of the hedging is submit
ted by alm to alco the impact of translation on consolidated capital is monitored and reported to alco the alco decisions are
then implemented by alm and the implementation status is reported on a monthly basis to alco

hedging
banking book market risk management consists of optimising erste groups risk position by finding the proper tradeoff between the
economic value of the balance sheet and forecasted earnings decisions are based on the balance sheet development economic environ
ment competitive landscape fair value of risk effect on net interest income and appropriate liquidity position the steering body respon
sible for interest rate risk management is alco alm submits proposals for actions to steer the interest rate risk to alco and imple
ments alcos decisions

in order to achieve the goals of risk management hedging activities focus on the two main control variables net interest income and
market value of equity risk in a broader sense hedging refers to an economic activity that mitigates risk but does not necessarily qualify
for hedge accounting under ifrs rules ifrs hedge accounting is applied if possible to avoid accounting mismatches due to hedging
activity within the scope of ifrscompliant hedge accounting cash flow hedges and fair value hedges are used if ifrscompliant hedge
accounting is not possible the fair value option is applied where appropriate for the hedging of market values most of the hedging
within erste group concerns hedging of interest rate risk the remainder is hedging of foreign exchange rate risk

446 liquidity risk
definition and overview
the liquidity risk is defined in erste group in line with the principles set out by the basel committee on banking supervision and the
austrian regulators kreditinstituterisikomanagementverordnung  kirmv accordingly a distinction is made between market
liquidity risk which is the risk that the group entities cannot easily offset or close a position at the market price because of inadequate
market depth or market disruption and funding liquidity risk which is the risk that the banks in the group will not be able to meet effi
ciently both expected and unexpected current and future cash flow and collateral needs without affecting either daily operations or the
financial condition of the group members

funding liquidity risk is further divided into insolvency risk and structural liquidity risk the former is the shortterm risk that current or
future payment obligations cannot be met in full and on time in an economically justified manner while structural liquidity risk is the
longterm risk of losses due to a change in the groups own refinancing cost or spread

liquidity strategy
in 2015 client deposits remained the primary source of funding for erste group the volume of client deposits increased to eur 1279
billion as of yearend 2015 amounting to 64 of the balance sheet total the loantodeposit ratio stands at 98 which is in line with the
targeted level

with regards to own issuance erste group issued eur 236 billion in bonds in 2015 which was in accordance with the size of the budg
eted figure eur 1 billion was collected via two mortgage covered bonds in benchmark size eur 731 million was collected by issuing
senior unsecured bonds via private placements or the retail network subordinated debt tier 2 issuance was in the size of
eur 600 million the average tenor of all new issues in 2015 is approximately 74 years

since 2014 the ecb supports bank lending to the nonfinancial sector through a series of targeted longerterm refinancing operations
tltros with a maturity of up to four years and an early repayment option at group level erste groups total tltro participation
increased slightly in 2015 to eur 196 billion 2014 eur 178 billion

methods and instruments employed
shortterm insolvency risk is monitored by calculating the survival period for each currency on both entity and group levels this analysis
determines the maximum period during which the entity can survive a severe combined market and idiosyncratic crisis while relying on
its pool of liquid assets the monitored worstcase scenario simulates very limited money market and capital market access and at the
same time significant client deposit outflows furthermore the simulation assumes increased drawdown on guarantees and loan commit
ments dependent on the type of customer as well as the potential outflows from collateralised derivative transactions estimating the effect
of collateral outflows in the case of adverse market movements to reflect the reputational risk from callable own issues the principal
outflows from these liabilities are modelled to the next call date in all stress scenarios

additional to qis monitoring according to bcbs guidelines and reporting of liquidity coverage ratio lcr and net stable funding
ratio nsfr according to crr erste group is reporting lcr internally according to the delegated act regulation eu 201561 since
october 2015 the ratios are monitored at both entity and group level and since 2014 lcr is part of the internal risk appetite statement
targeting to be above 100 at group level ahead of the regulatory requirement

legal lending limits exist in all cee countries where erste group is represented as they restrict liquidity flows between erste groups
subsidiaries in different countries they are taken into account for the assessment of liquidity risk in the survival period model as well as in
the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio at group level

additionally the traditional liquidity gaps depicting the going concern maturity mismatches of the subsidiaries and the group as a whole
are reported and monitored regularly funding concentration risk is continuously analysed with respect to counterparties erste groups
funds transfer pricing ftp system has also proven to be an efficient tool for structural liquidity risk management

last years improvements of the internal stress testing methodology have been successfully completed at the same time erste group is
continuing its ongoing project activities to improve the framework for groupwide liquidity risk reporting and liquidity risk measurement
aside from the adoption of changed and additional regulatory reporting requirements current projects focus on improving data quality
and granularity used in the internal and regulatory risk measurement as well as increasing flexibility in reporting

methods and instruments of risk mitigation
shortterm liquidity risk is managed by limits resulting from the survival period model internal stress testing and by internal lcr targets
at both entity and group level limit breaches are reported to the group asset liability committee alco another important instrument
for managing the liquidity risk within erste group bank ag and in relation to its subsidiaries is the ftp system as the process of plan
ning funding needs provides important information for liquidity management a detailed overview of funding needs is prepared on a quar
terly basis for the planning horizon across erste group

the comprehensive contingency plan of the erste group ensures the necessary coordination of all parties involved in the liquidity man
agement process in case of crisis and is reviewed on a regular basis the contingency plans of the subsidiaries are coordinated as part of
the plan for erste group bank ag

analysis of liquidity risk
liquidity gap
the longterm liquidity position is managed using liquidity gaps on the basis of expected cash flows this liquidity position is calculated
for each material currency and based on the assumption of ordinary business activity fulfilment of the internal and regulatory liquidity
risk requirements as well as the current and expected market environment are also taken into account

expected cash flows are broken down by contractual maturities in accordance with the amortisation schedule and arranged in maturity
ranges all products without contractual maturities such as demand deposits and overdrafts are shown in the first time bucket irrespec
tive of the statistically observed client behaviour

an excess of assets over liabilities is indicated by a positive value while an excess of liabilities over assets is indicated by a negative
value the callable own issues are modelled to their next call dates the cash inflows from liquid securities amounting to eur 366 bil
lion 2014 eur 335 billion which are accepted as collateral by the central banks to which erste group has access are taken into ac
count in the first time bucket rather than considering them at their contractual maturity

counterbalancing capacity
erste group regularly monitors its counterbalancing capacity which consists of cash excess minimum reserves at the central banks as
well as unencumbered central bank eligible assets and other liquid securities including impacts from repos reverse repos and securities
lending transactions these assets can be mobilised in the short term to offset potential cash outflows in a crisis situation the term struc
ture of the groups counterbalancing capacity as of yearend 2015 and yearend 2014 are shown in the tables below

liquidity ratios
with the implementation of the crr at the beginning of 2014 new liquidity ratios the liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the net
stable funding ratio nsfr have been introduced as ratios relevant for reporting purposes for the lcr the european commission
released a delegated regulation eu 201561 of 10 october 2014 published in the official journal of the european union on
17 january 2015 specifying details on the ratio and setting a binding minimum requirement for the ratio as of 1 october 2015 the lcr
represents a ratio of highly liquid assets visàvis net cash outflows over a 30 day time horizon the minimum ratio has been set at 60
for 2015 from 1 october 70 for 2016 80 for 2017 and 100 from 2018 the nsfr remains for the time being a reporting require
ment only with a binding minimum requirement potentially introduced from 2018the nsfr represents a ratio of available stable fund

447 operational risk
definition and overview
in line with article 4 section 52 of regulation eu 5752013 crr erste group defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events including legal risks both quantitative and
qualitative methods are used to identify operational risks consistent with international practice the responsibility for managing opera
tional risk rests with the line management

methods and instruments employed
the quantitative measurement methods are based on internal loss experience data which is collected across erste group using a standard
methodology and entered into a central data pool additionally in order to be able to model losses that have not occurred in the past but
are nonetheless possible scenarios and external data are also used erste group sources external data from a leading nonprofit riskloss
data consortium

erste group received regulatory approval for the advanced measurement approach ama in 2009 ama is a sophisticated approach to
measuring operational risk pursuant to ama the required capital is calculated using an internal var model taking into account internal
data external data scenario analysis business environment and internal risk control factors in 2011 erste group received approval to
use insurance contracts for mitigation within the ama pursuant to article 323 crr

methods and instruments of risk mitigation
in addition to quantitative methods qualitative methods are also used to determine operational risk such as risk assessment surveys the
results of and suggestions for risk control in these surveys which are conducted by experts are reported to the line management and thus
help to reduce operational risks erste group also reviews certain key indicators periodically to ensure early detection of changes in risk
potential that may lead to losses

erste group uses a groupwide insurance programme which since its establishment in 2004 has reduced the cost of meeting erste
groups traditional property insurance needs and made it possible to buy additional insurance for previously uninsured bankspecific
risks this programme uses a captive reinsurance entity as a vehicle to share losses within the group and access the external market

the quantitative and qualitative methods used together with the insurance strategy and the modelling approaches described above form
the operational risk framework of erste group information on operational risk is periodically communicated to the management board
via various reports including the quarterly top management reports which describe the recent loss history loss development qualitative
information from risk assessments and key risk indicators as well as the operational var for erste group

distribution of operational risk events
detailed below is the percentage composition by type of event of operational risk sources as defined by article 324 crr the observation
period is from 1 january 2011 to 31 december 2015

the event type categories
 _ internal fraud losses due to acts of a type intended to defraud misappropriate property or circumvent regulations the law or company
   policy excluding diversity or discrimination events that involve at least one internal party
 _ external fraud losses due to acts by a third party of a type intended to defraud misappropriate property or circumvent the law
 _ employment practices and workplace safety losses arising from acts inconsistent with employment health or safety laws or
   agreements from payment of personal injury claims or from diversity or discrimination events
 _ clients products and business practices losses arising from unintentional or negligent failure to meet a professional obligation
   to specific clients including fiduciary and suitability requirements or from the nature or design of a product
 _ damage to physical assets losses arising from loss of or damage to physical assets caused by natural disaster or other events
 _ business disruption and system failures losses arising from disruption of business or system failures
 _ execution delivery and process management losses from failed transaction processing or process management losses pertain

45 hedge accounting

the interest rate risk of the banking book is managed by group alm preference in managing interest rate risk is given to using bonds
loans or derivatives with hedge accounting for derivatives usually applied in accordance with ifrs the main guideline for interest rate
risk positioning is the group interest rate risk strategy that is approved by the group alco for the relevant time period

fair value hedges are employed to reduce interest rate risk of issued bonds purchased securities loans or deposits on the erste group
balance sheet in general erste group policy is to swap all substantial fixed or structured issued bonds to floating items and as such to
manage the targeted interest rate risk profile by other balance sheet items interest rate swaps are the most common instruments used for
fair value hedges concerning loans purchased securities and securities in issuance fair value is also hedged by means of crosscurrency
swaps swaptions caps floors and other types of derivative instruments

a minor part of the cash flow hedge relationship have been terminated in 2015 because of inneficiencies caused by the zero procent floors
in the client loan contracts

cash flow hedges are used to eliminate uncertainty in future cash flows in order to stabilise net interest income the most common such
hedge in erste group consists of interest rate swaps hedging variable cash flows of floating assets into fixed cash flows floors or caps are
used to secure the targeted level of interest income in a changing interest rate environment

in the reporting period eur 388 million 2014 eur 515 million was taken from the cash flow hedge reserve and recognised as in
come in the consolidated income statement while eur 114 million 2014 eur 2243 million was recognised directly in other compre
hensive income the majority of the hedged cash flows are likely to occur within the next five years and will then be recognised in the
consolidated income statement ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges amounting to eur 01 million 2014 eur 02 million is report
ed in the net trading result

fair value hedges in 2015 resulted in losses of eur 3661 million 2014 gain of eur 4974 million on hedging instruments and gains of
eur 3596 million on hedged items 2014 loss of eur 4664 million

46 fair value of financial instruments

all financial instruments are measured at fair value on recurring basis

financial instruments carried at fair value
the measurement of fair value at erste group is based primarily on external sources of data stock market prices or broker quotes in
highly liquid market segments financial instruments for which the fair value is determined on the basis of quoted market prices are
mainly listed securities and derivatives as well as liquid otc bonds

description of valuation models and parameters
erste group uses valuation models that have been tested internally and for which the valuation parameters such as interest rates ex
change rates volatilities and credit spreads have been determined independently in 2015 as a consequence of the negative interest envi
ronment valuation models of interest rate options for the respective currencies were adjusted lognormal valuation models were re
placed by standard market models which are based on a shifted lognormal distribution or a standard distribution for such models nega
tive interest rates are no restriction

securities for plain vanilla fixed and floating debt securities the fair value is calculated by discounting the future cashflows using a
discounting curve depending on the interest rate for the respective issuance currency and a spread adjustment the spread adjustment is
usually derived from the credit spread curve of the issuer if no issuer curve is available the spread is derived from a proxy instrument and
adjusted for differences in the risk profile of the instruments if no close proxy is available the spread adjustment is estimated using other
information including estimation of the credit spread based on internal ratings and pds or management judgment for more complex debt
securities eg including optionlike features such as callable capfloor indexlinked the fair value is determined using combinations of
discounted cashflow models and more sophisticated modeling techniques including methods described for otcderivatives the fair
value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option is determined in consistency with
similar instruments held as assets the spread adjustment for erste groups own credit risk is derived from buyback levels of own issu
ances techniques for equity securities may also include models based on earnings multiples

otcderivative financial instruments derivative instruments traded in liquid markets eg interest rate swaps and options foreign
exchange forward and options options on listed securities and indices credit default swaps and commodity swaps are valued by using
standard valuation models these models include discounting cash flow models option models of the blackscholes and hullwhite
type as well as hazard rate models models are calibrated on quoted market data including implied volatilities valuation models for
more complex instruments also use montecarlotechniques for instruments in less liquid markets data obtained from less frequent
transactions or extrapolation techniques are used

erste group values derivatives at midmarket levels to reflect the potential bidaskspread of the relevant positions an adjustment based
on market liquidity is performed the adjustment parameters depend on product type currency maturity and notional size parameters are
reviewed on a regular basis or in case of significant market moves netting is not applied when determining the bidaskspread adjustments

credit value adjustments cva for counterparty risk and debit value adjustments dva for own default credit risk are applied to otc
derivatives for the cva the adjustment is driven by the expected positive exposure of all derivatives and the credit quality of the coun
terparty dva is driven by the expected negative exposure and erste groups credit quality erste group has implemented an approach
where the modeling of the expected exposure is based on option replication strategies for products where an option replication is not
feasible the exposure is computed with montecarlo simulation techniques one of the two modeling approaches is considered for the
most relevant portfolios and products the methodology for the remaining entities and products is determined by market value plus add
on considerations the probability of default by counterparties that are not traded in an active market is determined from internal pds
mapped to a basket of liquid titles present in the central european market market based valuation concepts are incorporated for this
counterparties with liquid bond or cds markets are valued by the respective singlename market based pd derived from the prices erste
groups probability of default has been derived from the buyback levels of erste groups issuances netting has only been considered for
a few counterparties where the impact was material in these cases netting has been applied for both cva and dva for collateralised
derivatives the effect of collateral received is considered and reduces the amount of cva accordingly for counterparties with csa
agreements in place no cva was taken into account for all cases with immaterial threshold amounts

according to the described methodology the accumulated cvaadjustments amounts to eur 439 million 2014 eur 528 million and
the total dvaadjustment amounts to eur 120 million 2014 eur 127 million



                                                                                                                                          237

validation and control
the responsibility for valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value is independent of the trading units in addition erste
group has implemented an independent validation function in order to ensure separation between units responsible for model develop
ment fair value measurement and validation the aim of independent model validation is to evaluate model risks arising from the models
theoretical foundation the appropriateness of input data market data and model calibration

fair value hierarchy
financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value are categorized under the three levels of the ifrs fair value hierarchy

level 1 of the fair value hierarchy
the fair value of financial instruments assigned to level 1 of the fair value hierarchy is determined based on quoted prices in active mar
kets for identical financial assets and liabilities more particular the evaluated fair value can qualify as level 1 if transactions occur with
sufficient frequency volume and pricing consistency on an ongoing basis

these include exchange traded derivatives futures options shares government bonds as well as other bonds and funds which are trad
ed in highly liquid and active markets

level 2 of the fair value hierarchy
in case a market quote is used for valuation but due to restricted liquidity the market does not qualify as active derived from available
market liquidity indicators the instrument is classified as level 2 if no market prices are available the fair value is measured by using
valuation models which are based on observable market data if all the significant inputs in the valuation model are observable the instru
ment is classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy for level 2 valuations typically yield curves credit spreads and implied volatilities
are used as observable market parameters

these include otc derivatives less liquid shares bonds and funds as well as asset backed securities abs collateralized debt obliga
tions cdo and own issues

level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
in some cases the fair value can be determined neither on the basis of sufficiently frequent quoted market prices nor of valuation models
that rely entirely on observable market data in these cases individual valuation parameters not observable in the market are estimated on
the basis of reasonable assumptions if any unobservable input in the valuation model is significant or the price quote used is updated
infrequently the instrument is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for level 3 valuations besides observable parameters typical
ly credit spreads derived from internally calculated historical probability of default pd and loss given default lgd measures are used
as unobservable parameters

these include shares and funds not quoted illiquid bonds as well as illiquid asset backed securities abs and collateralized debt obliga
tions cdo

a reclassification from level 1 into level 2 or level 3 as well as vice versa will be performed if the financial instrument does no longer
meet the criteria described above for the respective level

the following table shows the classification of financial instruments carried at fair value with respect to levels of the fair value hierarchy

movements in 2015 the total value of level 2 financial assets decreased between 2015 and 2014 by eur 5825 million the level 2
securities fair value change down by eur 3260 million can be explained for the most part by matured or sold positions in the amount
of eur 2838 million and new investments in the amount of eur 925 million the reduction in volume for securities that have been
allocated to level 2 at both reporting dates 2015 and 2014 amounted to eur 204 million due to partial sales and purchases and fair value
changes caused by market movements

due to reduced market depth a total volume of eur 200 million was reclassified from level 1 to level 2 in 2015 as previously outlined
this applies mainly to bonds issued by financial institutions and other corporates securities in the amount of eur 1039 million were
reclassified from level 2 to level 1 for the reporting date due to the use of significant nonobservable valuation parameters a total volume
of eur 151 million was reclassified from level 2 to level 3 participations as well as securities issues by financial institutions are affected
by this reclassification due to a change to valuation models with significant observable parameters a total volume of eur 94 million was

reclassified from level 3 to level 2 as a consequence of the sale of assets which were held for sale the level 2 position decreased by
eur 53 million the remaining decrease in the amount of eur 193 million was due to partial sales and fair value changes of reclassified
instruments the decrease on the asset side derivatives in level 2 by eur 2565 million are caused by changes in market values and by
netting effects
on the liability side as far as securities are concerned there were no significant movements between the levels changes in the amounts
were caused either by purchases sales or changes in market value the changes of derivatives were mainly caused by changes in the
market value and netting effects

movements in 2014 the total value of level 2 financial assets decreased between 2014 and 2013 by eur 1843 million the level 2
securities fair value change down by eur 3631 million can be explained for the most part by matured or sold positions in the amount
of eur 52 billion and new investments in the amount of eur 23 billion the reduction in volume for securities that have been allocated
to level 2 at both reporting dates 2014 and 2013 amounted to eur 70 million due to partial sales and purchases and fair value changes
caused by market movements
due to reduced market depth a total volume of eur 07 billion was reclassified from level 1 to level 2 in 2014 as previously outlined
this applies mainly to bonds issued by financial institutions and other corporates securities in the amount of eur 11 billion were reclas
sified from level 2 to level 1 for the reporting date due to the use of significant nonobservable valuation parameters a total volume of
eur 02 billion was reclassified from level 2 to level 3 this applies mainly to securitizations and securities issued by financial institu
tions due to a change to valuation models with significant observable parameters a total volume of eur 01 billion was reclassified from
level 3 to level 2 the remaining decrease in the amount of eur 02 billion was due to partial sales and fair value changes of reclassified
instruments the decrease on the asset side in derivatives in level 1 by eur 14 million represented only a very small contribution to the
overall changes
on the liability side as far as securities are concerned there were no movements between the levels changes in the amounts were caused
either by purchases sales or changes in market value the changes of derivatives were mainly caused by changes in the market value

other comprehensive income of level 3 financial instruments disclosed in the balance sheet line item financial assets  available for sale
are reported directly in equity under available for sale reserve

movements in 2015 the reclassification of securities to level 3 was caused by a decrease in market liquidity and was based on an in
depth analysis of broker quotes in addition to the assessment of the parameters used for the fair value determination the external market
values of securitizations were subject to an internal validation process which is based on observable market inputs based on the de
scribed analysis securities in the amount of eur 151 million were reclassified from level 2 to level 3 the change is coming from securi
ties issued by corporates eur 68 million securities from financial institutions eur 58 million and securities from sovereigns in the
amount of eur 25 million on the other hand securities in the amount of eur 94 million were reclassified from level 3 to level 2 there
of eur 46 million are securities issued by corporates eur 35 million from financial institutions and eur 13 million are securities is
sued by sovereigns out of level 1 eur 6 million were reclassified to level 3 the additional increase in level 3 positions was on the one
hand caused by an increase in derivative exposure of eur 20 million and on the other hand caused by the purchase sale and market value
change of securities in the amount of eur 140 million
the increase of level 3 market values in the category financial assets  available for sale is based on the fair value valuation of the visa
europe participation as of 31st december 2015 the revaluation of the participation was necessary due to a purchase offer posted by visa
inc the proposed offer is a combination of an initial cash payment combined with preferred shares of visa inc and a potential earn out
payment in 2020 all these elements have been considered in the determination of the fair value as significant input parameters for the
fair value determination could not be derived from external observable parameters it was necessary to include assumptions and estima
tions in the determination of the fair value in total this revaluation led to an increase within the category financial assets  available for
sale amounting to eur 127 million
the cash payment was accounted for with its present value as of 31st december 2015 the preferred shares which are issued as part of the
initial purchase price can only be sold after a minimum holding period of 12 years in addition to that the preferred shares are subject to
conditions for which a nonfulfilment would affect the conversation into market tradable visa inc shares based on these restrictive
conditions the preferred shares were subject to a discount compared to tradable visa inc shares moreover the amount of the potential
earn out payment is influenced by external specification for which the probability of fulfilment cannot be derived from external observa
ble parameters as a consequence the potential earn out payment was derived from estimated assumptions

movements in 2014 the reclassification of securities to level 3 was caused by a decrease in market liquidity and was based on an in
depth analysis of broker quotes in addition to the assessment of the parameters used for the fair value determination securitisations were
subject to a market liquidity analysis based on market data provider scoring the issues with insufficient score were moved from level 2 to
level 3 the move to level 3 mainly affects securitizations eur 146 million where significant valuation parameters were no longer
observable as well as issues from financial institutions eur 42 million in contrast the reclassification of securities from level 3 to
level 2 in 2014 was mainly due to a change to modelled prices with observable input parameters
an amount of eur 117 million shown within transfers into level 3 is related to investments in equity instruments which have been
measured at cost according to ias 3946 c in the past in 2014 these investments have been measured at fair value for the first time and
have therefore been added to the category available for sale

the volume of level 3 financial assets can be allocated to the following two categories
 _ market values of derivatives where the credit value adjustment cva has a material impact and is calculated based on unobservable
   parameters ie internal estimates of pds and lgds
 _ illiquid bonds shares and funds not quoted in an active market where either valuation models with nonobservable parameters have
   been used eg credit spreads or broker quotes have been used that cannot be allocated to level 1 or level 2

unobservable inputs and sensitivity analysis for level 3 measurements
in case the fair value of a financial asset is retrieved from input parameters which are not observable in the market those parameters can
be retrieved from a range of alternative parameters for the preparation of the balance sheet the parameters where chosen to reflect the
market situation at the reporting date

the range of unobservable valuation parameters used in level 3 measurements is shown in the following table

                                                                                                                               significant            range of

in estimating these impacts mainly changes in credit spreads for bonds pds lgds for cva of derivatives and market values of
comparable equities were considered an increase decrease of spreads pds and lgds result in a decrease increase of the correspond
ing market values positive correlation effects between pds and lgds were not taken into account in the sensitivity analysis

the following ranges of reasonably possible alternatives of the unobservable inputs were considered in the sensitivity analysis table
 _ for debt securities range of credit spreads between 100 basis points and 75 basis points
 _ for equity related instruments the price range between 10 and 5
 _ for cva on derivatives pds rating upgradedowngrade by one notch as well as the change of lgd by 5 and 10

the fair value of loans and advances to customers and credit institutions has been calculated by discounting future cash flows while tak
ing into consideration interest and credit spread effects the interest rate impact is based on the movements of market rates while credit
spread changes are derived from pds and lgds used for internal risk calculations for the calculation of fair value loans and advances
were grouped into homogeneous portfolios based on rating method rating grade maturity and the country where they were granted

the fair values of financial assets held to maturity are either taken directly from the market or they are determined by directly observable
input parameters ie yield curves

for liabilities without contractual maturities eg demand deposits the carrying amount represents the minimum of their fair value

the fair value of issued securities and subordinated liabilities measured at amortized cost is based on market prices or on observable
market parameters if these are available for issued securities where the fair value cannot be retrieved from quoted market prices the fair
value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the applied discount rate is based on the interest rates at which instruments with
comparable characteristics could have been issued at the balance sheet date moreover optionality is taken into account when calculating
the fair value the fair value of other liabilities measured at amortised cost is estimated by taking into account the current interest rate
environment as well as the own credit spreads this positions are assigned to the level 3 category

the fair value of offbalance sheet liabilities ie financial guarantees and unused loan commitments is estimated with the help of regula
tory credit conversion factors the resulting loan equivalents are treated like other onbalance sheet assets the difference between the
calculated market value and the notional amount of the hypothetical loan equivalents represents the fair value of these contingent liabilities
in case of the total market value being higher than the notional amount of the hypothetical loan equivalents the fair value of these contin
gent liabilities is presented with a negative sign

when their carrying amount is impaired down to fair value less costs to sell

the fair values of nonfinancial assets are determined by experts with recognised and relevant professional qualification

fair values of nonfinancial assets owned by erste group through austrian companies which are located in developed and active real
estate markets such as austria czech republic and slovakia are based on valuation reports relying essentially on observable market

court of first instance took a decision only in one of these eight cases and decided in favour of bcr against which an appeal was filed in
most of these cases the proceeding have been suspended until the constitutional court rules on whether the legal provisions on which the
actions were grounded are compliant with the romanian constitution if one of these cases on the validity of certain clauses becomes
adversely adjudicated this may have the impact of invalidating such clauses also in agreements of bcr with several other consumers in
hungary foreign currency loan related invalidity lawsuits by consumers against banks including ebh have been suspended by the regu
lations of the 2014 consumer loan law until the completion of the settlement and refund process towards the customers concerned while
some plaintiffs may not pursue further their claims it is expected that ebh will remain a defendant in a number of these litigations and
that consumers will continue and initiate further court cases even upon the completion of the refund process set out in the 2014 consumer
loan law creating a level of legal uncertainty which makes it impossible to quantify the potential financial impact in the case of adverse
adjudications in croatia in a case instituted by a consumer protection organization against several local banks among them ebc the
supreme court in the second quarter 2015 while rejecting some other requests by plaintiffs declared null and void contractual provisions
used over a certain period in the past which allowed banks to change unilaterally the variable interest rates in chf denominated consumer
loans approved in the period from 2004  2008 ebc submitted a constitutional complaint before the constitutional court of the republic
of croatia contesting the part of the decision referring to the illegality of unilateral change of the variable interest in addition in spite of
the long term practice of foreign currency denominated lending recognized and confirmed by courts of all instances in croatia laws have
been enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015 that forced banks to accept requests from clients that are consumers or individual professionals
to convert their chf denominated loans into eur with retroactive effect legal steps have been taken to challenge such forced retroac
tive conversion
