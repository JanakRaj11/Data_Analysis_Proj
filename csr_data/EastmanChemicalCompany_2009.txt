eastman chemical company  the company with a purpose

from the beginning eastman chemical company had a purpose george eastman needed an
alternative source for his photographic chemicals his product shortages led him to kingsport
tennessee to establish tennessee eastman corporation while many things have changed over
the past almost 90 years there is one thing that remains constant at eastman  our people

we have a rich heritage that we proudly share our history is filled with stories where we
have taken a challenging situation and made it a success this tradition of innovation and
execution has guided our past and will continue to direct our future as a pioneer and leader
in an everchanging global market our core values of quality creativity collaboration
innovation and teamwork provide the framework for our continuing success

community involvement is another important area for eastman our volunteer spirit
has made the communities where we do business some of the best places to live
eastman employees go to work each day making sure our products and facilities
are safe because we know our neighbors depend on us to do so we protect the
environment we promote education and we are committed to sustainable practices
for future generations

sustainability is a way of doing business at eastman our philosophy has been to
conduct business in a way that supports the success of future generations while
balancing environmental protection social responsibility and economic growth we
win awards that validate these principles for example eastman was one of five
companies awarded the 2009 presidential green chemistry challenge award from
the environmental protection agency we received this award for improving our
biocatalytic process this is just one example of how we used our ingenuity to
solve a customer problem and improve their product by making it solvent free

while our specific purpose has changed from being a supplier of photographic
chemicals we still have one main purpose  to be an outperforming chemical
company we are not afraid of change we embrace the competitive world
in which we live and we rely on our strengths  our people  and eastman
