  the primary survey involving both internal and external stakeholders was based on an online questionnaire including a
   quantitative part assessing the importance of the given aspect and a qualitative part inviting respondents opinion about telenors
   sustainability reporting system please note that we had a much higher number of internal respondents than external ones yet
   the answers of both groups were considered with an equal weight due to the methodology of selecting material aspects
3
   material aspects cannot be assigned to any specific organizational unit these material aspects are relevant for all organizational
    units
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                about the report         5

aspects survey at least one indicator per aspect the table always indicates which indicator of the gri g4 standard it is about and gives the chapter
that discusses the given aspect and any major change of indices in detail
