at textron we are focused on minimizing the
environmental impacts of our business activities while
maintaining and enhancing employee wellbeing our
expectation for environmental health and safety ehs
performance is simple  continuous improvement we
expect that our workplaces will be safer our employees
healthier and our impact on the environment lighter today

textron manages ehs systematically at the corporate
level our global ehs policies establish a framework which
includes facility auditing performance data reporting
minimum standards around ehs program elements
and quarterly meetings with textron businesses to
follow up on key issues the businesses augment the
corporate program with management systems of their
own for instance bell helicopter uses the du pont safety
management system and kautex facilities are iso 14001
and iso 18001 certified the overall program is managed
by the textron ehs council whose members include the
senior ehs leaders from the textron corporate office and
each textron business unit we use an annual goal setting
process to drive environmental and injury rate reduction     in this section you will see many of the measures
