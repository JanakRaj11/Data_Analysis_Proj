which the group could not or would not exist i would thus like to take this opportunity to express my genuine gratitude
to the people who dedicate their time and efforts to the common goal of making the group a success

to my fellow board members  and in particular treve and his team of executive directors  your dedication commitment
and unwavering loyalty to the group are qualities that are admired and respected in the difficult world of business your

       manufacturing

       this sector performed as planned despite performance being severely hampered by the july strike action which cost the
       sector an estimated r151 million

       the group prepared the best they could for the expected strike building up the required stock levels however this did not
       go as planned as the strikers prevented stock being dispatched this resulted in the sector still being stocked to capacity
       at the end of the strike action forcing it into poststrike short time and as a result underrecoveries numsa prevented
       all of our operations from opening up during the strike which included preventing salaryearning staff from entering the
       various premises and the intimidation of nonunion members the group is on track with its planned staff reductions via
       its automation and product import plans

       steel trading

       this sector performed well and performance was in line with expectations however we have seen a drop in the demand
       for carbon steel coupled with mill price decreases in april and may 2015 the prices decreased by a total of 17 to the
       march 2015 cost the july 2014 strike action cost the sector an estimated r15 million in profit

automotive

the sector made an overall loss of r649 million of which r505 million is due to the closure of giflo and r61 million
attributable to the july 2014 strike action

the board have taken the decision to conclude operations at giflo

the decision was made on the back of a history of poor margins and the current labour dispute with numsa which resulted
in a labour strike starting on the 12th of january 2015 and is currently ongoing

the strike has been incredibly violent with a number of our working staff and staff of our suppliers and customers being
hospitalised our trucks as well as those of our suppliers have been damaged working staff houses have been set alight
and the factory has been brought to a halt as a result of the strikers stoning all vehicles in the vicinity of the giflo factory
and cutting off the companys water supply

the company has reserved its rights against numsa and has obtained a court interdict to allow it to operate unhindered
something which is easier documented in theory than it is in reality

the closure of giflo resulted in the following write down

                                                                                                                    r 000

       impairment of land and buildings and plant and equipment
       the markets in which the group operates had been negatively affected by the poor economic environment in south africa
       over the past number of years

       although the diversified nature of the group was able to compensate for these negative influences to some extent
       management thoroughly investigated various alternatives to enhance group performance it was therefore decided to
       restructure the group in 2014 in order to ensure sustainability and an improved shareholder value in the medium to longer
       term

       the following segments were affected
       for impairment of land and buildings  automotive and properties
       for impairment of plant and equipment  automotive and steel trading

       pledged security
       certain items of property plant and equipment are encumbered as set out in note 13

land and buildings is recognised at the revalued amount which is based on directors valuations prepared every year at
year end the carrying amount of properties is the fair value as determined by the directors less subsequent accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses the effective date of the revaluations was 31 march 2015

the fair values of the land and buildings are estimated using an income approach which capitalises the estimated rental
income stream net of projected operating costs using a discount rate derived from market yields and take into account
the type of the property and the propertys location

the most significant inputs all of which are unobservable are the estimated rental value assumptions about vacancy
levels and the discount rate the estimated fair value increases if the estimated rental increases vacancy levels decline or if
discount rates market yields decline management considers the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions is
greatest for rental values and vacancy levels and that there is also an interrelationship between these inputs the assumed
discount rates applied for the future income streams range between 96 and 14

the directors assessed the useful lives of the buildings to be 50 years and the residual values exceed their carrying values

the giflo engineering bophuthatswana pty ltd property located in garankuwa is currently scheduled for auction which
decision was made subsequent to year end independent valuations ranging from r20 million to r35 million have been
obtained the directors are of the opinion that these valuations are not necessarily a reflection of the market value and
considered it prudent to carry the property at r135 million as the directors are unable to determine a definitive fair value

the deferred tax asset in jetmaster pty ltd and paint and ladders pty ltd arises on temporary differences most
specifically an assessed loss the directors have tested the deferred tax asset recognised for recoverability in terms of
ias 12 the turnaround strategy supporting the recognition of this asset makes certain key assumptions which the board
has considered and believes to be reasonable in the circumstances

the principal assumptions are summarised as follows
 restructuring of certain brands and the closure of loss making divisions
 continued cost control
 introduction of additional revenue streams which are reasonably and broadly achievable

a deferred tax asset of r88 million 2014  r46 million in giflo engineering bop pty ltd will not be raised due to the
fact that it is not probable that the company will generate profits in the future to utilise this loss

       17 restructuring adjustments

       the markets in which the group operates had been negatively affected by the poor economic environment in south africa
       over the past number of years although the diversified nature of the group was able to compensate for these negative
       influences to some extent management thoroughly investigated various alternatives to enhance group performance
       it was therefore decided to restructure the group in 2014 in order to ensure sustainability and an improved shareholder
       value in the medium to longer term

                                                                                group                    company
                                                                        2015            2014         2015       2014

287 capital management
capital is regarded as total equity the groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor creditor
and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business the board of directors also determines the
level of dividends paid to shareholders

the group may purchase its own shares on the market if the cash resources of the company are in excess of its requirements
in this regard the directors will take into account inter alia an appropriate capitalisation structure for the company and
the longterm cash needs of the company and will ensure that any such utilisation is in the interest of the shareholders

the group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of interestbearing borrowings to total equity this ratio is calculated
as interestbearing borrowings divided by total equity as follows

                                                                             group                       company

288 fair value measurement

fair value measurement of financial and nonfinancial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into three
levels of a fair value hierarchy

the three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement as follows
 level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either
   directly or indirectly
 level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability




                                                                                      argent annual report 2015             71      home

       the group has measured land and buildings at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of the reclassification of land
       and buildings as held for sale

       there have been no transfers between levels 1 and level 2 recurring fair value measurement during 2014 and 2015

       the groups policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or
       change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred

       measurement of fair value of financial instruments
       the groups finance team performs valuations of financial items for financial reporting purposes including level 3 fair values
       in consultation with third party valuation specialists for complex valuations valuation techniques are selected based on
       the characteristics of each instrument with the overall objective of maximising the use of marketbased information the
       finance team reports directly to the financial director fd and to the audit and risk committee valuation processes and fair
       value changes are discussed among the audit and risk committee and the valuation team at least every year in line with the
       groups reporting dates the valuation techniques used for instruments categorised in levels 2 and 3 are described below

       measurement of fair value of financial instruments

       foreign currency forward contracts level 2
       the groups foreign currency forward contracts are not traded in active markets these have been fair valued using observable
       forward exchange rates and interest rates corresponding to the maturity of the contract the effects of nonobservable
       inputs are not significant for foreign currency forward contracts

land and buildings level 3
the groups land and buildings and plant and equipment is estimated based on appraisals performed by the directors
the valuation processes and fair value changes are reviewed by the board of directors and audit and risk committee at
each reporting date

the fair values of the land and buildings are estimated using an income approach which capitalises the estimated rental
income stream net of projected operating costs using a discount rate derived from market yields and take into account
the type of the property and the propertys location

the most significant inputs all of which are unobservable are the estimated rental value assumptions about vacancy
levels and the discount rate the estimated fair value increases if the estimated rental increases vacancy levels decline or if
discount rates market yields decline management considers the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions is
greatest for rental values and vacancy levels and that there is also an interrelationship between these inputs the assumed
discount rates applied for the future income streams range between 96 and 14

the reconciliation of the carrying amounts of nonfinancial assets classified within level 3 is as follows
