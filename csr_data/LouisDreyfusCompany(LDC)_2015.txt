carbon is expended moving cargo from

inevitable and often advantageous

cannot produce enough or as efficiently
as other origins as with any other cost

the frequency index expresses the relation between the number of workplace injuries requiring medical
attention and hours worked the ratio expresses the number of employees in every 100 that experienced
an injury requiring medical attention during the year
the gravity index is a subset of the frequency index and shows the relation between the number of
workplace injuries serious enough to result in time away from work and hours worked




as the rolling averages show our work
continues to produce good reductions
in the frequency of accidents however
despite significant efforts with a 15
reduction we missed our target for the
year we will continue to work hard in
this area and maintain our ambitious
20 target for 2015
reductions in the gravity of accidents
also continued throughout 2014 and we
will keep striving to reduce accidents
resulting in people needing time off
work to zero

biodiversity
biodiversity is a major concern to us
both globally and locally to our assets
as we expand our asset base we
always give weight to the results of
both environmental and social impact
assessments before beginning projects
in any area where there are possible
sensitivities
globally we support a number of
initiatives especially in asia and africa
aimed at protecting and enriching the
biodiversity this way we hope that
we not only prevent our operations
damaging local ecosystems but
that we also contribute to improving
ecosystems in many areas

long ago we would lose tons of our         through their corporate social
coffee to diseases and would not know      responsibility programs projects
the best way to manage our farming         should touch the lives of many with
activities                                for example
some of the old problems have gone           	scholarship funds for childrens
partly thanks to training from private          education
sector companies and government we
now know how to manage our farming            	water boreholes drilled in villages
better and to prevent the diseases that      	road repairs
previously destroyed tons of our crops    they should also visit regularly to

enabling farmers
louis dreyfus commodities also
takes direct action to support
smallholder cotton farmers
we try to identify ways we can enable
them to make a sustainable living
in what are often difficult conditions
here are two sample projects




mechanizing zambian                           farmers in zambia operating tractors
smallholdings                                 this benefits not just their own farming
                                              but also the communities around them
this forms part of our ongoing
commitment to smallscale zambian             this year we have built a plan with
farmers as featured in our last two          our joint venture partners in zambian
sustainability reports our existing          agriculture company nwk as
approach had helped 120 000 farmers           to provide a full package of machines
improve yields quality and income but       to facilitate effective tillage planting
ran into a number of difficulties last year   spraying and transportation

                                              backing nwk as will then provide
we have learned from this and
                                              access to markets and buy cotton
we are adapting our approach to
                                              and other commodities at full market
build resilience to such events
                                              value we were successful in securing
mechanization is key to this approach
                                              external financial support as first loss
a large part of the problem with poor         guarantors in case farmers cannot keep
yields results from farmers inability        up payments for the equipment
to prepare land fast enough to plant
                                              the scheme therefore enables
before the rainy season this means
                                              farmers to build their own capability
that they cannot take advantage of the
                                              and efficiency while providing cotton
full length of the growing season
                                              to nwk as to sell on to customers
mechanized ploughing and planting             around the world all this is done
would avoid this issue but the               through financing channels the
farmers lack the necessary finance to         farmers would not otherwise have
mechanize their operations                   been able to access with this scheme
in previous years we started to pilot a       we have now helped 134 farmers to
scheme to get farms mechanized with          mechanize their operations
great success this led to 37 further
