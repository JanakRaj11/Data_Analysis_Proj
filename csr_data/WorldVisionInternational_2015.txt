foreword from the wvi board chair
and the international president
11

responsibility for the proper use of donor resources and for the results
attained with them begins with the individual decisions taken by every
staff member
in a year of improved results in the field despite evertighter financial
constraints we are heartened by the professionalism and ethical
commitment of world visions staff and volunteers
this is reinforced by a spreading awareness of the value of accountability
among members of the communities we serve many things contribute to
this but one which became increasingly prominent in 2014 was our
citizen voice and action approach more than 600 programmes in 45
countries employed this methodology by which communities are
empowered to understand their rights and call for better services
especially for their most vulnerable children it goes without saying that      kevin j jenkins
an empowered community brings better scrutiny to bear on its
development partners like world vision  and that keeps us all sharper        president and chief executive officer
                                                                                world vision international
where we have become aware of failures  in the misappropriation of
assets and cases of fraud  we are open about it in this report we have
used each incident as a lesson for management and staff this included
eight anticorruption workshops for 680 leaders and managers in the
organisation the fact that theft fraud and corruption cases have not
been significant considering the scope and context of world visions
work is a testimony to the motivation and sense of vocation of the vast
majority of our staff
in addition to our enthusiastic endorsement of the ingo accountability
charter and a new commitment to publish information through the
international aid transparency initiative world vision continues to hold
itself accountable to our own child wellbeing outcomes these are
designed to enable everevolving annual analysis of the degree to which we
are improving the lives of children in all our programmes  relief advocacy
development and microfinance included                                          josef stiegler
in 2014 we continued to support the united nations every woman every           chair
child initiative to fulfil the millennium development goals relating to
                                                                                world vision international board
childrens and womens health our us15 billion fiveyear commitment
is being independently reviewed at regular intervals with a final report to
be published in 2015
2014 was a year with many new challenges large volumes of donor aid
were channelled to sensitive locations like iraq and central african
republic there was an urgent response to hurricane devastation in
vanuatu in the pacific and world vision began to play a prominent role
in promoting safe burials in the ebola viral disease outbreak in sierra
leone
each of these was a significant opportunity to do good for the worlds
most vulnerable children  and to put our commitment to
transparency and accountability to the test we hope you will enjoy
reading about those activities and many others in this report

accountability work for the fiscal year 2014 fy14 the period between 1 october 2013 and 30 september 2014 as
part of the ingo accountability charter membership requirements

while world vision wv adopted a twoyear cycle for presenting a detailed report with a shorter version
published in between this report presents the organisations accountability in reasonable size while complying with
the reporting template of the ingo charter the report makes several references to world visions 2012
accountability report which presented accountability experiences in detail highlighting systems practices and
policies of the organisation including key changes and updates

there are no significant changes from previous reporting periods in the scope boundary or measurement methods
applied in this report it is however important to mention the following changes in world visions operations

                                                                                                                                    accountability report  5


raising accountability profile

the world vision leadership demonstrates its commitment towards promotion and enhancement of good
accountability practices within the organisation manifested through public statements and internal decision making
processes during this reporting period the leadership decided to allocate additional resources required for a full
time leader for the global accountability unit which allowed recruitment of a new wv partnership leader in
charge of all accountability initiatives of the entire organisation after wide consultation with different internal
offices a revised and simple definition of accountability was created for the organisation the definition
encompasses internal and external accountability practices and was adopted in january 2015 it will be shared in
the next accountability report

this common understanding of accountability helps different departments and entities to join efforts in enhancing
good practices and building a culture of accountability for word vision

    world vision international 2010 annual review

     this document provides a highlevel overview of the wv partnerships activities in 2010 including selected
     programme highlights and case studies

    world vision international and consolidated affiliates financial statements

     these full financial statements are audited by kpmg the international accountancy firm note that the figures
     included in these financial statements differ from the aggregate figures given in the accountability report for the
     whole wv partnership this is because certain wv national offices are not consolidated in the world vision
     international financial statements for accounting purposes1 audited financial statements for each of the non
     consolidated national offices are available on their individual websites

accountability reporting

in the spirit of transparency accountability reporting enables the assessment and disclosure of our achievements as
well as areas where we fail to deliver on promises or to meet our own or international standards it offers an
opportunity for substantive analysis of the importance and effectiveness of our work at a time when there is
increased demand for greater transparency on the part of all actors in global development cooperation

in 2014 wv initiated accountability reporting at national offices encouraging different offices to include an
accountability component in their annual external reports without having to write a separate report this effort
commenced with an accountability workshop for 29 staff members organised in swaziland where a template and
guide were developed the template served as a starting point for encouraging offices to adopt an accountability lens
in their reports representatives were drawn from all wv southern africa offices and from world vision
international more details on nos that adopted this accountability reporting will be included in our next report

in our pursuit to realise the international aid transparency initiative iati objectives wv has defined a roadmap
committed to publishing on iati centralising and publishing wvs information under one legal entity world vision
international the iati publishing will start with grantsrelated information in 2015 while information on other
funding streams will be published in 2016 more details on iati publishing will be included in our next accountability
report

cities around the world the full list of locations where wvi and its affiliated entities work can be found on the wvi
website wwwwviorg under the link where we work

wvi was incorporated in 1977 as a nonprofit religious corporation in the state of california usa wvi has tax
exempt status under section 501c3 of the us federal tax code based on the charitable and religious purposes
outlined in its mission statement

governance structure and decisionmaking process

the federal governance structure that includes the wvi board the organisations highest governing body5 and
national boards is optimal in supporting wvs mission in practice the wvi board is composed of members from
the national boards who are diverse in their experience and expertise because members come from the different
global regions they have a good understanding of their regional and national contexts and provide unique
perspectives in representing stakeholders the result is the ability to use their deep knowledge and bring strategic
input and oversight at a global level

the international board which is part of the global centre gc sets policies that have partnershipwide global
implications as members of the wv partnership national offices have voluntarily ceded certain reserve powers to
the global centre for the effective operation of the partnership these are

            ensuring accountability
            providing global stewardship
            promoting the world vision way
            developing capabilities and leaders across the wv partnership

national boards where they exist provide governance oversight to their local entities they have an important role
in contextualising partnership policies and where necessary setting additional national policies provided these
policies align with partnership policies this enables decision making closest to where those decisions have the
greatest impact

of particular note in 2013 and 2014 revisions of the wvi board policy on national boards and advisory councils
was the establishment of a charter for relationships for engagement which further described decision rights
reviews and expectations between national boards and the gc this has encouraged further clarification in published
guidelines on matters of importance

in 2014 effective risk management including compliance was a high priority for the national boards at the national
board level a specific effort was begun to develop national boards understanding of their critical role in risk
oversight as per the partnership policy on enterprise risk management and with contextualisation to meet local
regulations requirements the effort continues to be a focus for global governances efforts and includes training
and development of tools for enhanced support to boards

division of powers

the wvi board supervises and evaluates the president and chief executive officer ceo utilising a protocol of
setting and annually assessing performance management objectives the president and ceo have established a
comprehensive support method for the wvi board by designating senior staff to each committee to provide subject
matter expertise the board also receives reports from management based on boarddefined priorities

    with the exception of certain decisions that can only be made by the broader council members

                                                                                               accountability report  9


process to support the highest governance bodys performance

the world vision international board membership is representative of the regions where wv operates members
are selected by electoral forums drawn from these regions based on defined criteria the board has established a
standing policies manual that describes appointments term limits responsibilities and internal accountability
mechanisms that support the effectiveness of the international board

reviews are conducted after each meeting to evaluate the performance of the boards work on a regular basis in
addition there is a comprehensive peer review conducted in 2014 work began to establish an additional assessment
protocol every threeyear cycle based upon defined critical success factors for board effectiveness all of these
mechanisms are reviewed by the wvi boards partnership governance committee which is tasked with the
responsibility of advising the board on areas of improvement for selfgovernance

number of members in the highest governance body

the wvi board has 24 members 23 being independentnonexecutive

mechanisms for internal stakeholders

there is continual transparent and meaningful engagement between internal stakeholders and the wvi board
through the senior staff that serve the board committees as well as those presenting reports and updates to the full
board recommendations from staff to the committees on various aspects of the ministry are considered regularly
in addition there is a specific people committee whose key objective is to advise the full board on staff issues the
board receives a report from management on the annual staff engagement survey

in 2014 global governance initiated an annual assessment of the national boards and regional leadership on issues
related to the health of the federated partnership particularly focused upon decisionmaking and collaboration
those results were also shared with the wvi board

these examples demonstrate a systematic mechanism by internal stakeholders to communicate to the wvi board
on a variety of issues

compensation for the highest governance body members

wvi board members are noncompensated volunteers please note that the president and ceo a compensated staff
member is an executive member of the board

conflicts of interest

all wvi board members must meet a high standard of criteria for selection which includes ethical behaviour and
are selected based upon a solid reputation they also must annually identify and disclose any actual or potential
conflict of interest to guard against even a perception of impropriety that could damage the ministry as per
partnership policy personal financial and other interests related to affiliation andor gain in any area related to
government or private interests are included in the disclosures

diversity in composition of governance bodies

as a global organisation that includes within its structure and ministry the richness of different races ethnicities
genders and cultures wv governance welcomes and values diversity as a competitive advantage that contributes to
effectiveness in the important area of gender both the wvi board standing policy and the policy on national
boards and advisory councils require that not less than onethird of the board be represented by either gender
there is an earnest effort to meet that requirement despite challenges of recruiting qualified and dedicated
volunteer members that also must meet additional criteria in addition effort is made also to recruit some qualified
members from younger age groups to expand the diversity range

                                                                                                 accountability report  10


the wvi board consistently meets the standard of not less than onethird of its composition being of either gender
and 75 per cent of all national boards and advisory councils combined do so as well those boards and advisory
councils that do not meet the requirement are held accountable for improvements until they are aligned with policy

global governance utilises a matrix that identifies and evaluates diversity for each board and advisory council
throughout the partnership a target of full alignment with policy in regards to diversity is set and there is
intentional work conducted by the global governance staff to monitor diligently and influence boards in order to
meet the goal

partnership and management policies

world vision has structures and systems guided by wellthoughtthrough policy documents

       partnership policies  approved by the wvi board these are highlevel guiding principles that set the tone
        frame behaviours and guide decision making where needed and appropriate this includes delegation to the
        wvi president to generate more detailed management policies to assist
       management policies  these are approved by the president or delegated to the management team
       guidelines  these are generated by the organisational unit that has management responsibility for the area
        and must be approved by the relevant partnership leader guidelines help to contextualise andor interpret
        the applicable policy to the standard required

before final approval internal policy documents are systematically reviewed by the policy coordination committee
for consistency in language and for clarification during 2014 policy documents approved or amended included
global data protection privacy dpp partnership policy on child sponsorship partnership policy on information
security communication reputation and crisis management and partnership policy on boards and advisory
councils of world vision national offices

it is worth noting that our process for formulating public policy around our federated governance structure builds
from a strong evidence base expertise and learning in line with the board policy it focuses both externally and on
intersections with internal policy

three tools compose public policy development checklists and stepbystep guidelines public policy cover sheets
containing all the essential facts and references about a policy and the public policy library on wwwwvcentralorg
for communicating and disseminating policies and position statements the organisation makes use of several

participating in child sponsorship are between 5 and 11 years of age while 12 per cent of children range between 0
and 5 years of age twentythree per cent are 11 to 14 years old with another 15 per cent older than 14 of the
total number of children participating 18 million are in africa 43 per cent of the global total 14 million in asia 33
per cent 08 million in latin americacaribbean 20 per cent and 02 million in the middle east and in eastern

81651 and mozambique reduced 10044 to 98856

revised world vision partnership policy on child sponsorship

in 2014 world visions partnershipwide policy on child sponsorship was established by the wvi board of
directors replacing the previous policy from 2003 underpinning this policy is the aim to partner with local
communities and supporters to improve and sustain the wellbeing of children especially the most vulnerable by
empowering children with their families and communities and inspiring supporters as change agents it provides

evidence of effectiveness child sponsorship research

in recent years wv has invested in promoting evidencebased practice in improving transparency and accountability
with communities and supporters and in improving the effectiveness and impact of its programmes to date
rigorous research conducted in partnership with research institutions has tended to focus on specific sectorbased
programming for example in education and health implemented within wvs broader programmes little had
been done to demonstrate how these sectoral approaches combine within a childfocused communitybased
development programme to improve child wellbeing and how this is supported through child sponsorship

the child sponsorship research project was established to fill this gap through an exploration of the following
research questions
     what contribution do wv programmes make to the wellbeing of children including the
      registeredsponsored children do the most vulnerable children participate or benefit
     how does wvs communitybased approach support communities to improve the wellbeing of their
      children
     how does wvs christian identity inform the way it works
     how effective are child sponsorship activities that is sponsorship communications and child monitoring in
      creating lifeenriching experiences for children communities and supporters
      how do programmes enable communities to sustain improvements in child wellbeing

the research is being conducted in three phases phase i was completed in fy14 it comprised a desk review of
findings of existing evaluations and research the review found improvements in child wellbeing in many of the
communities in which wv works but it also highlighted that wvs evaluation quality is typical of ngo evaluations
conducted primarily for learning and accountability purposes it is not produced to academic standards of rigour

phase ii sought to explore the research questions by leveraging and strengthening programme evaluations that were
planned for 2014 eight programmes in five countries uganda bolivia sri lanka armenia and cambodia were
selected phase ii is being conducted by wvs own researchers with guidance from academic partners approval
from an external university ethics review committee was attained for the research design to enhance the rigour and
quality of phase ii evaluations phase ii is due to be completed in 2015

phase iii will be conducted in partnership with a respected external academic institution and will be completed
in 2016

involvement of affected stakeholder groups

the development programme approach dpa is designed to empower local stakeholders to lead the development
process from the beginning together with wv local stakeholders do a careful analysis of their context identifying
the gaps in child wellbeing and which resources already exist wv then works with communities and stakeholders
to negotiate plan and manage their joint work towards achieving a shared vision of child wellbeing it is this joint
analysis planning and decisionmaking process that empowers local stakeholders to own the project plans that are
developed within area development programmes adps implementation should also be jointly baselined
monitored and evaluated

world vision recognise that children exist within a network of different relationships institutions and systems within
a family and community and at the national and global levels the stakeholders within this network provide many of
the essential resources and services that children and their families need to thrive such as access to education
health care nutrition shelter and protection they are dutybearers and wv recognises that they have a legitimate
responsibility for child wellbeing given the number of dutybearers and their ability to affect childrens wellbeing it
does not make sense for wv to develop and deliver its own programmes in isolation instead wv seeks to work
effectively with dutybearers from the beginning of a programme in ways that are designed to strengthen and
empower them building on their interests mandates strategies roles and capacities this belief underlies wvs
approach to sustainability

                                                                                                                        accountability report  13


sustainability is already at the core of wvs ministry goal the sustained wellbeing of children within families and
communities especially the most vulnerable and wvs development programme approach dpa indeed one of
the main reasons for developing wvs dpa was to address concerns about limited sustainability of child wellbeing
gains after a wv programme ended

world visions approach to sustainability is based on the understanding that our contribution to a communitys
journey will always be temporary we define sustainability as the ability to maintain and improve upon the outcomes
and goals achieved with external support after that support has ended the challenge is making sure that the
positive changes to child wellbeing achieved as a result of a wv programme last beyond its transition this is always
multifaceted in every context where wv works key drivers of sustainability including an intentional drive to build
ownership and to partner effectively and appropriately with local stakeholders need to be built into the dpa and
associated technical programmes this increases the likelihood that improvements in childrens wellbeing will be
sustained beyond wvs involvement in a programme area priority focus areas are

       local ownership the programmers vision and priorities are developed with and owned by the
        community and local partners this is after an indepth shared exploration of child wellbeing in their own
        context there are clear plans for how local actors will continue mutually accountable dialogue and action
        on child wellbeing priorities after wvs engagement has ended

       partnering shared projects including those linked to technical programmes are developed and
        implemented by multistakeholder and crosssector working groups local groups and organisations are

citizen voice and action

citizen voice and action cva is a social accountability approach that equips communities to constructively hold
their governments accountable for the commitments they make cva evolved from years of practice and research in
communitybased performance monitoring cbpm and following the publication of the 2004 world development
report entitled making services work better for poor people the social accountability movement gained momentum
resulting in new approaches and models such as cva being developed up to the first quarter of fy15 more than
600 wv adps in 45 countries were applying the approach to improve child wellbeing across the partnership cva
practitioners and communities report improvements in services and increased development outcomes as a result of
their cva work6 the internetbased platforms crowdmap and cva youtube are kept updated to ensure that all
interested parties  both external and internal  have access to information and documentation resulting from cva
work7

world vision currently works with a number of research partners to evaluate the impact of cva across our
developmentprogramming portfolio current partnerships include the university of oxford georgetown
university columbia university johns hopkins university the institute of development studies joint poverty
action lab jpal and the overseas development institute wv also works closely with civil society organisations

local and national government and increasingly with the private sector to develop contextspecific sustainable
partnerships where cva can flourish expanding cva into other sectors such as resilience and livelihoods and
water sanitation and hygiene wash the private sector as service deliverer under contract to the government
service providers became a key stakeholder in the accountability process currently cva is being piloted in drc
with mining companies to support the transparent extractives platform and transform the relationship among
communities affected by mining operations the private sector and government

wvs experience and evidence from cva has enabled the organisation to contribute to numerous national regional
and global policy forums and positions on the accountability mechanism for the sustainable development goals
sdgs  pushing for citizen engagement including children through social accountability and other means

wv national offices are also intentionally building social accountability approaches such as cva into the
programming work because evidence suggests that it is an effective way of building an enabling environment holding
powerholders accountable for basic services and promoting inclusion of vulnerable groups in policy and decision
making processes recent studies that include cva also indicate sustainability of child wellbeing outcomes because
it builds local skills and capacity for collective action that will remain after wvs contribution to the programme has
ended

this joint analysis and exploration process is intended to enable wv staff to build strong relationships with all key
stakeholders in the process staffs develop a good understanding of the activities power dynamics and linkages that
exist in the local area wvs engagement in the programme area will be based on this understanding and this should
ensure that wvs contributions do not duplicate or undermine existing activities and resources wv programme
teams support local stakeholders to define and work towards their own preferred future bringing groups and
organisations together to collaborate in this way can change the local power dynamics this enables the poor and
marginalised to negotiate with dutybearers for the protection of rights and provision of services for their children
and families

accountability to affected communities

reporting on accountability to communities became a requirement for wvs national office annual child wellbeing
no cwb reports from 2013 this requirement is being implemented in phases with a gradual increase in the
number of nos reporting each year sixtytwo out of the sixtythree no cwb reports for 2014 included a section
dedicated to accountability to children and communities and cover the four areas of the wv programme
accountability framework paf information sharing consulting with communities promoting community
participation and collecting and acting on feedback and complaints each report was assessed against a quality scale
that was previously applied in 2013 allowing the quality of reporting in 2014 to be compared with the previous year
there was comparative reporting on quality over the four areas of the paf this rating assesses the quality of the
reporting only and although it is not an indicator of the quality of wvs accountability practice at field level it
nonetheless provides a useful snapshot of programme practice

                                                                                               accountability report  15

            report rating max of 3 per
                   component




the report review provided anecdotal evidence that improving wvs accountability leads to increased trust between
wv and the community enabling communities to manage their projects better and ensuring that their feedback is
incorporated into improved programming for child wellbeing cwb the reports also highlighted many examples
of good practice in the four accountability areas for example applying social media and tools such as exploring
perceptions message box drama posters banners name boards and leaflets to share information with
communities we now have more knowledge about wv as we can read from the notice boards and meeting
notices are shared on these boards allowing us to participate meaningfully in programming male community
member focus group discussion held in zimbabwe one programme has set up contextspecific consultation spaces
for boys girls adolescents youth community leaders representatives and partners to ensure they are all adequately
involved in decision making programmes are also highlighting the value of community participation to identify
project priorities formulate log frames and enhance project evaluations innovative methods for collecting feedback
and complaints have also been employed including the use of the photo voice tool with children to collect their
feedback during evaluations photo voice is a tool that allows children to use photography and videography to
capture experiences for sharing with others

the reports also highlighted some of the continuing challenges being faced by nos in their understanding of
programme accountability application of the paf accountability standards measuring progress completing the
feedback loop and addressing staff capacitybuilding needs for accountability as a result world vision is addressing
these challenges

a positive finding from the cwb reports is that nos continue to show ability and willingness to identify and address
accountability challenges themselves for example wv mongolia included the following in its cwb report  one of
the key challenges noted by the community is the poor follow up done for the recommendations provided by them
 and suggested the following solution  semiannual reviews with the communities will help to provide feedback to
the communities regarding the progress made for their recommendations

the cwb reports also revealed that several nos have conducted a voluntary programme accountability self review
the findings from which are used to help formulate an accountability action plan for the no one selfreview
conducted by wv vietnam states it is particularly encouraging to note that 3439 adps 872 per cent agree that
communities are informed about wv mandate core values planned activities target beneficiaries and their rights to
provide feedback the findings also help to identify and find solutions to some specific challenges overall as wv
vietnam reflected on our work it became clearer to us that there are many groups and committees operating at
community level which require better collaboration to avoid overlapping and overburdening community
participation

                                                                                                       accountability report  16


in 2014 complaint response mechanisms crm remained a critical standard in the implementation of any food
programme beneficiaries shared their concerns and received proper responses particularly with the introduction of
ministrywide risk assessment plans mwrap across the wv partnership crms were prioritised as risk
mitigating factors that require regular monitoring during audit reviews

world vision engaged in a number of strategic crossagency initiatives on accountability and external publications
they include

         development of core humanitarian standards chs wv participated in testing the chs in kenya niger
          somalia and india a chs verification model was tested with humanitarian accountability partnership hap
          through a mock audit process conducted with wv united kingdom wvuk and the haiyan response

         joint accountability to affected populations aap wv participated in the first communicating with
           communities cwc interagency assessment in iraq in order to understand information needs of
           communities affected by the crisis and used findings to initiate aap mechanisms training staff and raising
           funds for aap

         wv sudan staff members and colleagues from the active learning network for accountability and
          performance alnap and cda collaborative learning project presented action research on feedback
          mechanisms at the alnap annual meeting in ethiopia as well as the interaction annual meeting in
          washington dc this partnership led to the release of a report entitled we are committed to listen to you in
          october 2013 the report documents wvs use of communitylevel accountability mechanisms in darfur
          sudan listening to and learning from the communities with which we work

         presented learnings from embedding accountability and cwc mechanisms in the haiyan response at the
           alnap conference in ethiopia

         realtime evaluations rtes in haiyan and south sudan included questions about aap reports are available
          on the alnap website a paper on rte was presented at the american evaluation association annual
          conference in denver colorado usa

         in 2014 wv cambodia chaired the humanitarian accountability network and led interagency research into
           accountability during the 2013 flood response

building staff capacity

to build organisational capacity in accountability wv humanitarian and emergency affairs hea promoted the
programme accountability framework paf across regional and national offices with a focus on disasterprone
fragile contexts and humanitarian responses wvs commitment towards accountability to communities and
protection from sexual exploitation and abuse psea was operationalised by raising staff awareness through
humanitarian accountability training and extending capacity building to other organisations

world vision engaged in a number of strategic crossagency initiatives on accountability and external publications
including

         orientation to accountability
               in the asia pacific region 276 staff were oriented to accountability in relation to their work eighty
                  were from the haiyan response8
               the haiyan team developed a threeminute and a nineminute video to orient staff to accountability
                  a draft interactive elearning module was also developed and will be completed in 20159
               in the east africa region 96 staff were trained on accountability to communities
               in the syria response jordan 89 staff were trained on accountability to communities and
                  international standards

                  sixtytwo staff of implementing partner communitybased organisations in the syria response were
                      trained on aap and international standards

building on local capacity

in the haiyan response community capacities were assessed as part of the rapid assessment using the brat basic
rapid assessment tool in east africa refugees in adjumani uganda helped to set up and manage child friendly
spaces

community consultation

consultation and informationprovision mechanisms were developed across a number of disaster responses and
were tailored to context examples are drawn from the haiyan response where there were innovative ways to
share information with communities this was undertaken in partnership with first response radio and radio
abante and from iraq where wv contributed towards setting up the internally displaced persons crisis call centre
and hotline operations in jordan provided information through leaflets and regular meetings with communities on

          who wv is and the project scope
          distributions when what
          complaint and feedback mechanism

in jordan the beneficiary selection criteria were communicated through an accountability officer or field monitors
due to tension from the conflict refugees within dolo ado ethiopia helped to select appropriate water containers

feedback and complaints mechanisms

in 2014 complaint response mechanisms crms remained a critical standard in the implementation of food
programmes beneficiaries shared their concerns and received proper responses particularly with the introduction
of ministrywide risk assessment plans across the wv partnership crms were prioritised as riskmitigating factors
that require regular monitoring during audit reviews

in the philippines a comprehensive complaints and feedback mechanism was established in haiyan including a
database to track and manage complaints in somalia within the somrep10 programme an sms short message
service feedback mechanism pilot in baki district yielded valuable feedback on programme activities particularly on
the selection criteria

numerous mechanisms were used as part of the syrian response

            in jordan  a diverse complaints and feedback mechanism that included
                   field visits and focus groups discussions with beneficiaries to collect feedback

      in lebanon  a centralised location to manage complaints and information dissemination to communities
       through an accountability and outreach unit
             cost was mainstreamed in all relief projects within the bekaa area
             centralised approach allowed wider coverage
             1125 complaints logged and processed through this unit by september 2014
             reports extracted from this centralised system included in external reports to donors as well as in
                internal situation reports

a growing number of disasteraffected communities used mobile technology efforts were made to introduce
technology into accountability mechanisms where a communities preferred it and b capacity exists in wvs
national offices in 2013 wv received funds from the humanitarian innovation fund to build a prototype to use
mobile technology in such contexts the project was developed to help maximise twoway communication with
disasteraffected communities it also enhanced wvs evidence base and improved response decision making this

                                   case study wv sudan accountability system

 world vision sudan wvs embarked on an extensive community engagement process to establish community
 preferences in information provision consultation with communities promoting participation and collecting and acting on
 feedback and complaints mechanisms feedback from the assessment enabled wvs to design an accountability system that
 was aligned to the cultural setup context and other factors that boost acceptability and full utilisation as part of the
 project start up for all projects communities were informed about the project start and end dates project deliverables
 name of the donor development of the selection criteria their roles in the project names of contact persons and
 mechanisms for handling feedback in all the projects meetings were conducted with the leadership first then the entire
 community for example in water sanitation and hygiene wash projects signboards with world vision and the donor
 were strategically positioned at each water point clearly showing the funding partner  usaid koica etc the same
 applied to every food distribution point signboards were updated on a monthly basis and they showed food types and
 ration sizes in the food assistance projects guides that spelled out key information to be shared with beneficiaries on a
 monthly basis were developed and shared as part of strengthening information provision to communities in addition a
 predistribution address where pertinent information was shared on a monthly basis was required before any distribution

 generally all projects were implemented on the premise of assessments done to help understand communities needs and
 preferences as part of enhanced consultation regular monitoring collection of feedback and evaluation were required for
 all grant projects women men girls and boys were consulted their views were used in making programmatic
 modifications for example internally displaced children in food for education programmes were consulted on a bi
 monthly basis through a postdistribution monitoring system

 communities were also consulted during implementation of some projects such as construction of boreholes within
 schools location of food distribution points and selection criteria consultations were also made on setting up committees
 such as food distribution wash and voluntary lead farmers among others however wv sudan is working on
 formalising and having systematic consultations with communities where these processes are documented and reported
 on a regular basis along with other project deliverables in other projects letters telephone calls and visits to offices
 provided feedback

                                                                                                    accountability report  19


wvuk together with international ngo training and research centre intrac and the social impact lab
foundation simlab who own the frontline sms open source software began important accountability work in
2014 the department for international development dfidfunded pilot project focuses on designing monitoring
and implementing three approaches of beneficiary feedback mechanisms within dfid global poverty

action fund also funded health projects the pilot was during the reporting year and was carried out in seven
projects in somaliland india 2 tanzania pakistan ethiopia and zimbabwe the context analysis method used
social technological environmental economic and political factors to assess local context and barriers and
incentives to give feedback the results led to contextualised design of beneficiary feedback mechanisms in each
project

performance and risk monitoring

world visions measurement framework

world vision is currently going through a fundamental change process in how its programmes and projects are
structured and funded which will shift away from individual project designs funded geographically to countrylevel
programmes designed and implemented more strategically and measured and reported on more systematically to
enhance accountability and learning at all levels this process is currently in an actionlearning phase but is planned
for organisationwide roll out by fy17

during 2014 the organisation also developed a new online programme management information system horizon 3
which brings together previously disparate systems to track and report on finance sponsorship and programme
related data during fy15 a second wave of implementation will include a range of enhancements such as mobile
data collection dashboards and reporting this will significantly strengthen the organisations ability to utilise data for
timely reporting and evidencebased decision making

world vision continued focusing its development work in sponsorshipfunded area development programmes
adps these adps are geographic areas of intervention where typically 35 issuebased projects are implemented
according to local needs and capacity for example nutrition child protection livelihoods mother and child health
since 2010 the organisation has focused on designing and implementing projects with local partners including
community members integrating advocacy work and a focus on the most vulnerable children areas of intervention
are now more closely determined by the field no strategy since 2012 efforts have been made to ensure that
findings from baselines and evaluations are shared with communities partners and project staff to validate or
question and discuss the findings

to enhance organisational accountability to communities and strengthen programme effectiveness wv is also
piloting an annual community review process to discuss progress successes and challenges including results from
monitoring and complaints and feedback mechanisms and to validate or update programme implementation plans
for the next year

       design programmes are designed and documented using both a narrative format and a logical framework
        to detail the goal outcomes outputs and activities in each project within the adp an indicator tracking
        table and monitoringandevaluation plan are developed based on the log frame for use at the programme
        level for management and for accountability to donors
       baseline key outcome indicators are measured during the first year of programme implementation in
        each adp these indicators provide baseline data for the specific area of intervention this information is
        used to validate or update the programme design and to use as a comparison with a future evaluation
        this is typically a populationbased survey sample of approximately 600900 households within the
        target area and measures indicators across the different projects for an integrated approach child
        focused measurement tools are also used to measure other aspects such as youth wellbeing or literacy
        levels
       monitoring regular monitoring is undertaken at the individual project level by staff volunteers or local
        partners as part of ongoing activities this supports good project management and can flag any issues
        arising during the implementation

                                                                                               accountability report  20


        evaluation key outcome indicators are again measured at evaluation after 35 years to measure
         changes in child wellbeing using the same methods but including qualitative data typically through focus
         group discussions and key informant interviews to triangulate data better understand the findings and
         explore unexpected or unplanned changes with the community members including children

global national office dashboard

in addition to ongoing monitoringandevaluation activities wv has implemented several mechanisms to assess and
follow up on national office performance and capacity the global national office dashboard gnod is a semi
annual monitoring report of field nos in 2014 the gnod included a set of 27 key performance indicators in 11
programming and operational dimensions the gnod informs the programme capability and performance review
pcpr an annual partnershipwide management review which measures no performance and capability to deliver
on programming outcomes the pcpr looks at gnod ratings and incorporates feedback and recommendations
from regional office and support office partners to assess performance in seven programming and operational
dimensions of fieldfacing activities gnod and pcpr focus on measuring the extent to which field no systems and
programs meet agreed partnership standards in key areas and on highlighting gaps and areas for improvement pcpr
ratings and recommendations are used to inform regional officenational office line management no organisational
capacity plans and annual business plans and programme support team priorities for the next fiscal year

accountability

the 2014 pe selfreview ratings are as follows

          12 nos 19 per cent rated green maturing  majority of programmes are maturing and none is
           emerging
          43 nos 683 per cent rated yellow growing  majority of programmes are maturing or growing
           but less than half are maturing

the ratings are defined as follows

          emerging e a programme is just beginning to meet this criterion
          growing g a programme is making good progress in meeting this criterion
          maturing m a programme is consistently meeting this criterion

additional types of evaluation in world vision

          impact evaluations a small selection of programmes globally are chosen each year depending on
           available research funding to undergo a rigorous impact evaluation
          expost evaluations a small number of previously funded programme areas undergo an expost
           evaluation where there is funding and prioritisation these typically examine whether gains in child well
           being have been sustained two or more years after a programme has closed
          annual monitoring of outcomes national offices are piloting an approach to annual outcome
           measurement to shorten the feedback loop and identify where change is or is not occurring and address
           this this focuses on the intermediate outcomes such as behaviour change which can strengthen the logic of
           results between outputs and longerterm outcomes

enterprise risk management

the focus in 2014 has been on embedding risk management globally  making it part of normal business  in all
regions and offices across the partnership good progress has been made in many areas

all seven regions appointed the senior director of operations as the regional risk management champion established
risk management committees comprising senior management and completed an introductory enterprise risk

11
  in areas where children face critical wellbeing needs demanding immediate action wv works with local authorities to plan its direct operational role in
addressing these issues while strengthening the capacity of partners to assume the role over time

                                                                                                    accountability report  22


management erm workshop these regional risk committees provide oversight to the erm process and support in
rolling out basic risk management practices to the national offices in some offices the local internal auditors used
their riskbased auditing tools  the mwrap templates  as a means of training staff on risk management and on
how to complete risk registers

risk training to date has been primarily internal and via webex however the need for more facetoface
professional training is now recognised as necessary particularly since the majority of staff are appointed only part
time as risk primes but do other jobs a threeday risktraining workshop was planned for march 2015 for both the
staff responsible for risk management and local internal auditors from the 14 nos in asia

by the end of 2014 the larger support offices us canada australia uk germany taiwan korea and hong kong
and visionfund had their own boardapproved erm policies in place these offices are still at various levels of risk
management maturity often influenced by the existence or not of local regulatory requirements the majority of
offices report their top risks to their senior management regularly and to their boards twice a year

an extensive review of simple risk management software packages was completed this year the objective was to
find a tool that would move offices away from spreadsheets to a more rigorous methodology in reporting rating and
managing risk it was also to enable a bottom up consolidation of risks from local offices to regions and to the wvi
level the roll out of a risk software package has been put on hold pending requirements gathering by global
information communication technology team for a global governance risk and compliance system it is anticipated
that this will address the systems needs of several stakeholders including global internal audit

in the absence of risk software a manual roll up of risks is being planned for review by senior wvi management and
the audit and risk committee of the wvi board in 2015 this will be the first time that such a bottom up view of
risk will be reported in the wv partnership to facilitate this roll up a risk library of 60 to 70 typical risks has been
created by working with subjectmatter experts from the main functional areas in the global centre

significant progress has been made in integrating the various manual incident management processes within wv an
integrated process and system has been implemented in the seven regional offices and the global centre which
enables the management of incidents across several functional areas  security fleet management people and
culture staff care finance and child protection other areas that have been identified to use the system are
visionfund communications and global internal audit the system also provides valuable reports on the numbers
and types of actual incidents these are included in risk registers and support management of risk

security and fleet management

corporate security

security of all staff is of utmost importance to the organisation which places a high premium on its workforce

as well as protecting staff and property good security measures allowed wv to work in challenging environments
the organisation endeavoured to inform staff through appropriate assessment and briefing of significant risks they
faced at work recognising that individual staff members have a role and responsibility in their safety and security
wv helped mitigate identified risks to staff through security planning training and management

wvi partnership management policy on security management

the 2010 wv partnership security and security management policy required wv offices to adopt and implement
appropriate policies and processes this helped address the safety and security of staff and assets the security policy
mandated the international president to establish and keep an updated management policy on global security this
management security policy forms the basis of new core security requirements

the organisation maintained a country riskrating database that is available to all staff on the wvcentral internal site
one hundred per cent of high and mediumrisk locations had corporatesecurity and riskimplementation plans
while 50 per cent of lowrisk locations had their plans approved

                                                                                                  accountability report  23


security practices

given the nature of wvs work in conflict and fragile contexts 14 highrisk locations had fulltime security officers
over the 12 months ending december 2014 the organisation had 373 security incidents reported on the integrated
incident managementethics point system into the wvi security incident database this is a 16 per cent increase
from the 2013 data and is consistent with international trends

the wvi partnership directly employs the following security personnel

        corporate security office  17 global staff
        regional security directors and advisors  11
        all operational country offices have either a senior security manager country security manager country
         security officer andor security focal point depending on the size of the office and risk level there may be
         more than one security officer on staff for example drc haiti

we are not able to report the percentage of security personnel who have received formal training on the
organisations policies or specific procedures for human rights issues and their application to security however
particular attention is paid to the selection and orientation of security staff all wv staff are required to affirm their
commitment to the wv code of conduct and child protection standards

global information communication technology and security

wvs global information communication technology gict department has made significant progress by reducing
the organisations overall risk by deploying technologies to protect the wv partnerships most critical data both
child and financial and associated systems gict also supports the secure development and implementation of wvs
most critical initiatives and applications both internally and in the field

additionally a boardlevel policy for information security was developed for the boards approval in november
2014 this policy provides an overarching framework for information security at wv documenting the information
security principles and policies required to ensure confidentiality integrity and availability of wvs assets
information data and information technology it services

under the umbrella of this policy wvi management is authorised to develop technical and securityrelated policies
applicable to the entire wv partnership that outline wvs approach to managing its information security objectives
this policy and associated technical and securityrelated policies will be published and communicated to employees
and relevant external parties starting in 2015

all wv staff and contractors and other third parties in their interactions with wv are required to comply with
these information security policies

fleet management and safety

the influence of ongoing fleet safety training was strongly felt with significant improvements in efficiency and
environmental impact including fuel consumption there was a flat trend in fatalities across wvs fleet of vehicles

during the reporting year firstphase training and implementation took place in mozambique zimbabwe mongolia
malawi mali and ghana meanwhile secondphase training of trainers tot and driver course finalisation also
moved forward and started with implementation in kenya and zambia the update of the fleet database and fleet
safety and fleet management guidelines for wv were reviewed

tots were held in 24 countries with 98 trainers trained to phase 1 and 12 trainers trained to phase 2 a total of
1012 drivers completed the phase 1 course and 142 completed phase 2

this information confirms the comprehensive nature of fleet management and safety training offered to wv staff

supply chain management

in 2014 global supply chain management gscm strengthened the entire endtoend strategic sourcing process
supported by eprocurement software called coupa it streamlined business processes improved process controls
and provided critical insights into spendmanagement performance supplier performance and liquidity

the spend analysis and strategic sourcing sass project that began in march 2013 was a collaboration with the
hackett group it targeted all seven wv regions and covered 72 offices the project focused on strategy
management of categories and structured strategic sourcing processes information relating to us466 million of
project funds spent was collected and analysed

conservative estimates of annual potential savings made ranged between us23 million to us42 million as a result
of this project world vision international managed to save us62 million since the projects inception in 2013

through the sass project global commodity categories were identified contracts were signed between suppliers of
it hardware and vehicles with global information communication technology and the vehicle fleet management
departments standardising product specifications and the procurement process supported the wv partnerships
strategic vision of simplified processes reduced total cost of ownership and enhanced lifecycle asset management
draft procurement policies for both it hardware and vehicles were developed they were circulated for wv
partnershipwide review and approvals these policies took advantage of the newly negotiated contracts with global
suppliers

new and enhanced wvi global standard contracts for goods and services were updated with robust terms and
conditions including supplier servicelevel agreement clauses that positioned and improved wvs relationship with
suppliers

eight hundred procurement and finance practitioners attended capacity and training seminars during the
implementation of the sass project topics covered included spend analysis strategic sourcing contract
negotiations and supplier management

gscm helped lead the creation of a new wv pharmaceuticals policy and standard operating procedures in the
procurement and handling of pharmaceutical products the policy was rolled out to the entire wv partnership

in 2014 wvis partnership leader for supply chain and logistics was appointed the new leader initiated a
departmentwide reorganisation that strengthened gscms presence in all seven regions he appointed a global
procurement director and a global sourcetopay implementation director he then moved both travel and fleet
management departments into the gscm business unit

gscm published and rolled out procurement manual version 20 and launched a wvcentral page of procurement
templates and forms for field use training materials manuals and other resources for distribution and
transportation management lifecycle asset management and disposal processes have all been developed and are also
available online for early field office adopters to use in their offices a fundamentals of procurement training course
was offered virtually across six regions with 219 staff participating the training covered procurement process and
policy procurement planning strategic sourcing tender committee and contract management due to language
constraints staff from the latin america region participated in the sourcing negotiation skills and contract
management training provided by the hackett group

overall the gscm team continues to improve the organisations capacity to

       increase value for money through strategic sourcing efforts project procurement planning and better
        spending on management practices across all offices
       mitigate procurement fraud and risk exposure through increased visibility better managed procurement
        spend and increased effectiveness of procurement tender committees at all levels of the organisation

impacting monitoring

measuring progress on child wellbeing targets

in 2010 wv developed a set of four child wellbeing cwb targets and each field office integrated one or more
of these targets into its strategy each target has specific standardised indicators used to measure progress annually
and to evaluate longerterm changes as relevant for the context and programming approach

       target 1 children report an increased level of wellbeing ages 1218
       target 2 increase in children protected from infection and disease ages 05
       target 3 increase in children who are well nourished ages 05
       target 4 increase in children who can read by age 11

after two years of piloting every field office reported in 2014 on progress towards child wellbeing in line with its
strategy and including one or more of the standard indicators following thorough review learning and feedback on
the reports and the process every office has reported again with significant increases in the quality of the reports
including the quality and quantity of the data included these annual summary reports on child wellbeing are based
on existing data collected during the year this data is then analysed against previously collected data to identify for
trends relating to progress and against secondary data and international norms to better understand the results this
analysis is used to draw out important learning and recommendations for accountability and for improving field
work

                                                                                                          accountability report  27

the child wellbeing reports include not only data on standardised indicators across multiple programmes by
strategic objective but sections on the sustainability of programming interventions based on wvs five sustainability
drivers12 a focus on the most vulnerable children disaster management and programme accountability to
communities

it is an intensive process that involves a whole range of staff time investment but the learning is catalytic for many
offices resulting in timely adaptation of strategy programming approaches and the systems and processes to enable
greater effectiveness findings are utilised by staff and internal leadership for decision making as well as to share with
key stakeholders and partners these reports are crucial for wvi to review progress globally on key indicators and
use the learning and recommendations to strengthen policies and guidance for improving both internal systems and
field practice all of these contribute to strengthening accountability

each child wellbeing report undergoes a thorough review process by the regional office at least one funding office
and wvi global technical staff these reviews result in

             report quality ratings using an internally developed tool13
             quality of evidence rating using the bond evidence principles tool
             summary of key successes challenges and recommendation for each national director and a regional
              summary for regional office leaders
             a global summary report on child wellbeing including the targets

national directors of field offices are held accountable for the quality of the reports and also the implementation of
priority recommendations within the next year this has led to much greater ownership by directors of the reports
and utilisation of the findings and recommendations for strategic decision making process improvement and
resource allocation based on feedback to date as well as this years review of the reports it seems that this
reporting process is driving positive changes and improving results in the field

for 2014 the thresholds for each colour rating were increased to raise the bar on quality for example in 2013 an
office needed to be rated 66 out of 100 to be awarded a green rating but for 2014 reports this year the bar is set
at 76 this means that it was harder for reports to be rated green this year

good practice examples

reports highlighted many examples of good practice in the four accountability areas for example applying social
media and tools such as exploring perceptions message box drama posters banners name boards and leaflets to
share information with communities one programme has set up contextspecific consultation spaces for boys girls
adolescents youth community leaders representatives and partners to ensure they are each adequately involved in
decision making programmes also highlight the value of community participation while identifying project priorities
formulating log frames that are essential during project evaluations innovative methods for collecting feedback and
complaints have also been employed including the use of the photo voice tool with children to collect their
feedback during evaluations children use photography and videography to capture experiences for sharing with
others some nos are also beginning to centralise and track the collection of feedback from adps

global programmes

in 2014 wv recognised three global programmes with high potential and capability to support wvs mission these
three programmes have the scale and maturity to influence the global industry and enabling the organisation be a
leader in their respective sectors these programmes are

           generations within families and communities

in 2014 wv produced its first public policy on birth registration which was produced in four languages with
supporting documentation including a review of world vision experiences of birth registration and a study of the
global policy environment for birth registration this policy included an excellent process of engagement with
several key stakeholders working on birth registration including unicef who the interamerican development
bank idb and plan international a policy brief on birth registration was also produced in english french
portuguese and spanish

the global health fellows programme was founded on the principle of learning exchange and presents a means for
graduatelevel publichealth students to serve as global health fellows in support of wvs 711 strategy for maternal
newborn and child health and nutrition20

in 2014 an integrated framework known as go baby go was constructed around the combined effectiveness of the
most essential evidencebased preventive protective developmental and lowcost interventions that serve as the
backbones for childrens wellbeing throughout their lifetime as individuals and as positive contributors to the
societies in which they live

the maternal newborn and child health mnch team with our child health now chn advocacy team actively
engaged in influencing the development of the global every newborn action plan enap and supported our
partners to ensure it was successfully endorsed at the world health assembly wha in may 2014 in june 2014
the teams developed our wvi enap commitment for the period 201520 and disseminated this commitment across
the wv partnership25

the mnch team supported wv kenya to perform a case study on community mobilisation outcomes in reducing
newborn deaths based on a verbal autopsy approach the case study surveyed 225 women and demonstrated that
over the life of the project since the verbal autopsy training in 2011 there had been a trend of reduced newborn
deaths at home and improved postnatal care by trained chws as well as community mobilisation by chiefs and
important decision makers

water sanitation and hygiene wash

in 2014 wvs wash team affirmed the strategic longterm goal that every child in wv programme areas has
sustainable clean water dignified sanitation and practices healthy hygiene behaviours before 2030

planning for this vision involved identifying a phased approach including identifying targets for 2020 which are

         20 target countries of greatest need 10 expanded programmes 10 new country programmes
         everyone in more than 400 programme areas will have access to basic drinking water supplies at home at
          school and in health centres
         everyone in more than 400 programme areas will have access to adequate sanitation at home at school and
          in health centres
         everyone in more than 400 programme areas will have access to handwashing facilities and menstrual
          hygiene facilities at home at school and in health centres

during the reporting year wv exceeded its targets in all three areas  water sanitation and hygiene with a global
investment of us113 million in wash across 55 countries wv is working to increase efficiency and quality
through effective partnerships and strategic alignment in order to achieve this goal

a significant part of the wash interventions that are tracked at the global level are tracked through wv united
states wvus for every child campaign which has significant wash investment in 12 countries in 2014 wvus
started tracking wash efforts beyond these campaign countries in a total of 26 highneed countries around the
world

wvs global reach is as yet unknown because many countries have wash interventions as part of their engagement
areas in other sectors  particularly health and nutrition wv is still devising a system to disaggregate efficiently and
accurately wash reach numbers for a more comprehensive global report

in the 26 countries where beneficiaries are monitored wv reached the following in 2014

            total water beneficiaries 2713370
            total sanitation beneficiaries 2037935
            total hygiene beneficiaries 2350493

world vision water points typically continued to function for at least one or two decades after they were provided
to communities as evidence of this and consistent with previous research the water institute at the university of
north carolinachapel hill26 recently described research examining nearly 1000 boreholes constructed in ghana by
world vision most of these wells were between nine and 18 years old with many even older the results showed
that 79 per cent of the wells were functioning at the time of examination a figure which is much higher than
reported in previous surveys 50 to 70 per cent functioning consistent with wvs deep community engagement
model the research showed that an identifiable water committee and evidence of charging a fee for use of the water
were the main reasons associated with the continued functionality of the water

food assistance

with a fiveyear high of us264 million in foodassistance grants wv in the reporting year reached 8 million
beneficiaries in 35 countries sixty per cent of those reached were children who without such support were at risk
of stunting wasting and even death

in 2014 wv signed the united nations secretarygenerals zero hunger challenge which is a global movement to
build political momentum for a hungerfree world a resource pack was produced to support no advocacy on the
elimination of child hunger and malnutrition at the country level hunger and child undernutrition is a priority
theme for wvs engagement on the post2015 development agenda

in 2013 30 per cent of wvs foodassistance programmes incorporated resiliencebuilding elements to address the
root causes of hunger and reduce the need for emergency relief in the future participants immediate food needs
were met which enabled them to devote more time to longterm activities that helped them grow more nutritious

our clients and their children

visionfunds mission is about improving the lives of children living in poverty during fy14 visionfund worked to
bring brighter futures for children by focusing on four key elements

       reaching the right clients that help fulfil the mission
       providing financial services that meet the real needs of our clients and their children
       protecting and serving our clients well
       demonstrating the wellbeing of children

reaching the right clients our clients are primarily poor women and men with dependent children in the household
who live in the rural areas where wv works to understand if we are reaching the clients in poverty we seek to
reach visionfund has rolled out the progress out of poverty index ppi assessment tool at the end of fy14 18
visionfund mfis are using the ppi to track the poverty levels of incoming clients and 13 of these mfis are doing a
good job of reaching poor clients in their context the following ppi data illustrates the practical realities of poverty
some of our incoming clients deal with

       62 per cent of new clients in cambodia do not own a latrine
       67 per cent of new clients in ghana do not have a cook stove
       67 per cent of new clients in zambia have grass roofs

providing services that meet client needs visionfund offers loans savings and client education to empower families to
increase income and create jobs some key achievements during fy14 include the following

       visionfund lent us906 million to 15 million borrowers in 35 countries benefitting 35 million children
       23 mfis offered loans that supported water and sanitation energy efficiency education disaster recovery
        and shelter
       40 per cent more clients received financial education in 2014 compared to 2013
       74 per cent of visionfunds clients are in areas where wv works providing opportunities for greater
        impact

protecting and serving clients well as wv provides services that meet client needs visionfund seeks to protect and
serve clients well some key achievement by the end of fy14 include

       24 mfis had conducted client protection selfassessments five were assessed by the smart campaign client
        protection initiative and two fully met all 95 indicators and were certified in client protection
       21 mfis had launched a campaign to encourage clients to share any concerns through a customer hotline
       14 mfis had received seals of transparency from microfinance transparency for participation in pricing
        transparency initiatives in their country
       six mfis were recognised as socially transparent and responsible star mfis by the microfinance
        information exchange a microfinance information provider

demonstrating child wellbeing in 2014 vfi work touched the lives of 35 million children but are they better off
listed below is information gathered from clients studies and ppi data

       89 per cent of sampled clients reported at least one child wellbeing improvement because of receiving the
        loan
       47 per cent of clients reported three or more improvements for their children
       53 per cent of parents said they are more able to provide sufficient food 47 per cent said their ability to
        send their children to school improved and 32 per cent said they were more able to cover their childrens
        healthcare costs
       a 2013 study of visionfund ghana by oxfam and triple jump released in 2014 found better access to
        health care for clients and their families than nonclients and that clients with business training reported
        greater income and savings

                                                                                                 accountability report  35


       ppi data is being tested to show movement of clients out of poverty preliminary data show that in a one
        year period 11 per cent of clients moved out of poverty in the philippines over two years 14 per cent of
        clients moved out of poverty in ethiopia and over three years 24 per cent of clients moved out of poverty
        in ecuador

a social performance database that would allow more robust input and analysis of social performance data was
tested in fy14 for expected roll out in fy15

humanitarian and emergency affairs

humanitarian and emergency affairs hea within wv helps the organisation in disaster risk reduction preparation
for and response to slow and rapid onset emergencies in disaster situations children are always the most vulnerable
to the effects of malnutrition and disease world vision works around the clock to bring hope and relief to children
and families whose lives are threatened in the wake of disasters wv has a system of categorising the magnitude of
an emergency depending on the numbers affected category iii is an extreme disaster

category iv which is supposed to transcend continents decimating large numbers across the globe as in the case of
major world wars has never been declared

                                                                                                    accountability report  36

dm2020

over the past two years wv has developed a new childfocused disaster management strategy disaster
management 2020 dm2020 this new strategy is a shift to a more nimble and responsive model that has increased
evidencebased leading disaster management technologies and strengthened interagency collaboration the initial
strategic priorities are the delivery of specific disaster management programmes focused on children especially
children in conflict and urban settings

within the dm2020 strategy wv demonstrates accountability to children and communities affected by disasters by
respecting their needs concerns and preferences providing critical timely information and involving them in the
activities and decisions that directly affect their lives

in 2014 wv began preparing for the may 2016 world humanitarian summit this summit is a unique opportunity to
make bold changes to the way the humanitarian system functions and to ensure that no vulnerable child misses out
on protection and assistance when a disaster strikes for the world humanitarian summit wv is putting forth
three goals that humanitarian action must deliver on one of them is to strengthen accountability to affected
populations and empower them to take on a leading role and to participate in humanitarian action

gender and diversity

over the past years wv has made intentional developmental and succession planning strides in gender and diversity
with the identification of high potential national directors and support office leaders we have women leaders in the
middle east and eastern european meer east asia eas southern africa sar and west africa war regions
world vision is committed to achieving gender equality across the wv partnership

world visions gender and development unit also launched a gender equality framework for action that outlines
the path to achieve child wellbeing through the enhancement of genderequality programming the framework
includes outcomes such as a reduction of genderbased violence and early marriage an increase in equality in
household decision making and improved mutual respect amongst women men boys and girls the framework also
provides a guideline for the implementation of the wv partnerships gender equality policy and for strengthening
programming on genderspecific outcomes mainstreaming gender in programming and strengthening organisational
commitment and capacity

with the release of wvs learning through evaluation with accountability and planning leap 3 in 2014 the
organisations approach to programmelevel design monitoring and evaluation gender is emphasised as essential to
improving and sustaining the wellbeing of girls and boys therefore no strategies technical approaches technical
programmes and area programmes are all expected to consider gender carefully in planning implementation
monitoring and evaluation leap 3 guidance also requires all offices to disaggregate human data by sex and age in
monitoring and evaluation data collection and analysis

building upon the leap framework wvs strategic paper on sustainability drivers that was developed in 2014
highlighted gender equality as a key element in working towards transformed relationships which ultimately
undergird sustainable development offices are expected to report on progress towards these sustainability drivers
in their annual reports

child protection

child protection cp has been working alongside sponsorship to give guidance and technical support for support
offices in meeting the wvi cp standard minimum responsibilities to be a childsafe organisation particular attention
is given to raising awareness on the safe use of digital technology and sponsordonor engagement another effort is
seen in the staff protection working group which has come together to assess the current perception of personal
safety or risk that each person contacted faces in his or her daily work this group endeavours to provide simple
guidelines for offices better to protect staff working in project and programmes that pose risk to their personal
safety

                                                                                                  accountability report  38


world vision saw a significant increase in the reporting of cp incidents using the integrated incident management
iim system it improved coordination among appropriate stakeholders with data confidentially stored in one place

in 2014 approximately 800 cp incidents were reported of these there were 37 level3 incidents which refers to
any child protection allegation or incident involving harm to a child by a wvrelated person staff volunteer donor
etc or death or serious injury to a child while participating in a wv activity with the current reporting
mechanisms in place it is likely that this tally will grow as capacity for childsafe organisation practices are embedded
in all wv projects and programmes

the continued increase in reporting in 2014 has also proven the likelihood of protection incidents being under
reported where dedicated systems are lacking wv has renewed efforts in training staff designing and implementing
cp incident preparedness plans and managing reported incidents a proposal to bring back end management of the
iim to national office cp leads was approved for piloting in the fy15 fiscal year

advocacy and public awareness campaigns

advocacy is one of the organisations three lines of ministry together with development and emergency relief

wvs advocacy work is governed by the promotion of justice policy approved by the wvi board in 2002 the
policy outlines the principles development of policy positions and advocacy campaigns and how this works in wvs
federal partnership the wv international advocacy and justice for children ajc team has primary responsibility
for establishing guidelines and ensuring alignment on advocacy positions across the wv partnership the group
tracks all major policy positions

the ajc strategy was developed for the 201014 period this strategy helped shape the decisions and choices in
advocacy including the key themes and issues that will be prioritised as a global partnership annual work plans and
dashboards are developed for the wvi ajc group based on the strategy and then monitored through the year by
the wvi ajc management team

the organisations global national office dashboard gnod has been updated to include indicators for advocacy
performance at the local and national level at the local level the indicator measures the percentage of programmes
where wv is supporting the community to advocate this highlights that the required performance is that advocacy
is done with the community rather than for the community at the national level a selfassessment questionnaire
moderated by the regional office includes a question about community participation

local and national advocacy has been identified as a driver of sustainability ensuring that communities are able to
engage in meaningful discussion with decision makers is therefore important in ensuring the sustainability of our
work

world visions focus was on measuring advocacy work related to the wv partnerships overarching goal which
contains three measures relating to advocacy these are

       number of children for whom wv contributed to policy change or implementation addressing causes of
        vulnerability
       number of supporter actions
       number of communities advocating

in 2014 wv contributed to policy changes or improved implementation of policy addressing root causes for more
than 560 million children almost two thirds due to the child health now chn campaign world vision also
mobilised supporters around the world to take 37 million actions engaging decision makers to make changes in a
single year there has been a significant increase in the number of programmes in which wv is supporting the
community to advocate  from less than half to more than two thirds

these measures help wv to track its advocacy work from the local to the global level

during 2014 wvs global advocacy work was focused on the chn campaign and influencing the post2015 agenda
the chn campaign has its own management and measurement system to help track its progress this helps to align

                                                                                                                             accountability report  39


the campaign across all of the national offices and support offices which are participating in the campaign it is worth
noting that wv contributed towards policy change that impacted 185 million children the organisation also
contributed towards policy change for 108 million children addressing multiple causes of their vulnerability

world vision has been influencing decision makers in the post2015 process to ensure inclusion of children as focus
for targets and indicators because it is often children who suffer disproportionately there is some evidence in the
zero draft that children are being included but the final intergovernmental meeting in september 2015 will see the
sustainable development goals adopted when this happens wv will be able to accurately assess its impact on the
process

environmental management

as reported in our earlier reports wvs environmental sustainability management system was finalised and
submitted to senior management at the end of 2013 the implementation of the system is considered voluntary for
wv offices given several priorities and new initiatives launched within wv for its field offices it continues to remain
a challenge to get different offices to collect carbon footprint data efforts to encourage nos to adapt and adopt this
good practice continued during this reporting period with limited progress while limited data is available on carbon
footprint from wv offices it is important to mention that wv programmes at the field level particularly
programmes that promote livelihoods have a good environmental protection component this aspect is covered in
field programmes to minimise the negative effect of programming while promoting good environmental practices
that contribute to reducing carbon emissions such as reforestation farmermanaged natural regeneration practices
fuelefficient stoves and so forth

in this report we share the experience of wv australia which measured its carbon footprint with positive results

world vision australia carbon footprint

world vision australia is committed to improving its environmental performance and reducing its contribution to
climate change and environmental degradation

since 2008 wv australia has considered the extent of its carbon footprint by measuring a selection of key activities
and consumption items that have the most significant environmental impact electricity air travel fuel only paper
car fleet and gas

wv australia set a target of zero emissions by 2017 for these key indicators it committed to reduce emissions and
purchase carbon offsets however emissions cannot be sufficiently reduced to meet its yearly reduction targets in
2007 wv australia expected to reduce its carbon footprint to an equivalent of below 5200 tonnes of carbon
dioxide per annum before purchasing carbon offsets

the organisation continues to integrate its carbon reduction strategy with its core development programmes it has
a reforestation project and energyefficient stoves project in africa both of which incorporate carbon emission
reductions that form the basis of certifiable emission reduction units under the clean development mechanisms of
the kyoto protocol during 2014 wv australia was able to purchase carbon emission offsets from its reforestation
project in soddo ethiopia28

table 14 shows the number of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted under each key activity last year
compared with the previous two years the data has been independently verified by pricewaterhouse coopers29

total emissions rose by 1152 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions due to increased paperbased
marketing activities management committed to immediate changes within the organisation to address this trend
this was offset by an 8 per cent decrease in emissions associated with air travel due to favourable variance in the
factors published by the department for environment food and rural affairs uk

education and life skills

in 2014 the education and life skills edls team continued to transition education programming from a focus on
inputs and access to strengthening learning outcomes for children through the education transition initiative eti
the etis three priority areas are 1 technical leadership and support 2 wv partnershipwide learning and 3
external engagement and resource mobilisation

technical leadership and support

            the edls team grew to almost full capacity and created the rapid education assessment design team as an
             innovative response to the increased demand for literacy programming support
            an additional 10 countries started implementing etifunded projects fortysix of 47 countries developed or
             initiated development of education technical approaches
            the literacy boost30 programme grew four new countries began implementation and two countries
             produced impact data
            significant progress was made in the development of project models for early childhood development basic
             education and youth including go baby go learning roots and youth ready

wv partnershipwide learning

       ninetytwo new members joined the edls community of practice and 15 interest group meetings were
        held covering topics like education in emergencies early childhood education and education technology
       a framework for monitoring eti and posteti education programming progress was developed
       a sidebyside mapping of literacy boost with cva was conducted in malawi the end goal is to enhance
        the literacy boost project model with a mechanism for strengthening social accountability
       work began with several countries including the philippines lebanon and south sudan to mainstream an
        education response on improved education programming for displaced or refugee students

external engagement and resource mobilisation for education ngo6

world visions credibility and reputation as a major contributor to the global education community grew and many
opportunities arose for edls to influence policy and practice for example in 2014

       the team began working with unicef to define life skills measurement scales and with the world bank on
        youth programming
       a number of edls staff became members of the international network on education in emergencies
        working groups on minimum standards fragile contexts and advocacy other collaborators included the
        global faiths coalition for education the usaid meducation alliance and save the children
       engagement with academic institutions and universities such as columbia george washington harvard
        stanford tulane and university of pennsylvania proved fruitful with potential for new partnerships
       the global edls team also participated in the annual conference of the comparative and international
        education society one of the most prominent global education conferences in the world of the 23 wv
        participants 19 presented in 11 public sessions showcasing wvs growing work in education and life skills
       resource mobilisation efforts around literacy boost included the development of two videos and an
        accompanying marketing package to help support offices fundraising for literacy boost

the edls team also provided technical input and review for several grant opportunities in east africa bosnia and
iraq and collaborated with meer wvus and wv armenia to develop a grand challenges explorations bill and
melinda gates foundation proposal titled go baby go the equalizer this proposal was successful and funding was
awarded youth were also a focus for grant acquisition through a usaid project in ethiopia for this group a retail
training project with walmart in brazil the creation of a blended youth readybusiness process outsourcing project
approach and the creation of a family of fundraising products to support urban youth livelihood projects

our total rewards philosophy is a comprehensive policy approved by the world vision international board it is
used to guide appropriate and fair compensation levels for all wv entities the policy covers aspects of both
financial and nonfinancial rewards to attract motivate and retain staff in the organisation these include
compensation benefits recognition development and career opportunities organisational value and affiliation and
working culture it specifically requires that all wv compensation programmes take the following into account

          consistency with our targeted yields to community and project
          stewardship responsibilities to the donors the children and the communities we serve and to our staff
          the ability to attract develop and retain competent staff with a heart for wvs mission and vision

          operational efficiencies to minimise time and cost in management
          consistency with our christian mission and ngo status
          consistency with local legal political socioeconomic and cultural policies and practices

the total rewards philosophy covers both financial and nonfinancial rewards such as employee regulatory and
other allowances and benefits as with the financial component our staff packages are designed to be competitive at
the 50th percentile within its labour market to ensure that an appropriate minimum level of benefits is provided to
all wv employees a set of health and welfare minimum benefit standards has been developed for comparison with
the local labour market and regulatory environment

world vision international executive salaries are set based on a salary market which is weighted 80 per cent for
ngos and 20 per cent for the total labour market annual reviews of executive salary ranges are undertaken they
may be reviewed in accordance with labour markets movements ability for the organisation to pay and individual
performance of the executive salary increases for executivelevel staff must be in alignment with the total rewards
philosophy that applies to executive and nonexecutive staff all executive salaries listed in this report are signed off
by the international president and also form part of the intermediate sanctions compensation review which is
conducted annually by the world vision international boards people committee it is then reported to the full
board33

the international presidents compensation is approved directly by the executive committee of the world vision
international board the international presidents compensation is documented in a written employment contract
its determination takes into account recommendations of an independent compensation consultant compensation
surveys or studies and performance

details of the compensation of the wvi senior executives with the five highest base salaries plus that of the chief
people officer are listed in table 24 the compensation is for the calendar year 2013 calendaryear tracking and
reporting of compensation is preferable to fiscalyear tracking and is broken down into the following categories

          base salary
          onetime adjustments and allowances such as relocation allowances
          ongoing expatriate allowances for employees required to relocate from their home country to perform
           their role for example housing vehicletransportation tax equalisation and tax preparation and other
           taxable benefits
          nontaxable benefits primarily pension contributions and employerprovided health benefits

all salary and benefits are determined in accordance with the total rewards philosophy world vision international
used external consultants to benchmark and determine salary and benefits the expatriate allowances vary according
to geography and market conditions these allowances are not designed as incentives but rather are in place to keep
employees from suffering loss as a result of the organisations need to relocate them

33
   as a nonprofit taxexempt entity registered in the united states world vision international is subject to oversight from the us internal revenue service
irs in a number of areas including compensation of staff the irs has established a safe harbour process also known as intermediate sanctions for setting
senior executive compensation which creates a presumption that the compensation is reasonable the process includes benchmarking against other
organisations and review and approval by the entitys board wvi follows this process which is a safeguard to make sure the public can have confidence that
charities have the skills and leadership they need to do their work while remunerating them in a way that respects donors aspirations

world vision has policies that allow some of the individuals listed above to access benefits such as travel for
companions and housing allowance or residence for personal use this also includes consideration of the effect of
tax tax gross up provisions for select expatriate benefits the organisation always follows the written policies
regarding payment reimbursement and provision of all of the expenses described it also requires substantiation
prior to reimbursing or allowing expenses incurred by all officers directors trustees and the international
presidentceo and senior wv partnership executives regarding expenses provided

when an executive has been asked to relocate appropriate expatriate terms and conditions are applied these are
detailed in the executives contract for the international presidentceo these are approved by the executive
committee of the wvi board all other executives are approved by the chief operating officer and ceo there
were 233 wvi employees who received more than us100000 in reportable compensation who were classified as
wvi staff

responding to staff feedback and complaints

the integrity and protection hotline is the main channel for staff who have a significant concern or complaint they
feel cannot be addressed through the normal management channels that is their own manager or their people and
culture support staff this whistle blower hotline has been in existence for several years the volume of cases
reported each year is very low for an organisation of wvs magnitude

a total of 57 reports were received through the hotline in 2014 compared to 50 reports in the previous year the
top four allegation types were financial misconduct general misconduct employee matters and conflict of interest
fortysix reports were closed with the following outcomes 4 substantiated 13 partially substantiated 17
unsubstantiated and 12 closed after determining that they did not contain enough information to warrant an
investigation or that management had already taken action to respond to the matter prior to the whistle blower
complaint being filed

                                                                                                  accountability report  51


world vision continues to support a fair and objective allegation management process ensuring complaints are
handled by qualified staff in a confidential environment the key principles are objectivity fairness accountability and
consistency the primary challenge is maintaining highquality investigation standards in the face of growing volume
and competing work priorities for the integrity and protection hotline teams this can result in cases not being
closed in a timely manner

                                                                                                 accountability report  52


ethical practices
so1 so2 so3 so4 pr6

anticorruption

world vision has a zero tolerance stand in fighting corruption and fraudulent practices it stands against any form of
diversion of resources or misuse of power that compromises our values and our accountability to children and
communities around the world

world vision adopted an anticorruption policy that ensures the organisation is accountable and transparent this
policy aims to avoid damage to its reputation which undermines the morale of staff and the trust and support of
beneficiaries partners the wider public and donors corruption also poses legal risks both for the organisation and
individuals involved

however given the organisations size and reach risk is high during the reporting year the organisation remained
open to scrutiny making disclosures in areas where it fell short of expectations figures 7 8 and 9 present cases of
recorded losses due to corruption and assets misappropriation in wv

figure 7 corruption
figure 8 misappropriation of assets

handling losses and fraud at visionfund

visionfund is seeing the benefits of implementation of global operational finance and credit policies in 2014 gross
fraud losses were us406105 or 005 per cent of assets which is a significant reduction from 02 per cent of assets
in the prior year there were also recoveries of us106600 reducing the net fraud cost to 004 per cent of assets
which visionfund management believes is extremely low for the microfinance industry

visionfund strengthened controls across the network with greater focus on areas of cash handling more mfis
across the network are moving to cashless banking and greater use of technology resulting in lower incidences of
fraud

taking a stand against corruption  staff training

world vision implemented a series of anticorruption training modules in 2014 the training pack comprises eight
modules dealing with issues such as conflict of interest cash and procurement misappropriation of assets fraud and
corruption in relief food programmes microfinance operations and human resources practice an additional
executive module is mandatory for all national directors

in 2014 eight training workshops supplemented with selfstudy by participants were carried out in various regions
at the end of the reporting year a total of 680 staff members composed of national directors staff representing
finance operations people and culture procurement and security functions had completed the programme

visionfund takes the operational risk of fraud very seriously and continues to work to minimise fraud at all levels
when fraud is detected visionfund acts swiftly in accordance with its zerotolerance policy

                                                                                                 accountability report  54


child sponsorship and marketing
ngo8 pr 6

sponsorship engagement and fundraising

during 2014 wv effected the new child sponsorship policy principles with guidance for sponsorship marketing with
20 support offices and about 100 marketing staff its aim was to build capacity and local adaptation of code of
practice relating to responsible fundraising for child sponsorship this included repositioning proof points and the
value proposition the specific guidance called sponsor experience seeds and tools was shared with all support
offices and key marketing leaders

the repositioning and value proposition support responsible fundraising in the following ways

            repositioning and proof points guidelines to communicate more specifically the vision for change in a
             specific community the plans and the proof of change as well as amplifying true and authentic voices of
             people involved through richer connections among all parties
            the value proposition explains the depth and breadth of our work with the childs community towards
             better futures for children including the sponsored child this is me  change my world  share my journey

child sponsorship assurance processes and systems

in 2014 we continued investments in people processes and platforms through the sponsorship transformation
programme staff and volunteers who work in field countries were supported with training and best practices in
communitybased care and protection for children new technologies and simplified processes were defined to help
to reduce unnecessary paperwork and harness faster digital communications whilst assuring that sponsored children
participate and benefit through the programmes

in 2014 several old and outdated computer systems were replaced in all national offices with the new singlestep
system improved processes and updated data privacy and security were addressed through the new system
requirements during the transition we experienced some delays in updating some child and sponsor information
while new systems were stabilised

better disciplines of data reconciliation and reporting are now possible with the improved system through
reconciliations we identified a relatively small number of supporters who had not been notified in a timely manner
after their sponsored child left the programme each sponsor was personally notified of the delay and individual
supporter concerns were resolved with our apologies

in 2014 the new rich media transfer system was deployed worldwide to facilitate fast and secure transfer of photos
and videos from field sites to other global users secure scalable qualityreview processes were successfully piloted
to assure the quality and dignity of the content before it is released the improved quality review process will be
scaled out in 2015

childsafe digital engagement

many of the children in wv communities are excited to tell their own stories to sponsors using digital media and
sponsors are excited to share these stories with their peers online wv mobilised endtoend mechanisms for the
online safety of vulnerable children children in programme communities frontline staff marketing staff and
supporters are all asked to adhere to the same guidelines for safe sharing of content training tools have been
developed targeting each audience segment in order to strengthen capacity in childsafe digital engagement these
tools include

            the keeping children safe online34 project which was developed with six countries in wvs middle east
             and eastern europe region and then extended to six more countries in latin america and africa while not

standards are properly reported and addressed

additional safeguards were built into the new digital content platforms national and support offices are required to
do their own filtering based on standardised guides to keep published content in compliance with the guidelines
