executive summary

the office of sustainability has been around for over 10 years and has not had a comprehensive strategic plan
until now even though it has had several plans for specific sustainability initiatives

the office plays a critical role on campus fulfilling a core part of the university of southern maines mission to
support sustainable development environmental stewardship and community involvement 1 this is a mission
that is becoming increasingly important to todays college students in the 2016 college hopes  worries survey
administered by princeton review 61 of respondents indicated that having information about a schools
environmental commitment would influence their decision of whether or not to apply to that institution

over the past six months fulltime staff in the office of sustainability worked with various campus stakeholders
to develop an eightyear sustainability plan the plans overarching objective is to achieve significant progress
toward the universitys national commitment of becoming a carbon neutral campus by the year 2040 this effort
serves as a stage for many corollary initiatives besides carbon reduction

the plan is comprised of three major pillars which are strategically designed to be mutually reinforcing energy
material resources and education  outreach all three pillars help advance carbon neutrality while also
supporting numerous noncarbon objectives such as resource reuse cost savings education and community
building

a summary of the plan highlighting the major intermediate goals is provided in the table below

the office of sustainability is charged with helping the university achieve carbon neutrality remove waste
support sustainability education in and out of the classroom raise money and garner media attention but has
little direct control over any of these activities with the exception of waste management therefore the office
cannot achieve this plan alone success will require broad participation from students staff and faculty

students staff and faculty who are interested in joining any of the activities outlined in this plan should contact
the office of sustainability here

                                                                                                                            6




introduction

in 1983 the united nations formed a commission to address the need for more mindful economic development
given developments link to environmental degradation this group known as the brundtland commission
coined the term sustainable development in 1987 to describe a more mindful approach to development they
defined it as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs 2 the definition is now widely used as a definition for sustainability more broadly

throughout the 1990s several environmental issues rose to the forefront of those concerned with sustainable
development including peak oil acid rain and climate change by the mid 2000s it was clear that climate
change in particular had captured the attention of the scientific community higher education responded in 2006
through a movement led by 12 colleges and universities to create the american college and university
presidents climate commitment acupcc 3 the commitment challenged colleges and universities across the
country to become carbon neutral the organization overseeing the acupcc second nature joined forces with
the nascent association for the advancement of sustainability in higher education 4 and began inspiring
institutions of higher education to sign the pledge and hire sustainability staff to oversee their institutions efforts

the university of southern maine was a charter signatory of the presidents climate commitment now known
as the presidents carbon commitment president pattenaude signed the public national commitment in 2007
and it is still upheld today by president cummings

usms pledge is to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the year 2040 5 the plan calls for an
80 reduction of campusaffiliated greenhouse gas emissions associated with burning fossil fuels for heat
electricity and transportation as well as methane emissions from waste disposal the remaining 20 of
emissions are intended to be offset by university initiatives to reduce another entitys greenhouse gas
emissions 6

usm has made notable progress toward this goal and by doing so has saved thousands of dollars per year
since 2006 gross greenhouse gas emissions from heat were reduced by 23 and emissions from waste fell
20 as the university surpassed a 54 waste diversion rate in fact usms waste diversion activities have
earned the school national recognition increased efficiency of operations key behavioral change initiatives and
an expansion of surplus operations resulted in five awards from the us environmental protection agency in the
past three years additionally usm has received significant local media attention for educational events and
activities on a wide range of sustainability topics

  offsetting is not intended to be a permanent solution rather a stopgap to buy more time to continue reducing university
emissions as new technologies become available

                                                                                                                    7




despite the universitys success progress on both energy and waste have begun to slow and the office of
sustainability has not been able to sustain a highlevel of student and faculty involvement in its initiatives if usm
is to achieve its carbon neutrality goal by 2040 students staff and faculty from every corner of campus will have
to lend a hand

engagement of an entire campus requires a strategic effort across capital planning daily operations and the
classroom sustainability efforts in each of these sectors must support each other in deliberate ways instead of
being carried out in isolation where they could potentially compete major achievements resulting in lasting
change can only be accomplished when multiple people share a common vision and efforts to work toward that
vision are mutually beneficial even sustainability goals as closely related as reducing energy use and reducing
material waste have to be deliberately tied together or else they risk competing with each other for the scarce
resources of time and human effort some past initiatives at usm have suffered as a result of the perception of
waste and energy or waste and sustainability as being separate universes when in fact the laws of
thermodynamics inextricably tie energy and material waste together as closely related sustainability challenges

for example every material resource requires energy to create from resource extraction to production in a
factory to delivery to the user at every step in the production chain fossil fuels are burned and greenhouse gas
emissions are emitted into the atmosphere the energy used in the production chain for a given material object
can be considered the embodied energy of that product therefore when we throw away material waste we
are throwing away energy waste disposal also results in terrestrial and atmospheric pollution the terrestrial
pollution is obvious to most people as trash piles up in landfills or gets dumped in the ocean atmospheric
pollution comes from waste decomposition in the form of methane a greenhouse gas similarly energy use
creates both terrestrial and atmospheric pollution modern industrial processes that use energy result in a range
of greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hfcs 7 and others use of fossil
fuel also affects land and water through activities such as deposition of acid rain and oil spills a sustainable
society and thus a sustainable campus necessitates careful use of both energy and material resources in order
to minimize waste and pollution

the plan presented here targets leverage points in capital planning daily operations and the classroom in a
coordinated way it also marries the dual goals of energy and waste reductions by carefully allocating time to
both and outlining education and outreach initiatives to strategically support both

education and outreach are also critical elements of the plan because no matter how sustainable the usm
campus physically becomes it cannot be considered truly sustainable unless its students are graduating with a
baseline knowledge of sustainability basic sustainability literacy is not just a key professional development skill
for usm students entering any sector of todays workforce it is also a crucial skill for students ability to be
informed citizens and active community members

the world usm graduates are now entering is experiencing unprecedented change according to the world
meteorological organization 8 last year was the hottest year on record since humans began recording
temperature and 16 out of the hottest 17 years have occurred during this century many scientists have

published papers in recent years suggesting that the earth is entering its 6th mass extinction event 9 when one
adds the scarcity of potable water across the planet 10 the overabundance of plastic waste in the north pacific
gyre 11 and growing economic inequality 12 to the list of challenges the task of maintaining a healthy environment
economy and society appears to be a monumental one

the science of sustainability grounded in systems thinking 13 is perhaps the most effective pedagogical
framework higher education has for teaching about the interconnected nature of these issues and training
students the analytical skills necessary to face these challenges as an institution with the motto university of
everyone its critical to ensure that all usm students receive sufficient education preparing them for the
uncertainty of global change as it will affect every industry and every citizen moreover every discipline has
something to offer to sustainability

the education and outreach elements of the plan are not only designed to teach sustainability literacy to
students staff and faculty but to exercise the section of the universitys mission dedicated to community
involvement community involvement requires that the university serve as a responsible local and global citizen
leading through innovation and research as a partly coastal university within a community vulnerable to climate
change usm has a special role to play in helping to mitigate climate change and its effects usm is also uniquely
situated to support maines economic legacy through responsible forestry and local food production two key
sectors of sustainability research

development of the sustainability plan presented here took six months office of sustainability fulltime staff
began by brainstorming which key components of sustainability should be the basis for a plan for usm utilizing
the 2040 carbon neutrality goal as its overarching framework they then settled on energy material resources
and education and began mapping the relationships between these three pillars

after settling on a conceptual model many of the core concepts outlined in the 2012 climate action plan were
revised and used to flesh out the conceptual model the team then began an iterative process of adding and
refining goals and activities to a spreadsheet based on the conceptual model they shared the spreadsheet with
one stakeholder at a time to garner input revised the goals and activities according to the input added new
ideas shared the spreadsheet with another stakeholder and repeated the process until over 12 key groups were
consulted therefore the plan includes strategic leverage points and opportunities from multiple academic and
nonacademic offices as well as student groups the plan was also deliberately aligned with president
cummings nine goals as well as the key performance indicators kpis identified by the university of maine
systems 2015 administrative review for facilities management

the plan primarily focuses on activities for the next eight years but the office of sustainability will be refining
strategies within the plan on a weekly basis and planning implementation strategies for the spring and fall

   systems thinking is a problem solving strategy that attempts to understand both macro and micro components of a
system and their linkages in order to develop holistic solutions modern application of the concept was articulated in
senge 1990 and served as the foundation for the frequently cited places to intervene in a system by meadows 1997

                                                                                                                                9




semesters during the winter and summer breaks respectively major revisions will be considered annually in
december to correspond with carbon action planning reporting obligations for second nature


presidents nine goals

the sustainability goals outlined in this plan were developed to strategically align with and support the
presidents nine goals in fact every goal as well as every action item listed in this document has been
aligned with one or more of the presidents goals 14 the presidents nine goals offer a critically important
vision for the future of the university of southern maine and the office of sustainability is committed to doing
everything it can to help the university realize this vision

the presidents nine goals are as follows

        usm will be known for academic excellence with realworld experiences as a core part of its academic
         program
        80 of our students will state that at least one individual staff or faculty knows them well supports
         them and believes in them nsse now below 60
        72 of our students will remain at usm between each school year ipeds now 63
        10 of our alumni will give to usm annually now 2
        the usm foundation will raise 50m in scholarships infrastructure and investments for our students
         now 17m
        usm headcount enrollment will reach 10000 ipeds now 8700
        usm will be designated as a great place to work
        80 will recommend usm to others post grad survey now 61
        usm will establish a sustainable financial model by attaining industry standards attributable to a
         financially healthy institution




14
  a spreadsheet is available upon request that shows a list of all the applicable presidents goals affiliated with each of
the sustainability goals and action items for the sake of space that information is not included in this report

                                                                                                                   10




sustainability goals

the strategic campus sustainability goals are listed below the goals are divided into three pillars energy
material resources and education and outreach each goal is represented by bold text listed below each goal
are specific actions nonbold that the office of sustainability plans to take to support the goal

for each goal and corresponding actions the table lists a date description metrics and partners for goals
the date represents a deadline for actions the date represents the time when the action will begin the
description offers more detail about the goal or action the metrics represent how progress toward the goal or
action will be measured finally potential partners are individuals departments groups or organizations who
have either expressed interest in helping with the initiative or are suspected by sustainability office staff as
potentially being helpful for the initiative the office of sustainability staff does not have the capacity to carry
out all of these actions by itself therefore the partners represent a crucial resource for success


                                                      energy

the energy goals and actions listed here are primarily focused on addressing energy use for campus heat
campus electricity and campusaffiliated transportation as discussed earlier energy and waste are intricately
related but for the sake of organization the energy implications of waste are primarily discussed in the
material resources section usms energy initiatives will also require a significant education and outreach
effort but those activities are primarily discussed in the education and outreach section

                                          material resources

the material resource goals listed below include strategies to address downstream waste issues as well as
upstream waste issues this dual approach recognizes the benefit of proactive strategies in addition to the
traditional reactive strategies usms material resource initiatives will require significant education and
outreach efforts and although some of those efforts are discussed here many of them are discussed in the
education and outreach section

                                                  education  outreach
the pillar of education and outreach is carefully designed to support the other two pillars energy and material
resources it is also designed to accomplish something greater than energy and material resources could on
their own in the framework of donella meadows 15 places to intervene in a system this education and
outreach pillar is aimed at changing the goals and the paradigm of the system 16 meadows argues that the
goals and paradigm are the two most transformative leverage points in a system

many of the people who contributed to crafting this plan believe that building a strong community around
sustainability at usm will foster a paradigm shift in how the university and larger community think about
sustainability sustainability can remain a valueadded side project in higher education or it can become the
norm of how universities operate the goals and actions listed below are aimed at achieving the latter

implementation

the university of southern maine is a fertile place for sustainability the city of portland is one of the pioneer
cities to sign on to a 100 renewable energy goal 17 the university is situated in a state with a thriving local
sustainable food network which is now being aided by the universitys dining contractor sodexo through their
maine course program 18 maine also has a rich history of relying on natural resources such as lumber and
fisheries to power its economy finally the university is situated at a strategic location along the north atlantic
trade route and will become a key player in sustainability challenges arising from increased trade due to the
opening of the north west passage from climate change 19


17
   the goal was pledged by mayor strimling in his state of the city address in january of 2017
18
   maine course is a program designed to build the local sustainable food network while supporting maines economy

                                                                                                                    25




beyond the universitys unique location it is also comprised of a thriving group of students faculty and staff
who value sustainability and have been working in the field for years students in nursing tourism and
hospitality business administration engineering and other majors have taken on sustainability projects in
recent years alongside the usual suspects from environmental science and policy staff in grounds trades
custodial information technology the library and many other departments have participated in sustainability
projects ranging from green cleaning to composting to computer recycling even president cummings has
earned sustainability stripes by writing his phd dissertation on campus sustainability and by serving as the
chair of the us department of educations green initiative when he was deputy assistant secretary

usm is primed and ready to take big steps toward sustainability infrastructure and education on its three
campuses the office of sustainabilitys fulltime staff and student ecorep program has already begun
implementation of this strategic plan students staff and faculty from across the university from any major or
department are encouraged to get involved in any way that is suitable to their professional goals and
schedules interested people can reach out to the office of sustainability anytime to find out which project
might best suit their needs the primary office is located in the facilities management building at 25 bedford
street and is open most of the time between 8 am430 pm monday through friday a satellite office in
gorham at 19 college avenue the energy lab is staffed certain days a week on a rotating basis and
sustainability employees can travel to the lewistonauburn campus upon request the sustainability website 20
offers the most uptodate phone numbers and email addresses of office employees

if we work together we can make the university of southern maine a model campus for sustainability and
prepare our students to thrive in a changing world
