project team is established to help plan for the new youth centre employment and
training programs are in place as is ongoing liaison with potential employers

enacted
the wfn safe premises law spl was enacted july 26th 2010 and has become a
valuable tool in dealing with the health and safety risks associated with properties used
for illegal drug operations the spl makes it time consuming and very expensive for
an illegal drug operation to be resurrected after it has been shut down

    the residential premises department is responsible for administering the provisions of the wfn
    residential premises law which governs relationships between landlords and tenants on wfn
    lands
    in 20112012 the vast majority of landlord tenant disputes were resolved informally by the
    residential premises administrator who has focused her attention on using her dispute resolution
    abilities to resolve matters there were 10 arbitration hearings this ﬁscal year which is a
    reduction of 58 from the prior ﬁscal period and an overall reduction of 75 over 2 years this
    represents not only a cost savings to wfn but helps to reduce friction in the community while
    educating landlords and tenants about their rights and responsibilities under the law
    notice adjudication activity
    the dispute adjudication law was enacted in 2008 and was established to deal speciﬁcally with
    the process by which an individual could dispute a wfn ticket although most tickets are not

    prior to the end of the 20102011 ﬁscal year wfn implemented a process for tracking and
    collecting overdue tickets which is fully operational and working well spreadsheets have been
    created for tracking all details relating to the enforcement notices that have been issued to an
    oﬀender and those enforcement notices can be ﬁled at court with the same eﬀect as a judgment

     planning and development contd
     after 3½ years of work by wfn members staﬀ and council the wfn community plan was
     completed in september 2010 the plan is a foundational document that provides a way for
     memberships desires for their community to shape the development of wfn policy and planning
     over the last two years the community plan has been undergoing a process of implementation
     spearheaded by council and the wfn administration the provision of membership housing
     incorporating culture language and traditional governance principles building a youth center
     installing sidewalks and street lights within the community core and many other initiatives
     highlighted within the plan are in various stages of planning development and implementation
     while we have been successful in implementing the plan it is important that we continue to
     reﬁne and review it to ensure it remains relevant to the changing needs of members
     the wfn community plan law requires a review of the community plan within the ﬁrst two
     years of being adopted this review is currently underway and will include three community
     engagement meetings and a community survey which will take place between july 2012 and
     october 2012 the revision process will culminate with a community vote in november 2012
     where members will have the opportunity to adopt any revisions through a referendum

                                                                                                  11

wellness
over the past year a number of new initiatives have been realized within westbank first nation
community services through community conversations it was identiﬁed that a more
coordinated and structured system of administration and service delivery would better support
the work that we do how we do it and ultimately the community we took the time to pause
listen and develop internal structures that would see the realization of key departments within
community services
during this development phase community services developed a new organizational chart and
the new community wellness department under the direction of the community services
manager the community wellness supervisor provides leadership to staﬀ programs and
services that are under the wellness umbrella
family programs run out of the salmon room at the health and wellness
building as well as educational programming programs include
connecting fun for families 123 rhyme with me granny  grandpa
connection box play and teach parenting program family fitness
the community wellness department includes programs and
services related to social development child and family services
mental healthwellness counselling youth  recreation child 
youth services and addiction services although there have been a
number of changes within the structure of how community services
develops and supports the community the department remains
committed to providing meaningful eﬀective quality services to our
community members we continue to provide regular updates and
information about our exciting programs through regular submissions
in the monthly newsletter and on the wfn website if you have any
questions or require any information about the programs and services
oﬀered by community wellness please feel free to contact the team
