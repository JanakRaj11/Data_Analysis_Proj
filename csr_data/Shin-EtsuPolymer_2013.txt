development of ecoproducts
based on the basic environmental principles please refer to page 18 the shinetsu polymer group tackles product
development to reduce environmental burdens positions existing products as ecoproducts and started internal
certification




  concept of our ecoproducts
based on the corporate action policy we set up the concept of ecoproducts in our group


  concept
  ecoproducts in our group are new or existing products that solve customers challenges and upon confirmation
  that they are required by society and the environment social needs are evaluated and certified for seven items
  please refer to the top half of the following page




  position of ecopro promotion activities
these activities are part of green activities and are positioned as described below in these activities we also establish the
concept evaluation standards and evaluation methods of our exclusive ecoproducts and certification of products


  we position green activities as an effort to improve productivity from
  the viewpoint of the environment and ecopro promotion activities as
  an activity to promote the development of ecofriendly products demanded and
  expected by the market from the viewpoint of the environment



  concept of activities
we add the ideas of ecology to qcd and tackle the challenge of environmental burden reduction of products from raw
material procurement to manufacture use and disposal


   the concept is to convert conventional qcd to qcd  e environmental friendliness
   q stands for quality c for cost d for delivery and e for ecology reduction of environmental burden


                                                                 ❶resource saving          ❺environmental pollutants

                  by developing ecofriendly products we target becoming a company that
                   contributes to the realization of a recyclingoriented society and that is
                  appreciated in society where environmental management is emphasized

  evaluation standards of ecoproducts
shown below are the evaluation standards of ecoproducts
           category                                                           description

    challenge to improve transmittance
    from 70 to 80
with an expanding range of applications and other
competitors technological innovations we needed to
develop a product with even higher transmittance to
                                                                                               conventional product                improved product
maintain our superiority of course the development of
                                                                                             conventional product with 70 transmittance left and
such a product was also a customer requirement and
                                                                                             improved one with 80 transmittance
we thus faced the challenge of developing a touch switch
with 80 transmittance
    the first thing we set about was the improvement
                                                                                                section of the automotive
of the method to form the conductive coating instead
                                                                                                center console
of coating formation by conventional print technology
we took a method to paint conductive paint fully on the                                                                                           console
film and additionally process electrodes for detection in
a required form and arrangement patent no 4818216
by introducing this technology we could make the paint
film of conductive paint thinner one of the key points                                                                                           backlight
for success was in launching a new coating process
we worked together with the technology development
he adqua r te r s to improve the conductive paint a nd
successfully developed a conductive paint that shows                                                                                              touch switch
c ondu cti v it y e qui va l e nt to that of th e c o nve ntiona l
product even when it is made thinner
    in this way we were able to realize 80 transmittance                                   making the transmittance of the touch switch higher contributes to save
                                                                                             energy needed for backlighting
for our touch switch and make it possible to promote the
energy saving of backlighting better than before which is
also greatly advantageous for our customers

                          report now has a structure of information to communicate                     point out some challenges one of them is the increase
                          the reality of management of the shinetsu polymer group in                  of co2 emissions at overseas plants with the increase of
                          more diverse viewpoints and these are improvements i very                   production weight energy use at overseas plants has been
                          much appreciate                                                             increasing if this is a cause of the increase of co2 emissions
                          2 internal certification standards of ecoproducts                          it is a matter of great concern co2 emissions of production
                          one of the innovations in terms of initiatives was the                       weight in basic units have worsened by 25 points the
                          establishment of internal certification standards of eco                    deterioration was observed while consolidated sales and
                          products the concept of ecofriendly products that had                      operating income have shown a decreasing trend and an
                          not been established is now clearly defined and evaluation                  analytic explanation is required for its cause
                          standards are now set up for seven ecofriendly items                             with the improvement of the contents of efforts and
                          including energy saving resource saving and recycling                     information disclosure easiness to read the report is now
                          with this the development of products that can meet                         the next challenge as information has been expanded
                          market needs in a sustainable society will make progress                    qualitatively and quantitatively the reports usability has been
                          and the creation of value shared with society will be                        enhanced but visually it still has room for improvement
                          promoted more efficiently i expect that such greening of                    i hope that organization and integration of information is
                          business strategies will lead to the longterm growth of the                 promoted with contrivances to the total configuration and
