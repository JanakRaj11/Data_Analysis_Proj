challenges of foster to become a
centennial company
foster group will mark its 68th anniversary in july of this year we have responded to the expectations of our customers
all over the world enjoying sounds through the oem business specialized in acoustic products since our founding
those products have been born from the power of approximately 50 thousand employees who are working around the
world

looking forward we have started to become a corporation with a history of 100 years a centennial company the bridge
between the foster of the past and the future foster targeting its 100th year anniversary depends mostly on the power of
each employee

to achieve these goals and dreams approach the vision of making
contributions for future society through acoustics and to align the vectors
of all members foster employees played a central role in developing the
foster rhythm guidebook this socalled manual provides guidance
for our daily behavior currently employees around the world have the
principles  values card which has been translated into nine languages

together with the foster rhythm the skills that will lead us to the future
are nothing less than the acoustic technology that we have accumulated                           foster rhythm card
over more than 60 years we have especially focused on acoustic quality
to improve our technology

it is said that the most important part that determines the quality of a speakers sound is generally the one made of a
saucershaped thin material called the diaphragm this diaphragm is the part that converts the sound signals input via
various means such as a cd or a smartphone into vibrations and outputs them as audible sounds in other words for us
to hear any sounds from the speaker the diaphragm plays the role of an interface between acoustic signals and human
beings

the diaphragm that produces sounds is generally called cone paper relying on the fact that sounds differ depending
on the selection and manufacturing method for cone paper materials we test the possibilities of various materials at the
development division in akishima headquarters in tokyo and develop the materials that are the most suitable for these
respective sounds

                                                              it is said that the materials most suitable for the cone paper
                                                              should have the following three elements 1 lightness

                                                              addition to the conventional paper pulps we combine a wide
                                                              range of materials such as nonwood pulp kenaf natural
                                                              materials including mitsumata which is also used for bills and
                                                              ganpi which is also used for japan paper and highmodulus
                                                              fibers including aramid and carbon to explore the possibilities of a
                                                              limitless expanse of sounds

                                                              cellulose nanofiber is a material that our development engineers
                                                              have employed to actual cone paper in collaboration with
                                                              a material manufacturer there are various types of cellulose
                                                              nanofibers such as one made of wood and one produced

approximately 15000 to 110000 of human hair yet it is five times stronger than iron while maintaining that strength
the internal loss vibration energy dump performance of this fiber contributes to the production of quality sounds that are
obviously different from the other materials

as you see with the case of the cellulose nanofiber our development engineers who keep exploring suitable materials are
like cooks who create recipes of materials that will produce quality sounds from various materials using those recipes we
manufacture cone paper at our internal factories in china and myanmar this is because we deeply understand that different
recipes for cone paper create different sounds that are desired by customers which is to say those recipes are the source
of our value creation

speakers generally consist of a small number of parts with
such a limited number of components which create the different
sounds we closely examine materials with a strong persistence
for each of those parts to create the recipes of the materials
the recipe created by a cook development engineer is
then handed over to another cook design engineer who
combines such parts to produce the sounds that are desired
by our customers

our customers deliver the sounds we have produced through
various types of products including automobiles smartphones
and audio products to their endusers as toplevel companies in
each field they are located in not only japan but also in a wide         masahiro miwa diaphragm engineering section
range of regions such as asia america and europe therefore         speaker engineering department 3 sp business division

they have different cultural backgrounds and substantially
different target sounds to catch the subtleties of those desired sounds is very much a part of the technology we have
accumulated

environmental management structure
we have established an environment management system at headquarters and overseas manufacturing sites and
embody the foster groups environment philosophies and midterm environment policies
at headquarters we monitor the activities conducted at each site and check their results


activities to reduce the environmental burden headquarters building
headquarters moved to a new company building in november 2012 and was reborn as an ecofriendly office building
using multifarious technologies to reduce its environmental burden these technologies include lighting control using
daytime sunlight which effectively brings daytime sunlight into the office and removing the need for lighting the human
body sensor light control which turns lights on and off by sensing peoples movements air conditioning using outside
air which brings in natural air to optimize the efficiency of air conditioning an ice thermal storage air conditioning system
which enabled a peak cut in the daytime use of electricity and a doubleskin facade that maximizes heating efficiency
adopting all these technologies the efficiency of electricity use has been maximized in addition thorough temperature
control through the cool biz and warm biz campaigns further helped control of electricity use and contributed significantly
to reductions per unit of revenue
 a system to use the air conditioner during the daytime that cold air is made from the ice produced during the nighttime




                                        daytime sunlight brought from the top of the staircase
                                          ceiling at 4th floor of the headquarters building


management of chemical substances
the group has set forth its autonomous management standard in which applicable laws regulations and customers
requests are reflected for handling environmentally hazardous substances contained in its products to minimize their
impact on the environment we eliminate any controlled substances from our products via ecofriendly procurement and
management of necessary parts andor materials purchased
based on the aforementioned scheme we have established an optimum management system for the efficient search and
collection of information about chemical substances that are contained in parts and materials and precise communication
of information necessary in the supply chain we have taken all possible measures to ensure that we do not miss to cope
with annually added chemical substances that need to be monitored in accordance with the eus rohs20 directive and
the reach regulations implemented in 2013 in addition to ensure communications of related information we provide
our suppliers with briefing meetings every year primarily at our overseas sites in fiscal 2017 we monitor 41 substances
as controlled substances and banned heavy metals such as lead cadmium mercury and hexavalent chromium together
with other highly harmful substances from use so that our products are completely free of these substances
in compliance with the trend of legal regulations andor customers requests some of our products are manufactured
without some chemical substances such as certain phthalate esters which are used as plasticizing agents referred to as
certain phthalate esterfree manufacture




                                                                                                                               38

environmentally friendly products
the foster group designs and develops products by taking into account all aspects of product lifecycles from the
procurement of raw materials to the manufacturing use disposal and recycling of its products we strive to develop and
provide products with the least possible environmental burden such as through the manufacture of ecofriendly products
that minimize the use of harmful chemical substances and the creation of lightweight products engineered to reduce
co2 emissions

lightweight speaker for invehicle use ecofriendly speakers
 we developed a lightweight speaker optimum for nextgeneration ecofriendly vehicles such as electric vehicles evs
  we reduced the weight of the speaker significantly to 140 grams for a speaker with a diameter of 17 centimeters while
  minimizing the suppression of its sound pressure level a fundamental performance feature for speakers its advanced
  design has taken into account the need to reduce overall co2 emissions from vehicles
 frame is made of a specific polypropylene pp material and succeeded in reducing the frame weight while maintaining
  practical strength through profile optimization
 we have employed adhesives that do not contain harmful solvents and put them to practical use with the aim of
  reducing the volume of voc remaining inside the passenger cabin of vehicles we are taking steps to eliminate
  solvents in new models
 the diaphragms and the center caps made out of recyclable paper with the high waterproofing of speakers required
  for invehicle use
 as one aspect of our environmental activities we have developed and found practical application for speakers that
  reduce the use of solder we will disseminate this activity to all group companies and expand in mass production




                                              lightweight speaker for invehicle use


headphones and headsets
for headphones and headsets we have been active in incorporating environmental considerations in our product and
or process design for reducing the substances in our products that burdens the environment we address the most up
todate information regarding countryspecific legal requirements and the rohs2 to promote proposals to our customers
and dissemination to all the group companies we have reduced energy consumption in manufacturing and the volume
of raw materials that would be disposed as wastes we also have been keen on measures to minimize the volume of
waste materials reuse raw materials by introducing new equipment and developing products using natural materials
as well as addressing the manufacturing of more ecofriendly products with less use of adhesives and developing a
manufacturing method using less solder


                                                         measure for solderless production

                                                       by applying resistance welding for
                                                       headphone frame terminals we achieved

invehicle speakers that support reflow soldering sae20d30
these products not only achieve reductions in the mounting time required on the customer side when fitting the speakers
by automatic mounting machine they also enable reductions in the amounts of solder used and waste flux produced
through the use of paste solder during mounting
moreover connections inside the product are achieved without the use of solder using heat and pressure joining
techniques
in addition acousticstructure design is no longer required because a three dimensional sound emitting hole duct is
added on the back of the speakers to separate the sounds from the front and back of the speakers patent pending
despite their high acoustic pressure of 800 hz approximately 91 db10 cm the speakers are lightweight at 3 g also
contributing to weight reduction in our customers products
it employs 100 snplated phosphor bronze composed of copper tin and phosphorus in their solderattachment
