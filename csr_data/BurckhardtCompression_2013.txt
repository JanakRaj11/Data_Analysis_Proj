breakthrough in maritime dual fuel engine systems we scored a major success in dual fuel
technology with the receipt of an order for a labygi fuel gas compressor system for two lng
carriers this order marks a major milestone in our efforts to position our compressors as a via
ble solution for an energyefficient and environmentally friendly ship propulsion system with gas
driven diesel engines this order can be viewed as a breakthrough in a market where significant
investments will be made in order to comply with more stringent environmental standards

positive outlook for the fiscal year 2013 the global debt crisis  in our view  has not yet been
overcome especially in europe and the associated turmoil particularly in foreign exchange mar
kets will also have an impact on our business nevertheless we look to the current fiscal year
with confidence most of the markets continue to grow especially the petrochemicals and gas
transport and storage markets shale gas activities will be expanded in the usa and in other
countries creating new opportunities for burckhardt compression in the application areas of gas
transport and storage petrochemicals and in the new application area of upstream oil  gas
from todays standpoint we expect an increase in order intake for both the compressor systems         valentin vogt
and the components services  support business area we assume that sales will be substan
tially higher in fiscal year 2013 than in the year under review the operating profit margin is
expected to be near the middle of the longterm target range of 15 to 20

further increase in the dividend the board of directors will propose a dividend of chf 900
previous year chf 700 per share at the upcoming annual general meeting which corresponds
to a payout ratio of 54 previous year 46 of net income per share in view of the companys
sound finances and ample cash holdings the board of directors has increased the targeted pay
out range from 4060 to 5070

a word of thanks we thank our shareholders for their trust it strengthens our resolve to stead
fastly pursue our longterm strategy we are also very grateful to the more than 1000 burckhardt
compression employees worldwide who once again showed unfaltering dedication and drive
throughout the fiscal year last but not least we thank our customers and suppliers for the long
standing partnerships we have built on the basis of mutual trust

yours sincerely

quality assurance

modern 3dcnc measuring machines are used at the production sites in winterthur switzerland and pune india for quality
assurance these machines excel in terms of measurement speed and accuracy work pieces are measured with utmost
precision quickly and efficiently


responsibility
transport of a hyper compressor

a team of professionals handles the delivery of hyper compressors with a transport weight of more than 200 metric tons and
a shipping destination on the other side of the world challenging demands are placed on heavyload specialists exact planning
and reliable logistics partners guarantee that the compressors are always delivered safely and on time


safety
laby compressors installed in a lng terminal china

labyrinth piston compressors are used in a variety of applications for example to compress lng boiloff gas at lng terminals
suction temperatures of as low as 170 c 250 f represent the greatest challenge here thanks to its unique technology the
laby compressor performs its mission to the highest degree of safety and availability

value with no growth at all management estimated the planned
gross profit margin based on past developments and the expec
tations regarding future market developments historical data
