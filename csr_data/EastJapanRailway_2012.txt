thriving with communities
growing globally

the great east japan earthquake on march 11 2011 caused devastating damage in the jr east group             s service area
and to its railway facilities owing to our comprehensive safety measures there were no injuries to the passengers
on board our trains however in some cases this was also due to good fortune which helped us to appreciate that
there is more to be done to be better prepared against future disasters following the earthquake together with the
great support of related parties and the ceaseless efforts of each and every jr east group employee jr east was
able to overcome the many challenges and restore its railway facilities each time we reopened a section of railway
we were able to see the joy and appreciation on the faces of the people in particular when the tohoku shinkansen
resumed full operation on the 50th day following the disaster a great many people lined the tracks waving and
cheering the return of the train i am sure that i will never forget that scene for the rest of my life
through the disaster each one of our employees was able to recognize anew their bonds with local communities
and the great expectations that society holds for our railway company as a company responsible for railways as
social infrastructure we have once again realized the importance of fulfilling our missions as a railway company and
                                                        in responding to the expectations of society
                                                        still due to the great east japan earthquake our business
                                                        environment has changed drastically and there is still much to be
                                                        done in order to fully recover from the earthquake in addition
                                                        to nationwide shortages in electricity and the uncertain future

                                                        financial crisis and the prolonged appreciation of the yen against
                                                        the dollar have further obscured the future path of the japanese
                                                        economy and society prior to the earthquake japan was
                                                        already facing several difficult challenges including a declining
                                                        birthrate an aging population and a hollowingout of domestic
                                                        industry following the disaster the direction of these challenges
                                                        became more severe than ever before and it continues to
                                                        become clearer as the momentum of change increases
                                                        in such a time of rapid reform jr east needs to remain
                                                        constantly moving forward into the future in order to continue to
                                                        respond to the great expectations of society with this at heart

                                                        now necessary that we once again ask ourselves what the roles

in order to achieve sustainable growth in this time of drastic change following the disaster we need to avoid
complacency and to continue to challenge ourselves with new goals for this reason jr east remains determined to
challenge new fields in order to tap the unlimited potential of the jr east group and each one of its employees jr
east aims to actively pursue new business fields through the promotion of strategies for energy and the environment
the utilization of information and communication technology ict increases in the speed of its shinkansen
technological innovations for the evolution of railways participation in overseas railway projects and the expansion
of its railcar manufacturing operations in support of these measures jr east seeks to create numerous opportunities
for its motivated employees to assume active roles and create their own challenges to establish corporate cultures
open to those outside of the group and to foster globallyminded individuals


toward the realization of a sustainable society  our ceaseless efforts to address
global environmental issues
the jr east group considers global environmental issues to be one of its most important management concerns
through various environmental conservation measures to date including the introduction of energysaving railcars
and a shift to led lighting jr east has been able to achieve steady reductions in its total co2 emissions and in the
environmental burden of its railway operations however owing to the 2011 disaster we are currently facing a new
business challenge an electricity shortage which is forecast to continue into the foreseeable future additionally
though in the past railways have been viewed as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation and have been
evaluated highly for their environmental superiority with recent significant advancements in the environmental
technologies of other fields such as the automobile industry we have a strong sense that in the near future there
might come a time when railways may not be seen as such
in order to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society and to maintain the environmental superiority of
railways advancements in the field of environmental technology are inevitable jr east must both strengthen its
environmental measures and remain steadfast in its commitment to lead in the advancement of environmental
technologies in japan

                  infrastructures in the eastern
                  japan area
a year and a half of restoration and reconstruction following the great east japan earthquake

our future measures against earthquakes
learning from the experiences of the great hanshinawaji earthquake of january 1995 the sanriku
minami earthquake of may 2003 and the mid niigata prefecture earthquake of october 2004 jr east
has introduced seismic reinforcement measures to its elevated bridge columns bridge piers tunnels and
station buildings taken preventive measures against derailments and increased the number of locations
where seismometers are installed
owing to these measures at the time of the great east japan earthquake on march 11 2011 no
customers on board our trains were killed or injured
since fy2010 jr east has expanded its countermeasures and initiated the 2nd phase of its seismic
reinforcement measures including further seismic reinforcement of its elevated bridge columns in
addition jr east plans to introduce the following as further measures against earthquakes


       ① seismic reinforcement measures for embankments earth cuttings arched elevated brick bridges
          and power poles and measures to prevent the collapse of station platform ceilings and walls in the
          event that an earthquake directly strikes the tokyo metropolitan area jr east will also accelerate
          the implementation of its plans for the ongoing seismic reinforcement of its elevated bridge piers
       ② seismic reinforcement measures for station buildings where the number of boarding and alighting
          passengers exceeds 3000 persons per day and for shinkansen power poles many of which were
          damaged by the great east japan earthquake
       ③ strengthened antidisaster telecommunication functions including an increase in the transmission
          speed of seismometer measurement data and the reinforcement of its emergency power sources
          for its communication network



jr east is committed to the promotion of these seismic reinforcement measures for at least the next
five years and to continuation of its efforts to bring further improvements to the disaster resilience of its
railways

measures for tsunami evacuation
prior to the occurrence of the great east japan earthquake jr east had designated tsunami hazard areas
and set rules for operational restrictions for each of its service areas formulating manuals and conducting
drills to guide the escape of passengers from trains after the great east japan earthquake jr east
reviewed all of its rules manuals and drill in consideration of our findings jr east decided upon the
following measures


  ① a reexamination of our tsunami warning zones based on hazard maps of municipalities and tsunami
     flooded areas resulting from the great east japan earthquake
  ② a reexamination of our rules for operational restrictions in the case of a tsunami warning
  ③ the formulation of a set of guidelines as a fundamental method for guiding passengers in tsunami
     evacuation
  ④ a plan to increase the number of locations of evacuation route maps and signage at and between
     stations
  ⑤ a joint project with local municipalities to install emergency stairs to evacuation shelters and
     signage to indicate escape routes
  ⑥ a review and revision of tsunami handling manuals for locations at risk
  ⑦ a plan to conduct annual regular training and drills around the anniversary date of march 11

restoration measures for disasteraffected areas
currently we are coordinating our efforts to restore conventional lines along the northeastern pacific coast
that were severely damaged by the tsunami with additional plans to rebuild the area as a whole and
develop towns and have been engaged in discussions with the relevant national and local government
authorities regarding these initiatives to date service has resumed along the entire hachinohe line and
in sections of the joban line senseki line and other lines and we plan to replace the tsunamidestroyed
track on the senseki line between takagimachi and rikuzenono the joban line between soma and
watari and the ishinomaki line between watanoha and urashuku as an interim method of restoring
safe transportation services on august 20 2012 we established brt bus rapid transit service along the
kesennuma line and are considering brt and various other proposals for the yamada line and ofunato
line meanwhile we are serving local customers by operating bus routes to temporarily replace the lines
that remain out of service
as part of our work for restoration of the tsunamidamaged railway lines jr east has been coordinating
efforts between local municipalities and the related departments of its head office and branch offices
having reviewed our support structure for a year we established the reconstruction planning department
at corporate planning headquarters on may 1 2012 in order to further strengthen and promote more
comprehensive measures for restoration
currently the reconstruction planning department is working in coalition with related organizations and
local municipalities to restore the damaged coastal railway lines

2 research and development related to safety
1measures against earthquakes

as countermeasures against earthquakes jr east has pursued measures to heighten the quakeresistance
of its structures to stop trains as quickly as possible when an earthquake strikes and to greatly reduce
the amount of damage resulting from an earthquake
in particular jr east has developed and introduced a seismic reinforcement measures to help counter
earthquakes through the introduction of reinforced concrete components to the side surfaces of bridge
columns lshaped car guides to prevent shinkansen trains from going to the side if they derail at the time
of an earthquake and countermeasures to prevent rails from overturning

3operational restriction methods

for operational restrictions during heavy rainfall jr east has traditionally utilized a calculation that
combines the rainfall for the preceding hour and the total continuous rainfall since the start of the rain
however to more effectively identify danger levels associated with disasters resulting from rainfall jr east
analyzed effective rainfall through changes in water levels utilizing a tank which modeled how rainwater
penetrated into the ground and rainwater outflow through the statistical analysis of past rainfall and
disaster data and by utilizing 3 kinds of effective rainfall with halflife periods of 15 hours 6 hours and
24 hours as indices it became possible to evaluate the potential danger for various rainfall disasters and
since june 2008 this system has been introduced to all conventional lines as part of their operational
restriction procedures

3 research and development for improvements in customer service
in an effort to provide easytounderstand operationsrelated information for customers in the event of
transport disturbances between 2002 and 2006 jr east developed passenger guidance emergency
information displays for the visual display of route maps the displays indicate routes with delayed train
operations in orange and those with suspended train operations in red in this way passengers can
immediately and visually comprehend the status of train operations in the event of a disruption following
field tests at ueno station and tokyo station the system was installed at akihabara station in february of
2007 and is currently being introduced to other stations as well mainly in the tokyo metropolitan area
in addition jr east is currently developing an onboard personalized information provision system to
provide customers realtime information of their actual location through smartphones with this system
customers can obtain a variety of detailed information according to their needs and at the same time
their activities after alighting can also be supported in 2011 jr east field tested a commercial trainset on
the yamanote line and aims to commercialize the system after conducting user questionnaires to assess
and to verify the services to be provided

new environmental targets
at jr east as part of steadily carrying out our environmental activities we set not only medium and long
term targets but also numerical targets for each category of environmental preservation effort with the
completion of the last target period we have now established new targets and will strive continuously to
meet them

concepts in setting new targets
 targets to be met by fy2021 8 reduction in energy consumption from railway business activities
   mj  relative to the fy2011 level
jr east has striven to improve efficiency in energy use with energyefficient railcars etc targets for total
co2 emissions however have been affected by fluctuations in the coefficients of co2 emissions of the
electric power companies from which jr east purchased electricity and it had been difficult to measure
the results of our own efforts jr east then set targets whereby its efforts to reduce energy consumption
could be reflected better and be less affected by changing external environments

 targets to be met by fy2021 30 improvement in co2 emissions per unit of electricity generated at
   jr east  s own power plants kgco2kwh  relative to fy1991 level
at jr east   s thermal power plants efforts have been made to reduce co 2 emissions by transforming

up such efforts with this new target
 the two targets above replace the existing target for fy2018 target for fy2031 will be addressed while ascertaining the direction of
   japans energy policy and others


 target for fy2014 68 reduction in electricity used for railway operations per unit of transport
   volume kwhcarkm  relative to fy2007 level
jr east used to set targets forenergyefficient railcar utilization ratesandelectricity used for train
operationsin addition toelectricity used for railway operations per unit of transport volumeas a result
of increased use of energyefficient railcars total power consumption is being decreased and accordingly
so is energy consumption per carkm these two targets have now been integrated intoelectricity used
for railway operations per unit of transport volume

 target for fy2014 3 reduction in energy consumption per unit of floor area at branch offices etc
   klcrude oil equivalentm2  relative to fy2011 level
the target ofenergy saving at stations and officeswas set to understand and reduce total energy used
at stations branch office buildings etc the target set this time is for energy consumption atfactories
etcas used in the law on rational use of energy the energy saving law and jr east will promote
reduction of energy consumed at its head office and branch offices accordingly

 target for fy2014 recycling rates for various kinds of waste
for recycling of waste although a rate of over 90 has already been achieved jr east will promote the
3rs  reduce reuse and recycle  toward realization of a recyclingoriented society without lowering
numerical targets

 target for fy2014 100 green procurement group target
in the past numerical targets for goods etc were limited to office paper and thus therecycled office
paper utilization ratewas established in 1996 currently howevergreen procurementis the favored
approach within society the jr east group thus sets this green procurement target for environmentally
friendly goods and materials used within the group specifically whether or not group companies
purchased goods materials or services according to the basic policy provided in article 6 of thelaw
on promotion of procurement of ecofriendly goods and services by the state and other entities green
purchasing law  is used as an indicator in parallel with this each group company establishes guidelines
for goods materials and services how to deal with them etc

  target for fiscal 2016 noise measures targeting 75 db or less along the tohoku and joetsu
   shinkansen lines for areas subject to noise measures
as for noise measures along shinkansen lines measures to reduce noise to 75 db or less have been
completed in the designated areas in accordance with government guidance currently improvement
work is being implemented step by step in other areas to be completed by the end of march 2016

 implementation of specific environmental protection activities every year group target
targets have not been set for fy2014 this is because individual companies in the jr east group are
regularly involved in various environmental protection activities in response to society   s increasing
awareness of global environmental issues

measures to prevent global warming
 trends in co2 emissions
 our co2 emissions in the fiscal year ending march 2012 totaled 188 million tons a decrease of 027
 million tons over the previous fiscal year this was due to the restart of our own hydroelectric power
 plant which resulted in the reduction of the operating rate of our own thermal power plant and eventually
 in the reduction of co2 emissions from it it was also attributable to energysaving efforts throughout the
 company

energy conservation and co2 reduction
the electricity consumed by jr east for train operations as well as for lighting and air conditioning at
stations and in offices is supplied by jr east    s own power plants and by electric power companies
besides electricity we also use diesel fuel and kerosene for diesel train operation and for air conditioning
at stations and in offices we will strive to save energy for train operation which accounts for about 70
of our total energy consumption and reduce co2 emissions in various ways

saving energy in office buildings
in response to revisions to laws and regulations saving energy in office buildings has become increasingly
important we work hard on reducing energy consumption through physical measures including the
introduction of highly efficient equipment and facilities and operational measures including temperature
management of air conditioning and diligently turning off lights
in addition given the concerns about energy supply and demand since the great east japan earthquake
we have been actively introducing led lighting apparatus which is particularly effective as a physical
measure

saving energy used by information systems
as part of our effort to save energy in office buildings since fy2010 we have been turning off power for
certain information systems equipment during nonuse hours the resulting savings were about 140000
kwh of power in fy2012 which is especially important with the tight energy supplyanddemand situation
since the earthquake in 2011 we also reduced the number of servers by combining equipment worked
to introduce energysaving products and set our businessuse pc terminals to power saving mode we
will continue our efforts to reduce energy consumption further

measures to create a sound material cycle
waste reduction and recycling
jr east generates many kinds of waste through its railway operations including daily trash removed from
trains and stations and industrial waste from our general rolling stock centers in addition restaurants
and retail stores in our lifestyle businesses produce garbage and general waste in order to reduce all
these various forms of waste jr east actively supports the approach known asreduce reuse recycle
for recycling in particular goals are set for each type of waste


recycling waste collected from stations and trains
in the fiscal year ending march 2012 the ratio of trash from stations and trains that were recycled was
93 beginning in the fiscal year ending march 2008 thermal recycling was considered also definitions
were partly changed in the fiscal year ending march 2010 since trash from stations and trains contains
recyclable materials we first placed separation bins in stations we then established recycling centers in
ueno omiya and shinkiba for more rigorous separation in october 2010 to further improve recycling
rates we consolidated the recycling centers in ueno and shinkiba and built the jr east tokyo materials
recycling center operated by east japan eco access co ltd

biodiversity
hometown forestation program
in 2004 in order to protect biodiversity and contribute to a sustainable society while cherishing our
sense of gratitude to nature we began the hometown forestation programs to plant trees native to each
region and revitalize the forests
we undertook these programs with the cooperation of fukushima prefecture from 2004 to 2009 and
with the cooperation of niigata prefecture and the town of tsunanmachi in 2010 in addition in other
areas served by jr east we are planting trees that are native to the areas and we shall continue to do the
same in the future

forest development along railway lines
beginning in 1992 we have been engaged in tree planting activities along the jr east wayside by fiscal
2012 a total of 44 thousand people participated in planting about 310 thousand trees today we have
gone beyond the wayside and do tree planting in cooperation with the communities


development of railway trees
along some jr east railway lines we have railway trees planted to shield the tracks from blowing snow
and wind the first railway forest was created in 1893 for disaster prevention as living disaster prevention
facilities railway forests are playing their roles
jr east now owns approximately 58 million railway trees on a total of about 4000 hectares along our
lines at approximately 1200 locations the trees absorb 16 thousand tons of co2 equivalent to 06 of
the co2 that jr east emits in this way they also contribute to preserving the environment
in 2008 after fundamentally reviewing the role of railway trees from the viewpoints both of disaster
prevention and environmental preservation we launched a new project to plant trees to replace those
that will require replacement over the coming 20 years

railway treesfrom single to multivariety trees
traditionally railway trees were of a single variety primarily cedar trees because another function in
addition to protecting against natural disasters was to generate profits through the production of timber
this has recently been less successful however in the face of declining demand for domestic timber in
future tree replacement we will plant several varieties suitable for the local climate and develop them to
be more sustainable and ecologically resilient

planting new railway trees
ceremonies for the planting of new railway trees were held in the kakizaki no 1 railway forest between
kakizaki and yoneyama on the shinetsu main line on september 27 2008 in the oitama no 2 forest
on the ou main line between oitama and takahata on july 26 2009 and in the jinguji no 2 railway
forest on the ou main line between jinguji and kariwano on may 22nd 2010 with kind advice and
guidance from ecologist and professor emeritus akira miyawaki of yokohama national university several
varieties of native trees potential natural vegetation were selected and planted many local residents
and participants from organized tours participated in the ceremonies and discovered how the trees they
planted would grow to become useful as living railway disaster prevention facilities

basic thoughts on noise reduction
improvement of the environment along railways basic thoughts on noise reduction
in the operation of trains noise is created by the train cars moving through the air by the wheels
travelling on the rails by the motors and by other sources in order to reduce noise we are working in
various ways to improve both the trains and our ground equipment
jr east also endeavors to reduce noise during maintenance work on track and structures to further
improve the environment along the lines


measures for the shinkansen
in accordance with the japanese government         s environmental quality standards for shinkansen
superexpress railway noise jr east has taken many steps to reduce this noise such as the installation
of soundproof walls and soundabsorbent materials rail grinding1 and the modification of our railcars to
operate more quietly we have already completed the implementation of measures to reduce noise levels
to 75 db or lower in densely populated residential areas along our railway lines and we plan to take
further steps by expanding the scope of areas where noise levels need to be reduced to 75 db or lower
also with the introduction of e5 series railcars which were developed based on the results of running
tests using the shinkansenfastechtest train jr east is working to improve the environment even as
we increase train speed including further reduction of noise and micropressure waves in tunnels2
    ail grinding a measure to smooth out uneven places in rails caused by wheels traveling over them this reduces noise by controlling car
1 r
   vibration
2 micropressure waves in tunnels an explosive sound caused by compressed air being forced




                                         the e5 series employs lownoise pantographs



measures for conventional lines
we have implemented voluntary measures for conventional lines to minimize noise installing long rails1
and performing railgrinding and wheeltruing2 we also comply with the japanese government  s policy
on noise measures for construction of new conventional railways or largescale remodeling when we
engage in this kind of construction or modification of our conventional lines
1 installing long rails rail joints are welded such that the length of a single rail becomes more than 200 meters with fewer rail joints these
    rails reduce noise produced at joints when trains pass
2 w heel truing a measure to grind the unevenness of wheels caused by wear to restore their circular shape



measures for maintenance work
as the maintenance work is usually done during night we give advance notice about the schedule and
details of the work to residents in surrounding areas we also make utmost efforts to minimize noise by
using modified equipment that produces lower noise furthermore by using track that is designed to
resist deformation jr east is reducing the volume of required maintenance work




                                                                        33

improvement of the environment along railway lines
restricting use of herbicides
safe train operations require regular removal of weeds along railway lines while we generally remove
them manually we also use a certain amount of herbicide we keep the usage of herbicides to a
minimum in both volume and range of use when selecting herbicides for use we select those from the
safest of the three levels of toxicity to humans and animals and from category a the safest of the five
levels of toxicity to fish
we continue to observe the rules in place in order to keep our impact on the surrounding environment
to a minimum as with our initiative to postpone the spraying of herbicides when conditions on the
scheduled day are not satisfactory for spraying in fy 2012 203 tons of herbicides were used


harmony with the landscape
given that construction of a largescale railway facility or its remodeling greatly affects the local area
and surrounding environment jr east endeavors to harmonize its completed facilities with surrounding
landscapes and natural environments in the fiscal year ended in march 2012 the agatsumagawa bridge
no 3 received the tanaka award for excellent bridge work or bridge engineering from the japan
society of civil engineers in recognition of a landscape in harmony with the surrounding environment and
the national road parallel to the bridge our efforts are indeed well recognized outside of the company

chemical substance management
compliance with laws and setting goals for reduction of chemical substances
when using chemical substances the effects on human health and ecological systems must be fully
considered the jr east group not only rigidly adheres to established standard values but sets its
own ambitious targets as well as much as possible we restrict the use of such substances and adopt
substitutes that have less impact on the environment


reducing and replacing ozone depleting substances
we endeavor to reduce the use of substances specified as controlled substances under the ozone layer
protection law and adopt substitutes that have less impact on the environment
 l arge heat exchangers large cooling unitshaving steadily replaced air conditioning units using
   specified chlorofluorocarbons cfcs with systems that do not use them we completed the removal of
   such units from buildings by the end of march 2008
 rolling stockexcept for some diesel railcars all of our cars use cfc substitutes as of march 2012
   we were using 05 tons of cfcs and 86 tons of cfc substitutes we routinely check for gas leaks
   and collect the refrigerants when scrapping retired railcars in accordance with applicable laws and
   regulations
 fireextinguishing agentalthough 74 tons of halon gas was still in use as a fireextinguishing agent as
   of march 2012 we have it under proper control and are replacing it with nonhalon agents such as
   powder agents and co2 when building new facilities or renovating existing ones


chemical substance management
as jr east uses chemical substances primarily for painting and repairing our railcars we take rigorous
steps for their use and management in order to prevent spills we are a company that handles a certain
amount of specified chemical substances and 13 jr east facilities submitted the data regarding the
release and transfer of these substances to relevant authorities in the fiscal year ended march 2012
pursuant to the prtr system
we have also been introducing stainless steel railcars that do not require painting at the end of march
2012 as many as 83 of the 10754 cars operated on our conventional lines were stainless steel railcars
beside their use for railcars we used 448 tons of organic solvents for painting railway facilities and
stabilizing track beds in the fiscal year ended march 2012
 prtr system a system where companies notify their releases and transfers of chemical substances as required by the prtr law it
   encourages the monitoring and control of toxic chemical substances emitted into the environment and measures to prevent negative
   impact on the environment

environmental communication
development of environmental education by delivering lectures on request
in the fiscal year ending march 2010 to contribute to the development of a sustainable society jr east
initiated environmental education programs for children they will lead the next generation and they
need to understand environmental issues and their relationships with the society
the program aims to help children understand the environment and life through materials related to
railways in fiscal year 2012 the program was implemented at seven schools primarily elementary
schools in tokyo and saitama prefecture we will continue it

we staged the secondseminar on environmentally friendly railwaysfor elementary school children at
the railway museum together with learning about global environmental problems they were shown the
importance of recycling by separating trash at a station and on the train

environmental events in cooperation with other companies
to explain jr easts environmental preservation activities and directly communicate with customers we
joined tokyo gas co ltd in stagingthe ninth gas and railway environmental activities exhibition for
parents and childrenat the gas science center in addition to introducing environmental aspects of gas
and railways and our energysaving activities the event featured handson opportunities to learn and have
fun at the same time

     voice



         collaborating on environmental education with jr east employees
         i call the joint effort with jr east employees teaching collaboration rather than lecturing on
         request lecturing by companies usually means the content is determined in advance by them
         and employees visit schools to give lectures in their technical areas as oneday teachers often
         moreover they spend an hour or so on something that might deserve six hours including oppor
         tunities for the students to see and try things for themselves
          teaching collaboration with jr east employees is different in that class teachers in elementary
         schools and jr employees work together in the teaching program all fifth graders participate for
         a total of three hours the employee remains at the school for almost a week  very unlike being
         a guest lecturer the person is with the class as long as possible including eating lunch with
         students in his uniform which serves well to stimulate their interest


                                                    there were two basic themes the railway information
                                                    network and mechanisms of conveyance of information
                                                    in emergencies such as the great east japan earth
                                                    quake and the benefit to the global environment of

                                                    card

                                                    having been part of the program twice since 2010 i
                                                    found one problem to be that the company is apt to
                                                    focus on efficiency  how can we convey more within
                                                    the allotted period  while the school is less
                                                    concerned with how much is taught than with the
                                                    children having enough time to think absorb and be
                                                    stimulated generally speaking proposals by compa
                                                    nies tend to be overloaded with content


                                                 with jr east however this is no longer the case
                                                 adjustments have been made one by one on both
         sides the reason we chose jr east as our partner was its attitude and desire to work together
         for something better the program provided students with a valuable learning opportunity and i
         am sure they had a good time at the same time jr east was able to make use at other schools
         of the knowhow on teaching collaboration it acquired with us making the program beneficial
         to them as well

         the effort has also been valuable for teachers not
         least as an impetus to look again at the nature of
         teaching itself ideally children become familiar with
         subjects interested in them and solve problems on
         their own only in this way do they truly learn thus
         we mostly endeavored to find handson subjects
         that the children could experience directly i am
         confident that we were successful  that teaching
         collaboration produced the desired result

public relations on environmental and societal activities
to present jr easts activities for the environment and society in an accurate easytounderstand manner
we began publishing annual environmental reports in 1996 and have titled them sustainability reports
since 2002
we also communicate about our environmental activities through magazines tv commercials and other
media as well as jr easts websites posters and pamphlets

ecotourism
ecotourism develops deeper understanding and affection for japan      s natural environment and culture
this year to convey the appeal of the shirakami mountain area a world heritage site we held a lecture
in the tokyo metropolitan area which attracted more than 500 people at our lecture in shirakami 40
people joined the program we continue to promote hiking from stations in each region and in the year
ending march 2012 we held 626 hiking trips from stations with approximately 200000 people in total
participating in the events among these trips we organized ecohiking courses which included visits to
facilities where energy resources were efficiently utilized and to seashores to pick up trash there a total
of about 250 people participated

environmental accounting and management indicators
using environmental management indicators in business activities
in the year ended march 2012 our environmental conservation costs amounted to approximately
577 billion yen in investments and 224 billion yen in expenses of these investments costs for global
environmental conservation which accounted for a large portion were at the same level as the previous
year because we continued acquiring new railcars
by introducing these new cars we estimate we will reduce co2 emissions by 235 thousand tons during
their service lives
jr east has its own environmental management indicator to assess the relation between our business
activities and environmental impacts these are calculated by dividing co2 emissions which are a major
factor in our environmental impacts by operating profits which represent our economic value added
a smaller value of the indicator means that we are making a smaller impact on the environment to create
the same economic value added for the year ended march 2012 the value of the indicator was 642
tco2billion yen compared with 945 tco2billion yen for the year ending march 1991

         yotsuya station transformed to an                         ecoste   is a facility where you can learn
         about ecology
         the jr yotsuya station on the chuo line in tokyo has
         been reborn as an ecoste embracing the four
         concepts of energy conservation energy generation
         feeling the ecology and environmental harmonization
         working at yotsuya station where we have
         introduced 17 ecomenus including solar panels
         greenery and led lighting we can feel and enjoy the
         natural breezes and light this is largely attributable to
         two specific ecomenus  skylights and natural
         ventilation systems blessed with greenery in an area
         near an ancient outer moat of edo castle yotsuya
         station has become even more pleasant comfortable             rooftop garden symbol of ecoste
         and bright filled with natural light and fresh air it is
         especially satisfying to hear so many customers say so with led lighting energy consumption is
         reduced and platforms are as bright at night as they are in the daytime train crews too often
         comment on this train drivers in particular say they can see customers on the platform better
         every jr station s top priority is of course customer safety being bright and easy to see is about
         more than being ecological
         since becoming an ecoste we have had more visitors  educational visits and school trips by
         elementary and juniorhigh school students  and we are working on ideas that will allow more
         students in the community to make ecoste yotsuya station a practical resource in their
         environmental education currently we plan to create guidebooks for our 17 ecomenus
         primarily by our ecopromotion members
         it will be a unique accomplishment of the station if people in
         yotsuya consider yotsuya stadion to be a symbol of environmental
         education ekinaka instation business is becoming increasingly
         popular and the utility value of stations has grown as shopping and
         entertainment spaces yotsuya station is opening up the new
         possibility of transformation into a educational facility where you
         can learn about ecology
         with ecoste projects to be carried out in various locations and as
         the stationmaster of the first i hope those involved will look at us
         gather information and apply it usefully elsewhere of course the
         picture of a successful ecoste will be very different depending on
         local needs and characteristics                                               hiroko shirayama

creation of a culture of safety
our 5 cultures of safety
to heighten levels of railway safety it is necessary to establish and support unwavering cultures of safety
the cultures of safety we seek are based upon accident information from the past and we learn and act
upon it in mutual trust


  ① a culture of proper reporting
    preventing the occurrence and recurrence of accidents through prompt and proper reporting of all
    accidents and incidents
  ② a culture of noticing
    the prevention of accidents through an awareness of the causes of accidents and the sharing of
    information that would prevent these causes from leading to actual accidents
  ③ a culture of direct meeting and discussion
    allowing for the open and honest exchange of opinions and discussions enables us to identify the
    causes of accidents and to take appropriate countermeasures against recurrence
  ④ a culture of learning
    continuously learning about accidents and learning from accidents and incidents which occur in all
                                   s own workplace
    places of work not just in one
  ⑤ a culture of action
    safety can be ensured only by taking safe actions think and act by yourself this is at the core of
    our safety



sangen principle three actualities principleas a standard for action
accidents and incidents always occur at the genba this means that the sources of accident prevention
can also be found at the genba in order to suitably understand and rectify each accident or incident
jr east approaches safety issues with thethree actualities principleas its standard for action actual
locations actual objects and actual people
 genbagenbameans a field or workplace where employees actually do their physical work in construction production maintenance
  operation etc as distinguished from management or office work in industrial sectors such as construction and manufacturing



changes with safety mission statements
jr east provides safety mission statements for the code of conduct for its safetyrelated employees in
learning from past disasters including the great east japan earthquake jr east has added a 5th safety
mission statement based on its basic safety promotion conceptsthink and act by ourselvesandremain
calmjr east added the wordingthink by ourselvesfor the prevention of human error in the event of
an emergency and to encourage employees to take a deep breath before taking action


general principles of safety

  ① safety is the most important mission in transportation
  ② ensuring safety is based on exact observance of rules and procedures and is achieved through
     constant practice
  ③ enforcement of confirmation and complete contact is most important for ensuring safety

  ④ for ensuring safety we should cooperate together and go beyond our official responsibility
  ⑤ when we have questions or must choose among several options we should remain calm think by
     ourselves and take the safest course after thorough consideration




                                                                 48

developing safetyrelated human resources
in the rapid transition as one generation retires and the next generation takes over it is necessary for
jr east to steadily pass down its safety knowledge to subsequent generations to this end since it is
vital to develop employees as the core of our safety jr east has assigned key safety leaders for its field
organizations and safety professionals for its branch offices to heighten levels of safety

key safety leaders are mainly concerned with the following three areas

  ①full knowledge a comprehensive understanding of weak points safety rules facilities work
     content and accident information accident case examples
  ②teaching regular training for employees on information they should know and weakness to be
     conquered
  ③foster successors development of successors to maturity


safety professionals are mainly concerned with the following three areas

  ①a  n understanding of safety rules mechanisms of safety protection past accident history and the
    comprehensive utilization of this knowledge in instruction
  ② l eadership and guidance in the formulation of safety measures and accident countermeasures
    advice for emergency situations and the challenge safety campaign
     
  ③ safetyrelated knowledge technology and sensitivity

take on the challenge of further improving safety levels rather than just passively maintaining safety the
challenge safety campaign aims to increase our employee awareness and sense of safety we intend to
guide all employees to more safetyoriented behavior by having them think about and discuss safety act
upon it and feel a sense of achievement through doing so

installing safety equipment
to prevent collisions between trains jr east has installed ats automatic train stop and atc automatic
train control systems on all of its railway lines
to heighten the current safety level of train operations even further we are installing atsp and atsps
systems which employ continuous speed monitoring functions the number of installations is steadily
increasing most are in the tokyo metropolitan area by the end of march 2012 the atsp system had
been installed on 23535km of railway line the atsps system is currently installed on 2105km of line in
the sendai and niigata regions and at 47 stations additionally jr east replaced the atsps for the section
of the senseki line between aobadori and higashishiogama with its advanced train administration and
communications system atacs a radiocontrolled train operation control system in october of 2011
in response to revisions to the ministry ordinance for technological standards for railways in july 2006
we are working on measures to prevent excessive train speeds at curves turnouts and terminals and on
descending grades planned improvements at all curves that had been targeted for action were completed
by the end of march 2010

systemization of maintenance work
when starting maintenance work on railway tracks jr east works to ensure the safety of its trains and
maintenance workers by following procedures to set signals to stop so that trains do not enter sections
of railway where maintenance work is being conducted in the past this was done mainly via telephone
from maintenance workers to stations however in order to prevent any occurrence of error including
human error jr east adopted a method for maintenance workers to operate handheld devices to change
signals to red and the devices have since been introduced to major railway sections in the tokyo
metropolitan area in the future jr east aims to continue its efforts to improve the safety of its operations
through the systemization of its maintenance work in other railway sections as well

introduction of the advanced train administration and communications system atacs
train control system with radio transmission
atacs is a train control system utilizing radio transmissions by using radio communications for the
transmission of information between ground and onboard facilities the system enables the trains to be
mainly controlled by onboard equipment permitting reductions in traditionally required facilities such as
signals connecting cables and track circuits which are currently used for the detection of trains
eliminating these facilities is expected to reduce the number of facility failures and the number of
subsequent transport disruptions
jr east began using the atacs system in october 2011 on the senseki line between aobadori and
higashishiogama


introduction of effective rainfall as a new indicator
when there is heavy rainfall we ensure train safety through operational restrictions such as limits to train
speed and when necessary by suspension of operations for operational restrictions on conventional
lines we have been using hourly rainfall1 and continuous precipitation2 as our indices since june
2008 we have been usingeffective rainfallas a new indicator that is effective in prevention of landslide
disasters due to rainfall effective rainfall is the amount of underground water remaining after changes
over time in ground penetration and outflow using this indicator we can more precisely predict the
occurrence of landslide disasters improving the safety and reliability of our train operations
1 hourly rainfall the total rainfall over a onehour period
2 continuous precipitation the total continuous rainfall over a 12hour period

measures to prevent railway crossing accidents
when the company was established in 1987 there were 247 accidents during the year at level crossings
in the fiscal year ending march 2012 the number had been drastically reduced to 36 approximately 60
of all levelcrossing accidents involve automobiles we have installed devices such as obstacle detectors
which are capable of detecting an obstacle such as an automobile stalled on a crossing and stopping
trains and we have increased the number of crossing warning devices in a higher position for better
visibility more large red and white crossing gates have been installed the barrier arms are thicker than
usual and have red and white reflective plates that cover the whole bar these are expected to provide
better visibility day and night studies are currently being carried out on the effectiveness of these bars in
addition we are presently promoting a wide range of public relations activities for the prevention of level
crossing accidents appealing to drivers for their cooperation and understanding
in addition for countermeasures against secondary accidents resulting from derailments at level crossings
derailment prevention guards have been installed at level crossings furthermore in order to decrease
the number of level crossings we are cooperating with local governments neighboring residents and the
police to increase the number of overhead crossings
as examples of our most recent efforts in 2005 jr east began working to improve safety at the sojiji
temple level crossing on the tokaido line near tsurumi station where there had been more troubles
than at other level crossings in the tokyo area because it is on a curve with restricted visibility the
overhead pedestrian crossing was rebuilt to be barrierfree and in fy2011 the level crossing was closed
during rush hours closed hours were extended to between 600 and 2100 in fy2012 and as a result
of our agreements with concerned parties from april 1 2012 this level crossing has been closed to road
traffic at all times
learning lessons from an accident at a level crossing on the iiyama line between morimiyanohara and
ashidaki on february 1 2011 jr east has introduced a rule to stop trains at stations when the warning
signals at a the level crossing are being activated due to causes such as equipment failures and when
pedestrians and automobiles are allowed to cross at the level crossing to ensure that train operations do
not endanger pedestrians or automobiles jr east also formulated a procedure for field staff to prevent
failures in safety confirmation




                               nowclosed sojiji temple level crossing on the tokaido line



station platform safety
in the fiscal year ending march 2012 there were 75 accidents in which customers fell from platforms
onto tracks or came into contact with trains jr east is installing protectionrelated devices including
emergency trainstop systems on our platforms to ensure customer safety customer awareness and
cooperation are also vital to safety on our platforms and we are implementing ourzero platform
accident campaignthrough posters as a measure to heighten this awareness
as a major measure to prevent accidents to customers on platforms jr east is introducing automatic
platform gates on the yamanote line in fy2012 jr east completed its replacement of all yamanote line
railcars by e231 series 4door railcars all locations at ebisu and meguro stations where the platform
gates were initially introduced are now equipped with these gates and based on experience at these
initial two stations jr east has been working on platform gate installation at other yamanote line stations
since fy2011 in fy2013 we plan to install these gates at osaki and ikebukuro stations and in fy2014
at otsuka sugamo komagome shinokubo mejiro takadanobaba and
tamachi stations with the exception of four stations shimbashi shibuya
shinjuku and tokyo which require largescale improvement work we plan to
complete installations at all stations on the line by fy2018
for stations with a daily number of passengers exceeding 100000 jr east
is currently working to install an increased number of dotbraille blocks that
indicate which direction is away from the edge of the platform
                                                                                             automatic platform gates on the

measures against earthquakes
lessons learned from the past earthquakes
learning from earthquakes in the past jr east has employed the following three antiearthquake
measures
① stopping trains immediately emergency train stop measures
② preventing structural damage seismic reinforcement measures
③ minimizing secondary accidents following derailment preventive measures against trains deviating from
   tracks


① early earthquake alert system
jr east has installed seismographs along coastal and shinkansen railway lines for the detection of primary
tremors pwaves our present system allows us to stop trains as soon as primary tremors are detected
for conventional lines our early earthquake alert system was introduced for the tokyo metropolitan
area in december 2007 and in all other areas in april 2009 the system enables trains in any section of
track to be stopped in the case of a major earthquake utilizing information obtained from our shinkansen
seismographs and from any advance announcements given by the japan meteorological agency
furthermore early detection of earthquake occurrence by seismographs and of interruptions of electric
transmission have enabled us to more promptly detect earthquakes and start emergency braking about
one second earlier jr east strengthened its observations for possible occurrences of earthquakes by
additionally installing its seismometers at 30 locations for earthquakes with epicenters potentially situated
directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan area and those in inland areas of its service area


② seismic reinforcement of elevated bridges
in response to the 1995 great hanshinawaji earthquake jr east has been taking a number of seismic
reinforcement measures by the end of march 2008 we had reinforced all of our elevated shinkansen
viaduct support columns and shinkansen bridge columns on our conventional lines by the end of march
2009 we had reinforced all other columns in the southern kanto and sendai areas except in places that
required additional construction work currently we are reinforcing elevated bridge columns susceptible
to failure due to bending by strong earthquake motion aiming to further improve our safety levels
against earthquakes based on the effects of the great east japan earthquake and to be prepared for
the possible occurrence of an earthquake with an epicenter directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan
area jr east is also employing additional measures including greater reinforcement of its embankments
advanced plans for the seismic reinforcement of its elevated bridge columns and the increased expansion
of its ranges for these measures


③ prevention of secondary accidents after derailment
during the niigata chuetsu earthquake in 2004 one of our joetsu shinkansen trains was derailed while
running fortunately this derailment did not lead to any injury to either our passengers or our train crews
learning from the events surrounding this earthquake jr east has taken numerous measures aimed to
improve our shinkansen trains and tracks for our railcars we have installed an lshaped car guide on
the bogies to restrict lateral movement of the car body for ground facilities we are improving the shape
of joint bars to lessen the impact of wheels on rail joints in the case of a derailment and implementing
countermeasures to prevent the overturning of railcars and the lateral movement of rails if metal rail
fasteners are damaged by a derailment
nevertheless at the time of the great east japan earthquake in march 2011 one of our trains in test
operation derailed after its regular inspection this showed that further investigations are needed in order
to improve our safety measures

measures taken since the accident on the uetsu line
on december 25 2005 the limited express train inaho no14 derailed between sagoshi and kita
amarume stations near the no 2 mogamigawa bridge we would like to report on the measures we
have taken since this accident




increased number of anemometers wind meters
jr east has increased the number of anemometers at the accident site between sagoshi and kita
amarume stations in addition for sections with operational restrictions due to strong winds we
established multiple anemometers as our new standard and increased the number of anemometers in
locations where windbreak fences were installed by reconfirming the requirements for wind restrictions
on sections of railway lines using information from frontline employees topography and wind conditions
of the areas and adding new operation restriction sections we are working to improve our safety
observation network to counter the effects of these strong winds we completed our planned increase
and installation of anemometers by the end of march 2010 with this reinforcement since the accident
jr east had installed a total of 574 anemometers for its conventional and shinkansen lines and the total
number of anemometers installed as of march 31 2012 was 891 733 on conventional lines and 158 on
shinkansen lines

expanded introduction of a gale warning system
we have been adding to our gale warning system to raise the level of safety by restricting operations
not only when the actual wind speed measured by anemometers exceeds restriction thresholds but
also when the projected maximum wind speed exceeds these limits jr east has installed gale warning
systems in all of the 297 locations on its conventional lines with gale operational restrictions


introduction of a method to properly assess and utilize the effect of wind force on railcars
for operational restrictions
the effect of wind force on railcars is constantly changing for this reason jr east has been studying
methods to properly assess the effects of wind on railcars and utilize the results to more accurately
assess operational restrictions for increased safety in train operations together with consideration for the
opinions of experts in the field jr east has been studying the following
① more accurate methods of wind observation using anemometers
② calculation methods for the yield strength of railcars against wind through considerations for track
   conditions and carbody shape
jr east plans to introduce these new methods for the following operations for the uetsu main line
between kobato and uzenmizusawa from december 9 2011 and between uzenmizusawa and uzen
oyama from march 22 2012 and for the keiyo line between shinnarashino and kaihin makuhari and
from march 23 between chibaminato and soga


utilizing meteorological information to test methods for operational restrictions
local gusts are meteorological phenomena and are difficult to observe with conventional observation
equipment such as anemometers through meteorological information obtained from the japan
meteorological agency radar and by detecting the passing of cold weather fronts and the accompanying
development of cumulonimbus clouds we have been investigating how to forecast the occurrence of
local gusts and to apply that information to our operational restrictions from fiscal 2008 the system was
tested during the winter on the uetsu main line between niitsu and sakata and on the hakushin line
between niigata and shibata on february 17th 2009 we added the system to sections of the uetsu
main line shinetsu main line echigo line yahiko line and rikuu west line for additional testing
during this five year period of testing though we initiated train operational restrictions for a total of eight
days we did not observe any actual occurrence of local gusts


research of a doppler radar observation method
we are currently investigating the possible utilization of a doppler radar observation method to help
identify local gusts as information to be used for operational restrictions doppler radars can determine
wind conditions by detecting the movements of raindrops and rain clouds and are used at some airports
for detecting local gusts
since 2007 we have conducted local gust observations using a doppler radar with the system
constructed in 2010 as a basis for a local gust detection system we started realtime local gust detection
experiments at amarume station on the uetsu main line while conducting ongoing validations and
improvements through experimental monitoring of the local gust detection system we will advance our
research on the application potentiality of the system for train operation restrictions

service quality reforms

service quality
since its establishment jr east has continuously striven to improve its service to the level that all
customers can enjoy travel free of care customer requirements however continue to become ever more
sophisticated so we need to respond with even better services
with this in mind and with the objective of further enhancing our service quality in july 2010 we clarified
our basic customer service quality policy and established the customer service quality reformation
department at head office as well as customer service quality reformation offices at various branches we
also formulated a five year planmediumterm vision for service quality reformsbeginning in fy 2012
mediumterm vision for service quality reforms is supported by the following three pillars
 quality services that reassure customers
 prompt improvements in the quality of our services that reflect customer comments with the entire
   group working as a single team
 creation of a corporate culture that allows employees to think and act as individuals
we worked diligently to establish these three pillars during the past year making fy2012 a key year in
our service quality reforms efforts we will continue to make steadfast efforts to carry out our service
quality reforms and attain the highest customer satisfaction unequaled in the railway industry



                  overall goals of the mediumterm vision for service quality reforms
                   prompt improvements in the quality of
                     our services that reﬂect customer            quality services that

service quality coordinator
for overall improvement of railway service quality focused on team efforts for service improvement and
for providing reliable railway transport we stationed service quality coordinators in districts and branch
offices beginning in october 2011 the coordinator    s job is to supervise the areawide improvement of
service quality as well as to support and promote solution of crossorganizational problems in this way
efforts will be made to improve service quality rapidly from the frontline field operations


service quality meetings
to improve our service quality further with field operations branch offices and the head office working as
a team we instituted service quality meetings in which senior executives from our head office visit field
operations and exchange views with field supervisors up to now these meetings have dealt with such
themes as how to deal with transport disruptions when they occur and how to resume service after the
occurrence of largescale disasters in the tokyo metropolitan area these meetings take up problems
affecting particular railway districts or areas and the team works together to improve service quality
without being constrained by organizational considerations

prompt service quality improvements with customer comments at the core
customer comments are considered at various levels within the company initially a decision as to
whether or not some action of improvement is necessary is made at the level that initially received the
original customer comments the action will reflect this decision if action is difficult to take at that level
then the comments are passed on to higher levels where potential improvements can be discussed
improvements in the quality of service can be achieved by implementing suitable methods of responding
to customersneeds
at the very top level we have also established the customer comments committee chaired by the
president which considers the possible implementation of improvement measures based on collected
customer comments through this system we are constantly striving for the attainment of improved
customer services

   what is the customer comments committee

    chaired by the president the committee discusses the necessity of improvements requested by
    customers and specific solution measures that will ultimately lead to speedy improvements



sq network
based on one of the three pillars of the mediumterm vision for service quality reformsprompt
improvements in the quality of our services that reflect customer comments with the entire group
working as a single teamour company and group companies closely involved in transport service
together established thesq service quality network in october 2011 the sq network holds
meetings of representatives of jr east and group companies at stations branch offices and the head
office to share customerscomments and devise solutions and improvements through teamwork that
goes beyond individual departments or group companies in this way the jr east group as a whole can
dedicate itself to enhancing customerssatisfaction


customer satisfaction surveys
we conduct customer satisfaction surveys via our jr east customer questionnaires to enable us to gain
an understanding of how customers evaluate our services that we cannot get simply through customer
feedback and to quantitatively check levels of customer satisfaction the survey results are used to decide
which issues jr east should most urgently address as well as to confirm the efficacy of previous measures


wayside monitors
we instituted a wayside monitors system beginning in fy2012 to gain a more specific understanding
of the needs of our customers and of the way they use our services on each of our railway lines this
is in addition to customerscomments we receive daily and our jr east customer questionnaires we
have recruited the monitors from among our customers who live along our railway lines and sought their
views through questionnaires on the internet and interviews to understand their needs from different
perspectives so that we can increase the attractiveness of living alongside or near our railway lines

prevention of transport disruptions
to increase service reliability we are implementing hardware measures designed to prevent transport
disruptions including railcars with dual systems track switches of nextgeneration design equipment to
reduce lightning strike damage to electric facilities and windbreak fences
 railcars with dual systems railcars with increased reliability through duplication of major equipment




                                                                        62

early resumption of operations after transport disruptions and prevention of disruption on
connecting lines
to ensure early resumption of operations after a transport disruption we maintain our preparedness
for quick responses at all times we regularly train our employees on how to deal with personal injury
accidents and how to rescue our customers we review transport disruptions that have occurred and
work to prevent their recurrence we also develop and maintain support tools including the introduction
of alive field video distribution system to prevent transport disruption impacts on other sections we
are adding facilities for turning trains back so that normal schedules can be maintained where there is no
direct effect from the cause of the disruption

turnback operation
when a transport disruption has occurred we try to turn trains back before they enter the disrupted
section so that the impact of the disruption will not extend to other sections
in fy2012 we installed turnback facilities at yoshikawa minami station a new station on the musashino
line and made corresponding changes to our atos system it is now possible to run turnback operations
on the musashino line quickly and flexibly we will continue to work on reducing the impact of transport
disruptions by readying necessary equipment and reviewing rules to enable turnbacks at the new station
resolving any remaining issues in turnback operations

learn lessons from transport disruptions and use the lessons at the worksite level
we accumulate our lessons from past transport disruptions to help us better deal with such problems
and restore regular service quickly
when a disruption has occurred each work site involved reflects on how it was dealt with learns the
lessons from this and uses the knowledge to study and implement measures to prevent recurrences
these measures at different work sites are widely disseminated to other work sites so that each individual
employee may build up his or her knowledge


information enhancement
we are developing methods so that if there is a transport disruption we can provide our customers with
prompt and accurate information at frequent intervals while we work to restore normal service when
train operation is suspended due to an accident resulting in casualty we are making efforts to announce
the expected time of resumption of train service within 10 minutes of the occurrence of the accident
in the meantime we will continue to install emergency information displays as of the end of fy2012
such displays were installed in 118 stations as tools for providing our customers with transport information
in addition we provide information through varied media such as through onboard led and liquid crystal
displays the jr east home page on the internet and cell phone service




            information display during transport disruptions        information on the website




problem prevention measures taken by the facilities section
we are working to lessen the impact of transport disruptions with priorities on a reduction in the actual
number of incidents rapid restoration of services when incidents do occur and the provision of accurate
customer information in the facilities section in particular in order to reduce the severity of problems
and failures we are strengthening or duplicating facilities to make them less likely to cause problems
established a restoration base and increased our supply of replacement parts for essential equipment
these initiatives have resulted in a downward trend of transport disruptions in the tokyo metropolitan
area
in our efforts to provide accurate customer information we are working to enhance and improve our
information displays we will continue to strive for a reduction in transport disruptions by analyzing past
occurrences and by facility strengthening measures including both software and hardware

relationship with employees

demonstrating the power of human resources
in order to provide services that will satisfy customers it is vitally important for us to create an
environment where jr east     s personnel can fully exercise their abilities our success in enabling our
people to be able to personally decide what they need to achieve and then act on their decisions will
determine the future of our entire organization
we also have to face the fact that society is in a continual state of change and this includes both the
awareness of working people and their working environments as a result of this we believe that jr east
as a part of the nations infrastructure and as an organization that aims for extreme levels of safety must
constantly respond to the motivation of all our employees as they work to meet their responsibilities and
thereby bring about improved safety and increased customer satisfaction
jr east continues to work to provide an environment in which all employees can enjoy their jobs while
constantly striving to attain even higher goals to that end we are determined to face the challenge of
creating a company where people grow through their work from the perspectives of how to respond to
the motivation of each employee to meet challenges how to ensure a suitable worklife balance and how
to make full use of the diversity of our human resources
injr east vision 2020     the company advocated a strategic reform of our human resources system
aimed at the fostering of motivated young employees the upgrading of the skills of managementlevel
employees the encouraging of veteran employees to pass on their technical knowledge and their skills to
the next generation of employees who will shoulder the burdens of the 21st century and the utilization
and fostering of diverse human resources


recruiting
jr east s main supports are the capabilities of each and every employee our basic philosophy is to
employ people based chiefly on their personalities and abilities and then to steadily nurture them
until they reach the full flowering of their abilities because of the large number of employees reaching
retirement age in march 2013 and the constant necessity of human resources development and the
transfer of knowledge and technologies to the next generation we have recruited 1810 new employees

jr east technical academy
in order to motivate our young employees and encourage them develop into professionals capable
of playing leading roles in all fields of railway technology in march 2009 we established the jr east
technical academy the 4th year class that started in march 2012 consists of 48 employees from 11
technological fields who will spend the year on leave from their regular positions in order to concentrate
on technological studies at the head office the program has been designed to enable participants to
thoroughly learn the theory and structure of their individual professional fields as well as to provide
them with a comprehensive overview of railway technologies and systems in general through research
at universities and from practical training sessions at manufacturers furthermore we hope to enable all
participants to acquire a broad range of knowledge


skills development
the development of human resources and the steady but continuous introduction of new technologies
and skills are vital to the sustainable growth of the jr east group based on a perspective of nurturing
quality through work we are striving to enhance the organizational power of the group and to develop
human resources capable of shouldering the burdens of the future
with this in mind we constantly conduct training programs at our general education center and in branch
offices and many kinds of seminars at our head office and as part of our support for all employees
to set their own challenges in regard to selfeducation and to thereby heighten their abilities we offer
both internal and external correspondence courses the internal courses are aimed at the acquisition
of knowledge and skills directly connected to our employeesduties while the external courses target
the acquisition of knowledge indispensable for businesspeople in terms of management knowhow
qualifications acquirement languages and office automation


my project
in order to encourage our employees to face the challenges of taking the next steps in their careers in
january 2011 we upgraded our small groups and proposal activities and initiated the my project program
this program is comprised of three aspects selfstarting freedom of method and importance of process
with the fruit being the employees personal growth the project is based on the belief that the tackling
of improvements in itself is an opportunity for the fostering of human resources and thereby aims to
nurture employees capable of thinking and acting independently


skills training centersdevelop engineers for future railways
integral to our efforts to ensure that veteran employees pass on their technologies and skills to the
next generation of technical staff who will carry the responsibilities for railways in the future is our
establishment of skills training centers designed to support the continuity of railwayspecific knowledge
in individual workplaces in our rolling stock maintenance center for example railway car component
mockups such as power collection equipment door openingclosing devices and braking equipment
have been set up while at our facilities maintenance center railway facilities including tracks turnouts
platforms overhead line equipment and signals have been installed so training sessions can take place in
virtually real environments
by the fiscal year ending 2014 we plan to establish a total of no less than 104 skills training centers
including those that make use of existing facilities

     voice



         i want to show my younger colleagues who want to
         become drivers how i balance work with childcare
         i joined jr east in 2001 and became a driver in 2005 after
         working as a member of station staff and as a conductor
         after the birth of my first and second sons in 2008 and 2010
         i returned to work in october 2011 i had been on leave of
         absence for about three years the mothers of some of my
         elder son s friends were surprised to know my situation
         saying that usually childcare leave could be taken until the
         child was one year old
         i had dreamed of becoming a driver ever since i joined the
         company so for me there was no question of leaving my job
         because of the birth of my children my family s understand
         ing of my feelings and its support for me together with a
         workplace environment that enabled me to work as well as
         to care for my children were the main reasons why i was
         able to continue my career now i am working to a reduced
         schedule and can take my children to and from nursery
         school myself
         while on leave i was kept informed by telephone or email
         of the situation in the workplace and i went there from time
         to time also the company organized an opportunity for
         female workers on childcare leave to talk about anxiety and concerns about childcare and return
         to work and to share various information i had two concerns associated with returning to work
         one was whether i could find a nursery school near my home and the other was the irregular
         work schedules for me and my husband as he was also a driver as members of the train crew
                                                            we have night shifts and sometimes have to work
                                                            from 5 o clock in the morning by comparison
                                                            with couples with fixed working hours it is more
                                                            difficult for us to share housework and to take the
                                                            children to and from nursery for this reason i
                                                            was somewhat worried before i returned to work
                                                            however i was able to overcome these concerns
                                                            after returning to work it was great my husband
                                                            and i have said many times that we shall do as
                                                            much as we can but that we shall ask our parents
                                                            to help us by taking the children to and from the
                                                            nursery should this become necessary earlier on
                                                            we had asked the company for advice on how to
                                                            deal with certain problems
                                                            the number of female drivers will continue to
                                                            increase this is why i wanted to explain to other
                                                            female workers in the company how i have been
         able to achieve a good balance between work and childcare i hope that
         this will contribute to the creation of a workplace environment in which
         they will be able to return to work after maternity leave more easily than
         now i shall be pleased if this explanation of how i dealt with the situation
         will encourage those who have similar concerns
         when i come back home from work my sons sing a song that they have
         learned while playing with their friends and they read a book to me
         listening to them is really a relief for me when i am so tired at first i felt
         guilty about going to work and leaving them in a nursery but now i feel
         really happy to see how my children are growing up while i am at work
         when i was told by one of the nursery teachers that my son pointed to a
         picture of a train in a picture book saying this is mom s train  i felt
         really happy that i was able to continue doing this job my sons are               megumi takemoto
         proud that their mother is a train driver it makes me feel that my job is      chief driver

improved work environment

mental health care
in order to maintain and improve the mental health of our employees we believe it is vitally important
for all our employees to recognize stress in their everyday lives and deal with it promptly as a result
we are taking various support measures such as the distribution to all employees of a pamphlet about
selfcare with the aim of increasing their awareness of this issue we have also set up a counseling service
in conjunction with a jr east medical facility and through this respond individually to our employees
needs in order to promote frontline care in the workplace beginning in the fiscal year ended march
2008 we also organized training programs for onsite supervisors


elder employee system
during the fiscal year ended march 2009 jr east introduced the elderly employee system that
encourages employees who have reached retirement age to continue working for group companies
that can benefit from their individual capabilities and skills through this plan we hope to enable retired
employees to stabilize their lives until they reach their fully pensionable ages as well as to encourage
them to continue to contribute to our groupwide accumulation of knowhow


human rights enlightenment

compliance
basic concept of compliance
in 2005 jr east adopted our policy on legal and regulatory compliance and corporate ethics as the
group s corporate activity guidelines concomitantly we established compliance hotlines both inside
and outside the company for internal reporting and have promoted efforts on compliance
since 2009 all employees of jr east group companies have been given education to increase their
awareness of compliance
jr east group has been making concerted efforts to further promote compliance in 2009 we started
reviewing legal aspects throughout our business activities and in 2011 we established abasic matter
confirmation support sheetdesigned for the regular checking of important matters by individual
departments to ensure proper business conduct


formulation and revision of the compliance action plan
in order to enhance the effectiveness of the 2005 policy we developed and distributed the first version
of our compliance action plan document that summarized what we consider to be desirable levels of
conduct for all group employees
after the shinanogawa power station incidents we revised the plan based on full awareness of laws
and regulations reports on the incidents and other factors and distributed to the revised plan to all
employees as society and the environment change we will continue to review it and make sure all
employees remain aware and observe the plan


strengthening mechanism for proper business conduct
we conducted full inspections of our compliance for all our operations including group companies
starting with the inspections jr east group is promoting continuous reviews of all its operations based
on laws and regulations internal rules and social norms
in 2011 jr east created thebasic matter confirmation support sheetlisting matters subject to regular
checking and requiring heads of departments to personally ensure that business is carried out properly
we endeavor to achieve thorough implementation at each workplace


education of all employees
we have been carrying out compliance education for all employees since 2009 in order to further
increase awareness focusing on cases and topics matching the realities of each workplace in fiscal 2013
jr east is implementing a new educational program focused on social media and information security
where a number of issues have been surfacing lately we will endeavor to improve educational content
that will be based on societal and environmental changes

the setting of mediumterm targets for total co 2 emissions from railway
business activities has been changed with the new environmental targets
targets are now set for two indicators energy consumption from railway
business activitiesandco2 emissions per unit of electricity generated at
jr easts own power plants rather than the previous single target oftotal
co2 emissionsin light of the review of national energy policy underway
since the earthquake in march 2011 jr east considered it better to set its
targets based on indicators that would be more under our own control
new environmental targets are mostly shortterm targets to be met by fiscal
2014 but the above two new targets are mediumterm targets to be met
by fiscal 2021 in this report values in base fiscal years results in absolute
values in fiscal 2012 and reduction or improvement rates are given we
believe that jr east could make the results of its activities more transparent     naomi sugo
