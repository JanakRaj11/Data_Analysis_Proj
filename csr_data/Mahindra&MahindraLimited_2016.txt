 starting this year we have revised the reporting
 format of mahindras sustainability performance
 while sustainability performance of mm auto 
 farm sector has been reported individually in line
 with gri g4 guidelines the sustainability highlights of
 all the subsidiaries and associates of mm have been
 captured in a separate section the reason for this
 change in presentation is not just alignment with the
 new g4 guidelines but also enhanced comparability
 of sector performance some of our subsidiaries like
 mahindra lifespaces and mahindra finance are
 already publishing their individual reports
