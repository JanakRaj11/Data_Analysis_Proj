                    a result of future events no matter how likely are not recognised an objective evidence of impairment is deemed to
                    exist where the principal or interest or both for insurance receivables is past due for more than 90 days or 3 months for
                    those individually assessed as prescribed in the guidelines on financial reporting for insurers issued by bnm

            	an impairment loss in respect of insurance receivables is recognised in profit or loss and is measured as the difference
              between the financial assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the
              financial assets original effective interest rate the carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced through the use of
              an allowance account

                    if in a subsequent period the fair value of insurance receivables increases and the increase can be objectively related
                    to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss the impairment loss is reversed to
                    the extent that the insurance receivables carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have
                    been had the impairment not been recognised at the date the impairment is reversed the amount of the reversal is
                    recognised in profit or loss

                    the carrying amounts of other assets except for investment properties that are measured at fair value and deferred tax
                    assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment
                    if any such indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated for goodwill that has indefinite useful
                    lives the recoverable amount is estimated usually at each reporting date

                    for the purpose of impairment testing assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash
                    inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets known
                    as cashgenerating unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing cashgenerating units to which goodwill
                    has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level
                    at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes the goodwill acquired in a business combination for
                    the purpose of impairment testing is allocated to a cashgenerating unit or a group of cashgenerating units that are
                    expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination

                    the recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs
                    of disposal in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre

                    or cashgenerating unit

            	an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cashgenerating unit exceeds its
              estimated recoverable amount impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss

                    impairment losses recognised in respect of cashgenerating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of
                    any goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating unit group of cashgenerating units and then to reduce the carrying
                    amounts of the other assets in the cashgenerating unit groups of cashgenerating units on a pro rata basis

             insurance contracts are those contracts that transfer significant insurance risk an insurance contract is a contract under which
             the insurance subsidiary the insurer has accepted significant insurance risk from another party the policyholders by agreeing
             to compensate the policyholders if a specified uncertain future event the insured event adversely affects the policyholders as
             a general guideline the insurance subsidiary determines whether it has significant insurance risk by comparing benefits paid
             with benefits payable if the insured event did not occur

             investment contracts are those contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk

      	once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract it remains as an insurance contract for the remainder of its life
        time even if the insurance risk reduces significantly during this period unless all rights and obligations are extinguished or
        expired investment contracts can however be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes
        significant

             insurance and investment contracts if any are further classified as being either with or without discretionary participation
             features dpf dpf is a contractual right to receive as a supplement to guaranteed benefits additional benefits that are

                     likely to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits
                     whose amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the issuer and
                     that are contractually based on the

                               profit or loss of the company fund or other entity that issues the contract

      	under the terms of the contracts surpluses in the dpf funds can be distributed on a discretion over the amount and timing
        of the distribution of these surpluses to policyholders all dpf liabilities including unallocated surpluses both guaranteed and
        discretionary at the end of the reporting period are held within insurance or investment contract liabilities as appropriate

              contract with dpf or if the host insurance contract andor investment contract itself is measured at fair value through profit or
              loss

      	when insurance contracts contain both a financial risk component and a significant insurance risk component and the cash
        flows from the two components are distinct and can be measured reliably the underlying amounts are unbundled any
        premiums relating to the insurance risk component are accounted for on the same basis as insurance contracts and the
        remaining element is accounted for as a deposit through the statements of financial position similar to investment contracts

             deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and
             they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities but they
             intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously

      	a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which
        temporary difference can be utilised deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are reduced to
        the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised

             the group presents basic and diluted earnings per share eps data for its ordinary shares

      	basic eps is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the company by the weighted
        average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period

             diluted eps is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number
             of ordinary shares in issue adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares which comprise convertible notes

                     for general insurance contracts claims liabilities are the outstanding claims reserve required for the future settlement
                     of losses on claims which have occurred but have yet to be fully settled claims liabilities fall into two categories

                     at the end of the reporting period

                     it can take a significant period of time before the ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty and for some
                     type of policies ibnr claims form the majority of the statements of financial position liability the ultimate cost of
                     outstanding claims is estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques such as chain
                     ladder and bornheutterferguson methods

                     the expected ultimate cost of claims reported are based on estimates of future payments that will be made with
                     respect to individual claims such estimates are made on a casebycase basis based on the information available at the
                     time the reserves are established the estimates reflect the informed judgement of claims personnel based on general
                     insurance reserving practices and knowledge of the nature and value of a specific type of claim these reserves are
                     regularly reevaluated in the ordinary course of the settlement process and adjustments are made as new information
                     becomes available

      226	fair value measurement

             fair value of an asset or a liability is determined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
             an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the measurement assumes that the transaction
             to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market or in the absence of a principal market in the
             most advantageous market

             for nonfinancial asset the fair value measurement takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic
             benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in
             its highest and best use

      	when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability the group uses observable market data as far as possible fair value are
        categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the input used in the valuation technique as follows


             level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the group can access at the
                      measurement date
             level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or
                      indirectly
             level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

             the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date the event or change in circumstances
             that caused the transfers

            impairment test for cashgenerating unit cgu containing goodwill

            for goodwill attributable to the acquisition of cab following the scheme on 1 january 2009 the carrying amount of goodwill
            has been allocated to the entire integrated general insurance business of the group as one cgu which represents the lowest
            level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes the estimated recoverable amount
            is calculated based on value in use determined by discounted cash flows generated by the general insurance business using
            approved 5year financial budgets projected to perpetuity

            the following key assumptions have been used in the cash flow projections in respect of the determining the value in use for
            cgu containing goodwill


            key assumptions
            discount rate  post tax                                         112
            terminal growth rate                                             30

            for goodwill attributable to the acquisition of alim the annual impairment test was done by comparing the estimated
            recoverable amount of alim with its carrying amount including the goodwill attributed the recoverable amount is the value
            in use which is measured by the embedded value attributable to alim calculated by an appointed actuary alim computes the
            embedded value using market consistent embedded value approach whereby the embedded value is the present value of
            future shareholders distributable profits after tax discounted at the risk free yield curve with volatility adjustment plus the net
            assets value the projected future cash flows are based on the best estimate of assumptions either derived from the operating
            unit experience or industry experience

            the estimated recoverable amounts of both the cgus were determined to be higher than their carrying amounts and thus no
            impairment loss was recognised

            the software development costs are in relation to internal development expenditures incurred for the open product

                                           having either received too little premium for the risks it has agreed to underwrite and hence has not enough funds to invest and pay
                                           claims or that claims are in excess of those expected

      	as all of the business is derived from malaysia the entire life insurance contract liabilities are in malaysia there is no investment
        contract issued by the company during the current and previous financial years

              key assumptions

              significant judgement is required in determining the liabilities and in the choice of assumptions assumptions in use are based
              on past experiences current internal data external market indices and benchmarks which reflect current observable market
              prices and other published information assumptions and prudent estimates are determined at the date of valuation they are
              further evaluated on a continuous basis in order to ensure realistic and reasonable valuations

              the key assumptions to which the estimation of liabilities is particularly sensitive are as follows

               mortality and morbidity rates
              	experience study on mortality and morbidity rates is carried out on an annual basis the actual claim experience is
                compared against industrial mortality table and reinsurers morbidity risk charges mortality and morbidity assumptions
                vary by product type and underwriting procedures

              	alim can increase the mortalitymorbidity risk charges in future years in line with emerging experience for investment
                linked and universal life contracts

              	an appropriate allowance for provision of risk margin for adverse deviation from expected experience is made in the
                valuation of nonparticipating life policies the guaranteed benefits insurance liabilities of participating life policies and
                nonunit actuarial liabilities of investmentlinked policies

            the analysis below is performed for reasonable possible movements in key assumptions with all other assumptions held
            constant showing the impact on gross and net liabilities and profit before tax sensitivities testing on individual assumptions
            are meaningful to analyse the magnitude of reserve changes for each assumption however it should be studied with care as
            it does not capture the possible correlation effect when all assumptions are being stressed simultaneously it should be noted
            that movements in these assumptions are nonlinear sensitivity information will also vary according to the current economic
            assumptions

             key assumptions

             the principal assumption underlying the liability estimates is that the subsidiarys future claims development will follow a
             similar pattern to past claims development experience this includes assumptions in respect of average claim costs claim
             handling costs and claim numbers for each accident year additional qualitative judgements are used to assess the extent to
             which past trends may not apply in the future for example oneoff occurrence as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix
             policy conditions and claims handling procedures

             no discounting is made to the recommended claims and premium liability provisions as a prudent measure in addition no
             explicit inflation adjustment has been made to claims amount payable in the future however implicit inflation is allowed for
             future claims to the extent evident in past claims development it is worthwhile to note that discounting is unlikely to result in
             any material impact due to the short tail nature of almost all classes coupled with the low prevailing interest rate environment

             the subsidiary has based its risk margin for adverse deviation prad for the provisions for unexpired risks and insurance
             claims at the minimum 75 of sufficiency according to the requirement set by bnm under the rbc framework

             sensitivities

      	analysis of sensitivity around various scenarios provides an indication of the adequacy of the companys estimation process in
        respect of its insurance contracts the table presented below demonstrates the sensitivity of the insurance contract liabilities
        estimates to particular movements in assumptions used in the estimation process

                                                  the analysis below is performed for reasonable possible movements in key assumptions with all other assumptions held

                                                  a significant effect in determining the ultimate claims liabilities but to demonstrate the impact due to changes in assumptions
                                                  assumptions had to be changed on an individual basis it should be noted that movements in these assumptions are nonlinear

                                                  the management of the subsidiary believes that the estimate of total claims outstanding as of 31 december 2015 is adequate
                                                  however due to the inherent uncertainties in the reserving process it cannot be assured that such balances will ultimately
                                                  prove to be adequate

      393 	market risk

            market risk is the risk of loss arising due to changes in market prices or parameters influencing market prices and in particular
            the resultant interest rate guarantee risks from asset liability management or from changes to participations this includes
            changes in market prices due to worsening of market liquidity market risk comprises of currency risk interest rate risk and
            equity price risk

            the following risk mitigation actions are in place to control and monitor such risk

                   investment committee actively monitors the investment activities undertaken by the group
                   investment committee would recommend the initiatives after balancing competing and legitimate objective of various
                    stakeholders
                   the investment policy and mandate which formulated the single counter limits company limits and sector limits are
                    in place compliance to such limits is monitored monthly and reported to risk management working committeerisk
                    management committee on a quarterly basis
                   stress tests are performed as and when needed
                   stop loss policy is in place

            the group also issues investmentlinked policies in a number of products in the investmentlinked business the policyholders
            bear the investment risk on the assets held in the investmentlinked funds as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value
            of the assets in the funds the groups exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from
            fund management charges is based on the value of the assets in the funds

            3931 	currency risk

                    currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to the changes
                    in foreign exchange rates

                    the groups primary transactions are carried out in ringgit malaysia rm and its exposure to foreign currency risk
                    arises principally with respect to us dollar usd singapore dollar sgd thai baht thb and indonesian rupiah idr
                    as the groups business is conducted primarily in malaysia the groups financial assets are also primarily maintained
                    in malaysia as required under the financial services act 2013 and hence primarily denominated in the same currency
                    rm as its insurance contract liabilities thus the main foreign exchange risk from recognised assets and liabilities
                    arises from transactions other than those in which insurance contract liabilities are expected to be settled

            	as the groups main foreign exchange risk from recognised assets and liabilities arises from reinsurance transactions
              for which the balances are expected to be settled and realised in less than a year the impact arising from sensitivity in
              foreign exchange rates is deemed minimal as the group has no significant concentration of foreign currency risk all
              foreign currency risk in investmentlinked funds is borne by policyholders

                   the group is affected by changes in market interest rates due to the impact of such changes on fair value and will
                   incur an economic loss when the interest rates drop since the duration of policy liabilities is generally longer than the
                   duration of the fixed income financial assets

            	besides the uncertainty of the cash flows of the insurance funds and scarcity of the longer dated instruments it is not
              possible to hold assets that will perfectly match the policy liabilities

                           unfavourable direction the impact on profit before tax would be dependent on whether the equity price risk

     1	continuation in office as independent nonexecutive director ined

           pursuant to the recommendations of the malaysian code on corporate governance 2012 the tenure of an ined should not
           exceed a cumulative term of nine 9 years the board must justify and seek shareholders approval in the event it retains as an
           ined a person who has served in that capacity for more than nine 9 years

           mr foo san kan an ined of the company was appointed to the board on 25 november 2005 at the last annual general
           meeting of the company in 2015 the shareholders of the company had approved for mr foo san kan to continue to serve as
           ined of the company until the conclusion of 42nd agm

           mr foo san kan has expressed his willingness to continue to serve as an ined of the company

           the nominating committee and the board of the company had assessed the independence of mr foo san kan and were of the
           view that mr foo san kan remains independence and shall continue to serve as an ined of the company

           the board recommended for shareholders approval the resolution for mr foo san kan to continue to serve as an ined of the
           company after serving for a term of more than nine 9 years

           mr foo san kan is interested in this proposal and had accordingly abstained from deliberation and voting at the nominating
           committee meeting and board meeting

           the ordinary resolution 8 if passed will enable mr foo san kan to continue to serve as an ined of the company until the
           conclusion of the next annual general meeting

           the justifications for this proposal are disclosed in the statement on corporate governance of this annual report

           all classes of general insurance business and underwriting of life insurance and investmentlinked business

           business enter into recurrent related party transactions with classes of related parties as set out in section 22 of the circular to
           shareholders dated 26 april 2016 shareholders mandate circular

           enter into categories of recurrent related party transactions with the respective related parties as detailed in the shareholders
           mandate circular provided that such transactions are made on arms length basis and are on terms not more favourable to the
           related parties than those generally available to the public and are not to the detriment of the minority shareholders

           detailed information in relation to the proposed shareholders mandate for recurrent related party transactions are set out in
           the shareholders mandate circular despatched together with this annual report
