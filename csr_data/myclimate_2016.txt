businesses in tanzania the technology also effectively reduces co2 emissions
thanks to an innovative monitoring approach

another award went to solvatten technology this is a central component of the
myclimate climate protection program for clean and safe drinking water in uganda
the technology replaces drinking water purification systems that run on fossil fuels
it reduces co2 emissions while improving the health and living conditions of thou
sands of people

myclimate already received awards for two projects back in 2012 these awards are
part of the unfccc momentum for change initiative which is financially supported
by the bill  melinda gates foundation a 24member international advisory panel

global sustainable
development goals




in september 2015 the un adopted 17 sustainable devel
opment goals sdgs  they include ending poverty and
hunger and ensuring universal access to clean water and
sanitation by 2030
goal 13 is to combat climate change and its impacts this
goal is obviously supported by all myclimate climate pro
tection projects
what is less obvious however is that all myclimate climate
protection projects support another 13 sustainable devel
opment goals too
