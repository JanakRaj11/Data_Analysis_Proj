                 sustainability report 2012  to our stakeholders




to our stakeholders
                 2012 was another difficult year for the economy and the home appliance industry despite this indesit
                 worked well and successfully defended its positions

                 in april 2012 the international monetary fund predicted that the world economy would grow 35
                 while gdp in the eurozone would be down 03 but as the months passed the situation continued
                 to worsen the recovery started backsliding again and prospects for the future were darkened by
                 uncertainty

                 in the course of the year the home appliance market saw a 3 contraction in western europe and
                 33 growth in eastern europe with an overall drop in demand in socalled greater europe of nearly
                 one percentage point

                 yet again the crisis forced us to rethink our plans but we managed to perform well achieving positive
                 sales results and margins in the face of a negative market successful sales of new products and the
                 companys competitiveness enabled us to gain market share with particularly encouraging results in
                 the uk and eastern europe

                 indesit companys 2012 was marked by other things however we invested 90 million euros in new
                 products over 13 million appliances were sold and quality was improved by a further 7 we filed
                 over 90 patent applications continued to improve workplace safety  with a 28 drop in the accident
                 frequency index in industrial sites 100 of our industrial facilities are ohsas 18001 certified  and
                 reduced our co2 emissions per unit produced by a further 2 total hours of employee training rose
                 40

                 we pressed on with our domotics research and innovation activities in the homelab consortium
                 which was joined by new partners a project was launched to define a new interoperable standard so
                 that a communication code can be created to enable functional interaction between devices made by
                 the various homelab manufacturers the domotics system and the web home automation will yield
                 big benefits in terms of consumption levels usability smart grids diagnostics etc

                 it was an important year for the jonathan project whose mission is to help young people with social
                 and judicial problems regain a place in the community and which indesit has been supporting
                 uninterruptedly for 14 years now the project which employs innovative methods was further
                 consolidated over the year in italy and poland

                 2013 is proving to be another difficult year not much better than 2012 but we will continue to do
                 what is needed to consolidate the groups competitive position

logistics   transportation of products from manufacturing sites to markets is a significant source of environmental
            impact indesit companys transportation policy is to use different means of transport and be in a
            position to choose the most efficient logistics solutions in terms of reducing the environmental impact
            of the groups business it has on one hand made increasing use of transport suppliers whose vehicles
            have advanced technology for low emissions while it has not been possible on the other hand to
            replace road transport with other more economically efficient methods that are more ecofriendly as
            well even though some of the transportation continues to be by intermodal systems the groups
            logistics policy in 2012 generated total unit emissions of 44 kg per unit transported

sustainable                       in 2011 indesit company drew up a plan to improve the sustainability of its distribution and warehouse
distribution                      management processes through a series of initiatives measures and projects to raise personnel awareness
and warehouse                     of the need for environmentally responsible behaviour and to act directly on the carbon footprint of storage
management                        and distribution of products and spares the plan led to the following action at the cà maiano warehouse


  initiatives at cà maiano

                                                                        the cà maiano spares warehouse pressed on with its green policy in 2012 good
                                                                        ecological behaviour was promoted both by initiatives addressing employees and
                                                                        through investments in energy saving the former initiatives included car sharing
                                                                        the timings of operatives shifts were optimized so that one car could be used for
                                                                        four people living close together sorting of office waste and use of recycled paper
  an unused area of the site was turned into a garden another initiative saved paper a small it investment enabled the warehouse to use only two
  transport documents per delivery instead of three thus saving on printing as well separation of returned parts into recyclable and nonrecyclable
  materials and reuse of packaging master boxes used for loose spares are removed if in good shape folded and sent for reuse as packaging or new
  master boxes were promoted
  heating and lighting were two obvious areas in which to reduce the warehouses carbon footprint people were encouraged to switch off when natural light
  and warmth are sufficient the warehouse was also fitted with twilight sensors to automate the switching on and off of lights
  a major investment is being made in the replacement of the old boiler with a natural gas fired one this conversion will be completed by spring 2013 and will
  deliver substantial savings on heating and be an important step towards reducing the carbon footprint
  new forklifts were introduced to achieve a reduction in emissions of over 10 the warehouse layout was radically redesigned to appreciably reduce
  distances travelled by trucks in the three dimensions horizontal lateral and vertical over half of all orders are managed by an eyelevel warehouse in which
  withdrawal and replenishment involve minimum use of forklifts

smart grids
integrating renewable energy sources rationalizing new infrastructure investments and making grids
more efficient by reducing peaks and increasing resilience are all key objectives that home appliances
can help achieve in a smart grid information on the state of the network can be used by intelligent
reactive devices to help the grid to work better the technologies are already available and standards
are being developed but for this vision to become reality rules are needed to protect consumers and
ensure they are fully free to manage their home appliances and also receive consideration at market
values for the contribution they can make towards grid management for example there should be
discounted tariffs tending to zero cost for energy consumed when supply is high and demand is low
