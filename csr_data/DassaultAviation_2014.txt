12 comments on the 2013 performance in adjusted data

121 preamble
to reflect the actual economic performance of the group and to enable its monitoring and comparability
the dassault aviation group has since 2012 prepared an adjusted income statement the consoli
dated income statement of the group is therefore adjusted
     by neutralizing the amortization of the thales purchase price allocation ppa
             by neutralizing change in fair value of derivative exchange instruments not eligible to hedge
              accounting
as from this year the group incorporates in its financial reporting its share of the thales income based on
the adjusted income of thales the adjusted 2012 statements have been corrected to reflect this change

this change allows the adjustments made by thales in its financial reporting to be taken into account
thereby ensuring consistency in the presentation

pace we were committed to despite some difficul          falcon 50 surmar

shutdown

the minister of defense announced that ultimate

homogeneous fleet of 225 rafale in line with the
conclusions of the white paper which establishes
the principle of a future tranche 5 for our air

                              directors report

in the civil field our main priorities are
   to replenish our backlog by increasing sales
   to continue the development of the falcon 5x
    and complete the assembly of the first aircraft
   to pursue our after sales efforts for falcon
    customers
   to prepare for the future by thinking ahead to
    the future falcon

innovation and cost control while maintaining high
standards of quality are imperative to increase our
sales

pursuing the implementation of new plmerp
processes industrial organization and the devel
opment of strategic sectors the dual nature of our
business should allow us to confront the compa
nys commercial and industrial challenges

the group expects to deliver approximately 70
falcons in 2014 subject to the recovery in the
market of business aviation and 11 rafales
2014 net sales should be higher than in 2013

the board would like to take this opportunity to
thank all dassault employees for the efficiency
and skill they have demonstrated in helping the
company carry through its projects

employee profitsharing corresponds to other longterm benefits and should be evaluated and discounted according to

rate and discount rate we consider that the evaluation method by cost less repayments constitutes a satisfactory
approximation of the profitsharing liability

note 26  contingent liabilities
in late 2002 a group of french manufacturers including dassault aviation was collectively issued with a request for
arbitration from a common client claiming a sum which according to the plaintiff would amount to no less than usd 260
million and for which the group of manufacturers may have joint obligation with regard to the plaintiff this request related
to the execution of old contracts implemented by these manufacturers in the framework of an agreement signed between
the parties in june 2003 the plaintiff withdrew its action in november 2012 the latter gave notification of a new request
for arbitration based on similar grounds to to the 2002 action for a total now amounting to eur 226 million the parties
firmly contest this request and to date it has not been possible to evaluate the possible financial risk consequently
dassault aviation has not established a reserve this procedure is still ongoing

note 27  contingent liabilities
in late 2002 a group of french manufacturers including dassault aviation was collectively issued with a request for
arbitration from a common client claiming a sum which according to the plaintiff would amount to no less than usd 260
million and for which the group of manufacturers may have joint obligation with regard to the plaintiff this request related
to the execution of old contracts implemented by these manufacturers in the framework of an agreement signed between
the parties in june 2003 the plaintiff withdrew its action in november 2012 the latter gave notification of a new request
for arbitration based on similar grounds to to the 2002 action for a total now amounting to eur 226 million the parties
firmly contest this request and to date it has not been possible to evaluate the possible financial risk consequently
dassault aviation has not established a reserve this procedure is still ongoing
