        our aim for the aeon hometown forests program is to have the planted trees grow as much as
        possible like natural forests for that reason our ideal is to entrust growth to natural forces and to
        allow shrubs and tall trees to grow naturally side by side without human interference however since
        the shape and area of the planted areas are limited weeding is necessary in the first five years after
        planting newly established stores carry out annual tree maintenance events in connection with the
        aeon hometown forests program during their first three years weeding and cleaning the planted
        areas with customers from fiscal 2014 weeds and refuse in the planted areas are being removed as
        part of the clean and green activities p 47 conducted on the 11th day of every month this practice
        was instituted on june 11 2014 at aeon stores across japan with aeon people neighborhood

     towards development of overseas auditors                                     common practice for our japan headquarters staff to train
     and positive evaluation systems                                              auditors abroad however we now have a system of excellent

   supplier management levels have been improving since the                       different districts training time can be reduced in this way in
   institution of the auditing system more than 10 years ago in                  fy 2010 there were 10 trained overseas local auditors and in
   order to give support to the coc taking firmer hold in the                     fy 2013 that number increased to 18 in addition it is possible
   manufacturing processes of evaluated suppliers we plan in                     to have daytoday feedback centering around the training
   2014 to promote a system whereby suppliers can achieve                         leader increasing the level of coc compliance as a team

      we ask management members to          fire extinguishers and equipment and                                to make sure that these facilities
      attend meetings along with staff     conditions such as light and noise are                               can be responsive to emergencies

                                            for example fire extinguishers are
                                            meaningless if employees do not
                                            know how to use them equipment
                                            is useful and effective only when
                                            people are trained in all aspects of
                                            using the equipment the goal of coc
                                            is for everyone from employees to
                                            management to be able to understand

      c         lose up fy 2013 accomplishments

 good management was established and factories doing firstparty audits increased however some inappropriate conditions
 were detected in factories doing new business
 stringent firefighting equipment inspections
 we strengthened our checks on firefighting equipment in fy 2013 in the wake of the garment
 factory fire and building collapse accidents in bangladesh in 2012 and 2013 and severely
 checked for deficiencies in the condition of fire extinguishers and fire hydrants emergency
 lights and equipment in overseas twoparty audits 91 deficiencies related to fire and disaster
 prevention were pointed out and we worked on immediate improvement regardless of the
 size of potential risk in addition we received reports that measures to continue and maintain
                                                                                                          pointing out the need for a fire extinguisher
 improvements were in place in factories where progress is slow the person in charge of                 during a manufacturing plant work
 overseas sites makes site visits to promote improvement                                                 environment check

 measures to prevent child labor abuses
 in a thirdparty audit at a factory in china an employees identity card showed 16 years of age at the time of hiring in accordance
 with the chinese labor law the date of birth on the identity card however was not correct it was concluded that it was not a
 violation since the household registration data showed the employee had reached 16 years of age with confirmation at time of
 employment being insufficient there is a risk of child labor policy infraction so it is necessary to scrutinize and assure that the id
 cards are correct

 response to child labor violations
 dismissal alone is not a solution to child labor violations considering the background of child labor dismissal would cause families to risk losing
 their livelihood aeon is organizing a program along with suppliers to help support children and their families in the case that an underage child
 is found working the system will provide for the child to go to school using funds earned to support the child and family and a promise to re
 hire the child when legal age is reached through implementation of such a plan we hope also to raise awareness and prevent recurrence of
 child labor violations




voice
 voice the objective of the coc audit is to create mechanisms
 for continued growth not to produce documentation
 a feature of the aeon supplier coc is that instead of making immediate compliance a condition the system works to
 solve problems together with suppliers and to lead to supplier capacity building for example the audit does require
 written organization charts management statements statements of policies and regulations but more important
 than these is the initiative to devise mechanisms on site to implement management further great importance is
 placed on conferring with the factory manager or person responsible in instances of noncompliance found during a
 twoparty audit on the spot discussion about what is deficient and how it can be improved allows for value sharing         noriko kimura

       increasing visibility of distribution operations                                              carbon offset initiatives

   one of aeons kpi is co2 emissions per case during shipment                                  carbon offsetting refers to the process of purchasing credits
   from distribution center to store we are striving to reduce                                 generated by co2 reduction activities at a separate location to
   emissions by better grasping the amount of co2 used during                                    offset part or the entire amount of greenhouse gas emissions
   distribution through visualization                                                           that really cannot be reduced

wastewater management
wastewater discharged from aeon stores rarely if ever contains
hazardous substances sometimes however this wastewater may
contain large amounts of oils which can exceed legal limits or
clog up wastewater pipes leading to a leakage or other accident
as a result aeon conducts training for its employees and the
employees of its tenants to ensure day to day maintenance is
correctly performed including compliance with cleaning rules
for grease traps we have also included grease trap monitoring as
part of the required hygiene checks for our stores and adopted a
system where thirdparties regularly perform these checks
    furthermore aeon retail co ltd and several other aeon
group companies perform water quality testing concurrently
that includes sewerage as part of annual voluntary inspections
stores where problems are identified are required to take
corrective actions which helps to improve our overall wastewater
management practices we have set voluntary standards that are
set 5 below legal requirements and take immediate action if
any values exceed these standards during voluntary inspections

   reexamining the groups activities overall which showed me that csr                            its stores to msccertified products above and beyond fresh seafood
   is comprehensively and strategically built into aeons operations with                         i hope aeon considers adopting msc and asc products for canned
   over 10 years of actual implementation backing up their policies as a                          goods and for prepared lunches in its convenience stores at the same
   customer who shops at aeon stores i can directly attest to this fact for                      time from the perspective of conserving biodiversity forest resources
   this independent review i would like to comment on two distinctive                             must also be included over and above the sale of fsccertified paper
   initiatives from the four key issues that aeon has announced                                   products i am hopeful for fsccertified lumber to be utilized when
           first with regard to the realization of a lowcarbon society                        rolling out new convenience stores i expect this to be an opportunity
   aeon has announced an ambitious goal of reducing energy usage                                  for aeon to communicate to consumers the importance of conserving
   per unit area of floor space in stores to approximately half of 2010                           biodiversity while simultaneously ensuring the sustainability of the
   levels by 2020 one means of doing so is their acquisition of the energy                        groups supply chain
   management standard iso 50001 looking at aeons results up to fiscal                                 supply chain management is however thoroughly considered
   2013 the group is ahead of its own goals which demonstrates the                               throughout the aeon groups four key issues at present aeon supplier
   seriousness of their intent in addition aeons mall business is actively                      code of conduct agreements with approximately 900 business partners
   rolling out eco stores committing to ecoconscious changes at malls                            appear to be a driver of growth for more products carrying msc asc
   is a very socially significant action over and above its significance as an                    fsc and fairtrade certifications
   action for reducing the environmental impacts of the group given the                                   ethical consumption is rapidly spreading specifically among the
   strong draw that malls have on customers eco stores can powerfully                             younger demographic rather than only selling individual organic msc
   lead the community in environmentallyfriendly actions and can affect                           ecoproducts etc is not now the time to present the new framework
   the consciousness and lifestyles of customers who visit the stores                             of ethical consumption to consumers this offers the possible transition
   four malls smart aeon opened in 2013 and i am interested in seeing                           beyond just food products and into apparel such as organic cotton
   aeons plans going forward does the group have a target for the                                as well as accessories bags and other items from the perspective
   number of stores it wants to open by 2020 if no store target has been                          of educating consumers i would like to encourage aeon to consider
   set is there a target floor space ratio for their ecofriendly changes                        providing information on ethical consumption
   a concrete numerical target is easy for stakeholders to understand                                    with regard to the activity of female employees the group has
   and should prove to be motivational for activities inside the group in                         announced an ambitious 2020 target that surpasses abenomics with
   addition global warming is at a level that cannot be forestalled by low                       a 50 ratio of female managers however there are more than a few
   carbon efforts such that social infrastructure is now being damaged by                         areas in asia that already have large numbers of female managers
   abnormal weather phenomena such as atypical rainfall tornados etc i                          when i am shopping i feel more of an affinity toward stores run by
   believe that adaptive countermeasures such as strengthening region                             women furthermore a society where women are able to work and
   wide disaster prevention will be necessary in order to minimize damage                          raise children with peace of mind is also a preferable society for men
   from abnormal weather phenomena caused by climate change                                       children and the elderly
          with regard to conservation of biodiversity socalled social                                  i feel that aeons corporate culture overall is one with lofty
   contribution programs such as conserving the medaka japanese                                   mediumto longterm goals and one where promises are fulfilled at
   killifish and other scarce species are popular however the aeon                              the same time some of the current plans and targets remain abstract
   groups initiatives stand out because the group is proactively                                  in areas and include numerical statements that are difficult to grasp
   developing and marketing products that contribute to conserving                                 i encourage aeon to standardize and unify the expressions used in its
   biodiversity while the group is actively devoting effort to sustainable                        objectives while carrying out its social duty as a leading asian retailer i
   seafood a topic beginning to garner attention recently focus is                               am hopeful that aeon will aim for further development as a corporation
   increasingly turning to catch limits on freshwater eel and pacific bluefin                      by contributing to building a sustainable society
