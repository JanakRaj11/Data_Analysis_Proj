   road to value creation
    review of cy2015 and the mediumterm management plan


   changes in the business environment driven by globalization and digitalization are forcing big
   changes in the advertising industry and its business model these circumstances and the acquisition
   of aegis group plc currently dentsu aegis network ltd in march 2013 have enabled the dentsu
   group to evolve into a truly global network we thus took the opportunity to formulate a medium
   term management plan dentsu 2017 and beyond that is to run from fy2013 to fy2017
       in recent years given the numerous technological advances and changing consumer behavior it
   has become difficult for many companies to achieve satisfactory results from marketing activities in
   the absence of coordinated initiatives our mediumterm management plan is designed to evolve
   into a worldclass global network contributing to raising corporate value for all clients accordingly
   we see the promotion of our plan as leading to value creation
       the following summarizes the mediumterm management plans progress and achievements
   by fiscal 2015 yearend which marked the plans halfway point we also consider the groups future
   outlook

   up 43 year on year with organic growth up 39 year on year since the establishment of dentsu

   hike in organic growth that resulted from overseas business significantly outperformed market growth
   underpinned by the strong business momentum in europe the middle east and africa meanwhile
   in the asia pacific region excluding japan we recorded a profit of 1175 billion a 235 yearonyear
   surge that included an 114 rise in organic growth
        in the americas the organic growth rate rose 49 year on year slightly less than the market
   growth rate this was the result of among other things the renewal of largeaccount contracts

steady progress in diversifying the portfolio
the goal of the dentsu group is to evolve into a truly global network at the forefront of marketing
convergenceone of our strategic objectives toward this goal is diversifying the portfolio on a
global basis
     our success to date in achieving this objective can be measured by the fact that we now operate
in around 140 countries from just 27 in 2005 and employ over 47000 people globally from 14500 in
2005 in addition we now have a diversified geographic revenue profile with 46 of our gross profit
for the fiscal 2015 generated in japan 20 in emea 18 in the americas and 16 in apac
     as shown above we are making steady progress in diversifying the portfolio however given the
fastmoving nature of our industry we need to continuously drive toward this strategic ambition

capability expansion in the digital domain
in the global advertising market digital media is continuously growing for 10 key marketsincluding
the uk ireland canada and australiadigital has already become the principal media channel
for advertising expenditures driven by the high demand for mobile and online video advertising
especially across social media platforms and the rise of programmatic buying
     under such circumstances the dentsu aegis network is expanding its digital capability portfolio
through acquisitions and by continuing to invest internally in hiring digital talent and supplementing
our product suite with cuttingedge digital tools
     in japan we established a new company dentsu digital inc which provides a total package for
clients across digital channels and platforms dentsu digital collaborates with other key business units
to ensure our clients have access to the full suite of dentsu capabilities

integration of newly acquired capabilities
according to carats latest forecasts for the industry outlook published in september 2016 global
advertising expenditure is expected to grow by 44 in 2016 this growth is primarily driven by the
continued solid growth of digital media 156 with its share of adspend expected to be 277
in 2016 on the other hand television is expected to remain resilient with a steady 411 market
share forecast for 2016 as the upcoming olympic games and us elections are expected to drive
considerable viewership
    importantly advertisers continue to place significant emphasis on the integration of their marketing
plans across these media platforms while continuing to invest in our digital capabilities we will also
integrate the newly acquired capabilities and skills into the services and operating model of the
dentsu group furthermore we will enhance our global infrastructure by strengthening partnerships
with global media owners with an emphasis on mobilecentric datarich and videofirst

                corporate governance




change of governance structure
dentsu inc changed from being a company with an audit  supervisory board to being one with an
audit and supervisory committee at the end of the ordinary general meeting of shareholders in
march 2016
    even though dentsu had been well organized under its previous configuration with an audit
 supervisory board the change in corporate governance structure was in response to the
implementation of the corporate governance code by the tokyo stock exchange on june 1 2015
it was also decided that we would voluntarily change the composition of the board of directors
so that at least onethird of the members would be independent outside directors to enhance our
auditing and monitoring functionsand set up an audit and supervisory committee
    the main role of the board of directors from then on would be the supervision of business execution
to enable expeditious decisionmaking and effective business execution by individuals in an executive
position with this change the dentsu group aims to improve the soundness and transparency of
management and the speed of decisionmaking in order to further increase corporate value




                                       implementation of new corporate
                                       governance structure
                                       in 2016 the corporate community in japan has seen a continuation of the corporate governance
                                       reforms that started in the previous year the degree to which the revised companies act and
                                       the corporate governance codeimplemented in may and june of 2015 respectivelyhave
                                       had an effect on the conduct of business here is currently being put to the test
                                            meanwhile besides the governance reform dentsu has implemented innovative changes
    toshiaki hasegawa                 it has changed its closing date for accounting from the end of march to the end of december
    lawyer                             adopted international financial reporting standards and changed its governance structure to
    dentsu inc                       reflect the amendment to the companies act the changes have been made to strengthen the
    director                           internal controls and governance of the entire group
    member of the audit and                 for my part i resigned from the office of auditor and was appointed an outside director
    supervisory committee outside
                                       and a member of the audit and supervisory committee at the ordinary general meeting of
    representative of thasegawa 
    co law offices                   shareholders on march 30 2016 some people may view this merely as a change in job title
                                       with the degree of responsibility remaining much the same however from the perspective of
                                       governance enhancement significant progress has been made
                                            since a member of the audit and supervisory committee is also a director i will participate
                                       in and exercise voting rights for resolutions at board of directors meetings while articulating
                                       my position on the pros and cons of management decisions i am also responsible for the
                                       legality of board of directors activities although establishing the auditing committee complies
                                       with global standards the management and supervisory system of a company with an audit 
                                       supervisory board was so unusual in japan that people outside the country found it confusing
                                            i believe that through the above drastic reforms the dentsu group has created a
                                       governance structure suitable for a truly global company

dentsu group internal controls


we believe that the dentsu group internal control system encourages compliance among directors
executive officers and employees while at the same time supporting continuous corporate
development as dentsu meets its social responsibilities the company has established the dentsu
group code of conduct to ensure that the execution of duties by directors executive officers and
employees of the company and its subsidiaries conform to laws and regulations and that business is
conducted appropriately the code is the foundation on which the internal control system rests
    based on the code the company familiarizes all employees with the relevant business
procedures through regulations manuals and training check items relating to risk management
and compliance have been created and inspections are carried out from various perspectives
allowing problems to be discovered and improvements to be developed
    a similar internal control structure is being applied in group companies to maintain and
improve the corporate value of the entire group

risk management
to ensure the comprehensive management of the entire groups risks the members of the csr
committee chaired by the director and an executive officer are drawn from the group the csr
committee monitors the groups risk management efforts and manages the plandocheckact pdca
cycle this ensures that policies and the risk management process are developed implemented
monitored and improved in the interests of enabling enhancement to be continuous
    dentsu sets up rules for the management of risk in order to maintain and improve a structure that
prevents the occurrence of risks and precludes the spread of damage or loss while minimizing the
impact of risk progression should risks materialize
    the company prioritizes key risks and formulates concrete measures that can be employed
should a response be required
    a department is assigned to be responsible for each key risk these departments develop and
implement the requisite measures to reduce risks compile midterm progress reports yearend self
assessments and guidelines for the succeeding year and report to the csr committee
    key risks and potential risks thought likely to eventuate over the medium to long term are
reported by the csr committee to the executive management committee after confirming the
status of any riskwhether it can be avoided reduced transferred or retainedthe csr committee
develops and reviews response measures
    to prioritize key risks the dentsu group conducts quantitative and qualitative analyses using a risk

dentsu groups consolidated performance for 2015 calendaryear basis showed significantly robust
growth with revenue increasing 128 yearonyear and underlying operating profit increasing 203
however in terms of future forecast a variety of risks exist including geopolitical issues and business
model innovations
    under such circumstances it is difficult for many companies to grow and continuously increase
corporate value solely by pursuing financial performance the corporate governance code for
which implementation began in june 2015 in japan promotes innovation aiming at medium to
longterm growth of the company through a constructive dialogue with stakeholders the code
places importance on the esg environmental social governance perspective above all and seeks
corporate value creation in the nonfinancial area in addition the institutional investors both within
and outside of japan also place importance on the principles for responsible investment pri and
over 1500 investors have already signed on to the pri globally
    in order to properly respond to such momentum in december 2015 the group formulated the
dentsu group mediumterm csr strategy 2020 setting targets to be achieved by 2020 the plan
aims to increase the corporate value from the esg perspective and highlights the four key domains
environmental conservation community supply chain and responsible marketing and sustainable
consumption
    the company is a public institution of society and it cannot achieve sustainable growth without
substantive collaboration with various stakeholders to that end the company will continuously strive
to achieve the following initiatives
     provide responsible marketing communication services to enable our clients to build better
      relationships with stakeholders through business activities
     engage in a wide range of csr activities in collaboration with our business partners within the
      supply chain
     support all employees of the dentsu group to act as professionals with high aspirations and
      energy by further promoting a worklife balance

we believe these initiatives among others help ensure our sustainability as a member of society
separate and aside from the pursuit of financial sustainability we will improve all esg values in
conjunction with our business activities to further enhance the corporate value of the dentsu group
and pursue the realization of a better society

dentsu group mediumterm csr strategy 2020
dentsu has formulated a fiveyear dentsu group mediumterm csr strategy 2020 setting targets to
be achieved by 2020 according to the dentsu group code of conduct based on the mediumterm
csr strategystipulating the four key areas and common goalthe group will continue contributing
to the realization of a sustainable society by steadily promoting csr activities worldwide

csr planning realizing a sustainable society
nations around the world face a number of social issues including those that are environmentrelated
such as global warming as well as human rights violations that are found in some countries and regions
many of the issues are the result of corporate activities since the increased social expectations and
demands are causing companies to focus on a variety of activities to fulfill their responsibilities the
advertising industry being no exception we have persevered in our effort to manage the impact on
the environment and society
    however the role that should be played by the advertising industry is far greater than we had
anticipated that said we have a significant impact on consumer behavior as it relates to the buying
of such goods as daily consumer items and extends to onceinalifetime major purchases while
being aware of the magnitude of the impact that advertising has on consumption we also should
remain aware of our responsibilities in terms of the fairness of the content and of goods and services
that consumers purchase when it comes to environmental and social impact we believe advertising
companies should bear in mind both direct and indirect impact
    based on the above considerations we developed a plan that defines the common goal of
the dentsu group the planinvolving the collection of data regarding the groups resources and
knowledge in japan and overseas will be steadily executed with a view to realizing a sustainable
society and promoting the integration of business activities and sustainability approaches

     communication



human rights promotion system

rights education at the company and for human rights education managers at group companies in

based on both employee hierarchy and occupational field
    there are also various opportunities to raise awareness of human rights textbooks with
information on human rights and explanations of their connection to advertising are distributed
to employees when they join the company the human rights college a site that collects past
examples of advertising expressions related to human rights is posted on the companys intranet
further a newsletter dealing with timely human rightsrelated topics is distributed within the group

    in the area of advertising and human rights the group has a permanent consulting contact to
ensure that expressions communicated to the world are appropriate and to respond to groupwide
inquiries

internal reporting to protect human rights
we established a contact desk that responds to inquiries from group
employees and allows the identification of possible human rightsrelated risks
associated with the right of expression in advertising during fiscal 2015 the
desk received 63 inquiries these were handled individually in a bid both to
prevent any recurrence of the issues and to increase human rights awareness

counseling section which has contact points at dentsu branches as well
as outside the company and provides consultation services the section
coordinates with harassment contacts at each group company in a bid to
prevent harassment across the group

harassment at dentsu offices we have issued an educational book entitled
stop harassment we also hold training sessions tailored to target
audiences including new employees and new managers and post messages
on bulletin boards calling attention to the companys antiharassment policy                                   site screen of the human rights college

 promotion of worklife balance

the dentsu groups approach
it is essential that we maximize and harness all our employees capabilities if we are to realize a
sustainable society since we consider people to be our greatest asset we believe it to be vital that
there be an environment in which employees can maintain high morale and motivation while doing
their work enthusiastically to this end dentsu implements measures guaranteeing that capabilities
are developed a worklife balance is achieved and health and safetyrelated structures are in place

development of human resources
recognizing that human resources are its greatest asset the group provides employees with
appropriate capabilitydeveloping opportunities and supports employee selfdevelopment in line
with each individuals career and the organizations goals


  human resources development policy
  1 new employees undergo training to acquire mindaction and knowledgeskills capabilities
  2 staff members are encouraged to develop solutionrelated expertise so that they become able to play a
     central role in their work sections
  3 leadership and managerial skills training is geared to more senior employees



besides training programs and in response to changes in the area of advertising and communications
the group conducts human resource development programs including those to develop digital
foreignlanguage and crosscultural communication ability thus for instance we have the new
school personnel development program for highlevel directors which was launched in 2011 through
a repeated cycle of assignments and feedback the program taught by toplevel inhouse lecturers
ensures that a leadership model is passed down
    moreover because accurate and sophisticated leadership is required in new areas other than
advertising some sessions are taught by noncompany people who are active in fields such as art
technology and digital curation
    we also have the dentsu management institute dmi geared to strengthening the groups
management capabilities and developing human resources that can provide advanced solutions for
management issues and the business challenges of various stakeholders including clients and media

the revised ecofirst commitment promised that the dentsu head office building would release
21 less co2 than its average emission for fy20032004 and that 90 of its waste would be
recycled by fiscal 2015 in fact in fy2015 the head office released 285 less co2 while the waste
recycling rate was 894 we still play a leading role in the industry and continue to practice our
environmental approach

raising awareness
environmental education
dentsu provides employees with a broad range of environmental knowledge so that they might play
a leading role in addressing environmental issues as an example dentsu encourages its employees
to take the certification test for environmental specialists sponsored by the tokyo chamber of
commerce and industry employees who acquire the certification are appointed as eco officers to
promote dentsus environmental activities
     these employees also contribute to the promotion of the dentsu group eco program by acting as
inspectors when internal environmental audits are required and as judges of environmental slogans
in fiscal 2015 the certification was awarded to 89 employees

awarenessraising using handbooks
dentsu creates handbooks as part of its awarenessraising activities for employees and uses them for
new employee training and other purposes
    for example the term greenwash is used in reference to labels and advertising that use
unsubstantiated information or partial data to give the impression that products or corporate
activities are more environmentally friendly than they actually are this practice is under scrutiny
by corporations and npos dentsu uses the greenwash guide in order to eliminate the risk of
greenwashing in advertising communications and to enhance employee knowledge based on the
guidelines on greenwash in europe and the initiatives of leading overseas companies dentsu revised
the greenwash guide and strives to raise awareness of the group companies in japan and overseas
from a global perspective
    dentsu defines a green event as an event that is an environmentally friendly one and the green
event guide is used for organizing such events the guide describes how to organize green events
from the viewpoint of a pdca cycle in line with the flow of event management from the planning
stage to implementation and postevent evaluation the guide includes case studies that are useful in
putting these instructions into practice

                                     innovative and creative value to our team on top of that these agencies have been some of the fastest growing in
                                     our network doubling in size yearonyear keeping this newly built ship steady and on course means developing

                                     collaboration in the agency itself and is a springboard for innovation showcasing the power of what digital and

    chief digital officer amplifi
                                     in 2015 i joined the global csr steering group making a contribution alongside functional and brand colleagues
                                     to the oversight of the csr team and csr strategy i was so impressed to get a view of everything that is going
                                     on around our network and most importantly the hard work behind the scenes by many volunteers to make sure
                                     we actually deliver real impact on the ground i had the pleasure to help develop our new fiveyear csr strategy
                                     launched in 2016 with some ambitious goals until 2020 we can really build on some of the success of future proof
                                     over the last five years and take a leadership role in our industry
                                     what are you proud of last year
                                     thats a really personal story for me 2015 will stand out in history as the year of the refugee rather than a far
                                     frommy bed show it came close to home for many of us working and living in europe i spearheaded our efforts
                                     to make a small contribution when we had our annual leadership agency conference in hungary in 2015 i asked
                                     everyone to bring an extra suitcase of winter clothing for a charity that helps refugees that had entered the country
                                     many of our media partners contributed too and together we released an enormous amount of clothing that
                                     helped more than 1000 refugees locally my little contribution to the bigger picture




                                     why is it important that we give back and engage around corporate social responsibility csr as

                                     first and foremost i believe that csr builds a really strong culture of engagement in our agency our success
                                     depends on our ability to attract and retain the best talent in our industry and make sure that they grow as
                                     individuals whilst they are with us csr is a key part of our value proposition and it contributes strongly to the
                                     culture of responsibility ambition and collaboration that we have it also helps bring our values alive off the

                                     and inspire them to envisage a better future thats what we as agencies can do share our skills and reach as many
                                     people as possible to inspire them
                                     what are you proud of last year
                                     alongisde the nowlabs rural coding initiative i am proud of launching our new csr strategy in south africa which
                                     has been realigned closely with the needs of all the stakeholders we are focusing very strongly on local impact
                                     adopting local schools in cape town and johannesburg and working with them to identify and address the key
                                     issues they are facing this new twoyear partnership spearheaded by bongiwe mhkize is much more focused on
                                     longerterm impact and responsive to the local needs that is what csr should ultimately be about not what is the

functional integration story germany going 100 green
everyone is affected by climate changewhether personally or as a business
with a demand of more than 13 million kwh per year dentsu aegis network in
germany could make a big difference we already reduced our consumption
by 20 since 2010 but in 2015 we aimed to switch all our offices in germany
to 100 green electricity by bundling our entire consumption together we
had a strong bargaining position even though we switched from cheap
nuclear electricity to 100 renewable energy we managed to still reduce the
total costs of germanys electricity consumption by 100000 euros this means
germany is now 100 green since january 1 2016




                                    why is it important that we give back and engage around corporate social responsibility csr as
                                    a leading global agency
                                    in my role i have to find the balance between our finite resources our ambitious growth strategy and the demands
                                    of our people and clients csr plays a key role in doing this successfully taking action on our environmental
                                    performance reduces our financial burden and makes us more resilient for the inevitable impacts of resource scarcity
                                    and price fluctuations in the future it also helps us make a stronger case in the pitch to our clients and people we
                                    are an agency that thinks much beyond own four walls of create wider social and environmental benefits
                                    what do you want people to know about your involvement with future proof
                                    i think its important to show people that csr is not only for communications hr or brand people functional
    daniel ahrens                   leaders in finance and technology can also get involved and actually make a huge contribution it may not involve
                                    everyone in the office like volunteering or pro bono work does but it makes a huge impact whether it is better

                                    to do and why i take a leadership role without these people and their passion we would not go half as fast on our

                                    what are you proud of last year
                                    together with the future proof team here in germany we really wanted to make a giant leap forward when it came
                                    to our environmental performance and show our leadership in our network we were thinking how can we have
                                    the biggest impact on our environmental performance and we realized that if in some way we could run without
                                    any energy consumption we would really be the greenest in the network thats how we started an energy audit
                                    and tender to find ways to save in the end we consolidated all energy consumption with one supplier saving us
                                    100000 euros whilet also switching us to 100 certified green electricity we are now the first country in dentsu

there are no intangible assets whose title is restricted or pledged as security for liabilities
  amortization is recorded in the consolidated statement of income as cost and selling general and administrative expenses


2 significant goodwill and intangible assets
the significant portion of goodwill as of march 31 2015 and december 31 2015 arose from the international business segment which forms a cash generating
unit and amounted to 656552 million and 656590 million 5444 million as of march 31 2015 and december 31 2015 respectively
  significant intangible assets other than goodwill as of march 31 2015 and december 31 2015 consist of customer relationships in the international business
segment which amounted to 196867 million and 181929 million 1508 million as of march 31 2015 and december 31 2015 respectively


3 impairment testing of goodwill
recoverable amounts of the international business segment to which significant goodwill was allocated are determined by the value in use based on the
financial budget for the next fiscal year approved by management and the management forecast for the subsequent four years the continuing growth rate
of 3432 as of march 31 2015  is set for cash flows beyond the fouryear period
  the pretax discount rates used for determining value in use are 89 and 81 as of march 31 2015 and december 31 2015 respectively
  for the goodwill above the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit sufficiently exceeds its carrying amount therefore it is unlikely that the recov
erable amount of the cashgenerating unit will fall below the carrying amount even with reasonable changes in the key assumptions


4 impairment losses
intangible assets are grouped by the smallest cashgenerating unit that generates cash inflows that are largely independent according to each reportable segment
  the group recognized impairment losses of 744 million and 2482 million 21 million for the year ended march 31 2015 and for the nine months ended
december 31 2015 respectively in the consolidated statement of income as other expenses
  impairment losses for the year ended march 31 2015 represent the losses incurred to reduce the carrying amounts of software and other intangible assets

uncertainty in the plan asset management on plan assets financing such as the possibility of fund shortages and tolerable levels of uncertainty in the rates of
return on plan assets are adequately reviewed

referred to as policy asset allocation selecting an asset manager and monitoring asset allocation after setting forecasts of expected rates of returns on
appropriate assets for investment

    level 2 fair value that is measured using the observable price other than categorized in level 1 directly or indirectly
    level 3 fair value that is measured based on unobservable inputs
  when multiple inputs are used to measure fair value fair value levels are determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the entire fair
value measurement
  transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the beginning of each quarter
  there are no transfers between level 1 and level 2 for the year ended march 31 2015 and for the nine months ended december 31 2015
