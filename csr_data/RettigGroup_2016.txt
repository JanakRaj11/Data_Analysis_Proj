                   our values define our way of conduct our mission sets our
                   purpose our strategy aims for value growth supported by
                         risk diversification and a strong balance sheet




      an open mindset is essential for interactive    fairness is the rettig approach to handling both
   teamwork and sharing information with free flow   internal and external relationships it is also our
        of information we create an atmosphere         attitude when meeting challenges and solving
       conducive to understanding our business        problems solutions that are perceived as fair by
      operations at all levels in the organisation       all parties become permanent solutions




      modesty is the principle applied by rettig in     trust and respect are the most fundamental
       listening to and understanding divergent       elements of our interaction and communication
     views and opinions the opposite of modesty       with different stakeholders without trust and
         is arrogance a modest organisation is         respect people feel neither empowered nor
                sensitive to early signals                       prepared to take charge

   massimo tinazzi runs one of emmetis installers
   termoidraulica mv di tinazzi massimo based in
   fontanelle in the province of treviso in italy as
   a very dedicated installer he proudly presents
   his own highly energyefficient home which has
   an a efficiency rating
       thanks to excellent insulation and efficient
   heatstorage solutions the energy generated by
   the electric pv panels is greater than that required
   within the home so the excess energy can be
   sold back to the energy distributor as a result
   running costs are zero  an excellent return on
   investment
       the products installed in this highly efficient
   home include the mirai smi inverter heat pump
   which can supply heating and cooling systems
   for summer and winter comfort this is one of
   the most efficient a rated airwater heat
   pumps on the market the house also benefits
   from the emmeti underfloor system with pipes
   and manifolds produced in emmetis factories
   and supported by insulation panels that have
   been designed inhouse the solar pv panels are
   emmeti sun polycrystalline modules exclusively
   assembled in italy
       one of the key features of the house is the
   febos hp system this software designed ex
   clusively by emmeti increases the energy output
   during periods of high availability and stores it in
   concrete flooring for use at a later date with no
   emissions no gas consumption and no mainte

newest solution consists of granules made of
hydrated lime that are used in packed bed filters
designed for landbased combustion units this
technology is used worldwide and it has recent
ly been modified to enable fluegas desulphuri
sation onboard ships which as of january 2015
need to comply with the strict sulphur limits for
fuel used in seca sulphur emission control
areas the sulphur emissions are absorbed by
the granules provided by nordkalk nordkalks
turnkey solution also includes collection of the
used granules which can be reused in applica
tions such as agriculture or in the construction
industry the solution is based on a closedloop
process which causes no emissions to water or
waste to be disposed of
    two dnvcertified dry scrubbers using nord
kalks granules have been installed onboard the
german shipping company rörd brarens vessels
which ship the pulp of one of the worlds largest

the hydrated lime granules will also be introduced
to water treatment applications
