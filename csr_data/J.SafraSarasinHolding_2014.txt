    the successful completion of the merger of bank sarasin  co
    ltd and bank j safra switzerland ltd
          the name j safra sarasin combines the successful pri
    vate banking heritages of safra and sarasin the two logos on
    either side of the name signify both the integration of safra and
    s arasin and the substantive banking strengths that the busi
     ness combination provides the group and our clients the tag
     line s ustainable swiss private banking since 1841 demon
     strates our swiss roots and the groups continued commitment
     and unique expertise in the area of sustainable investments
          switzerland remains the best country from which to operate
     a global private bank its qualities include a stable political
     p rocess a reliable legal system low government debt a strong
      currency and firstclass expertise in managing private and
      institutional wealth
          it is also a country with a strong reputation for building
       bridges both in the engineering sense and as a connector
       between different cultures and organisations globally we have
       chosen the theme of bridges in this report to illustrate how the
       groups history since the mid19 th century has been one of build
       ing connections across generations with clients and between
       the worlds major trading and financial centres

       tive approach in their choice of where to entrust their wealth

       which means j safra sarasin is one of the best capitalised pri
       vate banks in switzerland as a private entity we can take a
       longterm perspective and reinvest into equity capital which ulti
       mately secures the stability of the group and protects the assets
       of our clients
          i am personally delighted that we have been able to put these
       two great private banking heritages together into a single group
       which has the scale and strength to meet the needs of our clients
       for future generations
          every bank is like a child  you have to nurture it so it is able
       to grow and thrive

market climate


            the market environment should remain favourable in the midterm
            as the global economy continues to normalise after recovering
            from the last big financial crisis the gradual improvement in
            investors risk appetite creates attractive opportunities for
            sustainable asset management




            2013 was a golden year for investors the main reason for stock
            markets performing better than expected was the absence of any
            major negative surprises or crises the low interestrate policy
            adopted by central banks continued to provide support for the
            economy in the process fuelling a quest for investment returns
            and higher valuations on equity markets in 2013 investors grow
            ing risk appetite led to substantial flows of money into equity
            investments for the first time in many years while corporate
            bonds held up relatively well and benefited from a falling credit
            risk premium commodity investments suffered from the falter
            ing pace of growth in emerging markets rising interest rates
            in 2013 also eroded the value of longerdated safe government
            bonds

            macroeconomic and political environment in 2013
            the biggest concern at the start of 2013 was the looming fiscal
            cliff in the usa in the opening days of the year the us adminis
            tration approved a series of tough austerity measures and finan
            cial markets feared that future spending cuts would push the
            us economy over the edge of the cliff these fears turned out
            to be unfounded however a strong recovery in the housing and
            employment markets more than offset the tighter fiscal policy
            and even helped the us economy pick up significant momentum
            towards the end of the year
                given the pressure of the impending fiscal cliff no one believed
            at the start of the year that the us fed would start to wind down
            its asset purchasing programme qe3 any time soon the sur
            prise was therefore even greater in may 2013 when the chairman
            of the us fed ben bernanke announced a process of tapering
            i e the staged reduction of bond purchases through the entire
            second half of the year financial markets were preoccupied with
            discussions about when in what form and with what frequency
            this gradual withdrawal of stimulus would take place however
            the us fed held off until december before making a move while
