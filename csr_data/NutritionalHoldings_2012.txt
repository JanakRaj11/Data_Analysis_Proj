 financial highlights

the groups attributable earnings increased from r4542 million to r4731 million the headline earnings however decreased from a profit
of r1581 million to a loss of r4578 million this differential in headline earnings was as a result of the ifrs requirements relating to the
recognition of deferred tax assets on estimated tax losses which were recognised for the first time during 2011 this increased headline
earnings last year

turnover decreased by 12 to r41 million from the previous period as a result of cash flow constraints in the first half of the year and a lack of
inventory the cash inflow from certain of the shareholders in the latter part of the year together with managements turnaround programme
will assist the company to regain lost market share

the groups gross profit percentage however increased by 22 to 487 from 465 as a result of managing of issues relating to price and
margins

 chairmans report

introduction and overview
the groups performance in the past year was disappointing in march 2011 financial support was negotiated with certain of the shareholders
in the form of a subscription for four hundred million shares however there was a long delay caused by implementation of the new companies
act and all the new requirements necessary and the inflow of the funds only materialised in the latter half of the calendar year
new management was put in place during the year and they were tasked with the implementation of a turnaround programme these strategies
and resultant changes created their own challenges but i am confident that the group is heading on the right path and that the changes will
assist the group to grow from strength to strength
management has been tasked with turning nutritional holdings historical business into a profitable situation there are numerous challenges
including the fact that the typical historical contracts have been lost due to the bee status of the company this is something that is being
addressed and will assist in the future
the imuniti nutritional supplement combo pack was expected to commercialise fully last year however this did not happen although orders
have been received and successfully produced the customer has been delayed with slow progress being made on the final trials and funding
it appears that there has been progress here with orders increasing currently
management has been addressing ways to improve its routes to market with overhead and production costs under constant review strong
corporate governance and restoring the corporate image of the group is also high on the agenda
with the south african governments initiatives to promote job creation through manufacturing nutritional holdings intends to play its role
which will benefit the shareholders
the results of the past year should therefore not be repeated in the coming financial year
sustainability
we understand the need to ensure longterm sustainability for the group which will be achieved through a return to profitability
we have endeavoured to identify the risks associated with this stage of nutritional holdings business cycle and to ensure that management
has mitigated risk as best as practical under the circumstances
expansion of our activities will be done cautiously until we have established a platform of sustainable profitability and a strong financial base
shareholders are cautioned that until we have reached this stage the group is unlikely to pay dividends
corporate governance
the recommendations and requirements of the king iii report on corporate governance and the regulations of the jse form an integral part of
the corporate governance framework within which nutritional holdings operates
appreciation
i would like to thank all our business partners for their support during the year and i remain grateful for the support of the board shareholders
customers suppliers staff and other stakeholders of the nutritional holdings group

 chief executive officers report

introduction
as a result of the delay caused by the new companies act requirements the funding that was negotiated from certain of the shareholders in
march 2011 only materialised in the latter half of the calendar year this resulted in a delay in putting into place the necessary measures to
restore the group after the long period of cash constraints
nutritional foods division
nutritional foods once the capital injection in the latter half of the year was received focused on managing its working capital optimally so
as not to lose critical sales but also to be able to expand group market share pricing and margin issues were dealt with and the sales forces
were brought inhouse the production facilities remain currently underutilised and management is working on ways to address this problem
intense management involvement has resulted in far higher levels of coordination and cooperation between the different elements of this
business and a far greater strategic focus on the direct needs of the business the factory has extensive spare capacity and the impact of
increased volumes on profitability will be considerable
pharmaceutical division
the impilo business impilo marketing and impilo drugs has a contract manufacturing agreement with paccon pharmaceuticals in terms
of which paccon pharmaceuticals manufactures the impilo product range during the year under review the supply problems from paccon
were addressed and a reliable supply of product has since been maintained this has assisted impilo to recover some of its previously lost
revenue in the second half of the year
impilo as part of its risk strategy is negotiating with two other contract manufactures to manufacture products on its behalf in order to ensure
the continuous supply of product which in the past has not always been available and which has damaged our market share the process is
timeconsuming due to the numerous statutory requirements but steady progress is being made
the upgrade of the manufacturing facility at isithebe by paccon pharmaceuticals has had a delayed start this upgrade will ensure that the
factory is fully compliant with all the new medicines control council mcc regulations
corporate
exclusive manufacturing agreement
in june 2011 nutritional holdings signed an exclusive manufacturing agreement with regard to the imuniti nutritional supplement combo
pack iscp with edge to edge global investments limited e2e this agreement gives nutritional holdings the exclusive right to supply e2e
the first million iscp packs per month and thereafter we have the right of first refusal on any further manufacturing of the iscp packs this
new agreement supercedes all other previous agreements between e2e and nutritional holdings where previously nutritional holdings only
had the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell the iscp pack in south africa the term of the agreement has also been extended to an
indefinite period
proposed dual listing in aim market of the london stock exchange
nutritional holdings indicated in june 2011 that it was considering a dual listing on the aim market of the london stock exchange we did
a full investigation into this listing with a visit to the london stock exchange and at the moment we feel that due to the ongoing financial
instability of the euro region since the announcement it is not the right time to do this we have therefore delayed the process and will relook
into it when we feel the time is right
jse  altx 15 index
nutritional holdings was made a constituent of the jse  altx 15 index effective 8 july 2011 the altx 15 is an index that tracks the price
performance of the 15 largest companies listed on the altx
dti and idc
the group together with edge to edge global investments limited applied to the department of trade and industry for the iscp project to be
approved for participation in the national industrial participation programme an approval of the concept in principle was received in january
2012 this is now being pursued with the obligors to this programme
an application was also made together with edge to edge global investments limited to the industrial development corporation for the
funding of the iscp project a phased approach has now been taken for the funding of the project as the manufacturing capacity of the
nutritional holdings plant is sufficient in the short term and allows supply of the iscp in the interim accordingly the upgrade of the
manufacturing facilities by nutritional holdings will be done at a later stage as and when the demand for the iscp product increases to a
level that cannot be facilitated with the current plant available

 chief executive officers report

financial results
financial performance
sales of r41607 million were 12 down on the r46708 million of the previous year this was mainly due to a decline in sales in the
nutritional food division sales at nutritional foods were at the r38 million level for the year gross profit declined by r17 million to
r20012 million as a result of the decline in sales offset by an increase in the gross margin from 465 to 487 the increase in margin was
primarily as a result of restructuring the pricing levels at nutritional foods the reduction in gross profit however was offset by a reduction
in expenses from r26737 million to r25603 million 42 the attributable profit increased from a profit of r1664 million in 2011 to a profit
of r2619 million in 2012
financial position
the attributable profit of the group as well as the proceeds from the increase in the number of shares in issue were the major factors in
increasing the net asset value per share from 23 cents to 27 cents
prospects
with the comprehensive turnaround programme in place the group is on track to improving sales to acceptable levels and reaching acceptable
capacity utilisations as with any business a limited number of variables have a disproportionate influence on our performance we are
addressing those that are under our control which include local market development and operational and cost performance
overall we are focused on implementing strategies to improve business performance in the short medium and long term and look forward to
performance improvements in 2012
our market has been restricted due to our shortfalls in bee components something which we are actively addressing
positioning for the future
the imuniti nutritional supplement combo pack is still a product which creates opportunities to reposition the company in the near future
the slow progress on this product by the customer is as a result of matters out of their control such as funding of the final trials these have
delayed the commercialisation of the product however the first few orders have been received and produced during the year we renegotiated
the manufacturing agreement to an exclusive agreement for the production of the first one million packs per month the previous agreement
was a nonexclusive agreement
appreciation
i would like to thank jenny etchells our chief financial officer for her hard work and dedication in the past financial year she is leaving us as
an executive at the end of may 2012 she stays on as a nonexecutive director and we wish her all the best in her new role
i have been in the role as chief executive officer since march 2011 and would like to thank the board of directors management and all
employees at nutritional holdings for their support together i am confident that we will produce the turnaround that we owe to all our
stakeholders

that funds will be available to finance future operations and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities contingent obligations and
commitments will occur in the ordinary course of business
the ability of the group to continue as a going concern is dependent on a number of factors the most significant of these is that the directors
continue to procure funding for the ongoing operations of the group

risk management
the groups main objective is to provide value to shareholders through a longterm sustainable real return on capital as a result of taking
business risk within an appropriate risk framework the board of directors acknowledges its responsibility for establishing monitoring and
communicating appropriate risk and control policies and ensuring sufficient capital is held to support the taking of risk the board also regards
the management of risk as a key business process which ensures that the group is protected against uncertain events which could prevent the
group from achieving its objectives




                                                        page 13  2012 annual integrated report

 corporate governance

the group continually updates its vision strategy values and business objectives and the requirement for a robust risk management process
is critical in ensuring the sustainability of the business model the directors of the group unanimously support the longterm creation and
protection of wealth of its shareholders and fairness to all stakeholders
the board reviews risk including financial operational strategic and environmental risks on an ongoing basis this review process is carried
out to ensure that management continuously identifies potential risk and updates the risk profile of the group from this profile the group is
able to ensure that the necessary control procedures are implemented to mitigate such risk and in addition management is able to respond
timeously to any exposure to risk
strategic and business risk
strategic risk is the risk that the groups future business plans and strategies may be inadequate to prevent financial loss or protect the groups
competitive position and shareholders returns negative business risk arises from unexpected losses due to changes in business volumes
margins and costs
the directors recognise that the business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected in the future due to any of
the risks outlined below
political social and economic conditions
the group is incorporated and operates in south africa and therefore the countrys political social and economic conditions are relevant
south africa faces many challenges in overcoming substantial inequalities in levels of social and economic development among people the
south african government has taken a number of significant steps towards addressing the political tensions and social and economic problems
in south africa although certain problems still exist but will reduce with time while south africa features a highly developed financial and
legal infrastructure at the core of its economy it presently has high levels of unemployment poverty and crime particular considerations
include how the south african government will ultimately address such tensions and problems to what extent its efforts will be successful
the political social and economic consequences of such efforts and the effect on south african businesses of the continuing integration of the
south african economy with the economies of the rest of the world the economic direction of south africa may be influenced by the extent to
which the south african government organised labour and business are able to agree upon common goals and the means of achieving them
while the group believes that the economic sentiment is positive for the future these political social and economic problems may have a
negative impact on the south african economy the board of directors will engage with government as required to mitigate the effect of these
conditions on the group
black economic empowerment bee is an integral part of the south african governments economic transformation strategy the group is in the
process of implementing bee initiatives and in obtaining its targets in meeting an acceptable bee scorecard
key personnel
the groups performance depends to a large extent on the efforts and abilities of its key personnel and employees the group believes that its
success will continue to depend in part on its ability to continue to attract retain and motivate the necessary personnel including executive
officers and certain other key management
the responsibility of overseeing the daytoday operation and strategic management of the group depends substantially on senior management
and key personnel the inability to recruit personnel of the correct calibre could have a material adverse effect on the business of the group
the board is engaged at reviewing the groups remuneration policies to mitigate this risk
the groups objectives
the ability of the board to implement the groups strategy could be adversely affected by changes in the economy andor industry in which it
operates although the group has a clearly defined strategy and the board is optimistic about its prospects there can be no guarantee that its
objectives or any of them will be achieved on a timely basis or at all the groups ability to attract new growth opportunities is also dependent
on the maintenance of its reputation
competition
the group competes with numerous other local and international companies and individuals including larger competitors with access to
greater financial technical and other resources than the group which may give them a competitive advantage in the market

 notes to the annual financial statements

1 presentation of annual financial statements
	the annual financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards the companies
   act of south africa ac 500 statements and the jse listings requirements the annual financial statements have been prepared on the
   historical cost basis except for the measurement of certain financial instruments at fair value and incorporate the principal accounting
   policies set out below they are presented in south african rands
      these accounting policies are consistent with the previous period and there has been no change in the current year
  11 consolidation
		    basis of consolidation
		the consolidated annual financial statements incorporate the annual financial statements of the company and all entities which
      are controlled by the company
		control exists when the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits
   from its activities
		the results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated annual financial statements from the effective date of acquisition to
   the effective date of disposal
		adjustments are made when necessary to the annual financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line
   with those of the group
		          all intragroup transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation
 12 significant judgements
		in preparing the annual financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
     represented in the annual financial statements and related disclosures use of available information and the application of
     judgement is inherent in the formation of estimates actual results in the future could differ from these estimates which may be
     material to the annual financial statements significant judgements include
		 loans and receivables
		the group assesses its loans and receivables for impairment at the end of each reporting period in determining whether an
   impairment loss should be recorded in profit or loss the group makes judgements as to whether there is observable data indicating
   a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a financial asset
		 allowance for slow moving damaged and obsolete inventory
		this is an allowance for inventory to write inventory down to the lower of cost or net realisable value management have made
   estimates of the selling price and direct cost to sell on certain inventory items the writedown is included in the operating profit
   note
		 impairment testing
		the recoverable amounts of individual assets have been determined based on the higher of valueinuse calculations and fair
   values less costs to sell these calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions these assumptions may change which
   may then impact our estimations and may then require a material adjustment to the carrying value of intangible and tangible
   assets
		 property plant and equipment
		management has made certain estimations with regard to the determination of estimated residual values of items of property
   plant and equipment as discussed further in note 13
		 allowance for doubtful debts
		past experience indicates a reduced prospect of collecting debtors over the age of three months debtors balances older than three
   months are regularly assessed by management and provided for at their discretion
		 taxation
		judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes due to the complexity of legislation there are many
   transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business the
   group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due where
   the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the
   income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made




                                                      page 30  2012 annual integrated report

 12 significant judgements continued
		the group recognises the net future benefit related to deferred income tax assets to the extent that it is probable that the
     deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets
     requires the group to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income estimates of future taxable
     income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction to the extent
     that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates the ability of the group to realise the net deferred tax
     assets recorded at the end of the reporting period could be impacted
  13       property plant and equipment
		          the cost of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised as an asset when
		                it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and
		                the cost of the item can be measured reliably
		costs include costs incurred initially to acquire or construct an item of property plant and equipment and costs incurred subsequently
   to add to replace part of or service it if a replacement cost is recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property plant and
   equipment the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised
		the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located is also included
   in the cost of property plant and equipment
		property plant and equipment other than land and buildings is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
   losses
		land and buildings are carried at revalued amount being the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated
   depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses
		revaluations are made with sufficient regularity such that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would
   be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period
		any increase in an assets carrying amount as a result of a revaluation is recognised to other comprehensive income and
   accumulated in the revaluation surplus in equity the increase is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a
   revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss
		any decrease in an assets carrying amount as a result of a revaluation is recognised in profit or loss in the current period the
   decrease is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in
   respect of that asset the decrease recognised in other comprehensive income reduces the amount accumulated in the revaluation
   surplus in equity
		property plant and equipment are depreciated on the straightline basis over their expected useful lives to their estimated residual
   value
		          item				                             average useful life
		          land 			                             indefinite
		          buildings			                         30 years
		          plant and machinery                  5 to 15 years
		          motor vehicles 		                    3 to 10 years
		the residual value useful life and depreciation method of each asset are reviewed at the end of each reporting period if the
   expectations differ from previous estimates the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate
		the depreciation charge for each period is recognised in profit or loss unless it is included in the carrying amount of another
   asset
		the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is included in profit or loss when the
   item is derecognised the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is determined as
   the difference between the net disposal proceeds if any and the carrying amount of the item

 notes to the annual financial statements

  14       intangible assets
		          an intangible asset is recognised when
		                it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and
		                the cost of the asset can be measured reliably
		          intangible assets are initially recognised at cost
		expenditure on research or on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense when it is incurred
		          an intangible asset arising from development or from the development phase of an internal project is recognised when
		                it is technically feasible to complete the asset so that it will be available for use or sale
		                there is an intention to complete and use or sell it
		                there is an ability to use or sell it
		                it will generate probable future economic benefits
		          	there are available technical financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset and
		                the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably
		          intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses
		an intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when based on all relevant factors there is no foreseeable
   limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows amortisation is not provided for these intangible
   assets but they are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired for all
   other intangible assets amortisation is provided on a straightline basis over their useful life
		          the amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed every periodend
		reassessing the useful life of an intangible asset with a finite useful life after it was classified as indefinite is an indicator that
   the asset may be impaired as a result the asset is tested for impairment and the remaining carrying amount is amortised over its
   useful life
		internally generated brands mastheads publishing titles customer lists and items similar in substance are not recognised as
   intangible assets
  15 investments in subsidiaries
		    company annual financial statements
		in the companys separate annual financial statements investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any accumulated
      impairment
		          the cost of an investment in a subsidiary is the aggregate of
		          	the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by
               the company plus
		                any costs directly attributable to the purchase of the subsidiary
		an adjustment to the cost of a business combination contingent on future events is included in the cost of the combination if the
   adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably




                                                            page 32  2012 annual integrated report

  16 financial instruments
		    classification
		the group classifies financial assets and financial liabilities into the following categories
		                financial assets at fair value through profit or loss  held for trading
		                loans and receivables
		                financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  held for trading and
		                financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
		classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were obtainedincurred and takes place at initial
   recognition for financial instruments which are not at fair value through profit or loss classification is reassessed on an annual
   basis
		          initial recognition and measurement
		          financial instruments are recognised initially when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments
		the group classifies financial instruments or their component parts on initial recognition as a financial asset a financial liability
   or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement
		financial instruments are measured initially at fair value except for equity investments for which a fair value is not determinable
   which are measured at cost and are classified as availableforsale financial assets
		for financial instruments which are not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs are included in the initial measurement
   of the instrument
		          transaction costs on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss
		          regular way purchases of financial assets are accounted for at trade date
		 subsequent measurement
		loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less accumulated
   impairment losses
		financial liabilities at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method
		 impairment of financial assets
		at each reporting date the group assesses all financial assets other than those at fair value through profit or loss to determine
   whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets has been impaired
		for amounts due to the group significant financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy and
   default of payments are all considered indicators of impairment
		impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss
		impairment losses are reversed when an increase in the financial assets recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event
   occurring after the impairment was recognised subject to the restriction that the carrying amount of the financial asset at the
   date that the impairment is reversed shall not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not been
   recognised
		where financial assets are impaired through use of an allowance account the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss
   within operating expenses when such assets are written off the write off is made against the relevant allowance account
   subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses

  16 financial instruments continued
		    loans to from group companies
		these include loans to and from holding companies fellow subsidiaries and subsidiaries and are recognised initially at fair value
      plus direct transaction costs
		          loans to group companies are classified as loans and receivables
		          loans from group companies are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
		 trade and other receivables
		trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
   effective interest rate method appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when
   there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired significant financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the debtor
   will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade
   receivable is impaired the allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the
   present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition
		the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in
   profit or loss within operating expenses when a trade receivable is uncollectable it is written off against the allowance account
   for trade receivables subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in profit
   or loss
		          trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables
		 trade and other payables
		trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
   rate method
   cash and cash equivalents
		cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other shortterm highly liquid investments that are
   readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value these are initially and
   subsequently recorded at fair value
		 bank overdraft and borrowings
		bank overdraft and borrowings are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
   effective interest rate method any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption
   of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the groups accounting policy for borrowing costs
  17 tax
		    current tax assets and liabilities
		current tax for current and prior periods is to the extent unpaid recognised as a liability if the amount already paid in respect of
      current and prior periods exceeds the amount due for those periods the excess is recognised as an asset
		current tax liabilities assets for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to recovered from
   the tax authorities using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting
   period
		 deferred tax assets and liabilities
		a deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences except to the extent that the deferred tax liability arises
   from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting
   profit nor taxable profit tax loss
		a deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will
   be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised a deferred tax asset is not recognised when it
   arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting
   profit nor taxable profit tax loss
		a deferred tax asset is recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused stc credits to the extent that it is
   probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused stc credits can be utilised

 17 tax continued
		deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised
     or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
     reporting period
   tax expenses
		current and deferred taxes are recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the period except to the
   extent that the tax arises from
		                a transaction or event which is recognised in the same or a different period to other comprehensive income
		                a transaction or event which is recognised in the same or a different period directly in equity or
		                a business combination
		current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited to other comprehensive income if the tax relates to items that are credited
   or charged in the same or a different period to other comprehensive income
		current tax and deferred taxes are charged or credited directly to equity if the tax relates to items that are credited or charged in
   the same or a different period directly in equity
 18 leases
		a lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership a lease is
     classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership
            finance leases  lessor
		          the group recognises finance lease receivables in the statement of financial position
		finance income is recognised based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the groups net investment in the
   finance lease
   operating leases  lessee
		operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term the difference between the
   amounts recognised as an expense and the contractual payments are recognised as an operating lease liability this liability is not
   discounted
		          any contingent rents are expensed in the period they are incurred
  19       inventories
		          inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value
		net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and
   the estimated costs necessary to make the sale
		the cost of inventories comprises of all costs of purchase costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories
   to their present location and condition
		the cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and goods or services produced and segregated for specific
   projects is assigned using specific identification of the individual costs
		the cost of inventories is assigned using the weighted average cost formula the same cost formula is used for all inventories
   having a similar nature and use to the entity
		when inventories are sold the carrying amount of those inventories are recognised as an expense in the period in which the
   related revenue is recognised the amount of any writedown of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories
   are recognised as an expense in the period the writedown or loss occurs the amount of any reversal of any writedown of
   inventories arising from an increase in net realisable value are recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised
   as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs

 notes to the annual financial statements

 110 impairment of assets
		the group assesses at each end of the reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired if any such
      indication exists the group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset
		if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired the recoverable amount is estimated for the individual asset if it is not
   possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which
   the asset belongs is determined
		the recoverable amount of an asset or a cashgenerating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use
		if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable
   amount that reduction is an impairment loss
		an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation is recognised immediately in profit
   or loss any impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation decrease
		an impairment loss is recognised for cashgenerating units if the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount
   of the units the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit in the following order
		                first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cashgenerating unit and
		                then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit
		an entity assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for
   assets may no longer exist or may have decreased if any such indication exists the recoverable amounts of those assets are
   estimated
		the increased carrying amount of an asset attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss does not exceed the carrying amount
   that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods
		a reversal of an impairment loss of assets carried at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation is recognised immediately
   in profit or loss any reversal of an impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation increase
 111 share capital and equity
		an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities
  112 employee benefits
		     defined contribution plans
		     payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due
  113 provisions and contingencies
		     provisions are recognised when
		                the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event
		                it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and
		                a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation
		          the amount of a provision is the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation
		where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party the reimbursement
   shall be recognised when and only when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the
   obligation the reimbursement shall be treated as a separate asset the amount recognised for the reimbursement shall not
   exceed the amount of the provision
		          provisions are not recognised for future operating losses

 notes to the annual financial statements

2 new standards and interpretations
	at the date of approval of these annual financial statements certain new accounting standards amendments and interpretations to
   existing standards have been published but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the entity
	management anticipates that all of the pronouncements will be adopted in the entitys accounting policies for the first period beginning
  after the effective date of the pronouncement information on new standards amendments and interpretations that are expected to be
  relevant to the entitys financial statements is provided below certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are
  not expected to have a material impact on the entitys financial statements
 21 standards and interpretations not yet effective
		the group has chosen not to early adopt the following standards and interpretations which have been published and are mandatory
     for the groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 march 2012 or later periods
		ifrs 9 financial instruments has been issued this standard represents the first phase of the iasbs project to replace
   ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement and has mandatory application for accounting periods beginning on
   or after 1 january 2015 in its current form it sets out the classification and measurement criteria for financial assets and financial
   liabilities it requires all financial assets including assets currently classified under ias 39 as available for sale to be measured
   at fair value through profit and loss unless the assets can be classified as held at amortised cost qualifying equity investments
   held at fair value may have their fair value changes taken through other comprehensive income by election where the fair value
   option for certain financial liabilities is applied the portion of fair value changes representing own credit risk would be recognised
   through other comprehensive income rather than the income statement the group does not use the fair value option for financial
   liabilities the effect of applying the standard in its current form is not considered to have a material impact on the groups
   reported profit or equity
		a revised ias 19 employee benefits has been issued and will be mandatory from 1 january 2013 the new standard does not
   change the values of retirement benefit assets and liabilities on the balance sheet but does change the amounts recognised in
   the income statement and in other comprehensive income the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost on liabilities
   are replaced by a new component of the income statement charge  interest on the net retirement benefit assetliability in
   addition prior service costs will no longer be deferred and will be recognised immediately the revised standard has retrospective
   application the effect of applying the standard in its current form does not have an impact on the group
		ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements ifrs 11 joint arrangements and ifrs 12 disclosure of interests in other entities have
   been issued along with revised versions of ias 27 separate financial statements and ias 28 associates additionally ias 31 joint
   ventures has been withdrawn these standards form a single package of proposals with mandatory application from 1 january
   2013 the aim of these standards is to improve the quality of reporting in relation to the consolidation of subsidiaries special
   purpose vehicles and accounting for joint arrangements the requirements of these standards are not expected to materially affect
   the group
		an amendment to ias 1 presentation of financial statements has been issued this amendment changes the disclosure of items
   presented in other comprehensive income grouping them into items which recycle to profit and loss and items which will not
   apart from the change in disclosure this amendment will have little impact on the group accounts mandatory application is for
   accounting periods beginning on or after 1 july 2012
		ifrs 13 fair value measurement has been issued this standard aims to provide a single source of fair value measurement and
   disclosure requirements for use across ifrs the implementation of ifrs 13 does not change where fair value is or is not applied
   under ifrs and will not require a restatement of historical transactions mandatory application is from 1 january 2013

      distribution rights

	the useful life of brand names and intellectual property is considered indefinite brand names and intellectual property relate to dossiers
  registered with the medicines control council in impilo drugs 1966 pty limited which do not have a finite life these dossiers typically
  remain in demand and have done so in most cases since the inception of the company
	in assessing the carrying values of the brand names we have assumed that volumes of products will remain at the current levels the
  value of the brand names is not identified separately and we have applied our assumptions as one cashgenerating unit
	the distribution rights relate to a purchase price of exclusive rights to manufacture the imuniti nutritional supplement combo pack iscp
  from edge to edge global investments limited the agreement has no expiry date and therefore is regarded as indefinite
	the intangible asset relating to the distribution rights of the iscp was impaired in 2009 a portion of this impairment has been reversed
  as the company has received orders and produced this product during the period there is no indication that this order level will not be
  maintained for at least ten years the first three distribution outlets owned by the customer of the iscp have been completed in the
  western cape these customer distribution outlets are budgeted to monthly require product in excess of the order already placed

  interest rate risk
	as the group has no significant interestbearing assets the groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of
  changes in market interest rates
	the groups interest rate risk arises from longterm borrowings borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow
  interest rate risk borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk during 2012 and 2011 the groups
  borrowings at variable rate were denominated in rand
	at 29 february 2012 if interest rates on randdenominated borrowings had been 1 higherlower with all other variables held constant
  posttax profit for the year would have been rnil 2011 r14 800 lowerhigher mainly as a result of higherlower interest expense on
  floating rate borrowings
      credit risk
      credit risk is managed on a group basis
	credit risk consists mainly of cash deposits and trade debtors the company only deposits cash with major banks with high quality credit
  standing and limits exposure to any one counterparty
	trade receivables comprise a widespread customer base management evaluated credit risk relating to customers on an ongoing basis if
  customers are independently rated these ratings are used otherwise if there is no independent rating management assesses the credit
  quality of the customer taking into account its financial position past experience and other factors individual risk limits are set based
  on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the board the utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored sales to
  retail customers are settled in cash or using major credit cards credit guarantee insurance is purchased when deemed appropriate
