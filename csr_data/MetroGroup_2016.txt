our size with the great number of transactions we conduct daily has both the opportunity
and the duty to achieve sustainable transformation and that is our aspiration we want to
create added value for our customers while also caring for our environment to accomplish
this we have anchored the theme of sustainability in our guidelines and accordingly in our
daily actions in doing so we have set clear priorities in the last several years together
with our employees customers and partners we are focusing on tackling the issues that
are material to us we have therefore made materiality the guiding theme of this years
corporate responsibility report


    to determine which topics we and our stakeholders regard as essential we conducted
a comprehensive stakeholder survey as well as a materiality analysis this year the results
are helping us to prioritise fields of action on this basis we are defining objectives and
measures and systematically identifying and addressing potential risks and opportunities
for our business


    in this report we present several of these measures and the progress we have made
on them thus far through these efforts we are making a contribution at the societal level
to attaining the un global compact and sustainable development goals external assess
ments confirm that we are on the right path in 2016 metro group is again listed as
industry leader in the dow jones sustainability world and europe indices and is repre
sented in both the ftse4good global index and the ftse4good europe index


    the focus on the essential is also what ultimately unites the protagonists featured in

their dedication also motivate others to contribute to sustainability


    we wish you sustainably inspiring reading

lots of videos and instructions on the internet we bundled    repair of 50000 mobile phones in the last 18 months

manuals that earned us an award and enabled us to             contribution to sustainability

    for our users there are three reasons first it makes    profit but growth also brings the challenge of managing
economic sense because it saves me the cost of a new          a larger team and ensuring that it can succeed on the
device second its ecological because by repairing my       market over the long term

ewaste the third reason is my curiosity to better under         while maintaining what made kaputtde what it was
stand a product that i use daily and take for granted             right from the start 
                                                                    absolutely in the future people should still be
    would you describe kaputtde as a sustainable com         saying hey kaputtde is a great source of information
    pany                                                      that helps me decide whether to fix my electronic device
    to begin with kaputtde is a normal company thats        myself have it repaired or buy a new one its an honest
ethical and sustainable by virtue of our values and prod      intermediary that saves me time and money

   courses of action and guidelines
        we have created clear and efficient structures within metro group at the local level occupational health and safety
        officers who plan and organise the implementation of voluntary and legal guidelines have been appointed in the
        majority of organisations they serve as the link between the national and international committees
        in january 2016 our metro cash  carry sales line adopted occupational health and safety ohs guidelines these
        stipulate minimum standards which must be complied with in all metro cash  carry countries even if local
        legislation provides for lower standards the guidelines also contain rules concerning processes and reporting and
        define responsibilities
        to ensure controlled and continuous improvement in the area of occupational health and safety metro cash  carry
        has set itself specific goals the goals for 201516 include for example the written voluntary commitment to
        occupational health and safety by the management in all metro cash  carry countries the introduction of reporting
        figures concerning labourrelated accidents on the basis of set definitions regardless of countryspecific definitions
        and the implementation of verified processes that provide swift information about serious and fatal accidents
        the management board of metro ag receives reports of accident and illness figures and also changes in these
        figures twice a year starting with the annual report for financial year 201516 the causes of accidents and hence
        the reasons for absences will be evaluated and analysed at the same time a summary will be provided on the
        status the reports are then also made available to the responsible individuals at the international level this allows
        us to recognise the main causes of accidents and develop specific preventative countermeasures and to adjust our
        requirements if necessary
        the ongoing communication of the ohs expertise network in international and national meetings as well as regular
        webex conferences are opportunities for the exchange of experience and the presentation of exemplary measures
        this dialogue across the various countries and sales lines also contributes to the prevention of accidents
        we provide specific information and training for our employees on the issue of occupational health and safety there
        are also general online training sessions on topics such as stress and ergonomics and a library of ohs training is
        currently being put together we are editing training courses developed by metro group companies in such a way
        that they can be used by all employees and group companies
        we have put in motion national and international initiatives such as ohs day in april 2016 in an effort to constantly
        make our employees aware of the significance of occupational health and safety

   in september 2016 metro cash  carry china reopened a wholesale store
   as a metro green store in dongguan following comprehensive modernisa
   tion the aim of the modernisation work is to halve the stores annual energy
   consumption a large proportion of the energy for the wholesale store is
   generated by solar arrays and small wind turbines with a peak output of 800
   kilowatts other measures such as heat recovery from refrigeration systems
   the use of natural light via socalled solar tubes the installation of automatic
   sliding doors optimised ventilation and the carefully planned utilisation of
   rainwater improve energy efficiency and contribute to the conservation of
   valuable resources in addition a co2 cascade system was installed at the
   dongguan store to make refrigeration more efficient and more ecofriendly by using refrigerants with lower global warm
   ing potential the wholesale store is lowering its emissions of carbon equivalents co2e caused by the discharge of refrig
   erants while at the same time using less electricity for the refrigeration process


   the casa dellhoreca metro cash  carry wholesale store in baranzate italy is a model of integrated energy manage
   ment here solar panels are used for the generation of electricity and hot water the wholesale stores green wooden
   façade helps to increase biodiversity and the sales reps drive electric cars


   there are also examples of decentralised energy generation at stores in the reporting period in addition to an existing
   system metro cash  carry installed another eight photovoltaic systems in china for emissionfree electricity genera

   in its own operations
   a measure taken by metro international supply demonstrates that food waste can be reduced by means of carefully
   planned processes and smart data use the service company operates a network of regional warehouses in italy and the
   netherlands by analysing writeoff data the company was able to determine its percentage of food waste and the asso
   ciated disposal costs and then identify potential ways in which to avoid both the waste and the costs nonsaleable goods
   are now no longer destroyed and are instead donated to local food banks in good time in this way metro international
   supply was able to reduce its disposal costs by 64 per cent and its food waste by nearly 90 per cent within one financial
   year


   to reduce food waste in its wholesale stores metro cash  carry carries out bestbefore date monitoring the aim is to
   take bestbefore dates into account when stocking shelves and to make products available before they reach their best
   before date an example of this is the approach taken by metro cash  carry romania in its incoming goods depart
   ment the company uses a system with which it can simulate and analyse merchandise orders plan them more precisely
   and manage them more in line with demand this process was also optimised because stock that is not entirely sold ends
   up being marked down at outgoing goods a price reduction system allows staff members to quickly and easily reduce
   the prices of products whose bestbefore date is approaching

   solutions for the customer
   metro cash  carry also talks to its commercial customers specifically about this issue to achieve a reduction in food
   waste the consumers are likewise taken into account in this effort for example together with various project partners
   the company developed special boxes for restaurants and caterers in italy france and germany for uneaten food to be
   taken home in


   for example metro cash  carry france supports the gourmet bag initiative of the food authority draaf auvergne
   rhônealpes a special label identifies participating restaurants and encourages guests to specifically ask for doggy bags
   metro cash  carry france has developed a comprehensive package for newcomers to the programme in addition to
   background information and tips on how to avoid waste it contains gourmet bag door stickers and reusable doggy bags


   in italy metro cash  carry launched a similar project called schiscetta reverse during expo 2015 together with the
   un world food programme wfp and the food bank organisation schiscetta is the milanese term for a container that
   people use to take food from home to work the project of the same name uses the reverse process by encouraging
   consumers to have dishes they have not finished at restaurants wrapped up to take home


   in 2016 metro cash  carry conducted a representative survey on food waste in germany the key finding of the study
   was that not wasting food is very important or important to 98 per cent of restaurateurs in germany nearly two thirds of
   restaurateurs already offer their guests the option of taking their leftovers home metro cash  carry stays abreast of
   these changes and purposefully helps its customers to reduce food waste  not only with its leftovers box bestereste
   box which has been available in its wholesale stores since 2016 as an official partner of the united against waste asso
   ciation the company also offers seminars that teach ideas about and approaches to the reduction of food waste in addi
   tion restaurants and canteens can employ a waste analysis tool to find out where in their organisation they can improve
   the utilisation of resources


   metro cash  carry aims to sensitise its customers to responsible and sustainable consumption not only by disseminat
   ing specific information and with campaigns the company also supports its customers with specific activities including
   in the area of waste disposal for example customers in paris can return plastic bottles and tins at their wholesale store
   using their metro customer card in the course of this project which includes not only customers but also producers
   and disposers metro cash  carry france accepted approximately 16000 tins and 13000 plastic bottles in financial
   year 201516


   in ukraine metro cash  carry initiated a recycling project together with carlsberg in october 2015 the wholesaler set
   up a return station in its car park where customers could return beer bottles by august 2016 a total of 92000 bottles
   had been collected for reuse and 384000 bottles were sent for recycling

   old appliances of pollutants disassembles them into their components  such as condensers metals glass and plastics
    and then sorts the materials the average metal portion of a washing machine for example is over 80 per cent about
   16 per cent of the machine consists of other materials such as plastics including approximately 14 per cent elastomers

key performance indicators
and goals

key performance indicators

the chapter key performance indicators provides information about metro groups sustainability performance in the form of
key performance indicators kpis it is divided into figures showing the companys economic performance staffrelated kpis
key indicators regarding the sustainable operations area of responsibility which covers the responsible use of resources key
indicators for the sustainable procurement and assortment area of responsibility and kpis on sustainable consumption


reporting period
the reporting year is the same as the metro group financial year ie 1 october to 30 september key performance indicators
are reported for the previous three financial years


reporting of the climate protection target also includes the targets reference year 2011 the figure for the reference year relates
to the period from 1 january to 31 december 2011 a different reporting period is used in this case because metro group
changed its financial year from the calendar year to the twelve months from october to september in 2013


approach to data collection
the key performance indicators reported are based on data that is gathered using various internal reporting systems as a rule
this data is systematically recorded for each sales line and each country every quarter in some cases every month the kpis are
based on data collected for the whole metro group that is for all of the sales lines stores back offices and warehouses and
for the head office in düsseldorf it is necessary to extrapolate and estimate consumption data for some kpis in cases where
the primary data available is incomplete this applies to the kpis on sustainable operations in a few isolated cases we do not
have access to reliable primary data which we can use to extrapolate consumption figures as a result this consumption is not
included the table showing the extent of the data available provides information about the coverage of each key performance
indicator


for instance we do not have comprehensive measured or readout energy usage data for the mediasaturn consumer electronics
stores which are tenants in shopping centres likewise complete consumption figures are not available for a number of leased

warehouses used by our sales lines for this reason the energyrelated kpis coverage is less than 100 per cent in both cases
however the related greenhouse gas emissions are included in the carbon footprint under scope 3 leased assets


we do not have any data on the quantity of paper procured by mediasaturn on a decentralised basis like energy consumption
paper usage is included in the carbon footprint consequently the carbon footprints coverage is less than 100 per cent


the greenhouse gas emissions relating to purchased goods and services assets and leased assets which are reported in accor
dance with scope 3 are modelled because recording primary data for these is highly complex the modelling is based on kpis
regarding metro groups economic value added and an economic inputoutput model that draws on the economic flows of
goods and services in the reporting year we updated the data which serves as the basis for this model to use the most recent
data available 2011 additionally we took into account the effect of exchange rates and inflation up to 2015


the selling space figures used as a basis for some kpis are averages for the year they differ from the reporting date figures
given in the annual report


the kpis we report for workrelated accidents and continuing professional development do not currently cover all employees we
do not have the relevant data for all sales lines and organisational units


deviations from previous reports
in some cases the figures presented in previous sustainability reports differ from those cited in this report


the employee kpis and the kpis regarding value added do not include galeria kaufhof either in the year under review or in the
previous years the sales line was sold in financial year 201415


there are differences compared with the greenhouse gas emissions reported in previous reports due to the updating of emission
factors we use emission factors to calculate the carbon equivalents of the consumption of the individual emission sources our
primary sources for emission factors are the defra tremove and gemis databases and in the case of modelled emissions an
economic inputoutput model


there are other differences in the environmental kpis arising from estimated figures having been replaced by actual values in
a number of cases the utilities provide us with consumption figures quite late and we therefore initially work on the basis of
estimates


we complete our data collection and reporting on an ongoing basis to improve the level of transparency and the way we manage
our sustainability performance


as part of these efforts we have included additional kpis in our reporting and expanded on several existing ones the following
new kpis have been added since our previous reports
    new employees
    total energy consumption


at the same time we have ceased to report several kpis based on the results of our materiality analysis the following kpis are
no longer sufficiently relevant for our steering and reporting

definition number of reportable workrelated accidents per 1000 employees as compared to the number of fulltime equivalent

explanation there were 226 accidents per 1000 fulltime equivalent employees at the german metro group companies
based on the actual headcount there were 191 accidents per 1000 employees because of the widely varying definitions of
workrelated accident in the countries in which metro group operates we currently only report this kpi for germany we are
working on a uniform groupwide reporting approach


steps are taken to ensure that working conditions within metro group do not pose a major risk of fatal accidents for this
reason this is not a material topic for us as defined by gri and we do not report concrete figures as a result however should an
individual unexpectedly suffer a fatal accident due to occupational safety shortcomings we have processes in place to inform the
occupational health and safety officer at metro ag immediately so that an investigation can be launched to identify the causes
in the interests of prevention the results of any such investigation would also be shared with other group companies

explanation we aim to reduce our specific greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent between 2011 and 2030 in concrete terms
this means that we want to cut our emissions per square metre of selling space from 330 to 165 kilograms of carbon equivalents
per annum


between october 2015 and september 2016 metro group generated 250 kilograms of carbon equivalents per square metre of
selling space the significant decline in emissions compared with the reference year 2011 can essentially be attributed to three
factors
     measures to reduce consumption relating to energy company cars paper and business travel and to reduce emissions
     caused by refrigerant loss
     general technical and scientific developments as reflected by the adjustment of the emission factors used to calculate carbon
     equivalents
     changes in the store portfolio due to the sale of old and purchase of new locations in eastern europe and asia for instance
     particularly emissionintensive locations were sold on the other hand locations in germany and western europe with
     emissions per square metre of selling space below the group average were sold

explanation in absolute terms metro group drew 64 million m of fresh water in the reporting period at the warehouses
stores and back offices water is primarily used for cleaning and sanitary facilities in addition to this water may be used for stor
ing transporting and selling food for example for keeping live fish or making ice to chill fresh fish


at the group level we measure and monitor the amount of water which the company draws from the public drinking water supply
the public drinking water supply is the only source from which we draw significant amounts of water


we also measure and monitor the total amount of wastewater we generate at the group level as our locations do not consume
a significant amount of water our calculations are based on the assumption that the volume of wastewater is the same as the
amount of fresh water all wastewater is fed into public sewers we do not monitor the quality of the wastewater ourselves as this
is not relevant given the usage described above

definition waste generated in relation to selling space the amount of waste is made up of waste for disposal for recycling or
heat recovery and hazardous and organic waste the recycling rate is the amount of waste for recycling and heat recovery plus
organic waste as compared to the overall quantity of waste


explanation the volume of waste in absolute terms fell again to 512272 tonnes this can be broken down as follows
   waste for disposal 84919 tonnes
   waste for recycling or heat recovery 296429 tonnes
   organic waste 66967 tonnes
   hazardous waste 63957 tonnes

when we calculate the recycling rate we do not take hazardous waste into account because we cannot systematically record the
way in which it is treated recycled or disposed of in all of the countries in which we operate however based on information from
several countries most of the hazardous waste is also recycled in reality the recycling rate is therefore considerably higher

metro groups carbon footprint

why are climate change and climate protection important to metro group sdg13
climate change presents metro group with both risks and opportunities physical risks may affect our business directly or indi
rectly for example changes in the volume or frequency of precipitation may have an impact on the price and availability of agri
cultural products also our store operations may be jeopardised by extreme weather such as torrential downpours with flooding
or storms


regulatory risks may affect our business directly or indirectly for example the levies imposed by germanys renewable energy
sources act eeg have an impact on our procurement of electricity


one way in which we counter these risks is with procurement and supply chain management that creates the necessary struc
tures to ensure the availability of goods at all times among other things we are investing in technical measures to conserve
energy in energy management systems in accordance with iso 50001 in switching to refrigerants which are less harmful to the
environment and in programmes that will change the behaviour of every single employee


however we not only see risks in climate change but also opportunities sustainability will continue to grow in importance on a
global scale and the expectations in this respect on the side of customers employees investors politics and society will increase
continuing to systematically implement our sustainability strategy will enhance the appeal of metro group and its sales lines
and own brands for these stakeholder groups


while achieving our climate protection target does indeed require investments these will lead to savings in the medium to long
term thanks to lower costs in particular for energy resulting in both financial and environmental benefits and improvements


through our participation in the cdp climate change survey since 2006 we have provided information to the public about our
climate protection strategy the risks and opportunities resulting from climate change and the ways in which we manage our
emissions based on this we were once again named sector leader consumer staples and index leader mdax in 2016


carbon footprint and climate protection target
in 2015 the global community agreed in paris to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius at most achieving this target will
require a considerable reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions metro group is playing its part here by reducing its
specific greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent per square metre of selling space by 2030 compared to 2011


this climate protection target relates to emissions that are central to our activities as a retail company and most importantly
that we can influence directly these are emissions from
    the consumption of fuel oil natural gas liquefied natural gas electricity district heating and cooling and paper
    refrigerant losses for commercial refrigeration and airconditioning
    the fuel consumption of company cars and emergency power generators
    upstream chain emissions and network losses for all direct and indirect energy sources and
    business travel

metro group has been recording and publishing its greenhouse gas emissions since 2008 taking into account all the main
greenhouse gas emissions that we cause directly and indirectly in the course of our business activities this detailed documen
tation forms the basis for our goal of minimising our impact on the climate the emissions that are actively managed with a view
to achieving the climate protection target make up almost 40 per cent of the total emissions our carbon footprint reporting also
covers the following additional emission sources
     fuel consumption of the companys fleet of trucks
     all external logistics
     goods and services procured for our own use not including paper as this is included in the climate protection target
     assets
     waste
     employee commuting
     leased assets


methodology and reporting scope
our reporting is based on the corporate standard and the corporate value chain scope 3 accounting and reporting standard
of the greenhouse gas protocol the emissions of all the sales lines service companies and back offices are taken into account
with the aid of the groupwide carbon intelligence system introduced in 2011 we record consumption data for the aforemen
tioned emission sources at virtually all stores department stores back offices and warehouses where the documentation of
primary data is very cumbersome or impossible we model these emission sources for example we derive the emissions of
procured goods and services assets and leased assets from the key performance indicators for metro groups economic value
added using an economic inputoutput model that draws on the economic flows of goods and services


we report on the overall effect of all greenhouse gas emissions in the form of carbon equivalents in order to gauge the impact of
other greenhouse gases in addition to carbon emissions


since 2011 our carbon footprint has been subject to a business audit by kpmg ag wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft


developments in greenhouse gas emissions
from october 2015 to september 2016 metro group was responsible for a total of 68 million tonnes of carbon equivalents
prioryear period 75 million tonnes we have therefore reduced our emissions by more than 28 million tonnes compared with
the reference year 2011 the carbon footprint shows a breakdown of all the documented emissions by direct emissions in accor
dance with scope 1 indirect emissions scope 2 and other indirect emissions scope 3

the significant decline in emissions compared with the reference year 2011 can essentially be attributed to three factors
    measures to reduce emissions in particular those with respect to energy consumption and refrigerant losses drop of 15 per
    cent
    general technical and scientific developments as reflected by the adjustment of the emission factors used to calculate carbon
    equivalents drop of just under 6 per cent
    changes in the store portfolio due to the sale of old and purchase of new locations in eastern europe and asia for instance
    particularly emissionintensive locations were sold on the other hand locations in germany and western europe with
    emissions per square metre of selling space below the group average were sold drop of approximately 3 per cent
