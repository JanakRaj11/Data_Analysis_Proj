               one initiative sony is taking to ensure that its products are environmentally

               responsible involves designing them with recyclability in mind this means for

               used in parts to make it easier to extract resources from used products during

               recycling for example sony has issued environmental design standards and
               guidelines for tvs which are used when planning and designing new products
