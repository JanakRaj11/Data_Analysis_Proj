environment
2017 marked the first full year that our three manufacturing facilities in asia have been completely integrated into skyworks operations these facilities two in japan and one in singapore
have collected and reported data aligned with our established global reporting methodology thus the aggregate environmental impacts associated with energy water hazardous waste
municipal waste and carbon dioxide co2 could effectively be assessed and improved the 2017 data collected at these facilities is being used as a baseline from which future environmental
improvements can be measured providing skyworks the ability to report yearoveryear change for all six manufacturing locations beginning in reporting year 2018
our intent is to drive long term sustained improvement across all major environmental categories to this end our progress over the last five years at our factories in newbury park california
