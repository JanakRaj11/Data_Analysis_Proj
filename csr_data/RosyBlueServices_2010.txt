        the quality of a diamond is defined by the four cs clarity       transparency must be part of any future plan in every part of
        carat color and cut                                               the chain

        if we would try to define antwerp as the world diamond              rosy blue must be applauded for publishing their second csr
        capital in keywords we would end up with location                report their pioneering work has set the standard and is an
        concentration innovation and creativity                          example of a more transparent diamond industry

        antwerp is located in the centre of europe at the crossroad        the recent initiative of the responsible jewellery council is
        between east and west it is the home of diamonds for more          very ambitious and also deserves our support this
        then 550 years this multicultural neutral region is known       international notforprofit organisation unites more then 225
        for her high quality of life and homes of all the key players      companies across the jewellery supply chain these members
        this concentration of miners traders people of industry          are committed to promoting responsible ethical human rights
        retailing and many others makes antwerp the most important          social and environmental practices in a transparent and
        diamond trade centre in the world                                  accountable manner throughout the industry from mine to
                                                                            retail their commitment aims to reinforce consumer and
        the advantage of a highly trained and educated workforce
                                                                            stakeholder confidence in jewellery products rjc
        combined with high standard technology is the reason why
        the most difficult and precious stones are cut in antwerp          charles darwin once said that it is not the strongest nor the
                                                                            most intelligent of the species that survives it is the one that
        to keep that strategic position we should and will increase our
                                                                            is the most adaptable to change
        investment in innovation and smartly commercialize the spin
        offs and findings to become more competitive again in               the diamond business is going through a change i believe
        processes that today are dependent on manual handling in           they will come out more transparent more responsible and by
        the internet era product and process innovation wont be            doing so stronger
        sufficient

        that leaves the fourth keyword creativity

        for some years now antwerp is home of some of the best
        fashion designers in the world also in diamonds one can be
        should and is very creative there are no strict rules on colour
        the amount of facets the way to cut or polish when
        manufacturers push the limit and let creativity take over they
        can end up with brilliant result

        but there is no reason to gloat                                    cathy berx

        as they say pride goes before a fall and standstill means        governor of antwerp
        decline therefore we must keep on investing in our existing
        strengths and resolve our weaknesses

        that is why i have challenged awdc to deploy an ambitious
        vision for the future together with all key players in the
        industry awdc will present project 2020 in the nearby
        future

        while a significant cost reduction represented a vital            to make a positive and sustainable difference i would also like
        achievement it could largely only be accomplished through an     to recognize the important role of the united nations global

        always managed it in accordance with our family principles
        which have found their roots in the jain religion where          thank you
        equality is one of the main pillars the practical side of our

        about adding sustainable value to your business and helping

                                          guide the csr programmes in which we invest

                                          we have understood that corporate social responsibility is a synonym for constant reflection
                                          and learning and that a sustainable future depends on solid partnerships with all our key

                       77 of consumers feel they can make a positive difference by
                       purchasing products from socially or environmentally
                       responsible companies furthermore the report also showed
                       that 72 of the consumers avoided buying from companies
                       engaged in practices with which they disagree

                       therefore it is important that consumers have confidence
                       that diamonds they consider buying come from conflict free

                 what are the main objectives of the global compact                  we have just organised our first workshop on communication
                 network belgium                                                    on progress reporting on july 6th we are organizing a

                 it is not about just connecting the current belgian participants   summit ungc in new york we also work closely together
                 it is about incorporating csr practices in small and larger         with business  society belgium and kauri on key csr topics
                 organisations based on the 4 pillarsencouraging companies          such as supply chain human rights
                 to do business with the utmost respect for responsible
                 environmental practices universal principles surrounding           we have conducted a survey to the other global compact
                 human rights and progressive workplace standards all with          network participants in europe to understand the priorities of

                 parallel to outreach efforts we want to consult with some           it is my aim to work closely with the european members of
                 champion companies to develop a strategy of core activities of      the global compact and others csr organisations this vision
                 a global compact local network in belgium we want to               also reflects the statement of mr george kell  executive

                 hanard who said the diamond trades stakeholders came               was perhaps followed too zealously more careful oversight in

                 insecurity thanks to the decisions taken during the first          and balances may have helped the world economy avoid the

                 practices had been developed despite a calmer mood in              of disaster by massive injections of government capital by

                 to changing world conditions which called for the diamond           in the markets than it ever had intended
                 industry to come together to debate current developments
                                                                                     mrs berx said it was reasonable to expect a recovery in the
                 as the worlds largest diamond trading centre antwerp was
                                                                                     diamond markets during 2010 possibly beginning with the
                 the ideal meeting place for dialogue he said
                                                                                     2009 christmas season but she warned that it was generally
                 many of you were here last year when we held the first             accepted that the recovery would be slow here in antwerp
                 symposium in an atmosphere of financial uncertainty the            we have seen that across the board and not only in the
                 symposium gave us all the opportunity to explore issues             diamond sector container traffic at the port of antwerp fell
                 affecting us all and we made a great deal of progress in the       by 184 percent during the first nine months of the year
                 last year the key stakeholders have come together and shown        compared to the same period in 2008 however it did appear
                 collective responsibility this was satisfying for us at the awdc   to stabilise during the third quarter of the year
                 because facilitating dialogue is an important part of our work
                                                                                     she warned diamantaires that governments agree there was
                 we have navigated through the challenges and we are
                                                                                     an urgent need for new regulations on the financial
                 stronger now
                                                                                     community but the process in bringing this about was proving
                 we are stronger now so the question is do we need another        slow due to the need for consistently applied financial
                 symposium the answer is yes because we are living in a             regulation across the globe with the talk of new regulation
                 changing world and we need to come together to understand           the banks clearly understand that they soon will be facing
                 the changes strategies and practices of businesses                 higher capital requirements but by how much it is difficult to
                 throughout the pipeline have changed mining companies              say as long as the banks dont know the rules of the game
                 have not been immune to the changes and have rethought              says economist mr kenneth rogoff they will continue to be
                 their sales strategies mr hanard stated                         cautious in their credit policies and that puts a drag on
                                                                                     trade
                 the gravity of the issues facing us should not scare us
                 mr hanard said if we act proactively we will succeed we
                 have the destiny of the industry in our hands are we looking
                 for answers results and predictions we will not solve all of
                 the problems today but we can get an insight into how we
                 can go forward i do not doubt that the different messages
                 carried out through this symposium will be put into practice
                 in coming months

            just a year later

            situation turned around there was successful and orderly           considering the new normal

                                                                                mr evenzohar then explained what he meant by the new
            however most polished diamond prices are below those of            normal in the market there would have to be corporate
            january 2008 and there is still a mismatch between rough and       deleveraging with banks looking for better debtequity ratios
            polished confidence is still very low and consumer                in addition the diamond industry had to understand that it
            confidence is lower than that of business confidence               was fighting with many other sectors for credit from banking
            consumers are still not really back yet he said the industry is   institutions the basel ii banking regulations which even
            in a stability phase and not fully out of the crisis yet           before the financial crisis were proposing more stringent

            slight rise of 04 percent on 2009                                 likely to become even more important

            as for the cutting centres polished demand in 2008 was 188       mr evenzohar raised the issue as to whether more
            billion but in 2009 would fall 27 percent to 137 billion        recycled diamonds were likely to come on the market
            however it would rise by 25 percent next year to 171 billion     saying that the recycling of even a small part of existing
            in the rough market while sales amounted to 134 billion in       diamonds was likely to have a significant effect on the market
            2008 they would drop to 75 billion this year and rise to         he gave the example of the gold market where recycled gold
            125 billion in 2010                                              this year was equal to 60 percent of new mine production
                                                                                there is hard evidence to suggest that considerable recycling

            supported the diamond industry admirably particularly            much exactly
            during mid2009 which had been a critical period in addition
            the financial stimulus packages of central banks throughout
            the world had helped shore up retail sales he said that the
            level of diamond companies borrowing was down by around
            30 percent and estimated the global diamond sectors
            indebtedness at 115 billion

       documentation and supporting
       documents review
       our documentation review concentrates on determining how
       well an entity is managing the different areas of compliance
       business social and environmental and what systems are in
       place to monitor the implementation of the policies and
       procedures

       this review also allows us to pick up early indications of the
       areas on which the entity needs to focus

       from this data we can determine the possible risks that exist
       within the process or system under review that may affect the
       level of compliance and how best we can manage through the
       use of internal controls

       the documentation and supporting documents of all entities
       have been reviewed since 2008 by the global corporate
       affairs department

             going forward
             working for rosy blue wide improvements
             the next step will be to include the supply chain management principles in the contractors agreements and to evaluate the
             minority contractors when a minority contractor is not in compliance we will take appropriate action on a casebycase basis and
             work with them to correct deficiencies conduct followup audits and if appropriate terminate relationships

             working for industry wide improvements
             we believe that the most effective way to bring about lasting social and environmental improvements in the supply chain is to
             collaborate with other companies in our industry to create common standards and audit procedures as such we have worked as an
             active member of rjc since 2005 at board and committee level rosy blue is working with over 225 companies throughout the
             supply chain to drive this industry mechanism our application for rjc certification clearly reflects this commitment
             adressing new challenges in materials sourcing
             we continue to face new challenges in our supply chain and are committed to addressing them we will develop a sustainable
             procurement policy and establish a framework on all non diamond purchasing across the group a special taskforce will be
             appointed

we went through all the contractors workbook questions and        found this was a true recognition to our contractor
discussed the different areas of focus we adjusted the
contractors toolkit to a simplified document taking into
consideration the local needs

we also provided appropriate training for each employee
with a special focus on health and safety

what impact did this audit had on your relationship with
your contractor

at first they thought we were interfering with their business
over time they clearly saw the advantage of implementing
policies and procedures now i can say it has strengthened our
relationship we are in this together with one goal to deliver
sustainable products

for example we improved the structured reporting of the hr
reports we implemented a health  safety plan with one of
their very dedicated polishers who is trained in health 
safety we organised training on different compliance topics in
hebrew by one of our own compliance managers

interview with zahara samar elbinireceptionist antwerp
samar has been working for rosy blue antwerp since april 2008 together with her colleague helena van landeghem she manages
the reception at rosy blue

since when where you diagnosed with multiple sclerosis

i was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in january 1993 i was
27 years and i had just given birth to my son ms is an auto
immune disease which affects the nerves of the brain and
spinal cord when an attack occurs it will leave a scar around
the tissue of a nerve affected that nerve will not be able to
send signals towards a specific part of the body so that part
becomes disabled it is a silent progressing disease and thanks
to cortisone and other medications the illness can be treated
this way it will not progress too fastthere is no cure yet but
the medical world is getting there hopefully in the future
there will be one

what impact does this have on your personal and
                                                                    are your colleagues supportive
professional life
                                                                    yes they are supportive and helpful it is thanks to their
in my personal life it has a lot of effect on me my children
                                                                    flexibility and respect that i can work my work motivates me
and my family it is very hard to always feel very tired even
                                                                    also in fighting against my illness it feels good to be around
though i have had a good night of sleep sometimes i am not
                                                                    people and contribute to a successful company
able to do anything around the house which frustrates me
but i always push myself to go further as i do not give up my     what lessons have life taught you
professional life has also been affected as i have to work less     life has taught me to accept what comes along and to move
hours due to the progress of ms my intention is to keep on         forward life has taught me to respect diversity and never
working as long as my body allows me to                            judge this is so great about working here we have so many
how can you find the right balance                                 different nationalities and religious backgrounds this
                                                                    multicultural flavour adds value to doing your work
that is the problem with this illness it is unpredictable there
are times when i really feel great and that i nearly forget i am    another important point is to never give up life is what you
ill but many times i get an unexpected fallback i am a very       make of it for yourself and for others as long as i can make
dynamic personality it then frustrates me that i cannot come       people laugh and be cheerful life is worthwhile
to work and also cannot manage my household

thanks to the management of rosy blue and their flexible
working regime i found a balance between managing my job
my personal life and my illness i work part time which allows
me to arrange my private issues in the morning eg going to
the doctor if i am ill for a couple of days my colleague helena
who works full time is there to manage the reception

         embracing respecting honoring recognizing and leveraging our
         differences to build a better community workplace and world


          recruiting and integrating disabled individuals in the workplace
          lanka diamond polishing ltd diamond manufacturing
          operations

          background

          a highly significant element of the diversity debate  often
          overlooked  is recruiting and integrating disabled individuals
          in the work place until very recently disability was the
          forgotten dimension of human rights and unacknowledged as
          a subject for a right to equality

          how would you describe the role of csr in your company

          rosy blue sri lanka has always been actively involved in local
          community projects and made a lot of contributions to the         what has been the focus of your diversity programme
          community through its philanthropic actions such as
                                                                            since 2000 we recruited from the school for disabled
          supporting the village blood donation camp serving meals to
                                                                            established in seeduwa area at the factory 4 disabled
          blind voluntary work from staff
                                                                            employees deaf and mute work alongside their nondisabled
          but the company has made an even bigger contribution to the       colleagues without any needs for adjustment in their working
          local community by indiscriminately employing 4 people with       environment or working practices they work at the bottom
          disabilities what makes this application even more interesting   press pot plating and scaif reconditioning department
          is that it was done with firm conviction for equality as
                                                                            this is quite an important point as many organisations feel a
          opposed to simple compliance with the law
                                                                            lot of adjustments need to be made to the workplace in order
          how would you describe the culture within rb srilanka           to enable them to work effectively

          rosy blue sri lanka boasts a family culture where employees
          help each other and where most individuals are socially
          connected they have made their workplace their home and
          their extended family traditionally the company has always
          paid for its employees recovery in the case of their absence
          due to illnesses or any form of treatment psychological or
          physical depending on the nature of the treatment most of
          these funds are donated to the employee

             balanced way this programme gave me
             confidence to move forward i did not know
             anything about banking and thanks to the training
             and continuous coaching i started my own

health and safety monitoring
the health and safety team conducts periodic audits to
identify and correct hazards we require employees to report
injuries and accidents promptly so that the health and safety
team can investigate and take corrective actions to avoid
recurrence lessons learned are actively shared via the group
compliance team on the csr extranet


our safety performance
the annual review demonstrates that we have reduced our
accidents from 2 to 1 of the total workforce

our occupational accident rates vary by activity and region it
is clear that the risks of injuries in factories are much higher
than in office premises

we have found that the most common causes of accidents are
related to sawing activities in the manufacturing of diamonds
in general the level of risk is limited due to very strong
preventive measurements rosy blue will continue to drive
improvement in safety performance but manufacturing sites
are definitely our priority

our goal is zero fatalities and zero accidents we will continue
to devote substantial management and employee time and all
the appropriate resources to this area to progress group
performance towards those targets

     csr in action




             special awareness programme in
             sri lanka
            in general there is an overall reduction of injuries across the
            group by 1 on total workforce mid 2009 we evaluated our
            data on injuries and accidents as a result of this analysis we
            focused on the usage of ppe and we organised a general
            prevention campaign to improve awareness in our factory in sri
            lanka last quarter 2009 the major injuries reduced but we
            noticed that the minor injuries such as small cuts while working
            with machines and glasses as well as diamond powder spread to
            the eyes by lack of attention increased and will thus remain an
            important focus in the last three months of 2009 most of
            these injuries were reported in the repairs and maintenance
            section

            we developed a special awareness programme and trained the
            workers inhouse we also invited a district factory inspection
            engineer to inform the workers on how to avoid these kind of
            injuries importantly the increase was disproportionate due to
            the fact that the factory was relocated to a brand new premise
            given the fact that a 30 year old factory had to be relocated and
            a lot of machinery and equipment had to be moved these
            minor injuries were adequately handled

even though you already take the environment into account
as much you can in the production process it is unavoidable
there will be a certain amount of co2 emissions it is exactly
these co2 emissions that are the most important factors for
global warming and the deterioration of our environment and
its biodiversity rosy blue therefore asked artoos to contact a

on the basis of this knowledge they developed a unique             total                                          9724 kg
model which we can use to calculate the co2 emissions for
every print job taking into account such variables as the print
run the paper chosen the weight of the inks used which
printing press has been used and for how long how many
aluminium printing plates were used etc

the co2 emissions for this mix amount to 9724 kg rosy blue

              background

              in 1988 rosy blue india started to build a factory in pithampur
              our factory building has a land area about 4 acres originally
              the environment around was completely barren during the
              summer the average day temperature would be as high of 47
              degree centigrade since the start the company has invested
              in greening the entire location by planting trees and             waste management the fallen leaves are collected and
              maintaining lush green gardens in all open spaces in addition       used as manures thereby avoid chemicals after collecting
              the factory building was scientifically designed with high            fallen leaves we mix it with water and keep it covered for a
              roofing and adequate ventilation in order to maintain ambient         few days to make manure this manure is mixed with soil
              temperature and light in a natural way this has resulted in          to increase the fertility and help us to reduce the use of
              substantial energy conservation and costs                            chemicals this leads to reduction in the residual effect of
              today we are proud to say that we are the greenest factory in         soil this also helps us to regularly cleaning of fallen leaves
              the entire pithampur industrial belt we are proud of our             at our premises
              employees that have been consciously maintaining and                we have an arrangement with a local animal agency
              protecting the greenery around                                       which comes and collects all food waste on a daily basis to

              what are the initiatives recently developed in order to
                                                                                    suitable addressed

                 this water is used for gardening purposes                          functioning there is no requirement of power to run them
               the rain water is streamed from different locations and           reduce temperature during summer by pasting local lime

                    about the copenhagen communiqué57
                    background
                    from the 719 december 2009 33526 people representing ngos business government and media met in copenhagen for the un
                    conference on climate change in these two weeks governments from 192 countries came together making the 15 th conference of
                    parties cop 15 and the 5th meeting of the parties mop the largest political event outside of new york the official seat of the un
                    and with 126 heads of state the event with the largest concentration of government leaders at one time

                    even though the participants made the trip to copenhagen in the hope to attend a conference that would conclude with a historic
                    agreement in the global fight against climate change policy makers were just able to reach a minimal agreement in the end
                    according to the bali road map a framework for climate change mitigation beyond 2012 should have been agreed there in light of
                    the kyoto protocol that expires at the end of 2012 all countries merely agreed to take note of the copenhagen accord which was
                    drafted by us china india brazil and south africa the accord recognises climate change as one of the greatest challenges of the
                    present day as the document is not legally binding it also does not contain any legally binding commitments for reducing co 2

             reorganization we needed to eliminate many positions
             throughout our operations as we entered 2010 we are slowly         to engage all employees topdown and bottom up to
             recovering our aim is that the longterm structural growth           contribute to small and larger projects that improve
             drivers of our company are fully intact only then we can focus       practices and have a positive impact on their work and

public educational and nonprofit organizations to help
address the many challenging issues affecting the             to create a formal system to monitor our social projects
communities where our employees live and work                 and evaluate the impact it has on the people and the

transparency this helps to make a business more trustworthy and
improves the standards of other organizations at the same time since

          the man who removes a mountain
         begins by carrying away small stones

                                chinese proverb




every small step we take has impact not only on our existence and operations but
society at large
                                                                                                                    co r p o r at e s o c i a l r e s p o n s i b i l i t y r e p o r t   2   0   0   9
