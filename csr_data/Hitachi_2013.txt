top commitment message from management

our key business challenges are
social contribution and
reducing the environmental burden




the hitachi group has positioned the social innovation business as our
core business emphasis and we work as a group to expand that business
globally there are several reasons why we call what we do social innovation
business

resolving social issues
first continuing to simply supply the equipment and systems needed for the
social infrastructure would not be enough to overcome the trials faced by
society carefully honing and perfecting the functionality and performance
of individual products and systems is of course an extremely important
responsibility for a manufacturer however the issues facing many countries
and regions around the world are becoming too complex to be resolved
with equipment and systems alone take energy issues for example in many
regions economic development has brought power shortages one solution
is to build large highefficiency thermal power stations but at the same
time because thermal power stations emit gases that cause environmental
problems we also need to look closely at these problems and strive to

                                                                                          009
                                                                                   hitachi group
                                                                                   sustainability
                                                                                    report 2013




minimize the environmental burden so that we can be in harmony with the
environment if the environmental burden goes beyond tolerable limits it
will be necessary to use renewable energy such as solar and wind power
however renewable energy relies on the weather and the power that is
produced fluctuates enormously robust management must be used to
deal with the impact on power transmission and distribution systems for a
stable reliable supply of power many of these complex issues will not be
easily resolved by the hitachi group alone but the basic approach of our
social innovation business is to deepen our understanding of the particular
issues to the greatest extent possible and to seek solutions together with
our customers and partners engaging in close dialogue with people around
the world we will use hitachi technologies to the full to help resolve social
issues

using innovation to build a sustainable society
the second challenge is innovation to deal with the complex issues facing
society we need to clarify these issues to the maximum extent possiblenot
an easy task many social issues by their nature have political economic and
historical dimensions we are developing certain technologies including
big data and data analytics to gather a wide range of social phenomena
from many perspectives into databases and to analyze that data to bring
about social and business innovations we need to overcome many hurdles
as we mobilize these technologies and apply methods for the experiential
and objective analysis of social behavior we believe that by taking on these
challenges as a group we can earn the trust of many people worldwide
through our commerce and that this will in turn grow our business the
hitachi group is committed to contributing to society through social
innovation business in other words we view our social innovation business
as the business of creating a sustainable society

this sustainability report presents the many activities that the hitachi group
carried out with a view to creating a sustainable society as you will see we
operate around the world in a huge range of capacities this report also lays
out hitachis management strategies and csr a diverse array of solutions
showing how hitachi contributes to society through business respects
human rights promotes diversity and helps to reduce the environmental
burden from production as we become a corporate citizen through our
activities around the world

as we have done in the past in the years ahead we will position our business
operations with a firm emphasis on the creation of a sustainable society

sustainability is a part of every business it has always been a core part of hitachi
and is incorporated throughout everything we do let me address three specific
sustainability areas


environmental  our north america environmental managers attend annual
meetings to share updates and discuss regulation requirements similar meetings
are held in mexico and brazil there are 80 sites in the americas from the
viewpoint of the environment and each site is categorized based on its degree
of environmental load to determine the amount of impact that it generates                      takashi hatchoji
                                                                                                group chairman for the americas
the environmental office has three priorities for corporate environmental                       chairman of the board of hitachi
activity business and communication compliance and management the latest                    america ltd

environmental policies and regulations are shared as are best practices across
the hitachi companies an internal website is used to promote guidelines and
contains four types of handbooks that cover major us environmental laws and
are now available in country appropriate languages


community  our community action committees operate in 36 locations
throughout north america these employeeled groups designate funding and
volunteerism activities the hitachi foundation supports this program but also
drives two additional programs that support and expand business practices
that create tangible and enduring economic opportunities for underprivileged
americans


employees  being aware of our business environment includes being aware of
our employees diverse teams create better products for the marketplace and
by having all employees entered into our global human capital database we
can better manage where to locate the best talent and when that talent needs
training or education in addition many employee resource groups are growing
and providing additional support to our employees


in closing let me state that business sustainability is also important and
incorporating all sustainability issues into management decisions is vital for
success we will continue to cultivate strong community relationships and
develop our employees as they create innovative products and solutions

significant economic political social and environmental events have unfolded
in recent years pushing companies to look carefully at how they operate and do
business
for example asean was seen before as just a manufacturing hub for many
multinational companies and the indian subcontinent as just a big offshore
market today we clearly see that situations have dramatically changed these
areas now represent tremendous growth opportunities and are emerging as big
markets not only for hitachi but for other global companies as well
with the advent of progress social infrastructure improvements have been high                  kiyoaki iigaya
on the agenda of most of the regions leaders as more social infrastructures are               chief executive for asia hitachi ltd

built rapid urbanization normally follows and with growth each country in the                hitachi india pvt ltd

region today is faced with the issue of sustainability


for over a hundred years hitachi has maintained its role as a responsible
corporate citizen being a leading global company in the social innovation
business has given us an excellent platform to address the challenges of building
environmentallysound social infrastructures
to back up these commitments we announced in 2011 the appointment of
an environment representative for asean and india whose role among other
things is to promote environmentally conscious systems that prevent pollution
to lead sustainable business management and to supervise the full execution of
environmental compliance in every factory and office
addressing the issues of education is also part of our csr agenda we have been
implementing three educationrelated programs in the region that help towards
building the future generation the hinduhitachi scholarship program the
hitachi young leaders initiative and the hitachi scholarship
moving forward we are expanding our csr activities to include dialogues with
various stakeholders and introducing a human rights management system
stakeholder dialogues will help identify social issues understand what is
expected of us and to reflect this in our management and strategy at the same
time the human rights management system will seek to evaluate current human
rights and find ways to improve it
the initiatives that hitachi asia ltd is advancing show our recommitment to
actively engage ourselves as part of the asean and indian communities to build
a more sustainable society

business operations by maintaining the independence of inhouse and group
companies we clarified responsibilities and authority while respecting management
independence and original innovation this has speeded up management and enhanced
competitiveness since fiscal 2010 we have rated each company and transferred
authority to ensure swift independent management

sixgroup management structure
in april 2012 we reorganized the entire hitachi group into five groups to achieve an
increased focus on growing fields this move was designed to enable a rapid response to
the worldwide dynamic changes in business models and services centered on our social
infrastructure business in april 2013 the automotive equipment business which was an
element of the infrastructure systems group was split off to form the new automotive
systems group reorganizing the group management structure into six groups this
change will bring about quicker management decision making for automotive
components because in the future there will be accelerating changes in the needs of
regions and of customers

reducing the frequency and impact of risks globally by strengthening
policies and programs to meet the goals of the midterm
management plan



reinforcing the risk management system
we manage the business and operational risks of every division with internal audits the
entire hitachi group is reinforcing management systems to address increasingly global
and complex risks since fiscal 2009 we have consolidated information on all risks for all
inhouse companies hitachi group companies research centers and regional
headquarters outside japan in addition to traditional risks including natural disasters or
business risks such as the market environment and raw material prices these risks also
include environmental and reputational risks human rights risks that cover employee
diversity and poor working conditions within the supply chain as well as other risks that
could impact hitachis credibility and business sustainability
we will reinforce our comprehensive risk management framework within which our
assessment standards are fully examined where accumulated risk information is analyzed
and evaluated in greater detail and where responses to the results of these analyses and
evaluations are examined at the management level in addition we will improve risk
awareness among all employees through information sharing education and training



business continuity plans
being deeply committed to the social infrastructure
we are enhancing our business continuity plans
bcps to guard against risks that could cause an
interruption to business operations that impact

influenza that gave rise to fears of a pandemic1 we
set up a special organization called the risk
management headquarters headed by our president
in the event of a worldwide outbreak the risk
management headquarters would take the lead in
securing the safety of all hitachi group employees and       pandemic simulation drill
their families every effort would be made to ensure
that operations essential for maintaining social functions such as helplines logistics
information systems medical services and public security would continue without
interruption as part of these preparations we formulated the guidelines for pandemic
influenza preparedness in 2009 we distributed these to all hitachi group companies in
fiscal 2010 after translating them into english and chinese in fiscal 2011 we further
enhanced preparedness by collaborating with three hitachi group service businesses to
conduct a joint drill based on the scenario of a novel influenza pandemic
1 pandemic an infectious disease epidemic that spreads to a geographically wide area


tabletop exercise to prepare for largescale disasters
since fiscal 1998 hitachi ltd has held annual disaster
simulation drills covering 20 sites throughout japan
during these drills teams of people make decisions
under disaster scenario conditions that have been
developed over three to six months and include a
range of crises the objective is to verify and improve
the effectiveness of prevention plans for large
disasters in fiscal 2012 we held a drill in the kansai
                                                              drill at kansai area operation
region which has already experienced the great
hanshinawaji earthquake and where there is now concern about the potential for the
simultaneous occurrence of three large earthquakes known as the tokai tonankai and
nankai earthquakes business site risk managers participating in the drills reported on
their drills and the results at a general assembly for around 200 officers responsible for
handling risk we are constantly improving bcps to address large disasters by sharing the
results of these tabletop drills we also hold monthly drills that use a satellite
communications system

managing risk overseas
the growing geographic scope of our operations is also increasing business travel to
dangerous areas the hitachi group puts peoples lives first so since fiscal 1993 we have
operated a 24hour international travel call center system focused on overseas
emergency medical care we also run overseas risk management courses for employees
about to work outside japan and young employees entering overseas experience
programs in fiscal 2012 around 1600 employees took part in these courses
to ensure employee safety in countries and regions with a particularly high travel risk we
send in local survey missions that include external experts to identify and institute specific
risk management measures recognizing that the hostage incident in algeria in january
2013 increased the risk of similar incidents occurring around the world a presidents
message was issued to remind all employees to take extra care to ensure safety and we
have bolstered risk management partnerships worldwide



responding to the great east japan earthquake
when the massive earthquake followed by a devastating tsunami hit japans tohoku
region and pacific coast on march 11 2011 we responded by immediately setting up the
emergency headquarters for response to largescale earthquakes to confirm the safety
of all employees and their families while assessing the damage many hitachi group
facilities in fukushima and ibaraki prefectures were heavily damaged we expected that
restoration would take a long time but key business sites completed their recovery
within a month and restarted most of their production this swift turnaround is a
testament to the support received from related entities outside hitachi and the
emergency preparedness of business sites within hitachi on march 23 we broadened
the role of the emergency headquarters to create the hitachi group headquarters for
postearthquake reconstruction and redevelopment headed by hiroaki nakanishi
president of hitachi ltd this group functions as a control tower for the hitachi group
gathering information on damage and providing increased efficiency for support and
restoration work by consolidating of assistance requests empowering hitachi to
undertake concerted efforts to restore areas hit by disasters



reputation management
all hitachi group companies share the hitachi brand globally while this generates group
synergies for innovation and trust in the brand we recognize that accidents and rumors
can damage the brand around the world we have set up communication divisions at
regional headquarters outside japan to handle reputational risk these divisions ensure
the broad recognition of our activities by regularly communicating with local media and
government agencies as well as members of nongovernmental organizations and
opinion leaders in each market who are particularly interested in human rights and
environmental issues these divisions work hard to prevent public misconceptions about
our business management

as we expand internationally we are deepening compliance
knowledge and awareness among hitachi group companies
worldwide instilling and reinforcing even more stringent compliance
practices to ensure fair competition



enhancing framework for promoting compliance
the hitachi group codes of conduct were formulated in 2010 and are implemented
among hitachi group companies we have also developed inhouse regulations and
instituted bribery prevention measures to maintain fair business practices we use audits
including internal control assessment procedures and a compliance reporting system to
check the results of our compliance system and to promptly identify and address
breaches promoting robust and more sustainable management and business practices
as of april 2013 our senior vice president and executive officer has been appointed
chief compliance officer to further enhance our global compliance framework

formulating and ensuring awareness of the hitachi group codes
of conduct
hitachi ltd formulated the hitachi group codes of conduct as
specific common conduct codes for the hitachi group this was in
line with the shift to a new group management structure to mark
hitachis centennial based on translations of this document into 19
languages so far consolidated subsidiaries worldwide then
formulated their own codes of conduct in line with the same content
to ensure broader awareness of the codes we produced the hitachi
group codes of conduct handbook in fiscal 2011 as a resource for the hitachi group codes of
entire hitachi group we also produced english and chinese versions       conduct handbook

of an existing japaneselanguage elearning tool that teaches
appropriate behavior and presents specific examples to publicize initiatives for hitachi
group companies within and outside of japan we are extending training to business
sites of hitachi group companies worldwide and we are asking managers to submit a
written statement confirming that they have taken the course and that they pledge to
comply with the hitachi group codes of conduct

the 44 case studies were mapped to the chapters in the handbook so that employees
could discuss the issues relevant to their own workplaces we also translated the case
studies into english and chinese for use in hitachi global operations 219688 employees
in 23038 groups and departments have taken part in discussions and 11490 employees
attended lectures given by internal and external speakers on the topic



preventing corrupt practices involving public officials
hitachi group is focusing on the infrastructure business in emerging countries
recognizing that global compliance will become ever more important we formulated
groupwide rules and guidelines in october 2008 we are ensuring adherence through
audits and education
in october 2012 we held a lecture on bribery prevention and competition law in
vietnam and singapore that was attended by 10 compliance officers in vietnam and 26
in singapore in march 2013 we invited a speaker to give a lecture to 207 officers on
building and operating a global compliance framework



compliance reporting system
we instituted a groupwide whistleblowing system to prevent illegal and unethical
behavior to promptly address infractions and to enhance our ability to selfregulate
people can report directly to the compliance division at hitachi or to an outside attorney
this system can be used not only by hitachi employees but also by former employees
temporary staff and business partners another systemchannel to the board of
directorshas been introduced to allow employees to report problems anonymously
directly to hitachis board of directors



preventing violations of the antimonopoly law
the hitachi group operates on the principles of conformance with the law and business
ethics and fair and disciplined competition however it is with regret that hitachi ltd
was penalized for impairing the fairness of a public bid in fiscal 2002 and we received
administrative orders in september 2006 october 2008 and march 2009 for violating
japans antimonopoly law
in november 2012 a subsidiary established during an incorporationtype company split
received administrative orders for violating the antimonopoly law we deeply regret
these violations and have worked hard to boost awareness of compliance issues in
several ways including publicizing messages from top executives who also conduct
individual interviews with sales staff
in fiscal 2012 we held four education sessions for 76 sales managers using a group
discussion format to address familiar relevant cases during the corporate ethics and
compliance month discussion sessions on the antimonopoly law were also held in each
division and department with 7570 employees attending we intend to improve the
compliance awareness of all employees by stepping up auditing and education

for basic export control we use the hitachi standards of corporate conduct which                        report 2013

states that we shall help maintain international peace and security through compliance
with trade laws and regulations we adopted rules for controlling security exports based
on this policy in 1987 and we strive for the strictest possible export controls this means
promoting legal compliance and screening for destination countries and regions as well
as end use and enduser of all goods and technologies intended for export in addition
we promote groupwide export controls by providing guidance to all hitachi group
companies on the rules and organizations for export control also we support education
and compliance training to make certain that every hitachi employee follows the same
export control policies in fiscal 2012 we provided practical training on export control
through workinglevel meetings and workshops for group companies in europe china
and india in fiscal 2012 we held a basic elearning course on us reexport controls
within the hitachi group for around 66000 employees in japan and we supplied english
and chinese versions of the course to group companies worldwide in fiscal 2012 the

ropits singlepassenger mobilitysupport robot for autonomous
locomotion on footpaths
hitachi is conducting rd on human symbiotic
robots that coexist with and provide services to
people supporting the needs of a future society
with a high proportion of elderly people
announced in march 2013 ropits robot for
personal intelligent transportation system was
developed to support shortdistance
transportation for the elderly or those with walking
difficulties it is a singlepassenger robot that
autonomously navigates along walkways since
march 2011 hitachi has been participating in the
mobility robot experiment special district in
tsukuba city ibaraki prefecture to make
autonomous travel technology more practical
                                                        urban vehicle ropits
through pilot tests on realworld walkways we
have improved the convenience of robots as a transport support service as well as their
reliability in autonomous travel and the safety of robotpedestrian interaction a ropits
only requires the passenger to specify a pickup and dropoff point on a smartphone or
tablet then the ropits delivers them to their destination

highly efficient 11 kw permanent magnet synchronous motor without
rare earth metals
in fiscal 2012 hitachi ltd and hitachi
industrial equipment systems co ltd
developed a highly efficient 11 kw
permanent magnet synchronous motor that
does not use magnetic materials containing
rare earth metals such as neodymium and
dysprosium instead this motor uses an iron
based amorphous metal1 in the core of the          conventional motor left and 11kw highly efficient
motor                                                 permanent magnet synchronous motor right

in 2008 the two companies established the basic technology for a rare earth metalfree
motor to further increase capacity and efficiency technologies such as structural
optimization and core loss minimization were developed and applied to create a medium
capacity 11 kw motor compared with conventional motors of the same class the new
motor is smaller and has an energy efficiency of approximately 93 percent conforming to
the ie42 standard the highest level in the international electrotechnical commission
iec efficiency guidelines the technology will be further developed toward a fiscal 2014
product launch

intellectual property ip is a key element of hitachis business
strategy we are developing a global patent portfolio and promoting
ip activities focusing on social innovation business we are also
conducting anticounterfeiting activities to protect the hitachi brand
and we are working on international standardization to expand our
business to other markets



ip activities supporting global operations
our ip activities support global operations including building a global patent portfolio to
prevent other companies from using our technologies without authorization and to
demonstrate the advantages of the technologies to customers in some cases we use our
patent portfolio to forge crosslicensing agreements with other companies creating
smooth business operations without constraint on ips for those companies

 key indicators

                                                             1
   patent application ratios outside japan
   the goal in building our global patent and ip portfolio was to increase our patent application ratio
   outside japan from 47 percent in fiscal 2009 to 55 percent by fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2012 this ratio
   was 57 percent achieving ahead of time the 2012 midterm management plan goal of an overseas
   revenue ratio of more than 50 percent




   1 hitachi ltd and consolidated subsidiaries
   2 fy 2012 target
   3 the number of pct patent cooperation treaty applications is converted and counted based on the number of
      countries in which hitachi is expected to obtain patents




next steps
to efficiently build and maintain a global patent portfolio we will continue to file pct
applications we will also conduct ip activities that support our business operations
including anticounterfeiting programs to protect the hitachi brand and we will
participate in international standardization to grow markets

respect for intellectual property
we respect the intellectual property rights iprs of others as we expect them to respect
ours we follow inhouse rules1 and conduct preliminary searches of others patents
before undertaking rd on new products and technologies in order to avoid ipr
infringements for iprs that belong to others we obtain licenses from ipr holders before
we use their ip if any company is found to have infringed our iprs we encourage them
to acquire the necessary license and will take legal action if necessary
1 inhouse rules the hitachi group codes of conduct state we will respect the intellectual property of other
   parties we will prevent violations of other parties intellectual property rights in advance and for the smooth
   progress of business we will investigate other parties intellectual property rights beforehand when engaged in
   research development design production and sales of new products or new technologies and implement
   appropriate measures when any doubts arise

anticounterfeiting activities
protecting the hitachi brand is crucial to support our global operations and the hitachi
brand is now registered as a trademark in more than 200 countries and regions we
operate a rigorous regime against infringements such as making and selling counterfeit
goods carrying the hitachi brand and illegally applying for or registering trademarks
similar to the hitachi brand
the standard anticounterfeiting measures are to send warnings to manufacturers
distributors wholesalers and vendors who infringe our iprs andor to report these
occurences to administrative agencies recognizing however that the supply of
counterfeit products exists only where there is demand we are also educating consumers
about these products for example in fiscal 2011 we took part together with other
japanese companies in the third educational and advising event for primary school
pupils in beijing on protection of iprs hosted by the jetro beijing office and the
education committee of the copyright society of china at the event the importance of
protecting ip was explained to students at 10 elementary schools in beijing
we invest significant resources in ip programs for customs officials as the most effective
way of preventing infringements focusing particularly on china and the middle east we
also hold seminars and workshops in cooperation with local law enforcement agencies
governments and authorities to seek their assistance with our anticounterfeiting
initiatives

reward system for employee inventions
we motivate employees on the rd frontlines with a reward system for new inventions
to ensure that the reward system operates fairly and transparently we set standards to
evaluate inventions and disclose these standards to employees we also have a
mechanism for receiving inquiries about the rewards as well as opinions on the reward
system
we have set up a special division within the intellectual property group to plan and
operate this system an internal invention management committee made up of rd
legal affairs personnel management and ip experts ensures that the system operates
effectively across the whole group as part of the system we have developed an
invention information channel to promote communication between inventors and the
business divisions using their inventions inventors can ask the business divisions for
information about their patent implementation status and check the evaluation
standards used to calculate the rewards for their inventions to ensure transparency and
inventor satisfaction we also set up an arbitration committee for invention rewards
with the same composition as the invention management committee inventors can
appeal directly to this arbitration committee if they disagree with the amount they have
been rewarded
from fiscal 2005 we have given presidents awards to the top 100 inventors as of fiscal
2006 we have also awarded the top 50 young inventors under 35 years old based on
receiving patent application rewards within five years of them joining hitachi

cultivating human capital
we drive ipr initiatives forward by cultivating employees who are highly skilled and
globally aware as of april 1 2013 our intellectual property group had 106 registered
patent attorneys and six lawyers registered in the us every year we send six employees
from our intellectual property group to patent and law offices in the us and europe for
internships

hitachi builds corporate value by promoting the 2012 midterm
management plan and by improving business performance to
bolster and expand our social innovation business worldwide we
must improve our brand recognition and reputation in every market
and establish the hitachi brand in the social innovation business
arena in fiscal 2013 we will expand our social innovation business
globally as one hitachi in line with the 2015 midterm management
plan and pursue global brand management that contributes to
achieving that plan we will increase hitachis brand value globally so
that we become a company preferred by customers investors and
outstanding job applicants which in turn will improve our brand
value even more we will realize this positive cycle across the hitachi
group and communicate globally with stakeholders toward a fuller
understanding of hitachi to increase the value of our brand



global brand strategy
for developing social innovation business globally we
need to communicate our vision to stakeholders to
do this we will enhance the hitachi brand value by
implementing a groupwide brand strategy that
globally integrates public relations investor relations advertising the internet and csr
activities in fiscal 2013 we created a new vision this vision together with the mission
and values passed on since hitachis founding were articulated as the hitachi group
identity our focus now as one hitachi will be on promoting international
communications expanding our social innovation business globally and enhancing
hitachis brand value we will also present the hitachi group identity to all our
stakeholders building understanding of our direction for the future

             hitachi group identity
             httpwwwhitachicomaboutcorporateidentityindexhtml




evaluating our global brand strategy
every year we conduct surveys to get an objective overview of the strengths of hitachis
brand in global markets examining the degree of recognition and the reputation of the
hitachi brand in key markets we use these findings to review brand initiatives in line
with the 2012 midterm management plan and assist with the development of regional
and business strategies working to boost brand value
in fiscal 2012 we conducted surveys in 11 countries1 the midterm management plan
calls for global expansion of our social innovation business as a key business area but
markets still have a strong perception of hitachi as a japanese appliance or consumer
products manufacturer moreover while we are better known in some regions
recognition of the hitachi brand is certainly not high compared with our competitors we
need to further improve that brand recognition and build our image as a social

tackling environmental concerns as a group to
resolve energy and environmental issues
the environmental report 2013 provides an overview of
hitachi group environmental initiatives where we are
making steady progress guided by the major policies laid
down in our environmental vision


one particular focus in fiscal 2012 was reducing energy
use in response to the call for energy conservation
following the great east japan earthquake in the
summer we introduced electricity visualization systems
into our main japanese facilities and offices showing
employees how much power was being used across
hitachi as a whole in real time raised their awareness of
efficient power use and enabled us to cut our peak power
consumption by 164 mw in fiscal 2010 we intend to
further improve our energy efficiency groupwide


we are also communicating globally on environmental
issues and company initiatives we are deeply involved in
the world business council for sustainable development

management plan coming to an end and the 2015 mid
term management plan beginning we have revised our
environmental action plan from the traditional fiveyear
format to three years to better integrate our management

product throughout its life cycle as a milestone on the way to realizing this
environmental vision we drew up the longterm plan environmental vision 2025
looking ahead to fiscal 2025

longterm plan environmental vision 2025
the intergovernmental panel on climate change1 ipcc concluded in its fourth
assessment report that global warming is real and that human activities are involved in
this warming the area of sea ice in the arctic ocean in 2012 was the smallest ever
recorded due to this warming shrinking by an amount double the size of the japanese
archipelago since 2007 the year the ice was at its smallest size in the past2 the report
further stated that co2 emissions will have to peak by 2015 and be reduced by 50 to 85
percent of their 2000 levels by the year 2050 to meet the minimum stabilized density
scenario 450 ppm for greenhouse gases
the international energy agency iea has drawn up a co2 emission reduction scenario
allocating the amount of reductions for the supply and demand of power to meet the
450 ppm stabilization scenario hitachi conducts business widely in both of these sectors

world outlook for energyrelated co2 emissions and reduction scenarios




                                       based on energyrelated co2 emissions in iea world energy outlook 2012


for this reason the longterm plan hitachi group environmental vision 2025 targets the
prevention of global warming one of the issues that the world is facing today and states
our goal of helping reduce annual co2 emissions by 100 million tonnes by 2025 through
hitachi products and services
this means that as we reduce co2 emissions through greater efficiency and other means
our contribution to curbing co2 emissions through the use of our products and services
will be 100 million tonnes per year by 2025 compared with the products of the base year
fiscal 2005 the target of 100 million tonnes was calculated based on growth strategies in
each business sector some 70 percent of the reductions are being targeted in the power
sector 20 percent in the industrial sector and 10 percent in the transportation
commercial and residential sectors to reach these goals we are working to increase the
ratio of our products that are hitachi ecoproducts with a reduced burden on the

and services
to reduce the environmental burden of products and services we
take steps to help reduce co2 emissions through products conserve
resources and manage chemical substances we assess each of these
factors at the design and development phase and designate those
products that meet the standards as ecoproducts and promote the
development of environmentally conscious products and services



increasing the ratio of ecoproducts
we develop environmentally conscious products called ecoproducts as part of our efforts
to make the burden on the environment of our products and services as small as possible
ecoproducts that meet even more demanding requirements are designated as eco
products select
ecoproducts must meet specific environmentally conscious criteria for the design and
development of products and services these criteria are set in our assessment for dfe
design for environment which is used for the evaluation process to make all our
products and services ecoproducts by fiscal 2025 we have set targets for raising the eco
product sales ratio which is the ratio of ecoproduct sales to total product sales

activities and results
in fiscal 2012 we created a chinese language version of the ecoproduct registration
database system in addition to the english and japanese versions to enable registering
the results directly from product designers outside japan these initiatives helped
increase the number of models designated as ecoproducts to 11731 up 1255 from the
previous fiscal year and our ecoproduct sales ratio to 84 percent topping our goal of 81
percent

   1 ecoproduct sales are the sales of all products excluding those elements that hitachi cannot control or influence
      in terms of environmental impacts such as patent income

   ecoproduct increase




development of ecoproducts
in 1999 we introduced assessment for dfe design for environment which sets specific
environmentally conscious criteria for designing and developing products and services to
minimize their environmental burden products that meet dfe standards are designated
as ecoproducts
in assessment for dfe the environmental load for each product life cycle stagefrom
material procurement to production distribution use and disposalis assessed using
eight dfe criteria including environmental protection measures and energy saving the
results are recorded as 1 through 5 for a product to be designated an ecoproduct it
must score at least level 2 the reference level before the latest major model change in all
eight assessment criteria and its average over all the criteria must be level 3 or more

   energy this value indicates the rate of achievement for energy efficiency targets of certain home appliances
   the target values are defined using the most energyefficient products available at the time


global warming prevention factor calculation
the global warming prevention factor indicates the amount of improvement in efficiency
of global warming prevention compared with a reference product the efficiency of
global warming prevention is based on the concept of environmental efficiency that
balances the value of products contributing to the quality of life and the reduction of
their environmental load we measure the improvement in product value by function
and life span using the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over the product life cycle
to calculate the reduced environmental load




resource factor calculation
the resource factor indicates the amount of improvement in resource efficiency
compared with a reference product drawing on the same concept as global warming
prevention efficiency we measure the improvement in product value by function and
lifespan using the amount of resources used over the product life cycle1 to calculate the
reduced environmental load
1 amount of resources used over the products life cycle amount of new resources  wasted resources

the carbon footprint of products cfp is the co2 equivalent of     hitachi unified storage150
the total amount of greenhouse gases ghgs emitted over the
entire life cycle of a product or servicefrom procurement of
raw materials through to disposal and recycling making the
ghg emission amount visible in this way boosts peoples
interest in buying products with low carbon emissions and
encourages businesses to reduce the amount of carbon emitted
by their products over the whole life cycle a number of
countries around the world use the cfp approach
we participate in the carbon footprint communication
program of the japan environmental management association
for industry jemai launched in 2012 continuation of the cfp
pilot project run by the japanese ministry of economy trade
and industry meti and other ministries in december 2012 we
were authorized to display the cfp label on our ocr1 scanners following earlier
approval for use on servers and storage equipment for each of these products we are
able to show the co2 reduction rate per function per page in the case of ocr scanners
compared with conventional products these products and their cfp labels were on
display at ecoproducts 2012 held from december 13 to 15 2012

disclosure of environmental information
in 1999 hitachi introduced an environmental information labeling system that uses
symbols and datasheets to provide environmental information on environmentally
conscious products hitachis environmental mark indicates that assessment for dfe has
shown the product to be an ecoproduct informing stakeholders that the products
environmental burden has been reduced our website also discloses environmental
information such as datasheets that include power consumption for each
environmentally conscious product and case studies of products that helped to improve
environmental efficiency

reduce annual co2 emissions by 100 million tonnes by 2025 through hitachi products
and services
this means that as we reduce co2 emissionsby improving the environmental efficiency
of products and by other meansour contribution to lowering co2 emissions through
the use of our products and services by 2025 from the base year of fiscal 2005 will be 100
million tonnes annually
to achieve our targets for contributing to reduced co2 emissions we have set as our
leading indicator to make all of our products hitachi ecoproducts with a reduced
burden we are working with partners in global markets to expand business
opportunities while we develop environmentally conscious products and create new
businesses

activities and results
our contribution to co2 reduction in fiscal 2012 was 2274 million tonnes a wide range
of products and services contributed to the reduction in emissions including high
efficiency thermal power plants and inverters energysaving information systems and
parts and materials for use in energysaving products after the great east japan
earthquake in 2011 our plans for installing electric power facilities were altered and we
fall short of the targeted amount of 23 million tonnes

the decision to install this equipment was made in january 2012 as a measure for
boosting supply capacity in the summer of 2012 as the utility struggled to meet demand
the plant was therefore built in a very short time being completed in approximately four
months from the start of construction through to commercial operation the new plant
will contribute to an annual reduction in co2 emissions of 37000 tonnes1

to promote resource recycling the hitachi group is developing recycling technologies                                          report 2013

and creating and operating systems for the reuse and recycling of endoflife products
we are working steadily on solving the difficult problems one at a time for completing
the cycle from product manufacturing to taking back endoflife products recycling
resources and using recycled materials


rare earth magnet separation and recycling
in the past it has been difficult to safely and cheaply extract rare earth magnets due to
their strong magnetic fields so reusing these valuable resources has not been successful
we have developed a technologyapplicable to hard disk drives and air conditioner
compressorsthat partially automates disassembly highly efficiently separating rare earth
magnets from these products after degaussing the magnets the recovered rare earth
magnets are provided to magnet manufacturers who use them to make new products

recycling of rare earth magnet




recycling and reusing informationtelecommunications products
endoflife it products need to be handled carefully
due both to the need for information security and the
safe disposal of waste materials through our sales
division we propose plans to our customers for taking
back endoflife it products for recycling and reuse
the hard disk drives that are taken back are physically
destroyed and their rare earth magnets are retrieved
so that we can recycle these resources in fiscal 2012
                                                                                  taking back of it products
we extracted 2620 kg of rare earth magnets from
approximately 200000 hard disk drives

the industry in recycling fabricated
counterweights traditionally considered
difficult to recycle to realize a material cycle
the company recovered and recycled
around 1300 tonnes from fiscal 2006 to
fiscal 2012 construction machinery
counterweights are used to balance
machines and are made by casting or are
fabricated from metal cast metal
counterweights have traditionally been
recycled because of their resource value
fabricated counterweights however
contain filler material such as lowpurity iron
ore and scrap metal1 within the steel outer
shell so they were disposed of as industrial
waste hitachi construction machinery
passes the endoflife fabricated
counterweights to a recycling specialist for
separation a counterweight manufacturer
then uses the recycled materials to make
counterweights which hitachi construction
machinery buys and uses
1 scrap from steel plate cutting or stamping

and prevent global warming

actions and achievements
co2 emissions per unit production is an indicator of reduced co2 emissions we achieved
a reduction of 22 percent in fiscal 2012 surpassing the target of 7 percent for further
reductions we are continuing to install highefficiency equipment and devices from led
lighting to inverter air conditioners and are reducing energy consumption by improving
manufacturing processes we are also raising environmental awareness by monitoring
electric power consumption and co2 emissions at every inhouse and group company
and visually displaying target achievements on the company intranet

introducing renewable energy
we are promoting the use of solar wind power and other forms of
renewable energy in fiscal 2012 797 mwh of electricity were
generated from renewable energy mainly from solar power
generation at our omika works in ibaraki prefecture 940 kw and
the yokohama office in kanagawa prefecture 500 kw we also
contracted for green electricity certifications of 1000 mwh
                                                                                                             green power logo from
through japan natural energy company limited using these to                                                 green power certification

participation in the lowcarbon society action plan
the hitachi group hitachi industrial equipment systems co ltd hitachi appliances
inc hitachi medical corporation hitachi kokusai electric inc and hitachi ltd takes part
in the electric and electronic industrys action plan toward a lowcarbon society aiming
to achieve the common target for the industry of improving the energy consumption rate
per unit by an annual average of 1 percent between now and 2020

green curtain project
to conserve electricity climbing vines were planted along building windows and walls
forming green curtains that lower the room temperature inside buildings this
continuing project begun in fiscal 2011 is being used at more than 200 hitachi group
sites and at the homes of some employees in december 2012 we held the hitachi group
green curtain contest presenting awards in the group and individual categories for
activities during the year

consumption during transportation as well as overall transportation energy hitachi
appliances inc in cooperation with hitachi transport system ltd is implementing
container round use from the tochigi works aggressively promoting this project while
matching nearby business partners




next steps
our measures to reduce energyrelated co2 emissions include the scheduled introduction
of led lighting inverter air conditioners and other highefficiency equipment and
devices we also use energy conservation diagnoses to determine the potential for
improvement as we aim for a high level of energy conservation including improvements
in production processes target acheivement is tracked visually and individual reduction
measures are supported based on the extent of progress as we work to raise the overall
level of reduction by the group

we have been working to calculate ghg greenhouse gas emissions throughout the                                                     report 2013

entire value chain

activities and results
in fiscal 2012 we carried out trial calculations using a methodology based on ministry of
the environment guidelines we found that the category with the most ghg emissions
was the use of sold products accounting for 92 percent of the total this was followed by
purchased products and services and then indirect energyrelated emissions we believe
it is important to focus first on those categories with the most ghg emissions so that we
can efficiently reduce the amount of emissions

categories of ghg emissions in the value chain




scope 1 direct ghg emissions by the company
scope 2 indirect emissions from electricity heat and steam supplied to and used by the company
scope 3 indirect emissions other than scope 1 and 2 emissions by others related to the companys
activities
inhouse within the scope of the companys organizational boundaries in principle the scope of all
business activities of the company itself and activities within or controlled by its consolidated subsidiaries
upstream in principle activities related to purchased products and services
downstream in principle activities related to sold products and services

generated per unit production by 9 percent compared with fiscal 2005 the base year
while the assembly industry group2 reduced this by 16 percent by implementing various
measures such as reducing the amount of waste plastic and recycling resources both
groups achieved their targets

using it for managing waste
in 2012 we improved a system that manages the status of general waste and valuable
waste generated at each facility this has made it easier to analyze waste by type and
helped us to effectively implement measures to raise the recycling rate to recycle
valuable resources and to improve the landfill rate
we intend to boost the hitachi group emanifest1 registration ratio to at least 90
percent by fiscal 2015 as of fiscal 2012 109 facilities had introduced emanifest systems
raising the registration rate to 56 percent

examples waste reduction by introducing returnable transportation
packaging
at hitachi hightechnologies corporation the packaging used for shipping products
between japan and manufacturing sites around the world was changed from cardboard
to returnable boxes made of plastic with aluminum frames the company has reduced
the amount of cardboard that used to be thrown away as waste in japan lowering the
environmental burden the returnable box is designed strong and safe to be used for
double stack shipping in a freight container this is helping to reduce the number of
containers as well as to improve transport efficiency




               conventional cardboard box                                                   returnable box


next steps
to achieve the targets in the environmental action plan we will promote waste
reduction from a global perspective by working on minimizing waste generation
reducing waste in landfills and raising resource recycling rates mindful of each countrys
circumstances we will continue to steadily reduce waste by implementing appropriate
measures as well as by sharing information in the hitachi group

communicate the risks to deepen local residents understanding of how we manage
chemical substance risk

cegnet chemical substance management system
since 1998 we have operated a database for chemical substances management called
cegnet to index the latest laws and regulations and our own voluntary regulations
ensuring the management of newly introduced chemical substances chemical
substances used in our operations are also registered with cegnet collecting and
aggregating data on the amount of chemical substances used emitted or transferred
helps to reduce our use of chemicals

cegnet chemical substance management system




activities and results
to prevent air pollution we cut emissions of 41 volatile organic compounds vocs based
on a program from the ministry of the environment in japan in 2012 we raised painting
efficiency by changing paint and improving processes and achieved our target by
strengthening the pdca plan do check act cycle based on the data collected in japan
every three months and outside japan every six months
we comply with japans prtr law1 through groupwide monitoring of chemical
substances released into the atmosphere or into public waters removed outside our
plants as waste or discharged into sewage systems reporting this to local japanese
governments although some substances are exempt from reporting due to their small
quantities our policy is to keep data on all prtr substances 10 kilograms or more per
year recognizing the need to control these substances as well

regulatory requirements considering the environmental burden of all our business
activities at every business site we regularly monitor water quality and noise for
example and work to minimize environmental risks

monitoring environmental performance data
for effective environmental management we collect environmental performance data
on business operations using the environmental load evaluation system this system
collects environmental load data from some 270 hitachi business sites worldwide on such
items as energy use co2 emissions and waste generated together with information on
outside complaints honors received and other items by analyzing this information we
identify environmental management issues share instructive examples within the group
and improve environmental practices specifically environmental performance data in
the key areas of energy waste materials water and vocs is collected and analyzed
monthly or quarterly so that the performance levels can be further raised

environmental activity evaluation system
we use our own evaluation system green 21 to improve the level and quality of our
environmental activities it divides environmental activities into eight categories and
evaluates achievements and progress toward action plan targets by rating 53 items on a
scale from 1 to 5 then showing the results on radar charts for any category a perfect
score is 100 green points gps the results of green 21 evaluations are incorporated into
the business performance evaluations of all hitachi inhouse companies and some group
companies we surpassed our fiscal 2012 target of 448 gps with a score of 489 gps as
we further raise the level of environmental activities we are aiming at a target of 640 gps
for fiscal 2015

we have made the preservation of ecosystems a pillar of our environmental vision and                                            report 2013

incorporated this into our action guidelines for environmental conservation in fiscal
2012 we focused on encouraging employees to understand the relationship between
corporate activities and ecosystems as well as world trends in this area and to reflect this
understanding in our business operations for these reasons we revised the hitachi
group guide to preservation of ecosystems that was originally issued in march 2011 and
conducted a trial of the business assessment on the preservation of ecosystems program
we were also active outside the company serving as cochair of the ecosystems focus
area of the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd we will
continue working to raise awareness and knowledge in the company and to carry out
medium to longterm programs involving the entire group in addition by taking action
outside the company we are laying the groundwork for other ecosystem preservation
initiatives

corporate relationship with ecosystems
corporations depend on ecosystem services or the benefits received from ecosystems
including raw materials such as fibers and wood and the ability of the ecosystem to
maintain the quality and quantity of air water and soil to continue receiving these
benefits and to restore ecosystems we believe that we can contribute to ecosystem
preservation through both business and social activities specifically for contributions
through business we are promoting designs and production that reduce the impact on
ecosystems during the product life cycle raw material procurement production
transportation use recovery recycling and appropriate disposal as well as increasing
the number of products and services for direct preservation of ecosystems through water
and air purification seeing chemical substance management as part of ecosystem
preservation we continue to ensure that it is carried out correctly for contributions to
society we encourage tree planting and ecological surveys of rare plants and animals by
employees in volunteer programs along with other programs that preserve ecosystems

corporations and ecosystems

    contribution of our products while the scope is still
    limited we are thinking about further improving this
    village we would particularly like to enhance the range
    and areas of activities to increase interest in satoyama
    conservation we are also thinking about strengthening
    collaborative creation with local officials and universities
    for example by using it to gather regional data and to
    collaborate with local data centers further contributing to
    ecosystem preservation

we have adopted and are making public environmental accounting procedures that                                                                     report 2013

conform to the environmental accounting guidelines issued by the ministry of the
environment in 2005 the results help us to raise the efficiency of environmental
investments and activities by more effectively allocating management resources to our
ongoing efforts that benefit the environment the increase in rd expenditures related
to the environment in recent years has resulted in higher environmental protection costs
at the same time environmental investments were down year on year this is mainly
because large expenditures were accelerated in fiscal 2011 to deal with changes in
electric power supply and demand

one priority in the 2012 midterm management plan is to expand our
global procurement ratio particularly by increasing purchasing in
emerging countries this will reinforce our competitiveness in global
markets and our operational foundation in procurement we respect
human rights including basic work rights of everyone in our supply
chain we collaborate with suppliers in promoting csr by sharing
guidelines and communicating proactively



promoting global procurement
using the 2012 midterm management plan we intended to raise the hitachi groups
global procurement ratio from 36 percent fiscal 2010 to 50 percent by fiscal 2012 we
therefore formulated the hitachi group midterm procurement strategic plan the key
aims were to establish global partnerships to create group procurement strategies to
stabilize the supply of materials and to reinforce csr and sustainability within the supply
chain in fiscal 2012 however the impact of factors such as changes in the parameters of
our business portfolio kept the global procurement ratio at 38 percent in fiscal 2011 we
appointed procurement officers for the first time to oversee local procurement in china
the rest of asia europe and the americas these officers are responsible for expanding
the pool of suppliers in emerging markets as well as for reinforcing our responsiveness to
csr risks a growing concern as the supply chain expands globally

and reliable relationships with all suppliers with an eye on the long term for these
reasons as well as the principle of free competition we disclose procurement items to all
suppliers inside and outside of japan to cultivate and expand our pool of suppliers
for this goal we held supplier meetings aimed at developing new supplier partners in
dalian in july 2012 istanbul in december and in kaohsiung and bangkok in march 2013
we will continue to develop relationships with suppliers in new areas in response to
globalization focusing on the emerging countries that we have positioned as major
markets



hitachi group csr procurement
csr risks are a growing concern as globalization accelerates recognizing that supply
chain procurement risk could cause management problems we are reinforcing our risk
identification and management systems to avoid and mitigate risk as much as possible

csr procurement promotion framework
to strengthen our csr supply chain management we established a csr green
procurement center within the hitachi headquarters in fiscal 2011 we have also
established the hitachi group csr green procurement committee which includes
committee members from our inhouse companies and group companies this completes
a framework that will enable our csr procurement and green procurement philosophy
and initiatives to be shared throughout the group

formulating a csr code of conduct and standards and informing suppliers
in fiscal 2009 we revised the hitachi group supply chain csr deployment guidebook
which conforms to the supply chain csr deployment guidebook of the japan electronics
and information technology industries association jeita our guidebook serves as a
csr code of conduct and standards that we expect our suppliers to comply with we
have distributed this guidebook to around 22000 suppliers of our inhouse companies
and group companies around 12000 sites of inhouse companies suppliers and around
10000 sites of group companies suppliers to inform them of their csr responsibilities

also requirements for reducing the environmental impact of products supplied to hitachi
such as conserving resources and energy in production recycling managing chemical
substances and fully disclosing related information
in fiscal 2012 we reviewed our categories for controlled chemical substances with a
particular focus on restricted substances authorized substances and svhcs substances
of very high concern as stipulated in europes registration evaluation authorisation and
restriction of chemicals reach regulations managing chemical substances within the
eu specific changes include 1 moving some chemicals to the prohibited substances list
2 further breaking down the controlled substances list and 3 adopting the industry
association list the guidelines were revised to match the changes and distributed to
suppliers
there is a global trend for strengthening regulations on chemical substances we have
built the a greenet an internetbased green procurement system to collect information
about chemical substances contained in products and other environmentrelated data
from suppliers as soon as it becomes available the goal is to manage chemicals carefully
under this system we encourage suppliers to use the msdsplus1ais2 reporting
templates published by jamp joint article management promotion consortium we
also encourage them to use information transmission systems and to minimize the
amount of labor involved
1 msdsplus a format for reporting chemical substances contained in products created by upstream companies
   chemical manufacturers for midstream companies molded product manufacturers etc
2 ais a format for reporting chemical substances contained in products created by midstream companies
   molded product manufacturers etc for downstream companies assembly manufacturers etc

response to the conflict minerals issue
in august 2012 the us securities and exchange commission sec adopted and issued a
final rule obliging companies with securities registered in the united states that use any
conflict minerals in their products to report this to the sec pursuant to article 1502 of the
doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which was signed into law
in july 2010 conflict minerals include columbitetantalite cassiterite gold and
wolframite the four minerals determined to be financing conflicts that are produced in
the democratic republic of congo the drc and adjoining countries together the
drc countries the goal of this law is to cut off revenues from armed groups that use
violence and violate human rights in the conflictridden drc countries
because hitachi ltd has not been listed in the united states since march 2012 we have
no legal obligation to report however we strive to ensure that we do not directly or
indirectly abet the human rights violations identified in the drc countries to continue
our responsible procurement practices we are working with group companies suppliers
and the industry association jeita to strengthen supply chain transparency and to ensure
that the minerals we procure do not finance or benefit armed groups committing human
rights violations

important our diversity training for managers features group discussions on specific
company or worksiterelated issues that encourage the adoption of a new mindset

approach to maximizing the potential of people and organizations we expect concrete
changes to emerge from all participants around 570 managers have participated in the
program from the second half of fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012

it is important that the workplace as a whole puts diversity and worklife management
into practice and that our diversity workshop approach is effective hitachis unique
diversity workshops use the world café approach bringing together employees
including senior executives and young employees to freely exchange opinions on
diversity and worklife management based on their own experiences more than 1000
hitachi group employees have already participated in these workshops prompting many
positive comments one person for example felt that the workshop had been invaluable
for sharing issues and opinions with senior staff and other employees in fiscal 2013 we
created a handbook so that group and inhouse companies can hold their own
workshops publicizing the approach across the group

particular to women such as putting careers on hold
for childbirth child care and concerns about balancing
work with child care women attend seminars with
their managers so that both can share attitudes and
approaches when returning to work this will ensure a
womans smooth return to work as well as
understanding and support from her managers and

unionhosted worklife balance partnership forum
labor unions are also proactively addressing worklife balance for example by holding
study meetings to boost awareness among their members in april 2013 the federation
of hitachi group workers unions held a partnership forum for union members from
group companies
at the forum company policies and programs on promoting diversity were highlighted
and an outside speaker gave a lecture on career development this was followed by
group discussions on workplace issues and their solutions for achieving a worklife
balance the forum gave participants the chance to think about their own worklife
balance furthering their understanding of the importance of taking concrete action for
better ways of working

support for womens leadership networks wlns in north america
hitachi ltd and all of our group companies believe that diversity of our business lines
technologies and people enables social innovation by embracing diversity and
differences hitachi can drive social innovation by developing individual talents and
cohesive teams that provide the best solutions for our global customers
one of the ways that hitachi promotes diversity and inclusion is by supporting womens
leadership networks wlns in north america as with any employee resource group
ergs or affinity groups these are open to men and women who have a shared interest
the wlns focus on topics such as professional development time management people
skills and networking opportunities the wln leaders at each company hold quarterly
teleconferences to share resources make book recommendations and discuss how their
groups are growing all employees are encouraged to create other ergs to support their
interests
in addition many of our locations host international appreciation days some of these
events tie into our annual north america food drive and others host learning days at
other times of the year one of our locations celebrated diversity by performing and
hosting a japanese tea ceremony where the employees learned about japans cultural
traditions and history
respecting differences increases employee satisfaction which in turn motivates
employees to work at their highest level both personally and professionally this in turn
translates into greater innovation company sustainability and growth we strive to
create an environment where the unique strengths and abilities of a wide array of people
are brought together to produce new value and develop innovative solutions

promoting diversity in europe
hitachi in europe continues to address diversity and inclusion driven by the reality of
demographic change an aging population and an intensifying war for talent in the
region having a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace culture is particularly
important for increasing innovation and therefore business performance
a recent annual survey of hitachi group companies in europe indicated that overall the
proportion of female employees in europe has remained the same as in 2012
approximately 29 percent there has been a small increase in the number of female
senior managers however more needs to be done to ensure that female managers are
equipped to take on senior level roles this issue is being addressed for example in 2012
four times more women graduated from hitachis european leadership programme than
in 2011
hitachi europe has seen a rise in the proportion of female managers from 21 percent in
2012 to 30 percent in 2013 our policy is to hire and promote the best candidates for
each position and in 2012 twice as many women as men were promoted to
management positions in recruitment processes standard job description terminology
was reviewed to make it more gender neutral and recruitment agencies were briefed on
implementing a more diversity friendly approach to attracting people to work for hitachi
three female managers were recruited to work for hitachi europe in 2012 a threefold
increase from 2011
a series of management level meetings was kicked off in december 2012 coinciding with
a visit by ms yukari tominaga executive officer hitachi solutions ms tominaga shared
her desire to improve gender diversity within hitachi with a number of female managers

partnerships with governments and policymakers around the world
are vital for growing our social innovation business to create a
sustainable society we are enhancing external relations so that we
can respond to social expectations as a company supplying social
infrastructure and then feeding back social and policy trends to
management



external relations promotion structure
background to and vision for government  external relations
partnerships with government institutions in and outside japan are becoming
increasingly critical for the global expansion of our social innovation business deepening
our relationships with the government institutions that are the main agents for social
infrastructure will enable us to more precisely identify local business needs and
contribute to the creation of optimal societies working with the japanese government
to best use the systems that the government has in place to support the export of
infrastructure business will also be a powerful business driver

external relations structure and mission
the government  external relations division was established within our headquarters in
fiscal 2009 to guide and accelerate the external relations of the entire hitachi group
responding to the management policy of strengthening our social innovation business
as well as the growing support offered by the japanese government for infrastructure
system exports through this division including executive managers we talk with
policymakers so that government institutions can get a better understanding of our
business we then offer policy recommendations with a view to stimulating industry as a
whole
in addition to appointing external relations personnel in inhouse companies and group
companies we have offices in washington dc and brussels to monitor policy trends and
to manage external relations initiatives in the us and europe to promote external
relations groupwide we hold regular meetings to share cases and issues with an eye to
boosting the efficiency of our activities

exports in fiscal 2012 executives attended the subcommittee on infrastructure and
advanced systems strategy under metis industrial structure council and the ministry of
land infrastructure transport and tourisms advisory council on promotion of
international infrastructure deployment proposing specific types of support

participating in business and industry associations
operating through business and industry associations is another critical aspect of our
external relations for example the european union parliament is currently revising the
proposal on the general data protection regulation for the protection of personal data
we are working as a member of the japan electronics and information technology
industries association jeita to put our views to the european union parliament as well
as to develop in consultation with meti a japanese industry response
hitachi is also a member of keidanren japan business federation serving as vice chair as
well as participating on several committees as the planning and coordination chair for
the subcommittee on europe we urged the japanese and european governments to
enter negotiations on a japaneu economic partnership agreement with that decision
reached in march 2013 we will continue to support the progress of negotiations

using government support
meti provides a program supporting global human resource development and the
creation of international networks part of their support for infrastructure system exports
in fiscal 2012 14 hitachi group employees took part in this program which sends for
several months workinglevel employees from private companies to government
institutions and local companies in emerging countries participating in this kind of
program will enable us to more accurately identify the needs of emerging countries
hitachi has also been contracted by the new energy and industrial technology
development organization nedo to participate in the japanus island grid project on
the island of maui in hawaii in a bid to convert 40 percent of the islands power
generation to renewable energies by 2030 this demonstration project running until the
end of fiscal 2014 is a collaboration with partners including the state of hawaii the
hawaiian electric company inc the university of hawaii and the pacific northwest
national laboratory

external relations in the us
the hitachi group corporate office in washington dc examines the impact on business
of us government legislation to promote mutual understanding and improve business
opportunities we communicate to key stakeholders how hitachis business can
contribute to the growth of us society
for example we launched the hitachi government relations network hgrn in fiscal
2011 with more than 20 membersprimarily from group companiesthe hgrn serves
as a venue for exchanging information on key laws and regulations that impact
management and business and for sharing the business impact of public policy the
hgrn also communicates with key policymakers in federal and state governments and
with other government representatives
we provide information to policymakers and government representatives on hitachis
specialist technologies in the social innovation business to convey directly and indirectly

external relations in europe
the hitachi corporate office europe located in brussels gathers analyzes and
disseminates information on policy trends in europe makes recommendations on
european union policies and serves as a link to european institutions participating in
european policy debates from the perspective of a global company will enable us to not
only understand the future business environment but to seize the opportunity to have
some influence on shaping it we believe that these activities will contribute to
maintaining an appropriate quality of management as a global company especially in
recent years there have been discussions involving stakeholders in the fields of business
and human rights that have the potential to impact the business environment as well as
policy trends in europe from this point of view in fiscal 2012 we contributed to the
discussion on business and human rights led by the european commission when the
european commission was creating sector guidance for putting the united nations
guiding principles on business and human rights into practice we formulated views on
sector guidance through the csr committee of the japan business council in europe
jbce which hitachi chairs and submitted them to european institutions we also
hosted the jbce japaneurope business and human rights roundtable focusing on
internal communication from a practical perspective and published the summary of the
roundtable for wide distribution

quality and reliability education
our training courses for all technical and skill levels at divisions working in design and
quality assurance cover reliability fundamentals and applications and product safety in
fiscal 2011 we reinforced our monozukuri practices by beginning an elearning program
for the more than 120000 hitachi engineers around the world reaffirming the
monozukuri spirit based on our engineering ethics in fiscal 2012 we developed a second
elearning program that draws on the results of analyses of past product accidents to
identify weaknesses that our engineers should be aware of and should overcome
building monozukuri craftsmanship into their daily activities
quality assurance training centers at manufacturing sites and locations in hitachi city
ibaraki prefecture help to increase production inspection and maintenance skills
through their own specialized technical courses



strengthening quality assurance qa systems in china and
throughout asia
as production volume has been increasing in china
and other asian nations we are reinforcing systems
and training to improve quality production from
these locations for example we host annual
conferences for qa managers in china and thailand
to improve quality awareness and to share
information and best practices
we provide quality reliability courses in beijing
                                                            first advanced reliability course in bangkok

ensuring hitachi home appliance safety
we are eliminating consumer appliance accidents in line with hitachis customer
satisfaction cs management guidelines which take the avoidance of accidents as their
baseline for example since fiscal 1987 we have been testing worstcase scenarios such
as deliberately setting a fire inside a product to confirm that the fire will not spread
outside it since fiscal 2006 we have also been conducting product safety risk
assessments at the development stage creating accidents that might be caused by
misuse
of the serious product accidents occurring in japan there were as many as 2862 fires in
electrical products between may 14 2007 and march 31 20121 by product room air
conditioner accidents were the most common only one of those room air conditioners
was from hitachi and this was a simple case of smoke coming from an internal
component that had deteriorated over time there was no external fire we will continue
to make all our consumer appliances even safer using our own voluntary action plan for
product safety so that customers can use our products with confidence

hitachis universal design philosophy
we promote universal design ud by improving the quality and ease of use accessibility
and life cycles of our products quality of use means focusing on the traits that make
people feel that the product is easy and enjoyable to use accessibility refers to the range
of people who can use a product or service life cycle covers all the stages of the value
chain from product purchase through to disposal

our universal design activities
in keeping with the ud philosophy we conduct basic research on behavior and cognitive
characteristics of various users to formulate ud guidelines and reflect these in product
development incorporating the voices of users and experts at every stage the
information obtained during product development is entered into a database shared by
our businesses we also distribute some of this information externally to promote open
source standardization and education

digital and home appliances
we define people as customers as soon as a product interests them so we make a point
of considering universal design in everything from presales to disposal key attributes
are usability features harmony with the environment safety and maintenance our
intention is to provide products that suit the physical ability or lifestyle of every customer
and are appreciated for a long time
our ud focus extends beyond products to include product manuals for example we are
working with the npo kanagawa information employment and welfare network for the
visually impaired viewnet kanagawa to make our manuals available as audio text files
the entire manual including photographs diagrams and tables is converted into a text
file that can be played aloud using texttospeech software a screen reader for the
visually impaired these reconstructed text files are available online and allow the
visually impaired to use our products safely and easily the text files are created based on
feedback from visually impaired people who have operated and verified product use
while listening to the instructions on the text files in february 2013 this initiative was
selected for the 5th kanagawa barrierfree urban development awards hosted by
kanagawa prefecture hitachi appliances inc and viewnet kanagawa jointly received
the award from the kanagawa prefectural governor
we have also launched a range of measures to improve the accessibility of increasingly
complex consumer electronics appliances for the elderly and disabled dvds providing
clear explanations on product use are included with products while some products have
braille labelling on their buttons

fundamental policy against takeovers
the group invests a great deal of business resources in fundamental research and in the
development of marketleading products and businesses that will bear fruit in the future
realizing the benefits from these management policies requires that they be continued
for a period of time for this reason the company keeps its shareholders and investors
well informed of not just the business results for each period but also of the companys
business policies for creating value in the future
the company does not deny the significance of the vitalization of business activities and
performance that can be brought about through a change in management control but
recognizes the necessity of determining the impact on company value and the interests
of all shareholders of the buying activities and buyout proposals of parties attempting to
acquire a large share of stock of the company or a group company by duly examining
the business description future business plans past investment activities and other
necessary aspects of such a party
there is no party that is currently attempting to acquire a large share of the companys
stock nor is there a specific threat neither does the company intend to implement
specified antitakeover measures in advance of the appearance of such a party but the
company does understand that it is one of the natural duties expected by shareholders
and investors to continuously monitor the state of trading of the companys stock and
then to immediately take what the company deems to be the best course of action when
a party attempts to purchase a large share of the companys stock in particular together
with outside experts the company will evaluate the buyout proposal of the party and
hold negotiations with the buyer and if the company deems that the buyout will not
maintain the companys value and is not in the best interest of the shareholders then the
company will quickly determine the necessity content etc of specific countermeasures
and prepare to implement them the same response will also be taken in the event that a
party attempts to acquire a large percentage of the shares of a group company

applying finger vein authentication to health and demographic studies in
developing countries
there is an urgent need to improve the accuracy of
data analysis related to infectious diseases and public
hygiene in some developing countries and areas such
as africa and asia where no civil registration or basic
demographic information is available to solve this
problem hitachis finger vein authentication
technology has been applied to studies undertaken by
the institute of tropical medicine of nagasaki

research institute corporation without basic civil registration identifying every local
resident was a major problem but hitachis finger vein authentication system has made it
a lot easier and more accurate the residents only need to place their fingertip on the
device and then the system accurately identifies them and their samples boosting the
efficiency of these studies
nagasaki university surveyed the health of 500 infants in the kwale district of
southeastern kenya in march 2012 in july 2012 rihn worked with the lao pdrs

     unusual experience fosters responsibility in the next generation
     i spent six weeks from march 2013 at an npo in india as
     part of my companys international corporate volunteering
     program ryushoku program under this program
     employees work with local people as well as npos and
     companies in emerging countries to resolve social issues
     my npo operated its own schools provided teaching                                   osamu torigoe
     materials to other schools and gave assistance to teachers                         it platform division group

     because of the big disparity in childrens academic levels                          telecommunication systems
     they are divided into several groups to provide an                                   company

     education geared to their individual needs this requires
     assessing every child and developing an individual
     education strategy using my experience as an it engineer
     i worked on the development of tools for managing and
     analyzing data on computers that had until then been
     managed on paper i spoke with teachers data input staff
     and those analyzing the data and showed them visually
     the current status and results i worked particularly hard to
     improve input efficiency and i consider the positive
     feedback that i received as my greatest achievement
     working with local people to solve problems made me
     realize how difficult it is to raise childrens education levels
     but i was also able to experience firsthand the childrens
     desire to learn and that really motivated me to develop
     robust highquality tools i was delighted to see the
     growing number of students attending the origami classes
     that i held to introduce students to japanese culture and
     that the teachers decided to continue the class as part of
     the formal curriculum
     interacting with the children made me strongly aware of
     my responsibility to the next generation before this i
     hadnt been conscious of the necessity of creating a
     sustainable society but through my experience in india i
     feel as though ive come to understand this at least in
     part operating outside the framework of my professional
     experience has left me with a real desire to become an
     engineer who can take an unusual or beyondthesquare
     approach
