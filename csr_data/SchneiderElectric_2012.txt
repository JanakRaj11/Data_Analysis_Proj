     today out of the worlds 7 billions inhabitants only 2 billions have
     access to adequate energy infrastructure and 2 billions will attain       by 2050 the energy equation will therefore be a doubling of
     middle class status in around ten years while 13 billion people        worldwide energy demand and at the same time a need to
     300 million homes  still have no access to electricity in addition     halve co2 emissions at the global level in order to combat climate
     the planet could have 2 billions additional inhabitants by 2030          change under these conditions economic development requires

      to reduce the co2 equivalent emissions by 30000 tonnes per                  actions to reduce sf6 emissions

       sf6 gas emissions in the industrial sites concerned and energy             the performance of the planet  society barometer in co2 savings
       consumption of industrial and supply chain sites and of some                 is mainly due to the reduction of sf6 leaks in the production
       tertiary sites as well as for a part of scope 3 for the ghg                 processes resulting from
       protocol 1 air freight in the long distance freight transport mix 2    mandatory monthly reporting since 2010 rather than twice yearly
       the objective is to reduce co2 emissions by approximately 15                  in 2009
       over three years on a constant basis compared to 2008 these                  a failure modes effects and criticality analysis fmeca deployed

     exceeded the reduction target of 30000 tonnes per year ie                  leakage of sf6 gas had to be reduced from a rate of 4 at the end
     90000 tonnes over the threeyear period of the program                      of 2008 to a rate of 12 by the end of 2011 for gas consumed

     with the  symbol in the tables presented on pages 46 52 60 70 et 98 to 105 of the annual report the indicators have been prepared
     in all material respects in accordance with schneider electric 2011 reporting guidelines the guidelines summarized on pages 90 to 92
     it is the responsibility of schneider electrics management team to prepare the indicators draw up the guidelines and ensure that the
     guidelines are available for consultation at the groups head ofﬁce
     our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the indicators based on our review our review was carried out in accordance with the
     international standard isae 3000 international standard on assurance engagement december 2003 our independence is deﬁned by the
     legislative and statutory texts as well as the ethics code of the profession
     the conclusion formulated below concerns only the speciﬁed indicators and not the entire sustainability report included in the annual report
     a higher level of assurance would have required more extensive work


     nature and scope of our review
     in order to be able to express our conclusion on the indicators we performed the following review
      we conducted interviews with the persons responsible for the reporting on these indicators as well as a risk and materiality analysis at
       group level for emeas and north america regions extended works were performed on safety indicators
      we also assessed compliance with the guidelines and performed analytical procedures and consistency checks as well as veriﬁed based
       on sample surveys data processing for the calculation of the indicators and their aggregation
      we selected a sample of ﬁve operational sites1 according to their activities their geographic locations their contribution to the groups
       indicators and the results of prior risk analyses
      the selected sites represent on average 6 of the total value of the indicators from 2 to 35 depending on the indicators2 at the
       selected sites level we veriﬁed the understanding and application of the guidelines and veriﬁed on a test basis compliance with the
       calculation formula and reconciliation with supporting documents
      we reviewed the presentation of the indicators in the annual report on pages 46 to 80 and 98 to 105
     in view of the work carried out over the last seven years we consider that our veriﬁcation work concerning the indicators provide a sufﬁcient
     basis on which to formulate our conclusion presented hereafter

information and comments
regarding the reporting guidelines deﬁned by schneider electric for the selected data we wish to make the following comments
 speciﬁc attention has been provided to the traceability of changes in the reporting perimeter of operational units
 veriﬁcation procedures implemented by the group have been precised at group sites and operational units levels the implementation
  of controls to be performed could be reinforced on all security data as well as on the sf6 leaks and voc emissions indicators

conclusion
based on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the indicators were not established in all material
respects in accordance with the guidelines
