      engaging in progressive environmental activities
pursuing environmental targets eco vision 2020 in light of global issues
     achievements of eco vision v2 from 2015 to 2017 in the first year and future plans thereof
eco vision 2020 is conducted by dividing the nine years from          vious years all employees of lion group have been united in
2012 to 2020 into three periods v1 to v3 each of three            promoting environmental activities accordingly plans for
years 2015 was the first year of v2 following v1 in which          v2 have been steadily performed in general
almost all the set targets had been attained as with the pre

five key items
greenhouse gas emissions from business                                water use in domestic business activities
activities in japan                                                   in 2015 we reduced water used in domestic business activi
in 2015 we reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 41 com             ties by 45  compared to 2000 water used per unit total
pared to 1990 emission intensity per unit total revenue            revenue the 2020 target of a 35  reduction was attained
more than 29 over the previous year with integration of             earlier than scheduled due to modification of the production
production facilities and energysaving activities conducted          process watersaving activities at all offices and plants and
at all offices and plants we will continue to make efforts for       recycling of factory waste water discharge stated below
achieving our targets for 2017 and 2020
                                                                      recycling of factory waste water discharge
greenhouse gas emissions from postuse                                in 2015 we completed construction of facilities to recycle
productions in japan                                                  factory waste water and started operation there at chiba
in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from post            plant aiming to achieve the target of recycling waste water
use products we are making products more compact and                 at multiple plants by 2020 in 2016 we will begin the full
switching from petroleumbased surfactant ingredients with            scale operation of the facilities expecting to further reduce
plantbased ingredients that do not lead to an increase in            waste water discharge and water consumption
co2 in 2015 the emissions decreased by 49 compared to
1990 emission intensity per unit total revenue slightly in
creasing on a yeartoyear comparison due to temporary
changes in the composition of our products we will push
with the same activities to achieve the set targets
greenhouse gas emissions from overseas
business activities
we reduced greenhouse gas emission by 04 compared to
2014 emission intensity per unit of production failing to attain
the target of a 1  reduction for each year this was because
energy efficiency decreased due to the plants with lower pro
duction volume we will work on more efficient production by
ensuring production volume according to production capacity

         harmonizing with nature
lion has assumed a leading role in tackling waterrelated environmental issues such as bubble floating occurred in rivers and
eutrophication of waterways linked to the use of detergents and has considered biodiversity conservation at each stage from
raw material procurement to disposal however in order to receive and preserve the blessings of biodiversity into the future
it will be mandatory for us to coordinate with local communities to focus on conservation of biodiversity and promote sus
tainable use thereof also it is important to promote a shift in lifestyle of consumers through products that take biodiversity
into consideration and to contribute to the realization of a society harmonizing with nature
   to this end lion will contribute to the development of a sustainable society through its business by ascertaining the natu
ral resources used in business activities and the impact on biodiversity throughout the value chain and carrying out biodiver
sity conservation activities that lead to the expansion of opportunities and reduce the risks also by having each of our em
ployees participate in activities to conserve biodiversity as part of our environmental education we will spread awareness of
biodiversity conservation to all our office sites
