dear stakeholder
drdgold has  over the past decade  transformed itself from               our first integrated annual report which covers the key
what was largely a deep level underground mining company                   financial operational risk and sustainability issues facing the
to a company whose future lies  ironically  in the past and in          company this is our first step towards integrated reporting and
particular in the approximately 50year resource offered in the           in this report we have endeavoured to address the context of

drdgold today is a company in two parts                                   other stakeholders have a better and fuller understanding of the
  the deeplevel and labour intensive blyvoor operations                  group and can make informed decisions about their association
  while we have made it clear that this entity no longer fits within       with us

our approach to reporting                                               we recognise too that our employees as important stakeholders

    worked from 011 per million hours worked in fy2010 we continue
    to strive for a working environment without fatal accidents             the first relates to our everincreasing awareness of risk management
    regrettably the groups ltifr rose from 908 per million hours         and the need to address risks in an integrated and holistic manner
    worked to 1636 per million hours worked this reflects the             critically given that our surface operations are in close proximity
    increasing risk of seismicityrelated accidents at blyvoor an issue     to communities  both formal and informal  and scattered this
    that continues to receive significant attention                         will require much greater engagement with stakeholders on safety
                                                                             and environmental issues this is an area that will receive far greater
    it is also appropriate to record that on 18 march 2011 26 people        attention in the year ahead
    were injured and eight died when a bus operated by a transport
                                                                             a second issue relates to the way in which we manage people  the

    randfontein and johannesburg we extend our sincere condolences

    extend our gratitude to those who provided assistance in particular     alignment and harmony cultural ambiguity remains particularly
    the staff of the south african police service traffic authorities and   in communications and when one considers that we work in a
    the numerous emergency services and hospitals while this was not        country with 11 official languages and firmly entrenched cultures
    a mining related accident it is one which we take very seriously and    one can start to see the enormity of this issue

   detrimental impact on the way in which we run the business              accountants  to the business at a cost that we can afford there is
   and associated costs similarly unambiguous application of              simply a dearth of skills in the marketplace and hdsa skills attach
   legislation and capacity to grant and monitor permitting are             a sometimes unaffordable premium
   critical to the success of our industry
   costs and particularly labourrelated costs in a country whose

   seems unreal that the unemployed are disempowered to set                 i hope that the report that follows will provide our stakeholders

   at an operation such as blyvoor                                         questions
   our significant exposure to our us shareholder base gives us
   good insight into the hugely detrimental impact that the spectre
   of nationalisatiion has had on south african mining equities
   the fact that there has not been an unequivocal rejection of this
   by the governing party is a significant issue of concern
   i have always said that we need to plan and manage our
   business according to todays gold price in todays market and
   not in anticipation of an increase however the reality is that if
   the dollar does not decrease further in value the bull run on gold
   is probably going to run out of steam at some point or another
   the security of energy supply is another critical factor

rock dumps are a natural consequence of underground mining
where a combination of waste rock and ore is brought to surface for       economic activity they turn to account mineral wealth that was
crushing treatment and then separation from the valuable mineral         trapped in these dumps and they release prime land located within
stream which is further processed to release gold in the stamp          the hub of economic activity for redevelopment dump removal
