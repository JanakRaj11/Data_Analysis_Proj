new business process system
drives greater efficiency
cloetta is currently implementing a new business process system
throughout its operations through harmonisation and standardisation
it is possible to tie together all parts of the group



per svensson cloettas chief
information officer explains
we launched the project in 2011 and since
then different parts of the group have been
integrated one by one in 2014 we completed the
implementation in finland and later in the year
the benelux region with three factories and a
commercial organisation in the second half of
the year projects were started to roll out the solu
tion at the factories in sweden for deployment at
the beginning of 2015 in 2015 the commercial
organisations in germany and the uk and the
factory in ireland are next in line and the process
will be completed in 2016 with italy
     we have chosen to use a standard system
that currently has eight modifications reducing
the number of modifications from more than
500 down to eight represents a major process of
change and as in all such processes the biggest
challenge lies in getting the employees to alter
their working methods not making the it system
itself work initially there is often some resist
ance to adopting new working processes and
converting from the earlier customised system
one old truth is than an it system is never more
popular than when it is time to replace it how
ever on the whole the implementation has gone
more smoothly than expected
     but the fact that the business process system
will soon be found everywhere doesnt mean that
our work is done rather it means that we can
now embark on our journey towards even more
profitable growth we have created a platform
that will enable us to make high quality fact         effective and standardised global business
based decisions quickly and effectively through        processes of a high quality support factbased
more standardised and harmonised information
                                                         decisionmaking our global business system
and increased knowledge we can refine our
business and further hone our capabilities in
                                                         is the platform for profitable growth and
processes such as those we call order to cash          increased profit margins

sustainable sourcing in cloettas supply chain is a prioritised area by incorporating sustain
ability aspects into the companys purchasing strategy cloetta creates a platform for ensur
ing the supply of high quality raw materials to the factories while at the same time improving
the opportunities for growers in the countries of origin to develop sustainable farming



first of all sustainable sourcing at cloetta is about
having control one step back in the supply chain
ie to the first line of suppliers raw materials are
purchased only from suppliers that can be verified
against cloettas requirements for quality product
safety and sustainability all suppliers to cloetta
are evaluated and approved before they are permit
ted to deliver to the factories the process varies in
relation to the risks type of supplier involved and
which raw material is delivered certain suppliers
are evaluated and tested by cloettas employees via
physical visits according to an established schedule
      secondly sustainable sourcing at cloetta is
about directly addressing different types of social
environmental and economic challenges that are
found in the value chain beyond first line suppliers
of specific raw material groups cloettas sustain
able sourcing programme is based on external
certifications andor verification according to the
guidelines defined in cloettas code of conduct
