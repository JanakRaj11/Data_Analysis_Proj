capital and our global presence and experience to help ensure

in recent years some stakeholders have expressed concern          association aise on formulation improvements as well
about using risk as the basis for product safety these concerns   as providing consumer guidance on how to use detergents
have been driven by several issues including                     properly wwwwashrightcom we launched and then
 questions about whether the hazards of existing chemicals        expanded a pg internet site wwwscienceintheboxcom to

pg joins campaign to reduce
detergent impact in europe
pg continues to expand its sustainability achievements in          the compacting of traditional detergents to 95 grams per wash
detergents the company recently joined a twoyear european         led to a 36percent decrease in the weight of powder needed
campaign to reduce the amount of detergent used particularly       per wash and a 23percent drop in the amount of packaging
in central and eastern europe where consumers typically            used compared to 1997 additionally fully compacted
use 50 percent more detergent per wash 150 grams than in          detergents 75 grams per wash are available in several
western european countries it is expected that the campaign        european countries fully compacted detergents use 27 percent
will help reduce the amount of lowsuds heavyduty granular        less packaging than the compacted traditional detergents
detergent used in central and eastern europe by nearly
200000 tonnes

the international detergent association aise the association
internationale de la savonnerie de la détergence et des
produits dentretien launched the initiative in january 2006
and pg has implemented it in 10 countries with another nine
countries pending this initiative includes
 reducing the environmental impact of laundry detergents by
  reducing chemicals packaging and energy used in product
  manufacturing delivery and use this includes reducing by
  a minimum of 33 percent in weight the recommended
  dosage for a standard washing machine load also reducing
  the dose for a standard washing machine load by a minimum
  of 25 percent in volume
 encouraging consumers to modify the way they use                                                        pg continues to compact
  products to reduce the amount of detergent and energy                                                  powder detergents and
  used while maintaining cleanliness standards                                                           reduce their packaging

a noticeable beneﬁt for consumers is that detergent packages
are becoming smaller and lighter

the current campaign builds on previous efforts by pg and
the detergent industry to compact detergents over the past
decade pg has been working with aise in western europe
since the early 90s to compact detergents thereby using less
raw material and less packaging and putting less chemical
material into the environment

in the early 90s it was difﬁcult to convince consumers to
accept compact detergents that required only 75 grams per
wash instead of the traditional 150 grams so in 1997 pg
and the aise started compacting detergents in 18 european
countries from 150 grams down to 95 grams this was a four
step progressive process over eight years the new campaign
is scheduled to achieve its goals in one compaction step
instead of four

matarós wastewater efforts
help local environment
spains mataró plant did a lot of work this year regarding
wastewater reduction and treatment and also water consumption

the plant set up a new activated carbon wastewater
treatment unit this unit cleans wastewater so well that it
complies with the very strict requirements for river discharge
even though the wastewater gets discharged into a public
sewage system the surfactants concentration decreased up to
50 fold  typically from 150 parts per million down to 3

in addition four of the plants seven departments are now
zero efﬂuent departments

teaching kids to care
about animals
iams is partnering with operation outreachusa a nonproﬁt
organization that improves childrens literacy skills while
teaching respect for living things iams donates books about
interactions between people and animals each child receives
two books to use in the classroom and then take home

this program reaches thirdgraders and their teachers in
61 schools over nine years the program has reached nearly
52000 schoolchildren it operates in ﬁve states where iams has
facilities as well as in new york city this year the program will
add involvement by iams employees and local animal shelters

students and teachers have all learned what it is to truly
give care and protection to our animal friends says one
teacher an additional beneﬁt to this program is the increased
sensitivity our children now have to the importance of being
kind to animals and each other as well

operation outreachusa focuses on literacy academic
achievement and the building blocks of strong character
