the franke group continuously works to improve the               customers are increasingly asking for information
resource efficiency energy water and material safety         about sustainability aspects such as energy efficiency
and durability of its products we provide fair and safe         water consumption labor standards or hygiene of our
working conditions for roughly 9000 employees across            products services operations or our supply chain
the world this implies a social responsibility for our          what is more there is a trend toward green building
employees and their families                                    with the spread of labels such as leed which is
                                                                 beneficial for our innovative resourceefficient products
we also strive to consistently reduce the environmental          and services
impact of our operations taking into account the com           the regulatory environment is getting more complex

franke group is impacted by a number of sustainability            regulations
trends that pose either a risk or an opportunity for
our longterm business success the most important
trends are

    while we are permanently improving our competitive
    ness we still depend on the macro economic environ
    ment for our success in january 2015 the european
    central bank ecb decided to launch a largescale
    quantitative easing program to boost the european
    economy in the same month the swiss national bank
    decided to unpeg the swiss franc from the euro as a
    consequence the swiss franc gained instantly versus
    all major currencies leading to strong negative effects
    for all companies like franke that consolidate in
    swiss francs and that have a substantial cost base in
    switzerland however we also foresee positive devel
    opment the outlook for all major european economies
    has significantly improved since the announcement
    of the ecb program and we want to make sure we take
    full advantage of this opportunity
    globalization and the growth of emerging economies
     offer new market opportunities for our products and
     services at the same time increased competition
     in these economies requires franke group to remain
     innovative and costefficient and to offer solutions
     systems rather than single products
     in many countries we face a scarcity of skilled
      employees franke group has to remain an attractive
      employer in order to attract and retain talented people

is aware that rising energy prices are directly linked to   net sales by region
production costs this is why franke intends to further
reduce energy consumption in the future

and is used to supply approximately 13000 quick service restaurants in
europe the building fulfills high standards of sustainable construction and
is the first logistics center in germany that was awarded the leed gold

is awarded by the us green building council and is a quality hallmark for
buildings that are particularly sustainable during planning construction

includes the recovery of up to 90 percent of heat efficient ventilation

franke in aarburg switzerland around 850 employees headquarters of
franke group three production companies is collaborating closely with
the swiss business energy agency enaw to develop approved targets to
save energy and cut co2 emissions franke has commissioned a detailed
analysis of the energy flows in order to identify savings potential and
define a range of improvements such as waste heat utilization or replace
ment of the building control system the consumption of electricity and
fossil fuels was reduced by 28 in 2014 compared to 2009 in addition to
cost savings franke was also exempt from paying carbon taxes

in april 2015 franke inaugurated a wood chip heating system that replaced
the old natural gas heating in aarburg also as of 2015 franke has pur
chased all electricity from swiss hydropower this means that all heat and
electricity for the production and facilities in aarburg stems from renewable
co2 neutral sources
