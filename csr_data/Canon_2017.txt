creating synergies with axis a company
with superior image processing technologies
canon has deepened its collaboration with axis since the
company joined the group in 2015 including exchanges
in all areas of operations from product development and
quality assurance to sales and marketing the result of
this union was the merging of canons advanced optics
and imaging technologies with axis network image
processing technologies in our first jointly developed
product the axis q1659 with highperformance
sensors delivering 20 megapixelsnearly 10 times full
hd resolution this network camera system can be used
for a variety of purposes from widearea to longdistance
surveillance thanks to a selection of seven interchangeable
lenses we will promote the axis q1659 for use in city
surveillance systems as well as at such locations as airports                                       meeting with an axis employee on a business trip at canon

and stadiums


pursuing further technological innovations
strengthening solutions
the network camera market demands not only products
but also solutions that record and analyze video for
example canons software capable of counting up to 1500
people in an image can be used to determine crowding in
various facilities this capability helps in allocating security
personnel and in arranging evacuation and other safety
measures in addition canon is developing technologies
that quickly search for a specific person from a video feed
and continuously track that person throughout a multiple                                            counting people using the people counter version 10 software

developing medical equipment from our
early days
soon after its establishment canon became involved in
medical equipment including the development of japans
first indirect xray camera in 1940 utilizing our long
cultivated imaging technologies we have struck an optimal
balance between highquality imaging and compact
sizing compiling a product lineup that includes fundus
cameras that reduce patient burden during photography
as well as optical coherence tomography devices that can
perform 3d analysis of retinal disease which is linked to
vision loss in recent years we have expanded our digital
radiography product lineup to meet the onsite needs
                                                                     diagnosis with optical coherence tomography
of medical institutions our range of products includes
lightweight and portable wireless models and models
capable of fluoroscopic imaging for use in such fields as
disaster medicine telemedicine and home care


product development in the united states
located in the united states canon biomedical has
commercialized solutions that support genetic researchers
the canon biomedical research products enable life
scientists to detect variations in our dna the genetic
variations that scientists can detect may impact human
disease and therapeutic response canon biomedical will
continue developing new products to advance life science and
molecular diagnostics furthermore canon is collaborating
at its research laboratory in boston with harvardaffiliated
medical institutions such as massachusetts general hospital
and brigham and womens hospital to develop cuttingedge
endoscopes and other devices with the ability to perform
realtime inspections of areas of the internal anatomy that
doctors could not previously examine including the inside of
joints and paranasal cavities these devices are expected to be      canon biomedical pursuing the development of genetic testing

utilized in early treatment as well as in new diagnosis


canon technology selected for inclusion in
japanese national program
as signs of various diseases and medical conditions manifest
in changes that occur within blood vessels it is becoming
extremely important to be able to visualize the blood vessel
interior accordingly canon is promoting the development
of groundbreaking photoacoustic tomography technology
that can produce 3d images of blood vessels without using
radiation and in a noninvasive manner by enabling high
resolution imaging of the vascular network this technology
is expected to be instrumental in testing for cancer diabetes

nanoimprint lithography  groundbreaking
technology in the semiconductor
manufacturing process
semiconductors are used in a wide range of products
from cellular phones smartphones and televisions to air
conditioners automobiles refrigerators and washing machines
as such they are an indispensable part of peoples daily lives
    semiconductors are created using various technologies
including exposure technology that employs light to expose
circuit patterns advancements to semiconductors have been
realized by making these circuit patterns finer through the
lengthening of short light waves that are used in the exposure
process a semiconductor linewidth of 350 nm nanometers
was realized in the first half of the 1990s followed by the
realization of a linewidth of 38 nm in the second half of 2000s
however this progression practically came to a halt due to          development progressing on nanoimprint lithography
                                                                     technology
the belief that the process of making finer circuit patterns
through the lengthening of short light waves had reached its
technological limit
    following this conclusion canon began focusing its
attention on nanoimprint lithography a nextgeneration
technology continuing our research since 2004 we
succeeded in realizing an extremely fine linewidth within
the 10 nm range due to the fact that the finer the linewidth
becomes the more difficult it is to create circuit patterns
semiconductor fabrication devices have become more
complex and larger in size in order to create these circuit
patterns giving rise to various issues nanoimprint lithography
technology resolves these issues by employing a simple
method of stamping an etched circuit pattern mask on the
surface material thereby allowing fine patterns to be cleanly
reproduced furthermore this technology shortens the overall
production process leading to significant cost reductions          mask etched with fine circuit patterns
    we are currently working with canon nanotechnologies
inc located in the united states to promote the
development of nextgeneration semiconductor fabrication
equipment we expect this equipment to support society
as an important technology in the iot generation which
brings all types of things together


organic led oled manufacturing
equipment of industryleading canon tokki
compared with conventional lcd panels oled panels
are thinner and produce more vibrant colors in addition
oled panels have high expectations in terms of application
including the capability to be bent and in the future
folded vacuum evaporation equipment developed and
manufactured by canon tokki plays an essential role in
the manufacture of oled panels and we take pride in
its unsurpassed technological superiority supported by

nest boxes and bait tables etc so that various creatures can
live in addition we attach colored film to the front of the
windowpane of the building to prevent bird strikes against          conducting regular biodiversity surveys

birds windows and we also give consideration to creatures

  basic approach to co2 calculations
  canon compiles data for ghg designated under the kyoto protocol revised version past data may be revised due to improvements in the precision of data collection
    we use co2 emission factors for electricity for each region and year
    until 2014 figures used in japan were published by japans ministry of the environment and the federation of electric power companies of japan outside japan they
  were published by the international energy agency from 2015 calculations use co2 emission factors provided by individual electricity suppliers publicly disclosed region
  specific figures are used where factors are not provided by electricity suppliers please refer to operational sites covered in the environmental section page 74
    for figures on customer use electricity consumption of products shipped in a given year is calculated based on the average lifespan and output capacity and
  converted to the co2 equivalent using the same factors stipulated above other co2 emission factors use coefficients from the carbon footprint communication
  program of the japan environmental management association for industry jemai

  thirdparty verification of ghg emissions converted to co2
  thirdparty verification has only been obtained for co2 emissions occurring in 2016 from quantitative data appearing in the above graphs lifecycle ghg emissions co2
  equivalent and 2016 material balance
