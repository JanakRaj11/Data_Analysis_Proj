programs to instill the management philosophy


csr month

october is csr month at epson a time for all employees to reflect on the kind of conduct that builds stakeholder trust for 2013
epson group companies in japan sought to raise compliance awareness to achieve the management philosophy toward this
end each organization broke into groups to read aloud the management philosophy a message from the president and other
mandatory sections of the epson code of conduct as well as sections chosen by each department also all employees were
required to complete the online course epson code of conduct 2013 in addition a special feature article raising compli
ance awareness was compiled for the company magazine the article included messages from the director in charge of com
pliance outside directors and outside auditors these were put to good use during csr month


we conduct a survey after csr month to find out what each department did and discussed to pick up on any compliance
concerns and to gather opinions and suggestions about csr month activities we compile and analyze the results which we
share with employees and use to help shape activities for the following year

our vision

epson established its quality policy as a guide for achieving customer satisfaction one of the core commitments included in
epsons management philosophy and as a means to ingrain customercentric behavior within the corporate culture daytoday
decisionmaking and conduct are guided by the se15 cs  quality midterm action guidelines which epson established in
2009


in line with these guidelines product planners and design engineers directly visit observe and listen to customers to gather
information on customer needs and problems which is then used to provide customerpleasing products and services initiatives
aimed at achieving 100 conformance begin at the development and design engineering stages by identifying problems early
and addressing their root causes we can build quality into products instead of relying on inspection at the end of the production
process


we will continue to emphasize a conscious approach to identifying genuine customer value and to building that value into the
products and services we deliver

keeping customers operations flowing with tmp80 mobile receipt printers

we developed the tmp80 a portable receipt printer as a linebuster1 in the retail and food service industries


tablets and other smart devices are increasingly being used for order entry and linebusting instead of dedicated stationary
terminals the tmp80 thermal printer complements these devices by supporting direct wireless printing from them it is also
lightweight ultracompact and batterypowered to ensure great mobility the printers mobility makes it possible for sales asso
ciates to roam the floor taking customer orders printing them out and processing payment


a product that is likely to see demand growth the tmp80 is designed to keep our customers operations flowing by employing
a durable case that protects it from water dust and damage when dropped

1
    linebuster a product or system that allows sales associates to take orders andor collect payments anywhere on the floor using handheld devices thus avoiding lines in north
    america retailers and restaurants often set up temporary registers during busy seasons or peak hours of the day this receipt printer can be combined with a handheld terminal a
    smart device with a card reader to create a simple pos register to process payments by credit card



epson knows that customers expect and deserve good quick service and cannot be
kept waiting because of equipment failures


the tmp80 has a robust design that is resistant to dust and water and capable of
withstanding being dropped from a height of 120 cm onto a concrete floor without
breaking it has cleared the rigorous dust and waterresistance requirements of the ip54
standard2 and operates normally even after being tested for eight hours under harsh
conditions in a dust chamber                                                                                                                         tmp80 has an ip54rated dust and
                                                                                                                                                      waterresistant case
2
    the ip54 rating means that dust must not enter the enclosure of electric equipment in amounts sufficient to interfere with satisfactory and
    safe operation of the equipment and that water splashing against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effect




                dust resistance test                                                                    water exposure test




the tmp80 is designed built and sealed to provide protection against the instruction of water even in heavy rain3

3
    this is tested under ip54 by spraying the enclosure with 10 liters of water per minute




                                                                                                                                                  epson group sustainability report 2014   11

                    water is kept out of the printer by using effective sealing placement




in addition great care was taken to maximize the ease with which the printer can be used for example the battery cover is
constructed so that the batteries do not pop out if the printer is dropped and even though the printer is small the buttons are
designed such that they are easy to press




                      a photo captured during drop testing by a highspeed camera left compared with a simulation image


in the past drop tests were conducted by repeatedly dropping test samples for the tmp80 however the impact resistance
was verified by creating a data model for use in a simulated drop test the results of simulated impact analyses were translated
into visual images that allow us to use a pc to check the points of impact angle and magnitude of stress applied when a printer
is dropped and to ascertain whether parts are damaged moreover since numerical data can be used to determine the type of
physical impact a drop will have on various parts we are able to see on a partbypart basis how thin and light we can make the
case while still maintaining the required strength this also allows us to improve product functions and shorten development
times


we guarantee the reliability of evaluation results by using a highspeed camera to film actual printers as they are dropped com
paring these images against simulation results and verifying that the two are consistent


yoshiki kinoshita who was in charge of planning and development says i think the tmp80 has a very good usability balance
for a mobile receipt printer that supports 80mm media going forward the devel
opment team will work together to develop a printer that is even lighter tougher
and better looking we want our products to be professional tools that serve the
needs of customers in a variety of businesses




                                                                                                              yoshiki kinoshita head of planning and development

smart canvas satisfies customer needs identified by receptivity survey

in february 2014 epson released in japan the first products in its series of smart canvas epd wrist wear these products
designed around an allnew concept of sensing and enjoying time offer value quite unlike that of traditional wristwatches that
use hands and numbers to convey the time of day




                                      epson technology enables smart canvas products to present wearers with
                                      the time of day in a unique way




how did these new products come about


in october 2010 epson held an exhibit in the tokyo midtown complex the exhibit was titled smart canvas x 8 what is time
eight designers present new ways to experience time these eight designers were hired by epson to propose new ways to
express time they then cast their net to capture information that would enable them to flesh out the embryonic concept of what
it means to sense and enjoy time


exhibit visitors responded in a big way prompting epson to begin its product development the need to know the time of day is
universal but individual needs differ when it comes to sensing and enjoying time to meet these divergent needs we need to
arrive at a more accurate understanding of the desires of individuals toward this end we showed smart canvas prototypes to
people who exhibited strong interests and preferences we then conducted a receptivity survey to explore how they actually felt
about these devices and find out what they are looking for in addition to designing the survey with scrupulous care developers
and product planners interviewed subjects personally to provide them firsthand insight into what consumers are looking for


technology that epson has accumulated over the years was essential for translating the needs that were identified into concrete
form these devices sport an activematrix electrophoretic display epda type of display most often used for electronic paper
epds offer sharp contrast and high 300dpi resolution enabling them to render smooth text and playful graphic images along
with the time of day using its inkjet technology epson prints sharp crisp images on the glass and band the images tie the
design of the band and display together into a cohesive whole to meet the varied demands of customers epson adopted an
ondemand production system manufacturing the products to order going forward epson plans to uncover further consumer
needs and expand the number of models in the smart canvas family to meet those needs


product monitoring program

epson has a monitor program in which employees and their family members can
participate persons registered as monitors evaluate products not as employees but
as customers the objective is to identify ways to improve product usability quality
and design this program which began in 2001 has seen the number of monitors
steadily rise


in the 2013 fiscal year epson had 775 registered monitors the monitors evaluated
15 products such as printers projectors and watches we use the feedback from                       an employee monitor evaluating the
monitors to improve things such as user manual readability and product usability                      usability of keystone correction on a projector




                                                                                                                     epson group sustainability report 2014   13

case study ep805a improvement
prototypes for the ep805a series of inkjet printers released in 2012 used text to indicate the direction in which to insert memory
cards however evaluations by employee monitors showed that users had trouble deciphering the correct direction so an
illustration was used instead the new design was used on subsequent models

service personnel skills competition

every year epson sales japan holds a skills competition for customer engineers ce the people who repair epson equipment in
the field at customer sites the 2013 competition was a motivational experience that gave participants the opportunity to de
velop their repair and customer skills through friendly competition in the normal repair process which starts with customer
visitation and ends with reporting and advice twelve of the top ces from around
japan were selected to compete in a qualifying round the top three finishers moved
on to the finals the competition afforded observers a rare peek behind the scenes of
the repair process and gave them a sense of the importance of designing products
that can easily be repaired one observer commented that he got a sense that the
way ces interact with customers affects brand image and product sales as much as
the quality of repairs epson ces recognize the importance of quality customer sup
port and interaction and they understand that the opportunity to directly interact with
users of epson products is valuable and comes with certain responsibilities

analyses to prevent product incidents

electronic components procured for use in epson products and especially those that are crucial in terms of safety are evaluated
and analyzed to judge their quality safety and reliability


epson uses analytic techniques learned and honed over the years to analyze inmarket safety incidents and determine root
cause the lessons learned are shared throughout the epson group to prevent recurrence of similar incidents


epson has set up a combustion laboratory that enables it to conduct tests that
cannot be performed in ordinary laboratories such as tests that use flames or
could cause parts or products to ignite emit smoke or rupture in this lab epson
analyzes the causes of incidents and research combustionresistant structures and
materials we use the findings from these and other tests and studies to develop
standards for creating safe secure products therefore seeking to prevent product
related incidents

safety evaluations on substances released by products

products may release trace amounts of chemical substances during use epson goes beyond simply evaluating releases of
controlled substances specified under the requirements for environmental labels such as japans eco mark and germanys blue
angel1 and also evaluates the level and safety of substances for which the japa
nese health labor and welfare ministry has issued indoor concentration guideline
values2 an inhouse laboratory enables us to swiftly feed the findings from these
evaluations back into our products and conduct tests using the measurement meth
ods prescribed by isoiec 28360


epson seeks to deliver safe secure printers projectors and other products by
verifying that releases from these products meet epsons strict independent stand
                                                                                                                                 measurement of substances released by products
ardsstandards that exceed the rigorousness of the health labor and welfare
ministrys indoor concentration guideline values
1
    blue angel introduced in germany in 1978 is the worlds first environmental label

    indoor concentration guideline values are the levels of airborne chemical substances that are considered to be unlikely to have harmful personal health effects even if persons take in
    throughout life the substances at the indicated concentrations



product information security initiatives

once reserved for laser business inkjet and other office printers network connectivity is now routinely provided with home inkjet
printers and other consumer devices which can be accessed via wireless lans smartphones tablets and other wificapable
equipment network connectivity is a great convenience but it also exposes users to security risks such as cyberattacks that
could lead to the destruction of data or the theft of confidential information by persons or organizations who exploit network
device software vulnerabilities3


to ensure the security of epson products epson evaluates the vulnerability of embedded software printer drivers and other
software based on information security requirements included in the epson quality standard eqs requirements for web
services such as epson email print were also included in the eqs in 2012

3
    software vulnerabilities are system flaws or design problems that hackers or other cybercriminals can use to hijack a computer network or other information system or to steal or
    alter confidential information

business actions to minimize environmental impacts

tackling environmental issues as a pioneer leads to the creation of new competitive strengths


for example applying micro piezo technology1 in an expanded range of commercial and industrial fields and replacing conven
tional analog printing processes with epsons digital printing processes can be expected to sharply reduce environmental im
pacts epson aims to achieve in 2050 a 90 reduction in co2 emissions versus the environmental impacts of current operations
and those of business markets that we are looking to enter we aim to achieve this by reducing the environmental impacts of our
products themselves as well as by reducing their impacts during use

design for environment

the environmental impacts of a product across its life cycle from cradle to grave are largely determined at
the planning and designengineering stages


epson takes a lifecycle thinking approach in efforts to minimize customers environmental impacts by
providing products that change the way they work and live and 2 provide products that offer the environ
mental performance they should have as a basic feature we set concrete targets for environmental speci
                                                                                                                                                                think
fications that should be achieved at the product planning stage and we have introduced a designfor
environment dfe process in which we evaluate how well we did in and after the design stage


primary environmental performance features

below are some of the representative environmental performance features that we evaluate as part of our dfe process


                we explore various hardware and software approaches to save energy these can include anything from devel
                oping energyefficient basic technologies to implementing lowpower product control schemes we strive to
                realize lowpower products by setting and attaining concrete numeric targets several years out for each model



                epson sets concrete size and weight targets for products since reducing these helps to significantly mitigate
                environmental impacts not only because fewer materials are consumed but also because products can be
                transported and warehoused more efficiently we also make every effort to design products so as to minimize
                wastes on the customers end we do this by for example minimizing the amount of packaging used for prod
                ucts and consumables or by providing new printing functions that eliminate unnecessary prints


                we design our products to be easy to recycle after use specifically we try to achieve a recyclable rate1 of 75
                or better as estimated from product engineering drawings
                1 recyclable rate recyclable materials as a percentage of total product weight excluding materials used as reducing agents in blast furnaces or as fuel
                   sources




                epson standards specify substances that are prohibited from inclusion in products and substances whose
                inclusion must be controlled information on these substances is gathered in a database to help ensure safety in
                all processes from design and procurement to volume production




                                                                                                                                      epson group sustainability report 2014   30

textiles


revolutionizing the textile printing process with digital technology

by ushering in digital processes epsons inkjet technology provides good value to customers in the textile printing industry and
helps them sharply reduce their environmental footprint




                 1 monna lisa an industrial inkjet digital textile printer jointly developed by epson and italian textile production equipment manufacturer robustelli srl




streamlined manufacturing process

digital textile printing is greener than traditional analog textile printing since the digital process is shorter and does not require
plates it uses anywhere from 40 to 75 less electrical power and water than a traditional process as well as far less ink and
fewer chemical products2

garment


an inkjet workflow for brightly colored garments with fineness of detail

there is a growing market for the printing of original images on tshirts polo shirts tote bags and other cotton products we are
answering the needs of this market with advanced inkjet printing technology that renders images in vivid colors and intricate
faithful detail with low environmental impacts




transforming the garment printing workflow

traditional silkscreen printing requires extensive preparation including the production of screens and the mixing of ink as well
as maintenance for photos and other multicolored prints with gradations the print process is long and the longer the process
the more energy water materials and other resources are used


digital prints produced with a surecolor scf2000 print digital data from a pc directly onto tshirts and other garments so not
only is there no need for screens or plates but images and photos can be reproduced with smooth gradations and in full color
the surecolor scf2000 shortens the garment printing workflow


moreover the inkjet process saves resources and is more environmentally conscious than analog processes because there are
no films screens or plates to produce wash or store




                                                                                                     epson group sustainability report 2014   34

mental features or performance the requirements for environmental labels are prescribed by various groups including the
international standards organization iso the iso defines the three types of environmental labels described below



                indicates that the product has met the criteria set by a certified thirdparty organization




                a selfdeclaration label that indicates a company volunteers environmental information about its products
                epsons ecology profiles and eco labels fall under the type ii category




                indicates that the environmental effects of a product throughout its life cycle  from raw material procurement
                through manufacturing distribution use disposal and recycling  are analyzed using lca methodology and that
                the results of such analyses are published as quantitative data the accuracy and reliability of the claimed data
                must be verified before being made public

mercury no longer used due to the use of leds as light sources in scanners and in lcd panels for inkjet
multifunction printers

epson has been replacing the conventional cold cathode tube light sources in scanners and lcd panels with lightemitting diode
led light sources all of our current inkjet allinones use mercuryfree led light sources making easier to dispose of the
products once they are no longer needed


measures for meeting the rohs directive

epson has made compatibility with the european rohs directive2 a standard feature of our entire line of products throughout
the world regardless of whether a particular product is bound for the european market or not


in 2009 epson began an effort to replace phthalate esters dehp bbp dbp and dibp substances that are being considered
for addition to the list of restricted substances under the rohs directive as of march 2014 epson had succeeded in eliminating
these substances from all products except for a limited number in inventory and for industrial use etc applications exempted
from the rohs directive are scheduled to expire in july 2016 so epson is moving to ensure that its products remain compliant
with rohs requirements

2 the european rohs directive restricts the use of the following 6 hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium poly
   brominated biphenyl pbb and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde

actions for reach compliance

epson has stayed compliant with the requirements of reach registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemi
cals legislation in europe


under reach companies that manufacture or import chemical substances must register them in a central database if a prod
uct contains harmful substances such as substances of very high concern the company must disclose the substances notify
government authorities and search for alternatives moving forward we will continue to use our substance content framework to
thoroughly and efficiently meet our legal and societal obligations as well as the needs of our customers


we make information on the chemicals used in ink available to customers in the form of safety data sheets sds published in 23
european languages

   commitment to environmental conservation

epson and the environmental

production

the main focus is on global warming prevention the elimination of emissions and the control of chemical substances


global warming prevention

epsons initiatives to prevent global warming revolve around reducing co2 emissions by conserving energy and reducing global
emissions of greenhouse gases other than co2


in fiscal 2013 we set out to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 32 compared with fiscal 2006 and achieved our worldwide
target

zero emissions

epsons zero emissions program began with an effort to recycle 100 of our waste products in 2003 all group companies in
japan and overseas production sites met their material recycling targets we have been shifting towards resource conservation
initiatives which seek to reduce the resource inputs into production processes


in the 2013 fiscal year we employed control metrics benchmarked against fiscal 2006 emissions and we met our group reduc
tion target

water recycling

epson is mitigating environmental impacts and maintaining legal and regulatory compliance by focusing on water and resources
from a risk management point of view basic to this is making sure we soil and consume no more water than necessary and
recycling and reusing what we do use we work actively to increase the recycling rate of factory wastewater and comply with
stricter water quality regulations moreover we are implementing energyefficient water treatment facilities thus we seek to
reduce the overall impact of production processes


in the 2013 fiscal year we employed control metrics benchmarked against fiscal 2006 emissions and we met our group reduc
tion target

environmental risk management

any environmental pollution resulting from epsons business activities could have a serious impact on residents of the surround
ing area as well as for the rest of the region or country we follow groupwide standards for pollution control and ensure that all
members are well acquainted with the ideas and laws of environmental risk management each promotion unit uses iso 14001
to identify and assess the risk of failing to meet standards or of experiencing environmental complaints or incidents in an ongoing
effort to continuously mitigate those risks


in fiscal 2013 we conducted internal pollution and emissions audits at 27 business sites 20 in japan and 7 overseas and have
nearly completed the corrective actions for nonconformances that were found regulatory limits for oil were exceeded once
during fiscal 2013 this incident was reported to the government and is being addressed we did not have any complaints and
accidents


soil and groundwater remediation

epson is pumping and treating groundwater contaminated by chlorinated organic solvents at several sites in japan including at
its head office in addition we have barriers in place to prevent further contamination in addition treated wastewater dis
charged into sewers is monitored to ensure that it remains within 11000th of the discharge standard 03 mgliter

hr development

approach

epson develops and trains its human resources in line with a human resources development policy established in 1996 the
policy states that epson will support employees who have aspirations for selfactualization to connect all the companies in the
epson group with people and to nurture employees so that both corporate and individual objectives are met we provide
training so that our people understand their roles and what is expected of them as members of the epson team training enables
them to work and communicate effectively solve problems and achieve goals and experience personal and professional growth


in fiscal 2012 epson introduced a new personnel system that specifies clear roles and requirements for management in terms of
both business and conduct to ensure the efficacy of the system epson has implemented a training program that aims to ensure
that managers acquire two essential management skills in one course they learn our strategic business objectives and acquire
the skills that allow them to rapidly and nimbly respond to internal and external changes in the business environment in the other
course they acquire the skills that enable them to support the growth and development of the people who report to them by
putting organizations and individuals in a position to succeed


epson also conducts group trainings for new hires junior staff and others in premanagement positions to develop talented
people for future management positions

training for new employees in japan

epson considers the first year of employment to be a training period during which new employees learn about the epson ap
proach to work


for the first three weeks new employees in epson group companies in japan gather at the head office for group training
where they learn the following


 conduct expected of them as epson employees
 the mindset and attitude necessary for practicing the art and science of manufacturing which is the foundation of epsons
  compact spacesaving highprecision technologies
 the importance of working cooperatively as a team


training ranges from lectures on the epson code of conduct to handson training in manufacturing

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                epson group sustainability report 2014   55

in 2014 we added a new training program to get new employees to think about customer satisfaction through practical experi
ence new employees learn the importance and enjoyment of working in teams through group activities that take place through
out the training period


after they complete group training new employees are sent to the department where they have been assigned there they learn
their job through onthejob training under a mentor mentors are usually
selected from among young employees with two or three years of experience
they produce training plans tailored to the individuals they will be mentoring
and for a full year provide them with the support they will need to stand on
their own mentors themselves are expected to grow through this experience


at the end of the first year the new employees gather again for a followup
group training where they can observe how they and others have grown and
developed to further solidify the foundation they have built as a business
professional they review the previous year and consider action plans for the
                                                                                                                      training to think about customer satisfaction
next year and beyond to achieve further growth and expand their contributions

days during the year to stockpile the remainder up to 60 days in a separate account they have the option of using wellbeing
leave days in the event of personal injury or illness or to care for children or family members or to participate in school events for
their children in elementary and middle school

epson created to prevent excess overtime work we have also deployed time management initiatives and monitoring systems
across the organization epson has programs to build awareness among employees of the importance of regulating working
hours appropriately and we are fully committed to maintaining a wellbalanced working environment


worklife balance initiatives

epson with one eye trained on the wellbeing and development of our children allows employees
to balance their careers with their personal lives so that they feel they can stay with the company
we enforce an eighthour workday at least once per week at our sites and an increasing number
of sites have a day each year when parents can bring their children to work because of these and
other initiatives epson is recognized for implementing policies that will benefit the next generation

could make to further facilitate the careers of female employees and create a more femalefriendly workplace then in april
2014 human resources conducted a survey of female employees we will explore and plan to institute measures based on the
findings from the interviews and survey

manage disasters but the program really got started in 2006 when we formulated a business continuity plan bcp for what was
then our liquid crystal displays business


if a disaster or some other event impacts business at an epson group production site our first priority is to ensure the safety of
our employees next we take steps to ensure continuity of the product supply so as not to inconvenience our customers in
order to provide a steady supply of products particularly consumables and core components such as quartz and semiconduc
tor devices print heads and small liquid crystal panels we have preparations in place that allow us to limit damage secure
repair parts switch to alternative producers and restore operations in line with established procedures we conduct exercises to
check our procedures and ensure their effectiveness missioncritical it systems and critical data that are essential for business
continuity are consolidated in a robust data center and backups are at the ready in the event of a disaster we have secured
multiple distribution routes to enable us to immediately switch to alternative routes in response to any disruption in international
shipping and transport in addition our finance accounting public relations and other key corporate functions have established
bcps so that business can continue in emergencies


meanwhile we ask the companies that make up our supply chain to strengthen their
bcps and we check to see how established those bcps are we analyze the items
we purchase and we develop multiple sources for those that are most important
when we cannot secure multiple sources we keep an inventory of goods on hand or
try other means to ensure continuous production in the event that something should
happen to a supplier


every business and site in the epson group will continue to refine its bcp to ensure
                                                                                           employees conduct an exercise using a bcp to be

 the report makes it easy to understand epson
 tell us more about group companies in north america and europe and their products environmental information
 the chinese version is fuller than that of other firms
