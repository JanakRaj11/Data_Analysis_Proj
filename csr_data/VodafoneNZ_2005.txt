mobile communications can enrich peoples lives facilitate
economic growth and enhance social wellbeing

this is why vodafone new zealand is committed to providing as
many people as possible with access to mobile communications
especially those who are traditionally excluded such as people
with disabilities

were helping to close the digital divide by choosing the royal
new zealand foundation of the blind rnzfb as a key partner

the partnership has been designed to deliver the
following initiatives
 txttotalk technology on mobiles for blind and visually
   impaired customers
 a fulltime person to manage the rnzfbs adaptive
   technology unit which helps prepare blind people for
   the workplace

we also actively encourage our employees to take advantage of
volunteering opportunities to support the work of the rnzfb

txt bullying
what in the world have we done


happy smiling faces
many young people are becoming the victims of mean offensive
or threatening txt messages

in june 2004 vodafone joined forces with the internet safety
group netsafe to combat txt bullying among school students
and to help victims to fight back

we developed brochures and posters about how to handle txt
bullies and sent the information to every school in new zealand
and to libraries cinemas and swimming pools around the
country the campaign also featured on national television
and radio

the response was overwhelming with calls from 20 schools
requesting additional posters and brochures within the first
two days

the number of bullying incidents reported to netsafe dropped
by 30 per cent in the threemonth period from september to
november 2004

what in the world have we done


hidden power
in december 2004 vodafone new zealand was presented with
an award at the 12th tongariro taupo conservancy conservation
awards for our mobile phone site in the conservancy

presenting the award conservancy landscape architect herwi
scheltus said vodafone was an example of a large company that
realised the need to treat conservation sites as special places
when developing its network

vodafones solutions were visually creative as well as sensitive
 to the environment they shared a site with their competitor on
 mount pihanga used discreet aerials on the skifield staff building
 at whakapapa village and placed other aerials inside false cedar
 panels on the knoll ridge cafe at tukino they considered
 alternative power sources such as diesel wind and solar they
 eventually agreed with genesis power limited to lay eight
 kilometres of power cable underground from the desert road to
 their tukino base station

vodafone new zealand domonstrated an awareness of the
 special environment they were working in and made sure that
 their contractors also toed the line

what in the world have we done



hazardous waste collection includes mobiles
towards the end of the 200405 financial year vodafone joined
forces with the auckland regional council arc to encourage
more people to return their old mobiles for recycling through the
councils hazardous waste collection programme  hazmobile

hazmobile is a mobile waste collection service that operates in
15 different locations across auckland to enable households to
safely dispose of hazardous waste such as old paint oil batteries
and chemicals

vodafone and the arc decided to include mobiles in the
collection of waste from north shore homes in march 2005
about 400 old mobiles were collected negotiations are
continuing about extending the service to other parts
of auckland

reducing environmental impacts
what in the world have we done



walk the talk
the move to our brand new head office in early 2005 provided us
with an opportunity to review the way our people travel to and
from work

aided by the auckland regional transport authority arta we
developed a new transportation policy called icommute which
encourages employees to use alternative modes of transport like
cycling walking or public transport

personalised travel plans were prepared for more than 200 of our
employees highlighting their public transport options

and general awareness was raised by a promotional campaign
that challenged employees to send in pxt messages of creative
modes of transport responses included pictures of hang gliding
a flying fox and nude unicycling

the prize of a vespa for the most creative entry went to business
analyst darius afshar for his pxt of kayaking to work

icommute is an ongoing programme that we have showcased to
other organisations to promote more environmentally friendly
modes of transport

what in the world have we done



went for a number two
four new zealanders are diagnosed with leukaemia or a
related blood condition each day of these many will require
chemotherapy or radiotherapy that can cause unpleasant side
effects including severe nausea and hair loss

so it was an easy decision for nearly 250 vodafone employees
to shave or dye their hair as part of the leukaemia and blood
foundations flagship fundraising event shave for a cure

the companys involvement  which raised 55000 
was largely driven by call centre manager angela rota
and her customer care team who even gained the support of
vodafone group deputy chief executive sir julian hornsmith

proceeds from the event were used to fund patient support
education research advocacy and medical equipment
