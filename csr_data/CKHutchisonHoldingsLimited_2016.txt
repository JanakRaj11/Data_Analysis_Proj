ports and related services
throughput of the ports and related services division increased 1 to 838 million twentyfoot equivalent units teu during
2015 total revenue before additional contributions of hk33767 million was 5 lower than the hk35624 million reported
for last year principally due to the adverse foreign currency translation to hong kong dollars in local currencies revenue was
2 higher than the comparable results of 2014 ebitda and ebit before additional contributions decreased 2 and 1 to
hk11840 million and hk7887 million respectively in 2015 in local currencies ebitda and ebit respectively increased 4
and 6 reflecting higher margin and lower power and fuel costs in the year as well as the continued focus on better cost
control through improvements in productivity and efficiency despite the overall improvements in underlying performances
in most of the groups ports operations the better results were partly offset by the deconsolidation impact of the jakarta
operations which became a joint venture following the dilution of interests and by the lower profitability in the rotterdam
ports due to the entrance of new competitors during the year

the division had 269 operating berths as at 31 december 2015 in light of the challenging global trade conditions this division
will continue to focus on cost efficiency and margin growth to maintain a stable contribution in 2016

additional contributions
postreorganisation the groups interest in hph trust as compared to hwls interest increased slightly from 2762 to 3007
resulting in additional contributions which increased total revenue to hk34009 million for the ports and related services
division 5 lower than the total revenue reported by hwl in 2014 ebitda decreased 1 to hk11964 million and ebit
remained broadly flat at hk7957 million compared to hwls reported 2014 results for this division


retail
the retail divisions total store numbers passed the 12000 milestone with 12400 stores across 25 markets as at
31 december 2015 representing net additions of 965 stores in 2015 despite 2015 results being adversely affected by foreign
currency translation to hong kong dollars this division achieved strong sales and earnings growth in local currencies
total reported revenue of hk151903 million was 3 lower than 2014 in local currencies revenue increased by 5 driven
by 19 comparable store sales growth and an 8 increase in store numbers compared to 2014 excluding the onetime gain
on the disposal of the airport concession operation in july 2014 ebitda and ebit of hk14838 million and hk12328 million
in 2015 were 2 and 3 lower than 2014 in reported currency respectively but were both 7 higher in local currencies

health and beauty segment which represents 92 of the divisions ebitda reported impressive doubledigit growth rates
under the current challenging market conditions with both ebitda and ebit growth at 11 in local currencies this reflected the
successful store portfolio expansion strategies improving margins and strong cost management in the highly resilient health
and beauty store format health and beauty operations in europe overall delivered strong earnings with ebitda and ebit
growth of 9 in local currencies reflecting a 5 increase in store numbers 43 comparable store sales growth and generally
improving margins

in asia the health and beauty operations growth continued largely driven by expansion of the store portfolio partly offset
by the softening retail market comparable store sales growth was negative 21 for the full year resulting in ebitda and ebit
growth of 13 in local currencies watsons chinas total revenue grew by 9 in local currency against a 19 increase in stores
numbers compared to 2014 as comparable store sales growth was negative 51 ebitda and ebit growth for watsons china
in local currency both remained robust at 16 in 2015 as the business continued to maintain disciplined cost control measures
and to promote higher margin products

overall the retail division plans net openings of over 1000 stores in 2016 with key markets in the mainland and certain asian
and eastern european countries continuing to lead the expansion

husky energy
husky energy our associated company listed in canada announced profit attributable to shareholders before impairment
charge and asset write downs of c165 million in 2015 92 below last year primarily due to a depressed oil price
environment

in light of the prolonged low oil price levels husky energy has recognised an aftertax impairment charge and exploration and
evaluation asset write downs of c4015 million on its crude oil and natural gas assets located in western canada in the second
half of 2015 as part of the reorganisation the group had to rebase husky energys assets to their fair values on the date of
completion of the reorganisation consequently a lower valuation was assigned to these western canadian assets for the
groups financial statements consistent with prevailing conditions in the relevant energy markets as a result the impairment
charge and write downs of these assets by husky energy had no impact on the groups reported results

average production of 345700 barrels of oil equivalent per day boes per day in 2015 represents a 2 increase from
340100 boes per day in 2014 mainly due to ramp up in production from the asia pacific operations and new volumes from
the sunrise energy and rush lake thermal development projects which were partly offset by lower production in western
canada and the atlantic region as a result of natural reservoir declines in mature properties and reduced capital investment

husky energy is continuing to advance its transition into a low sustaining capital business while providing flexibility in ramping
up production when commodity prices recover several initiatives are in progress to unlock the incremental value and further
strengthen the business and its balance sheet including potential complete or partial sale and dispositions of certain assets
husky energy also plans to complete three new heavy oil thermal developments at edam east vawn and edam west in 2016

certain portion of husky energys operations are not directly affected by the commodity price volatility including the asia
pacific region which is delivering solid value through fixed price contracts and the marginbased downstream business husky
energy will continue to build on its resilience with a focus on growing profitability and further lowering its cost structure to
fortify its business in a weak commodity price environment

additional contributions
postreorganisation the groups interest in husky energy as compared to hwls interest has increased from 3396 to 4018
including the additional contributions on a full year pro forma basis the groups share of revenue ebitda and ebit before the

customer service margin 3 ireland from a full year of accretive earnings contribution after the acquisition of o2 ireland in july
2014 and continued cost synergies realised in 3 austria on a full year pro forma basis ebit in local currencies improved 92

assets under the reorganisation european currency weakness led to a 4 lower revenue in reported currency over last year
to hk62799 million while ebitda and ebit in reported currency grew by 12 and 69 to hk17396 million and

comparable ebitda and ebit before additional contributions for the division decreased 2 and 1 to hk11840 million
and hk7887 million respectively in 2015 but increased 4 and 6 respectively in local currencies primarily due
to the higher margin from the throughput growth previously mentioned the lower power and fuel costs together
with the continued focus on better cost control through improvements in productivity and efficiency these
improvements in underlying performance however were partly offset by the deconsolidation impact of the jakarta
operations as well as the lower profitability in the rotterdam ports during the year as mentioned previously

the decline in performance in the europe segment during the year is primarily attributable to the weakness of the
euro and the british pound that has resulted in lower reported results on translation to hong kong dollars in local

average production increased 2 to 345700 barrels of oil equivalent boes per day in 2015 mainly due to strong
production volume from the asia pacific region and new volumes from the sunrise energy project which began
production in march 2015 as well as the suite of heavy oil thermal projects including rush lake development which
began production in the third quarter of 2015 partly offset by lower production in western canada and the atlantic
region due to natural reservoir declines at mature properties and oilrelated drilling and completion activity in 2015
continued to be deferred as a result of the low oil price environment

husky energy has delivered its milestones in various key projects during 2015 in march 2015 first oil was achieved
at phase 1 of sunrise energy project and the project is expected to reach its peak production at 60000 barrels per
day 30000 barrels per day net to husky energy by the end of 2016 production at the first and second production
wells at the south white rose satellite extension in the atlantic region commenced in june and september 2015
respectively in terms of heavy oil developments first oil was achieved at the rush lake heavy oil thermal project in
saskatchewan in july 2015 husky energy plans to advance its production timetable for three new heavy oil thermal
developments at edam east 10000 bblsday vawn 10000 bblsday and edam west 4500 bblsday in 2016

                                     ebitda of 686 million was 25 higher than 2014 mainly driven by improved net customer service margin
                                     primarily due to an enlarged customer base and the net ampu growth of 7 compared to 2014 through pricing
                                     and proposition changes and a onetime release of the excess in the provision made last year following the
                                     settlement of interconnection rate disputes during the year the margin improvement was partly offset by
                                     higher operating expenses driven largely by higher network costs due to additional new sites commissioned
                                     ebit of 461 million represents a 47 increase over last year following the strong ebitda performance and lower

despite intense competition in the italian market 3 italy successfully grew its active customer base by 4 to
91 million customers in 2015 ebitda increased 11 during the year mainly driven by a 10 increase in net customer
service margin from the increase in the contract customer base partly offset by higher operating expenses and
higher total cacs net of handset revenue the turnaround to an ebit of 157 million from the lbit position of
46 million in 2014 was also due to the lower depreciation as a result of rebasing telecommunication assets under
the reorganisation

the operation in denmark where the group has a 60 interest faced a challenging and competitive market
in 2015 where the proposed but withdrawn merger of the two major danish operators intensified market
competition during the year although the active customer base increased 6 this was fully offset by the 6
lower net ampu resulting in the net customer service margin remained constant in 2015 compared to 2014
ebitda decreased 4 to dkk704 million mainly driven by higher operating expenses and total cacs net of
handset revenue the decline in ebitda was fully compensated by the lower depreciation and amortisation due
to lower telecommunication asset base under the reorganisation and as a consequence ebit improved by 1 to
dkk430 million

                                     ebitda increased 29 from 2014 to 316 million mainly due to an increase in net customer service margin driven by
                                     higher net ampu from improved tariff propositions and mix together with lower operating expenses attributable to the

                                     in 2015 reflecting the improvement of ebitda as well as the lower depreciation and amortisation due to a lower asset

     group capital resources and liquidity

     treasury management
     the groups treasury function sets financial risk management policies in accordance with policies and procedures that are approved by the executive directors and
     which are also subject to periodic review by the groups internal audit function the groups treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations
     in interest rates and exchange rates on the groups overall financial position and to minimise the groups financial risks the groups treasury function operates as
     a centralised service for managing financial risks including interest rate and foreign exchange risks and for providing costefficient funding to the group and its
     companies it manages the majority of the groups funding needs interest rate foreign currency and credit risk exposures it is the groups policy not to have credit
     rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of the groups borrowings the group uses interest rate and foreign currency swaps and forward contracts
     as appropriate for risk management purposes only for hedging transactions and for managing the groups exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate
     fluctuations it is the groups policy not to enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes it is also the groups policy not to invest liquidity in financial
     products including hedge funds or similar vehicles with significant underlying leverage or derivative exposure

     cash management and funding
     the group operates a central cash management system for all of its unlisted subsidiaries except for listed and certain overseas entities conducting businesses in
     nonhk or nonus dollar currencies the group generally obtains longterm financing at the group level to onlend or contribute as equity to its subsidiaries and
     associated companies to meet their funding requirements and provide more costefficient financing these borrowings include a range of capital market issues
     and bank borrowings for which the proportions will change depending upon financial market conditions and projected interest rates the group regularly and
     closely monitors its overall debt position and reviews its funding costs and maturity profile to facilitate refinancing

     interest rate exposure
     the group manages its interest rate exposure with a focus on reducing the groups overall cost of debt and exposure to changes in interest rates when considered
     appropriate the group uses derivatives such as interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage its interest rate exposure the groups main interest
     rate exposure relates to us dollar british pound euro and hk dollar borrowings

     at 31 december 2015 approximately 32 of the groups total principal amount of bank and other debts were at floating rates and the remaining 68 were at
     fixed rates the group has entered into various interest rate agreements with major financial institution counterparties to swap approximately hk47973 million
     principal amount of fixed interest rate borrowings to effectively become floating interest rate borrowings in addition hk6061 million principal amount of
     floating interest rate borrowings were swapped to fixed interest rate borrowings after taking into consideration these interest rate swaps approximately 47
     of the groups total principal amount of bank and other debts were at floating rates and the remaining 53 were at fixed rates at 31 december 2015 all of the
     aforementioned interest rate derivatives are designated as hedges and these hedges are considered highly effective

     foreign currency exposure
     for overseas subsidiaries associated companies and other investments which consist of nonhk dollar or nonus dollar assets the group generally endeavours
     to establish a natural hedge for debt financing with an appropriate level of borrowings in those same currencies for overseas businesses that are in the
     development phase or where borrowings in local currency are not or are no longer attractive the group may not borrow in the local currency or may repay
     existing borrowings and monitor the development of the businesses cashflow and the relevant debt markets with a view to refinance these businesses with
     local currency borrowings in the future when conditions are more appropriate exposure to movements in exchange rates for individual transactions such as
     major procurement contracts directly related to its underlying businesses is minimised by using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps where
     active markets for the relevant currencies exist the group generally does not enter into foreign currency hedges in respect of its longterm equity investments
     in overseas subsidiaries and associated companies except in relation to certain infrastructure investments

     the group has operations in over 50 countries and conducts businesses in 46 currencies the groups functional currency for reporting purposes is hong kong
     dollars and the groups reported results in hong kong dollars are exposed to exchange translation gains or losses on its foreign currency earnings the group
     generally does not enter into foreign currency hedges in respect of its foreign currency earnings at times of significant exchange rate volatility and where
     appropriate opportunities arise the group may prudently enter into forward foreign currency contracts and currency swaps for selective foreign currencies for
     a portion of its budgeted foreign currency earnings to limit potential downside foreign currency exposure on its earnings

     the groups total principal amount of bank and other debts are denominated as follows 25 in euro 36 in us dollars 7 in hk dollars 25 in british pounds
     and 7 in other currencies

     risk factors

     the groups business financial condition and results of operations are subject to various business risks and uncertainties the factors set out below are
     those that the group believes could result in the groups financial condition or results of operations differing materially from expected or historical results
     there may be other risks in addition to those shown below which are not known to the group or which may not be material now but could turn out to
     be material in the future


     global economy
     as a global business the group is exposed to the development of the global economy as well as the industries and geographical markets in which it
     operates as a result the groups financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the general state of the global economy or the
     general state of a specific market or economy any significant decrease in the level of economic growth in the global or regional or a specific economy
     could adversely affect the groups financial condition or results of operations


     industry trends interest rates and currency markets
     the groups results are affected by trends in the industries in which it operates including the ports and related services retail infrastructure energy
     and telecommunications industries while the group believes that its diverse operations geographical spread and extensive customer base reduce its
     exposure to particular industry cycles its results have in the past been adversely affected by industry trends for example lower oil and gas prices cyclical
     downturn in the business of shipping lines declines in retail consumer spending decline in the value of securities investments and also volatility in
     interest rates and currency markets there can be no assurance that the combination of industry trends and currency and interest rates experienced by
     the group in the future will not adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations

     in particular income from the groups finance and treasury operations is dependent upon the interest rate the currency environment and market
     conditions and therefore there can be no assurance that changes in these conditions will not adversely affect the groups financial condition and results
     of operations


     cashflow and liquidity
     from time to time the group accesses shortterm and longterm bank and debt capital markets to obtain financing the availability of financing with
     acceptable terms and conditions may be impacted by many factors which include among others liquidity in the global and regional banking and debt
     capital markets and the groups credit ratings although the group aims to maintain a capital structure that is appropriate for longterm investment grade
     ratings the groups actual credit ratings may depart from these levels due to economic circumstances if the liquidity in the capital markets declines and
     or credit ratings of the group decline the availability and cost of borrowings could be affected and thereby impact the groups financial condition and
     results of operations


     currency fluctuations
     the group reports its results in hong kong dollars but its subsidiaries and associated companies in various countries around the world receive revenue
     and incur expenses in approximately 46 different local currencies the groups subsidiaries and associated companies may also incur debt in these local
     currencies the group is thereby exposed to the potentially adverse impact of currency fluctuations on translation of the accounts and debts of these
     subsidiaries and associated companies and also on the repatriation of earnings equity investments and loans although the group actively manages
     its currency exposures depreciation or fluctuation of the currencies in which the group conducts its operations relative to the hong kong dollar could
     adversely affect the groups financial condition and results of operations


     crude oil and natural gas markets
     husky energys results of operations and financial condition are dependent on the prices received for its refined products crude oil natural gas liquids
     ngl and natural gas production lower prices for crude oil ngl and natural gas could adversely affect the value and quantity of husky energys oil and
     gas reserves prices for refined products and crude oil are based on world supply and demand the imbalance in the supply and demand can be affected
     by a number of factors including but not limited to the growth in us unconventional and the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec
     production lower economic growth forecasts from emerging markets and corresponding growth in global crude oil inventories which resulted in the
     prolonged low crude oil benchmarks in 2015 husky energys natural gas production is currently located in western canada and the asia pacific region
     western canada is subject to north american fundamentals since virtually all natural gas production in north america is consumed by north american
     customers predominantly in the united states in the asia pacific region natural gas is sold to a specific buyer with longterm contracts for the liwan
     31 gas field a price profile has been fixed for five years and will then be linked to local benchmark pricing for the years following subject to a fixed floor
     and ceiling for liuhua 342 the price is fixed with a single escalation step during the contract delivery period volatility in refined products crude oil
     and natural gas prices could adversely affect the groups financial condition and results of operations

highly competitive markets
the groups principal business operations face significant competition across the diverse markets in which they operate new market entrants the
intensification of price competition by existing competitors product innovation or technological advancement could adversely affect the groups
financial condition and results of operations competitive risks faced by the group include

      the vertical integration of international shipping lines who are major clients of the groups port operations shipping lines are increasingly
       investing in seaports and in their own dedicated terminal facilities and going forward may not require the use of the groups terminal facilities

      the expected continuous significant competition and pricing pressure from retail competitors which may adversely affect the financial
       performance of the groups retail operations

      the new market entrants and intensified price competition among existing market players of the groups waste management and offairport car
       park businesses which could adversely affect the financial performance of the groups waste management and offairport car park operations

      the introduction of new aircraft models brought about by technological innovation and cyclical downturn in the airline industry could adversely
       affect the demand for and value of aircraft in the groups aircraft leasing business

      the risk of competition with respect to gaining access to the resources required to increase oil and gas reserves and production and gain access
       to markets the groups ability to successfully complete development projects could be adversely affected if it is unable to acquire economic
       supplies and services due to competition

      the aggressive tariff plans and customer acquisition strategies by telecommunications competitors may impact the groups pricing plans
       customer acquisition and retention costs rate of customer growth and retention prospects and hence the revenue it receives as a major provider
       of telecommunications services and

      the risk of competition from disruptive alternate telecommunications or energy technologies and potential competition in the future from
       substitute telecommunications or energy technologies being developed or to be developed or if the group fails to develop or obtain timely access
       to new technologies and equipment


retail product liability
the groups retail operations may be subject to product liability claims if people are harmed by the products our retail operations sell our customers
count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and nonfood products that we source from our wide variety of
suppliers could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control claims recalls
or actions could be based on allegations that among other things the products sold by our retail operations are misbranded contain contaminants
or impermissible ingredients provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or misuse include inadequate warnings concerning flammability or
interactions with other substances or in the case of any handset and other electrical devices that we sell are not fit for purpose or pose a safety hazard
while we have maintained product liability insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are prudent there can be no assurance
that the coverage will be applicable and adequate to cover all possible adverse outcomes of claims and legal proceedings against us any material
shortfall in coverage may have an adverse impact on our retail operations results of operations further any lost confidence on the part of our customers
would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any material issue regarding the safety of any food and nonfood items we sell regardless of the
cause could adversely affect our retail operations results of operations


strategic partners
the group conducts some of its businesses through nonwhollyowned subsidiaries associated companies and joint ventures in which it shares control
in whole or in part and has formed strategic alliances with certain leading international companies government authorities and other strategic partners
there can be no assurance that any of these strategic or business partners will wish to continue their relationships with the group in the future or that
the group will be able to pursue its stated strategies with respect to its nonwhollyowned subsidiaries associated companies and joint ventures and the
markets in which they operate furthermore other investors in the groups nonwhollyowned subsidiaries associated companies and joint ventures
may undergo a change of control or financial difficulties which may affect the groups financial condition and results of operations

     risk factors



     future growth
     the group continues to cautiously expand the scale and geographical spread of its businesses through investment in organic growth as well as
     undertaking selective mergers acquisitions and disposal activities if appropriate opportunities in the market arise success of the groups mergers and
     acquisitions will depend among other things on the ability of the group to realise the expected synergies cost savings and growth opportunities upon
     integration of the merged or acquired businesses these businesses may require significant investment and the commitment of executive management
     time and other resources there can be no assurance that a failure to operate the merged or acquired businesses successfully or a longer than projected
     period to realise the expected synergies will not adversely affect the groups financial condition and results of operations

     the group has made substantial investments in acquiring 3g and 4g lte licences developing its mobile telecommunications networks and growing its
     customer bases in europe australia hong kong and macau the group may need to incur more capital expenditure to expand improve or upgrade its
     mobile telecommunications networks acquire additional licence spectrum and incur more customer acquisition and retention costs to expand its mobile
     telecommunications businesses there can be no assurance that any additional investments will further increase customer levels and operating margins
     and consequently additional investments may adversely impact the groups financial condition and results of operations

     as at 31 december 2015 the group had a total deferred tax asset balance of hk20986 million of which hk19001 million were attributable to the
     groups mobile telecommunications operations in the uk ireland austria sweden and denmark the ultimate realisation of these deferred tax assets
     depends principally on these businesses maintaining profitability and generating sufficient taxable profits to utilise the underlying unused tax losses in
     the uk ireland austria sweden and denmark taxation losses can be carried forward indefinitely in addition in the uk the group enjoys the availability
     of group relief in relation to taxation losses generated by its mobile telecommunications operations to offset taxable profits from its other businesses in
     the same period if there is a significant adverse change in the projected performance and resulting cashflow projections of these businesses some or all
     of these deferred tax assets may need to be reduced and charged to the income statement which could have an adverse effect on the groups financial
     condition and results of operations


     impact of national and international regulations
     as a global business the group is exposed to local business risks in several different countries which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition
     or results of operations the group operates in many countries around the world and has continued to expand outside its traditional market of hong kong
     the group is and may increasingly become exposed to different and changing political social legal and regulatory requirements at the national
     or international level such as those required by the european union eu or the world trade organisation these include

           changes in tariffs and trade barriers

           changes in taxation regulations and interpretations

           competition antitrust law applicable to all of the groups activities including the regulation of monopolies and conduct of dominant firms the
            prohibition of anticompetitive agreements and practices and law requiring the approval of certain mergers acquisitions and joint ventures which
            could restrict the groups ability to own or operate subsidiaries or acquire new businesses in certain jurisdictions

           delays in the process of obtaining or maintaining licences permits and governmental approvals necessary to operate certain businesses

           telecommunications including but not limited to spectrum auction and broadcasting regulations and

           environmental laws and regulations

     there can be no assurance that the european institutions andor the regulatory authorities of the eu member states in which the group operates will not
     make decisions or interpret and implement the eu or national regulations in a manner that does not adversely affect the groups financial condition and
     results of operations in the future

     ports are often viewed by governments as critical national assets and in many countries are subject to government control and regulations regime
     changes or sentiment changes in less politically stable countries may affect port concessions granted to foreign international port operations including
     the groups port operations

     certain infrastructure investments of the group are subject to regulatory pricing and strict adherence must be made to the licence requirements codes
     and guidelines established by the relevant regulatory authorities from time to time failure to comply with these licence requirements codes of
     guidelines may lead to penalties or in extreme circumstances amendment suspension or cancellation of the relevant licences by the authorities

impact of national and international regulations continued
husky energys business is subject to environmental regulations similar to other companies in the oil and gas industry compliance with such legislation
can require significant capital expenditures and operating costs and failure to comply may result in imposition of fines and penalties and liability for
cleanup costs and damages there can be no assurance that changes to such regulations including but not limited to environmental legislation requiring
reductions in emissions will not adversely affect husky energys and therefore the groups financial condition and results of operations

new policies or measures by governments whether fiscal regulatory or other competitive changes may pose a risk to the overall investment return of
the groups infrastructure and energy businesses and may delay or prevent the commercial operation of a business with a resulting loss of revenue and
profit

the group is only permitted to provide telecommunications services and operate networks under licences granted by regulatory authorities in
individual countries all of these licences have historically been issued for fixed terms and subsequently renewed however further renewals may
not be guaranteed or the terms and conditions of these licences may be changed upon renewal due to changes in legislation the groups mobile
telecommunications licences in the uk and italy effectively provide for perpetual renewal rights all of these licences contain regulatory requirements
and carrier obligations regarding the way the group must conduct its businesses as well as regarding network quality and coverage failure to meet
these requirements could result in damage awards fines penalties suspensions or other sanctions including ultimately revocation of the licences
decisions by regulators regarding the granting amendment or renewal of licences to the group or other parties including spectrum allocation to other
parties or relaxation of constraints with respect to the technology or specific service that may be deployed in the given spectrum band could result in
the group facing unforeseen competition and could adversely affect the groups financial condition and results of operations

the groups overall success as a global business depends in part upon its ability to succeed in different economic social and political conditions there
can be no assurance that the group will continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location
where it conducts business


accounting
the hong kong institute of certified public accountants hkicpa is continuing its policy of issuing hong kong financial reporting standards hkfrs
and interpretations that fully converge with international financial reporting standards ifrs issued by the international accounting standards board
iasb hkicpa has issued and may in the future issue more new and revised standards and interpretations including those required to conform to
standards amendments and interpretations issued from time to time by the iasb such factors may require adoption of new accounting policies there
can be no assurance that the adoption of new accounting policies or new hkfrs will not have a significant impact on the groups financial condition and
results of operations


impact of regulatory reviews
the group and some of its subsidiaries and associated companies are listed on various stock exchanges around the world and all are subject to regulatory
reviews of their various filings by the respective stock exchanges regulatory bodies while all listed companies endeavour to comply with all regulatory
requirements of the various stock exchanges and other authorities in the countries in which they operate and obtain independent professional advice
as appropriate there can be no assurance that the regulatory bodies review will not result in a disagreement with the companies interpretations and
judgements and that any required actions mandated by the authorities will not have a significant impact on the groups reported financial position and
results of operations


outbreak of highly contagious disease
in 2003 there was an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in the mainland singapore hong kong other asian countries and canada
the sars outbreak had a significant adverse impact on the economies of the affected countries since then there have been media reports regarding
the spread of the avian influenza among birds poultry and in some cases transmission of avian influenza virus from animals to human beings more
recently since december 2013 an epidemic of the ebola virus disease has impacted parts of the west africa and since 2015 the zika virus has been linked
to abnormal brain development in foetuses and miscarriages these diseases have led to travel warnings by health organisations for people to certain
locations there is no assurance that there will not be another significant global outbreak of a severe communicable disease and if the ebola virus zika
virus or other highly contagious diseases spread to the countries in which we operate or are not satisfactorily contained it may have an adverse impact
on the groups financial condition and results of operations

     risk factors



     natural disasters
     some of the groups assets and projects and many of the groups customers and suppliers are located in areas at risk of damage from earthquakes floods
     typhoons and other major natural disasters and the occurrence of any of these events could disrupt the groups business materially and adversely affect
     the groups financial condition and results of operations

     although the group has not experienced any major structural damage to infrastructure projects or ports or other facilities from earthquakes to date there
     can be no assurance that future earthquakes or other natural disasters will not occur and result in major damage to the groups infrastructure projects
     ports or other facilities or on the general supporting infrastructure facilities in the vicinity which could adversely affect the groups financial condition
     and results of operations


     political unrest and terrorist attacks
     the group has presence in over 50 countries around the world there can be no assurance that all of these countries will remain stable politically or
     immune to terrorist attacks between 2010 and 2012 a number of middle eastern and north african countries were swept by a wave of demonstrations
     and protests known as arab spring and many of the ruling parties were forced from power the violent demonstrations resulted in political and economic
     upheaval in the countries that were affected in 2015 a series of terrorist attacks occurred in paris france that resulted in the deaths of 130 people
     and led to the country declaring a state of emergency and some nearby countries declaring lockdowns there is no assurance that there will not be any
     political unrest or immunity from terrorist attacks in the countries in which we operate and if these events occur it may have an adverse impact on the
     groups financial condition and results of operations

anticorruption
the group has established a strong internal control framework and stringent policies to institute a vigorous enforcement regime against
corruption and fraud

in particular the board of directors sets a tone of zerotolerance on corruption and fraud this is reflected in our policy on the subject as well as
many of our operational procedures where emphasis on our values of integrity fairness transparency and accountability is evident

in addition our groups strong stance against corruption and fraud is communicated to all our employees and requisite provisions are
incorporated into our contracts with third party suppliers to ensure that they are fully aware of our position these measures are further bolstered
by independent audits conducted by the groups internal audit function

         recognised as goodwill if the consideration transferred and the fair value of preexisting investment in the acquiree is less than the fair value
         of the identifiable net assets acquired being a bargain purchase to the group the difference is recognised as a gain directly in profit or loss by
         the group on the acquisition date but only after a reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired the
         noncontrolling interest in the acquiree if any the consideration transferred and the groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree


         business combinations are initially accounted for on a provisional basis the group retrospectively adjusts the provisional amounts recognised
         and also recognises additional assets or liabilities during the measurement period based on new information obtained about the facts
         and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date the measurement period is the period from the date the group obtains complete
         information about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and ends on 12 months from the date of the acquisition


    ac	discontinued operations
         a discontinued operation is a component of the groups business the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the

         resale or dispose


         when an operation is classified as discontinued a single amount is presented in the income statement which comprises the posttax profit or
         loss of the discontinued operation and the posttax gain or loss recognised on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal
         of the assets or disposal group constituting the discontinued operations

    all existing hkfrs revenue guidance and requirements including hkas 18 revenue hkas 11 construction contracts and the related interpretations
    when it becomes effective the core principle of hkfrs 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
    customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the group is
    assessing the impact of hkfrs 15 it is currently anticipated that the application of hkfrs 15 in the future may impact the disclosure to be made in the

    of these financial statements


    hkfrs 16 will be effective for the groups financial statements for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 hkfrs 16 specifies

    lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance with hkfrs 16s
    approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged from its predecessor hkas 17 the group is assessing the impact of hkfrs 16 and as a result

      notes to the financial statements


      4     critical accounting estimates and judgements
            note 3 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements the preparation of financial
            statements often requires the use of judgements to select specific accounting methods and policies from several acceptable alternatives furthermore
            significant estimates and assumptions concerning the future may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the financial
            statements the group bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable
            under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates and judgements under different assumptions or conditions


            the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation
            of the financial statements


            a basis of consolidation
                   the determination of the groups level of control over another entity will require exercise of judgement under certain circumstances the
                   company controls an entity when it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to
                   affect those returns through its power over the investee as such the classification of the entity as a subsidiary a joint venture an associate or
                   a cost investment might require the application of judgement through the analysis of various indicators such as the percentage of ownership
                   interest held in the entity the representation on the entitys board of directors and various other factors including if relevant the existence
                   of agreement with other shareholders applicable statutes and regulations and their requirements the group also considers in particular
                   whether it obtains benefits including nonfinancial benefits from its power to control the entity


            b longlived assets
                   assets that have an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually and when there is indication that they may be impaired assets
                   that are subject to depreciation and amortisation are reviewed for impairment to determine whether there is any indication that the carrying
                   value of these assets may not be recoverable and have suffered an impairment loss if any such indication exists the recoverable amount of
                   the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair
                   value less costs to dispose and value in use such impairment loss is recognised in the income statement except where the asset is carried at
                   valuation and the impairment loss does not exceed the revaluation surplus for that asset in which case it is treated as a revaluation decrease
                   and is recognised in other comprehensive income


                   judgement is required in the area of asset impairment particularly in assessing 1 whether an event has occurred that may indicate that the
                   related asset values may not be recoverable 2 whether the carrying value of an asset can be supported by the recoverable amount being
                   the higher of fair value less costs to dispose or net present value of future cash flows which are estimated based upon the continued use of
                   the asset in the business and 3 the appropriate key assumptions to be applied in preparing cash flow projections including whether these
                   cash flow projections are discounted using an appropriate rate changing the assumptions used to determine the level if any of impairment
                   including the discount rates or the growth rate assumptions in the cash flow projections could materially affect the net present value used in
                   the impairment test and as a result affect the groups financial condition and results of operations if there is a significant adverse change in the
                   projected performance and resulting future cash flow projections it may be necessary to take an impairment charge to the income statement

    c	depreciation and amortisation
        i     fixed assets

                depreciation of operating assets constitutes a substantial operating cost for the group the cost of fixed assets is charged as depreciation
                expense over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straightline method the group periodically reviews changes
                in technology and industry conditions asset retirement activity and residual values to determine adjustments to estimated remaining
                useful lives and depreciation rates

                actual economic lives may differ from estimated useful lives periodic reviews could result in a change in depreciable lives and therefore
                depreciation expense in future periods


        ii    telecommunications licences other licences brand names trademarks and other rights

                telecommunications licences other licences brand names trademarks and other rights with a finite useful life are carried at cost less
                accumulated amortisation and are reviewed for impairment annually telecommunications licences other licences brand names
                trademarks and other rights that are considered to have an indefinite useful life to the group are not amortised and are tested for
                impairment annually and when there is indication that they may be impaired


                on the basis of confirmation from the ministry of the italian government that the groups 3g licence term in italy can be continuously
                extended for a period equivalent to the previous term effectively making it a perpetual licence and the enactment by the uk houses
                of parliament of a statutory instrument which inter alia changes the life of the groups 3g licence to indefinite the groups 3g licences
                in italy and in the uk are considered to have an indefinite useful life


                brand names relate to retail and telecommunications are considered to have an indefinite useful life as there is no foreseeable limit to
                the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows


                judgement is required to determine the useful lives of the groups telecommunications licences other licences brand names
                trademarks and other rights the actual economic lives of these assets may differ from the current contracted or expected usage periods
                which could impact the amount of amortisation expense charged to the income statement in addition governments from time to time
                revise the terms of licences to change amongst other terms the contracted or expected licence period which could also impact the
                amount of amortisation expense charged to the income statement


        iii   telecommunications customer acquisition costs

                telecommunications customer acquisition costs cacs comprise the net costs to acquire and retain mobile telecommunications
                customers which are primarily 3g and lte customers telecommunications cacs are expensed and recognised in the income statement
                in the period in which they are incurred


                judgement is required to determine the most appropriate accounting policy for telecommunications cacs any change in the accounting
                policy to capitalise these costs will impact the charge to the income statement as these costs will be capitalised and amortised over the
                contract periods


    d goodwill
        goodwill is initially measured at cost being excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred the amount recognised for
        noncontrolling interests and any fair value of the groups previously held equity interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net
        identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is recorded as a separate asset or as applicable included within investments
        in associated companies and joint ventures goodwill is also subject to the impairment test annually and when there are indications that the
        carrying value may not be recoverable




                                                                                                                                        2015 annual report     195

            e	tax
                   the group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for
                   income taxes there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course
                   of business the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due where
                   the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were previously recorded such differences will impact the income
                   tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made


                   deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
                   carrying values in the financial statements deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be
                   available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses and tax credits can be utilised based
                   on all available evidence recognition primarily involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or
                   tax group a variety of other factors are also evaluated in considering whether there is convincing evidence that it is probable that some portion
                   or all of the deferred tax assets will ultimately be realised such as the existence of taxable temporary differences group relief tax planning
                   strategies and the periods in which estimated tax losses can be utilised


                   the ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets recognised for certain of the groups businesses depends principally on these businesses
                   maintaining profitability and generating sufficient taxable profits to utilise the underlying unused tax losses it may be necessary for some
                   or all of the deferred tax assets recognised to be reduced and charged to the income statement if there is a significant adverse change in
                   the projected performance and resulting projected taxable profits of these businesses judgement is required to determine key assumptions
                   adopted in the taxable profit and loss projections and changes to key assumptions used can significantly affect these taxable profit and loss
                   projections


            f business combinations and goodwill
                   as disclosed in note 3ab the group applies the provisions of hkfrs 3 to transactions and other events that meet the definition of a business
                   combination within the scope of hkfrs 3 when the group completes a business combination the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
                   assumed including intangible assets contingent liabilities and commitments are recognised at their fair value judgement is required to
                   determine the fair values of the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and the purchase consideration and on the allocation of the purchase
                   consideration to the identifiable assets and liabilities if the purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired then the
                   incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill if the purchase price consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets acquired
                   then the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statement allocation of the purchase consideration between finite lived assets and
                   indefinite lived assets such as goodwill affects the subsequent results of the group as finite lived intangible assets are amortised whereas
                   indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill are not amortised


            g	provisions for commitments onerous contracts and other guarantees
                   the group has entered into a number of procurement and supply contracts related to specific assets in the ordinary course of its business and
                   provided guarantees in respect of bank and other borrowing facilities to associated companies and joint ventures where the unavoidable costs
                   of meeting the obligations under these procurement and supply contracts exceed the associated expected future net benefits an onerous
                   contract provision is recognised or where the borrowing associated companies and joint ventures are assessed to be unable to repay the
                   indebtedness that the group has guaranteed a provision is recognised the calculation of these provisions will involve the use of estimates
                   these onerous provisions are calculated by taking the unavoidable costs that will be incurred under the contract and deducting any estimate
                   revenues or predicted income to be derived from the assets or by taking the unavoidable costs that will be incurred under the guarantee and
                   deducting any estimated recoverable value from the investment in such associated companies and joint ventures

    h	pension costs
        the group operates several defined benefit plans pension costs for defined benefit plans are assessed using the projected unit credit method
        in accordance with hkas 19 employee benefits under this method the cost of providing pensions is charged to the income statement so as to
        spread the regular cost over the future service lives of employees in accordance with the advice of the actuaries who carry out a full valuation
        of the plans the pension obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates determined
        by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period based on government agency or high quality corporate bonds with currency
        and term similar to the estimated term of benefit obligations remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans are recognised in other
        comprehensive income in the year in which they occur and reflected immediately in retained profit remeasurements comprise actuarial gains
        and losses the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset and any change in
        the effect of the asset ceiling excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset


        management appointed actuaries to carry out a full valuation of these pension plans to determine the pension obligations that are required
        to be disclosed and accounted for in the financial statements in accordance with the hkfrs requirements


        the actuaries use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of the defined benefit plans and evaluate and update these
        assumptions on an annual basis judgement is required to determine the principal actuarial assumptions to determine the present value of
        defined benefit obligations and service costs changes to the principal actuarial assumptions can significantly affect the present value of plan
        obligations and service costs in future periods


    i	sale and leaseback transactions
        the group classifies leases into finance leases or operating leases in accordance with the accounting policies stated in note 3w determining
        whether a lease transaction is a finance lease or an operating lease is a complex issue and requires substantial judgement as to whether the
        lease agreement transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to or from the group careful and considered judgement is
        required on various complex aspects that include but are not limited to the fair value of the leased asset the economic life of the leased asset
        whether renewal options are included in the lease term and determining an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the
        minimum lease payments


        classification as a finance lease or operating lease determines whether the leased asset is capitalised and recognised on the statement of
        financial position as set out in note 3w in sale and leaseback transactions the classification of the leaseback arrangements as described
        above determines how the gain or loss on the sale transaction is recognised it is either deferred and amortised finance lease or recognised
        in the income statement immediately operating lease


    j	allocation of revenue for bundled telecommunications transactions with customers
        the group has bundled transactions under contract with customers including sales of both services and hardware for example handsets the
        amount of revenue recognised upon the sale of hardware is determined by considering the estimated fair values of each of the service element
        and hardware element of the contract significant judgement is required in assessing fair values of both of these elements by considering inter
        alia standalone selling price and other observable market data changes in the estimated fair values may cause the revenue recognised for
        sales of services and hardware to change individually but not the total bundled revenue from a specific customer throughout its contract term
        the group periodically reassesses the fair value of the elements as a result of changes in market conditions

    31 december 2015 the fair value of investment properties which reflects the highest and best use was arrived at by reference to comparable market

            described in notes 18 19 and in this note in assessing whether these assets have suffered any impairment the carrying value of the respective

            i     the recoverable amount for the purpose of impairment testing for the retail division and hutchison telecommunications hong kong holdings
                    are based on its value in use which utilises cash flow projections based on the latest approved financial budgets for 5 years discounted to
                    present value at a pretax rate of 6 to 9 and 3 to 4 respectively and where applicable in the calculation the cash flows beyond the 5 year
                    period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 1 to 3 per annum


            ii    the recoverable amount for the purpose of impairment testing for the other respective business units and divisions are based on their fair value
                    less costs of disposal their fair value is by reference where available to the quoted market value  share price or estimated using a value
                    ebitda multiple approach or a price to earnings multiple approach level 3 of the hkfrs 13 fair value hierarchy based on the latest approved
                    financial budget for 5 years the value  ebitda multiple and price to earnings multiple are derived from observable market data for broadly
                    comparable businesses with due consideration for market development expectations and


            iii   the group prepared the financial budgets reflecting current and prior year performances market development expectations and where
                    available and relevant observable market data there are a number of assumptions and estimates involved for the preparation of the budget
                    the cash flow projections for the period covered by the approved budget and for the value in use calculation the estimated terminal value key
                    assumptions include the expected growth in revenues and gross margin inventory level volume and operating costs timing of future capital

                    multiple that can be realised for the estimated fair value a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would not cause the recoverable
                    amount to fall below the carrying value of the respective business units and divisions

                   value of the defined benefit plan obligations disclosed as at 31 december 2015 contributions to fund the obligations are based upon the
                   recommendations of independent qualified actuaries for each of the groups pension plans to fully fund the relevant schemes on an ongoing
                   basis the realisation of the deficit is contingent upon the realisation of the actuarial assumptions made which is dependent upon a number of

                   assumptions in the valuation are an investment return of 6 per annum and salary increases of 4 per annum the valuation was performed

                          hkas 19 employee benefits requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis for the significant actuarial assumptions used to determine the
                          present value of the defined benefit obligations that shows the effects of a hypothetical change in the relevant actuarial assumption at
                          the end of the reporting period on defined benefit obligations


                          the effect that is disclosed in the following assumes that a a hypothetical change of the relevant actuarial assumption had occurred
                          at the end of the reporting period and had applied to the relevant actuarial assumption in existence on that date and b the sensitivity
                          analysis for each type of actuarial assumption does not reflect interdependencies between different assumptions


                          the preparation and presentation of the sensitivity analysis for significant actuarial assumptions is solely for compliance with hkas19
                          disclosure requirements in respect of defined benefit obligations the sensitivity analysis measures changes in the defined benefit
                          obligations from hypothetical instantaneous changes in one actuarial assumption eg discount rate or future salary increase the
                          amount so generated from the sensitivity analysis are whatif forwardlooking estimates the sensitivity analyses are for illustration
                          purposes only and it should be noted that in practice actuarial assumptions rarely change in isolation actual results in the future
                          may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses due to developments in the markets which may cause fluctuations in actuarial
                          assumptions eg discount rate or future salary increase to vary and therefore it is important to note that the hypothetical amounts so
                          generated do not present a projection of likely future events and profits or losses


                          if the discount rate is 025 higher or lower the defined benefit obligation would decrease by 41 or increase by 42 respectively

                          furthermore in presenting the above sensitivity analysis the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using
                          the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit

            the groups major financial assets and financial liabilities include cash and cash equivalents liquid funds and other listed investments and borrowings
            details of these financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in the respective notes the groups treasury function sets financial risk
            management policies in accordance with policies and procedures that are approved by the executive directors and which are also subject to periodic
            review by the groups internal audit function the groups treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and
            exchange rates on the groups overall financial position and to minimise the groups financial risks the groups treasury function operates as a
            centralised service for managing financial risks including interest rate and foreign exchange risks and for providing costefficient funding to the group
            and its companies it manages the majority of the groups funding needs interest rate foreign currency and credit risk exposures it is the groups
            policy not to have credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of the groups borrowings the group uses interest rate and foreign
            currency swaps and forward contracts as appropriate for risk management purposes only for hedging transactions and for managing the groups
            exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations it is the groups policy not to enter into derivative transactions for speculative
            purposes it is also the groups policy not to invest liquidity in financial products including hedge funds or similar vehicles with significant underlying
            leverage or derivative exposure


            a cash management and funding
                   the group operates a central cash management system for all of its unlisted subsidiaries except for listed and certain overseas entities
                   conducting businesses in nonhk or nonus dollar currencies the group generally obtains longterm financing at the group level to onlend
                   or contribute as equity to its subsidiaries and associated companies to meet their funding requirements and provide more costefficient
                   financing these borrowings include a range of capital market issues and bank borrowings for which the proportions will change depending
                   upon financial market conditions and projected interest rates the group regularly and closely monitors its overall debt position and reviews
                   its funding costs and maturity profile to facilitate refinancing


                   the group continues to maintain a robust financial position cash liquid funds and other listed investments liquid assets amounted to
                   hk131426 million at 31 december 2015 2014  hk44307 million liquid assets were denominated as to 28 in hk dollars 40 in

    b interest rate exposure
        the group manages its interest rate exposure with a focus on reducing the groups overall cost of debt and exposure to changes in interest
        rates when considered appropriate the group uses derivatives such as interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage its interest
        rate exposure the groups main interest rate exposure relates to us dollar british pound euro and hk dollar borrowings


        at 31 december 2015 approximately 32 2014  approximately 79 of the groups total principal amount of bank and other debts were
        at floating rates and the remaining 68 2014  approximately 21 were at fixed rates the group has entered into various interest rate
        agreements with major financial institution counterparties to swap approximately hk47973 million 2014  approximately
        hk2450 million principal amount of fixed interest rate borrowings to effectively become floating interest rate borrowings in addition
        hk6061 million 2014  nil principal amount of floating interest rate borrowings were swapped to fixed interest rate borrowings after
        taking into consideration these interest rate swaps approximately 47 2014  approximately 85 of the groups total principal amount of
        bank and other debts were at floating rates and the remaining 53 2014  approximately 15 were at fixed rates at 31 december 2015 all
        of the aforementioned interest rate derivatives are designated as hedges and these hedges are considered highly effective


    c	foreign currency exposure
        for overseas subsidiaries associated companies and other investments which consist of nonhk dollar or nonus dollar assets the group
        generally endeavours to establish a natural hedge for debt financing with an appropriate level of borrowings in those same currencies for
        overseas businesses that are in the development phase or where borrowings in local currency are not or are no longer attractive the group
        may not borrow in the local currency or may repay existing borrowings and monitor the development of the businesses cashflow and the
        relevant debt markets with a view to refinance these businesses with local currency borrowings in the future when conditions are more
        appropriate exposure to movements in exchange rates for individual transactions such as major procurement contracts directly related to its
        underlying businesses is minimised by using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps where active markets for the relevant
        currencies exist the group generally does not enter into foreign currency hedges in respect of its longterm equity investments in overseas
        subsidiaries and associates except in relation to certain infrastructure investments


        the group has operations in over 50 countries and conducts businesses in 46 currencies the groups functional currency for reporting purposes
        is hong kong dollars and the groups reported results in hong kong dollars are exposed to exchange translation gains or losses on its foreign
        currency earnings the group generally does not enter into foreign currency hedges in respect of its foreign currency earnings at times of
        significant exchange rate volatility and where appropriate opportunities arise the group may prudently enter into forward foreign currency
        contracts and currency swaps for selective foreign currencies for a portion of its budgeted foreign currency earnings to limit potential downside
        foreign currency exposure on its earnings


        the groups total principal amount of bank and other debts are denominated as follows 36 in us dollars 25 in euro 7 in hk dollars 25
        in british pounds and 7 in other currencies 2014  14 in us dollars 5 in euro 62 in hk dollars 8 in british pounds and 11 in other
        currencies


    d credit exposure
        the groups holdings of cash managed funds and other liquid investments interest rate and foreign currency swaps and forward currency
        contracts with financial institutions expose the group to credit risk of counterparties the group controls its credit risk to nonperformance by
        its counterparties through monitoring their equity share price movements and credit ratings as well as setting approved counterparty credit
        limits that are regularly reviewed


        the group is also exposed to counterparties credit risk from its operating activities particularly in its ports and aircraft leasing businesses such
        risks are continuously monitored by the local operational management




                                                                                                                                          2015 annual report     259

            e market price risk
                   the groups main market price risk exposures relate to listed  traded debt and equity securities described in liquid assets above and the
                   interest rate swaps as described in interest rate exposure above the groups holding of listed  traded debt and equity securities represented
                   approximately 8 2014  approximately 24 of the liquid assets the group controls this risk through active monitoring of price movements
                   and changes in market conditions that may have an impact on the value of these financial assets and instruments


            f market risks sensitivity analyses
                   for the presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities market risks including interest rate risk currency risk and other price risk
                   information hkfrs 7 financial instruments disclosures requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis for each type of financial market risk that
                   shows the effects of a hypothetical change in the relevant market risk variable to which the group is exposed at the end of the reporting period
                   on profit for the year and on total equity


                   the effect that is disclosed in the following sections assumes that a a hypothetical change of the relevant risk variable had occurred at the
                   end of the reporting period and had been applied to the relevant risk variable in existence on that date and b the sensitivity analysis for each
                   type of financial market risk does not reflect interdependencies between risk variables eg the interest rate sensitivity analysis does not take
                   into account of the impact of changes in interest rates would have on the relative strengthening and weakening of the currency with other
                   currencies


                   the preparation and presentation of the sensitivity analysis on financial market risk is solely for compliance with hkfrs 7
                   disclosure requirements in respect of financial assets and financial liabilities the sensitivity analysis measures changes in the
                   fair value and  or cash flows of the groups financial assets and financial liabilities from hypothetical instantaneous changes
                   in one risk variable eg functional currency rate or interest rate the amount so generated from the sensitivity analysis are
                   whatif forwardlooking estimates the sensitivity analyses are for illustration purposes only and it should be noted that in
                   practice market rates rarely change in isolation actual results in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses
                   due to developments in the global markets which may cause fluctuations in market rates eg exchange or interest rate to
                   vary and therefore it is important to note that the hypothetical amounts so generated do not represent a projection of likely
                   future events and profits or losses


                   i    interest rate sensitivity analysis

                          interest rate risk as defined by hkfrs 7 arises on interestbearing financial assets and financial liabilities


                          the interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions


                                 in the cases of nonderivative financial assets and financial liabilities with fixed interest rates changes in market interest
                                 rates only affect profit for the year or total equity if these financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value
                                 accordingly all nonderivative financial assets and financial liabilities with fixed interest rates that are carried at amortised cost
                                 are excluded from the interest rate sensitivity analysis as they are not subject to interest rate risk as defined in hkfrs 7


                                 in the cases of derivative financial assets and financial liabilities designated as hedging instruments for hedging interest rate risks
                                 changes in market interest rates affect their fair value all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly effective changes in
                                 the fair value of fair value interest rate hedges and changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to interest
                                 rate movements effectively balance out with each other in income statement in the same period accordingly these hedging
                                 instruments and hedged items are excluded from the interest rate sensitivity analysis as they are not exposed to interest rate risk
                                 as defined in hkfrs 7 changes in the fair value of cash flow interest rate hedges resulting from market interest rate movements
                                 affect total equity and are therefore taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis

         i    interest rate sensitivity analysis continued

                       in the cases of derivative financial assets and financial liabilities that are not part of an interest rate risk hedging relationship
                       changes in their fair value arising from gain or loss from remeasurement of these interest rate derivatives to fair value resulting
                       from market interest rate movements affect profit for the year and total equity and are therefore taken into consideration in the
                       sensitivity analysis

                major financial assets and financial liabilities for the purpose of the interest rate sensitivity analysis include


                      cash and cash equivalents see note 26
                      some of the listed debt securities and managed funds see note 25 carried at fair value that bear interest at fixed rate
                      some of the listed debt securities and managed funds see note 25 that bear interest at floating rate
                      some of the bank and other debts see note 31 that bear interest at floating rate
                      interest bearing loans from noncontrolling shareholders see note 32


                under these assumptions the impact of a hypothetical 100 basis points 2014  100 basis points increase in market interest rate at
                31 december 2015 with all other variables held constant


                      profit for the year would decrease by hk384 million 2014  hk152 million due to increase in interest expense
                      total equity would decrease by hk384 million 2014  hk152 million due to increase in interest expense and
                      total equity would have no material impact due to change in fair value of interest rate swaps 2014  nil


         ii   foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity analysis

                currency risk as defined by hkfrs 7 arises on financial assets and financial liabilities being denominated in a currency that is not
                the functional currency and being of a monetary nature therefore nonmonetary financial assets and financial liabilities monetary
                financial assets and financial liabilities denominated in the entitys functional currency and differences resulting from the translation of
                financial statements of overseas subsidiaries into the groups presentation currency are therefore not taken into consideration for the
                purpose of the sensitivity analysis for currency risk


                the foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions


                       major nonderivative monetary financial assets and financial liabilities are either directly denominated in the functional currency
                       or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of foreign currency swaps and forward currency contracts exchange
                       fluctuations of these monetary financial assets and financial liabilities therefore have no material effects on profit for the year
                       and total equity


                       in the cases of derivative financial assets and financial liabilities designated as hedging instruments for hedging currency risks
                       changes in foreign exchange rates affect their fair value all currency hedges are expected to be highly effective changes in the
                       fair value of foreign currency fair value hedges and changes in the fair value of the hedged items effectively balance out with
                       each other in income statement in the same period as a consequence these hedging instruments and hedged items are excluded
                       from the foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity analysis as they are not exposed to currency risk as defined in hkfrs 7
                       changes in the fair value of cash flow currency hedges resulting from market exchange rate movements affect total equity and
                       are therefore taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis




                                                                                                                                         2015 annual report     261

                           other price risk as defined by hkfrs 7 arises from changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk and currency
                           risk as detailed in interest rate exposure and foreign currency exposure paragraphs above on financial assets and financial liabilities


                           the other price sensitivity analysis is based on the assumption that changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate
                           risk and currency risk of financial assets and financial liabilities only affect profit for the year or total equity if these financial assets
                           and financial liabilities are measured at the fair value accordingly all nonderivative financial assets and financial liabilities carried at
                           amortised cost are excluded from the other price sensitivity analysis as they are not subject to other price risk as defined in hkfrs 7


                           major financial assets and financial liabilities for the purpose of the other price sensitivity analysis include


                                 availableforsale investments see note 25
