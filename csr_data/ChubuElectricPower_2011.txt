     we offer our prayers for those who lost their lives in the great    we have therefore established an electric power supply and
     east japan earthquake that occurred in march and we offer          demand task force which is examining and implementing
     our heartfelt best wishes to all who suffered the effects of the    measures to help assure a stable supply of electric power in
     disaster                                                           addition to measures on the power supply side we are asking
                                                                         customers with large factories and other such facilities to
     shutdown of the hamaoka nuclear power station                       change their days of operation with their cooperation and
                                                                         related measures we expect to secure a reserve margin of

     station in may of this year at the request of the prime minister   we realize that this is an imposition on our customers but we
     hamaoka nuclear power station was designed with sufficient          request that you cooperate in saving electricity by setting your
     margin to withstand not only the anticipated tokai earthquake      air conditioners to appropriate temperature levels and other
     but also one the size of the historic ansei tokai earthquake        such actions
     of 1854 in addition we completed construction to increase
     seismic tolerance with target ground motion of approximately        addressing the issue of global warming
     1000 gal in 2008 we have confirmed safety regarding tsunami
     like those following the ansei tokai earthquake the hoei           we electric power companies use large amounts of oil coal
     earthquake which is thought to have consisted of a triple          liquefied natural gas lng and other fossil fuels in order to
     sequence of tokai tonankai and nankai earthquakes and            supply electric power as a result we emit large amounts of
     other such earthquakes that have caused major damage in the         greenhouse gases we are therefore engaged in active efforts to
     region                                                             introduce renewable energy sources as well as nuclear power
     however nuclear power is a business that stands entirely on        as sources of electricity that do not emit greenhouse gases in
     the trust it earns from society for us therefore responding      the process of generating power
     genuinely to your uncertainties and gaining your greater trust      in fiscal year 2010 this companys first industrial mega solar
     is our top priority and we have decided to cease operation of      generation largescale solar power generation facility will

     providing a stable supply of electric power requires having a       the tohokupacific ocean earthquake and accompanying
     reserve power margin approximately 810 of anticipated peak        tsunami caused a tight electric power supplydemand situation
     demand the hamaoka nuclear power station shutdown has              in eastern japan as well as serious incidents at the fukushima

     feature article 1
     supply and demand measures
     in response to the suspension of operations
     at hamaoka nuclear power station
     in may 2011 chubu electric power suspended operations at all reactors at the hamaoka nuclear power station at the
     request of the prime minister the suspension of operations will lead to a significant shortfall in supply capacity for meeting
     maximum electric power demand and will cause the reserve margin necessary to ensure supply stability usually 8 to
     10 to decline this situation has prompted the president of chubu electric power to establish an electric power supply
     and demand task force which he personally heads to investigate and enact measures to ensure power supply stability
     beyond supplyside measures alone customers particularly largescale factories have lent their cooperation by changing
     their days of operation and shifting from peak load times although this still does not meet the adequate reserve margin
     of 810 that is the usual criterion for stable supply these efforts have allowed us to retain a projected reserve margin of
     67 during the summer


     supplyside measures
     we are striving to improve supply capacity through the following measures in order to compensate for the loss of 3617

     we ask for your cooperation in saving electricity at peak times
     electric power demand reaches its peak on summer weekday afternoons many of our customers are cooperating in saving
     electricity by changing their operating days so that days off are moved from weekends to weekdays changing their work
     hours or other such measures
     as a result we expect to be able to provide power with a suitable reserve power margin on thursdays and fridays
     despite the various measures we have devised on the supply and demand sides however we anticipate that the power
     supplyanddemand situation will continue to be severe from 1300 to 1600 on monday to wednesday we sincerely regret
     the inconvenience but we must request our customers cooperation in saving electricity

     tsunami countermeasures
     at hamaoka nuclear power station
     we have verified the hamaoka nuclear power stations level of safety against tsunamis taking into account tsunami events
     that have had a major impact on the area in the past such as those from the anseitokai in 1854 and hoei in 1707
     earthquakes additionally we have completed emergency safety measures that considered the accident caused at the
     fukushima daiichi nuclear power station of tokyo electric power company inc by the great east japan earthquake on
     march 11 2011because we take societys increased concerns about the safety of nuclear power very seriously we have
     decided to enact tsunami countermeasures announced on july 22 2011 intended to enhance the safety of the hamaoka
     nuclear power station

     approach of tsunami countermeasures
     the ability to shut down cool and contain is essential to ensuring a nuclear power stations safety in the case of the
     fukushima daiichi nuclear power station the ability to cool the reactor was compromised due to the total failure of ac
     power at the site complete loss of ac power furthermore the station experienced a loss of its ability to cool reactor
     facilities using seawater loss of seawater cooling function essentially the loss of cooling functions was the cause behind
     this serious nuclear accidentunder the current tsunami countermeasures we have decided to take two sets of flooding
     prevention measures namely 1 measures such as building a breakwater to prevent flooding on the station grounds and
     2 measures to prevent flooding in buildings if there is flooding on the station grounds in addition we will strengthen
     emergency countermeasures to ensure multiple and diverse cooling functions so that reactors can be reliably and safely
     brought to cold shutdown even in the event of complete loss of ac power and loss of seawater cooling function
     problems that occurred at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station

     flooding prevention measures

                                                                      measures such as building a breakwater to prevent flooding on the station grounds
       prevent flooding on the station grounds

       flooding prevention measure 2                                  maintain seawater cooling function and prevent flooding in buildings if there is
       prevent flooding in buildings                                  flooding on the station grounds

     strengthen emergency countermeasures

       ensure cooling function
                                                                      of seawater cooling function

tsunami countermeasures given on this page are based on plans as of july 22 2011 in the event of subsequent significant changes in plans announcements will be made by media announcements or notices on our website as required




           strengthen emergency countermeasures ensure cooling function
       we have devised worstcase hypothetical situations based on the unlikely event of a simultaneous loss of essential
       equipment similar to what occurred at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station namely the loss of seawater intake
       pumps and the emergency diesel generators used to power them to cope with this contingency we will provide multiple
       and diverse alternative means of cooling namely by ensuring water spraying heat removal and power supply so that
       reactors can maintain a stable hot shutdown state and subsequently be reliably and safely brought to cold shutdown

       system equipment

       diversify means of the injection
       measures include installation of an additional aircooled heat exchange which cools the pump for the highpressure water
       injection system and steps to make it possible to receive power from the emergency ac generator this enables operation
       of the highpressure water injection system the equipment that injects water under high pressure into the reactor core
       even when regular ac power and seawater cooling functions have been completely lost
       in order to secure sources of water for water injection additional water tanks will be installed methods for water
       intake directly from the niino river which runs next to the power station will be put in place and other such steps for
       diversification of water sources will be taken

       chubu electric power intends to implement these tsunami countermeasures with the objective of completing them by december 2012
       thereby improving the safety of the hamaoka nuclear power station we will also do everything in our power to explain these measures in
       detail in order to provide local communities and society at large with a sense of reassurance
       considering the lessons learned from the accident at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station and envisioning the simultaneous
       occurrence of earthquake and tsunamis with a nuclear disaster we intend to work on reviewing and strengthening the chubu electric
       power disaster management systems including those of our group companies we will coordinate closely with local governments and
       other such bodies regarding the appropriate responses to provide local residents in time of disaster and we will take positive action to
       cooperate by sharing knowledge and observations and so on
