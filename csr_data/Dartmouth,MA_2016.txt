                     progress in our sustainability journey harnessing solar energy has been
                     continuous impactful driver as dartmouth is the largest solarproducing
                     community throughout the commonwealth of massachusetts ma in
                     2015 this was bolstered by the addition of our eighth solar farm by the
                     end of the year we have successfully worked closely with solar
                     companies to offset our total electric energy costs through renewable
                     forms of energy more importantly dartmouth saw substantial growth in
                     solar installations on residential and commercial properties as the number
                     of permitted solar installations grew from 355 in 2014 to 725 in 2015

                     the town of dartmouth has continued our recycling program smart
                     save money and reduce trash in hopes of making recycling easier for
                     all residents and business owners and further improving and protecting
                     the beauty of our town this has resulted in an approximately 105
                     increase in the curbside recycling collection of glass cans and plastics
                     and a significant improvement in program participation rates since 2007

                     in order to thrive as a sustainable community the town of dartmouth has
                     positively impacted the economy environment and society by measuring
                     and implementing change highlights include a reduction in personal
                     injury claims and the expansion of sustainable markets such as the
                     southcoast behavioral health center other notable achievements include
                     the development of dartmouths first aquaculture project to clean our
                     waters and the addition of six electric vehicles to our municipal fleet

                     we have been working toward being more financially independent cash
                     reserves have more than doubled from 2008 prerecession totals and our
                     bond rating has also risen in recent years to aaa from sp we have
                     made a point to hire locally whenever possible further encouraging our
                     community to work collaboratively towards our goals



                                                                                                   i

reportedly capable of filtering out harmful impurities such as nitrogen algae and
other harmful pollutants in a quantity of up to 50 gallons of seawater daily



                                                                                      8

the harbormaster is collaborating with the lloyd center for environmental
studies the nautical science department of tabor academy and padanaram
oyster farm in planning a 2016 season project this project is designed to
measure the growth potential of species within the slocum river and little river

another way the town will see additional sustainable activities to the local
market is the new leadership of round the bend farm of south dartmouth
previously owned by the marion institute  an institute with a global and national
reach in developing projects targeting solutions for health and healing
sustainability green economics and environmental education  the farm was
purchased by the bromley charity trust as of january 2015 at which time the
former marion institute executive director desa van laarhoven stepped down
to serve the farm under bromleys mission the farm is active in conferences
featuring sustainable practices and its mission revolves around sustainable
agriculture as such the farm also utilizes its 40 acres for education teaching its
visitors about these sustainable practices and agricultural methods thus not only
does the farm provide sustainable products to dartmouths marketplace but also
works to spread and encourage sustainable knowledge g42

finally and perhaps most notably novel in terms of sustainable practice is
massachusetts contribution to dartmouth renewable energy productions as a
result of a local mandate banning food waste being transferred to the town of
dartmouth landfill the patrickmurray administration awarded the new bedford
regional refuse management district and commonwealth 400000 in grants
this grant award is intended to develop a pilot program for the anaerobic
digestion of local food fats oil grease and sewage sludge waste because such
refuse would typically be transferred to the dartmouth landfill the town of
dartmouth is able to gain from this pilot plant by way of renewable energies the
pilot plant produces electricity through the anaerobic transformation of gasto
energy so that the onsite facility could offer such sustainable energy to nearby
consumers the pilot project operated successfully during 2015 and accepted
source separated organic waste in fy 2015 the anaerobic digester produced
21316 mmbtus of biogas to supplement the 265598 mmbtus of biogas
produced by the landfill directly

rate multifamily housing along state and beeden road are also being produced
progress regarding these three separate apartment complexes has been underway
in the last fiscal year the first of which was just recently completed as of january
2016 the first unit holds 36 units the second unit will consist of 48 units age
restricted and the third unit will also hold 42 units while the second apartment
building is expected to be built later this year the third is scheduled to be
completed in 2017 it is expected that this apartment complex will have
commercial space available contingent upon market conditions g4ec8
another instance of housing development in the town of dartmouth is the project
initiated by partners in housing inc who have achieved funding for the
development of the oconnorsisson house for veterans a collection of nine
affordable living units for veterans located at the former state police barracks on
route 6 in addition to the 460000 in previous cpa awards the town awarded
partners in housing inc 50000 at the june town meeting for the development
of this project this amount adds to the 22 million that has already been
committed to the project from other state and private funds g4ec8
financial implications due to climate change
the town of dartmouth seeks to minimize its environmental footprint while
simultaneously maintaining its sound fiscal policies g4ec2 two power
purchase agreements ppas have been signed with companies providing solar
power for electrical use as a cost reduction and sustainability measure adopted by
the town the town continues to work on projects that would classify dartmouth
as a green community
in 2013 dartmouth launched its solar production project on the capped landfill by
working with borrego solar systems the town administration concluded that
solar panels would be less intrusive than wind turbines and could generate more
revenue for the town operating since february 21st 2013 this initiative has
already begun to reduce environmental costs dartmouth town administrator
david g cressman noted we project the landfill solar farm and energy park
solar farm will generate us about 13 million in savings over 20 years
in 2014 the town of dartmouth received several awards for sustainability
including a municipal award for its leadership on clean energy as well as a
community sustainability program excellence award from the international city
management association icma dartmouth currently contains eight solar farms
that collectively share 2875 mw of solar pv capacity maintaining dartmouths

status as a leading solar powergenerating municipality in massachusetts the
town has also reduced trash generation through recycling and is focused on
increased water conservation dartmouth became first in the southeast to convert
all municipal street lights to light emitting diode bulbs commonly known as
leds at one time with more than 1600 city streetlights retrofitted resulting in
an expected 66 reduction in street lighting costs david cressman has indicated
that dartmouth is producing 100 of solar power capacity within the next fiscal
year in order to offset them with net metering credits
the payasyouthrow payt recycling and waste disposal program
implemented in 2007 marked eight years of operation in october 2015 the
program was renamed on april 12 2012 to the save money and reduce trash
program smart g4en27 smart charges residents scheduled fees to
throw away trash in an effort to reduce trash in the landfill and increase recycling
efforts in the town during this period the program has achieved significant
reductions in waste disposal and improvements in the collection of recyclable
material in fy 2007 the first full year before the program began dartmouth
residents sent 10946 tons of garbage to the towns crapo hill landfill 2007
dartmouth town report in fiscal year 2015 that figure dropped to 481942
tons  a 56 reduction compared to fy 2007 curbside recycling volume saw a
corresponding increase from 1913 tons in fy 2007 to 260323 tons in fy 2015
 a 36 increase in annual recycling compared to fy 2007 and even slightly
higher than total recycling collected curbside in fy 2014 dartmouths smart
program serves more than 10000 households with weekly curbside solid waste
and recycling pickup the town also runs a transfer station that is open three days
per week since the inception of the program the town has reduced waste
manpower and operating costs which has been beneficial for the town both
environmentally and financially dpw director david hickox stated for fy
2015 revenue for the smart program was expected to be 555943
the efficient operation of the water and sewer division and the water pollution
control division of the department of public works is a strong component of the
towns strategy to improve service and reduce harm to the environment projects
designed to expand current facilities to meet growth in demand as well as to
improve the functioning of the sewage treatment plant and sewage pumps will aid
in improving service reducing costs and reinforcing the towns sustainability
initiative for dartmouths residents visitors and the local environment the
town is currently investigating energy efficiency upgrades at various water and
sewer division facilities that are expected to be implemented in fy 2017
over the past 3 years the town of dartmouth has purchased two solarbee
floating spray nozzle systems that were installed in the cross road and smith
neck road tanks these solarbee systems are water turbines that help to control
the formation of tthms as well as to lower the ph level of water in the tank and

over the past several years there has been increasing pressure for public and
private organizations to reduce their carbon footprint to use fewer conventional
forms of energy and to invest in renewable energy sources there is also building
pressure within organizations to drive down costs while dartmouth has been a
stateleader in implementing the use of renewable energy technologies as detailed
earlier in this report the town has also succeeded in reducing its energy costs
the town of dartmouth relies on four main sources of energy electric oil
natural gas and diesel fuel however the town has engaged in several power

summary
the town of dartmouth currently has 8 solar farms in operation with more
expected to be on the way in march of 2013 dartmouth was ranked the top
municipality in the commonwealth of massachusetts with respect to the amount
of installed solar capacity according to a september 2015 report by the national
renewable energy laboratory the town of dartmouth generates more solar
energy than any other community in massachusetts and twice as much as boston
nrel httpwwwnrelgovdocsfy16osti64702pdf with its ongoing
commitment to clean energy initiatives it is clear that dartmouth remains a
national leader in renewable energy
it is estimated that the borrego landfill solar farm and the energy park solar
field alone will bring the town over 13 million in savings over the 20 year
period of the ppas that dartmouth has entered into the increasing
competitiveness of renewable energy technology coupled with the closing of
nearby power stations due to both economic and environmental pressures places
further importance in solar and wind technologies in order to mitigate the risks
posed by the changing energy environment the town of dartmouth is constantly
investing in new technologies and services to offset its energy costs improve its
energy efficiency and adopt more renewable energy g4ec2

searching for practical opportunities to reduce municipal energy consumption and
the towns carbon footprint the following energy use information was
completed in early august 2016 and ongoing changes to the account setup since
this time may have impacted the energy use statistics below in fiscal year 2015
town facilities utilized 270055 less kilowatthours than in the previous fiscal year

despite reductions of energy use by the council on aging the department of
public works the police department and town hall moving from fy 2014 to
fy 2015 incremental increases in energy use were prevalent in some schools
such as dartmouth middle school 11 increase and demello elementary
school 11 increase which contributed to a net rise in energy consumption
cushman elementary school served as a major exception to the general trend
amongst the schools with an 11 reduction in electricity use making an
allowance for the size and complexity of these facilities and their consistent use
throughout the school year it is to be expected that the towns public schools are
responsible for more energy use than any other major group of facilities

purification plants sewage pumps and the wastewater treatment plant in fy
2015 the electricity accounts for the water  sewer division totaled 2065973
kilowatthours while accounts for the water pollution control division amounted
to 3319974 kilowatthours in the same fiscal year natural gas accounts for these
divisions totaled 7003 therms and 16557 therms respectively which is small
when compared to the levels of natural gas used by the schools
as a result of health concerns with the main police department building
dartmouths police are currently located in temporary accommodations outside of
the main building despite the slight increase in electricity consumption that
occurred from fy 2014 to fy 2015 the police department has made significant
reductions in both electricity and natural gas usage since fy 2012 in fact total
energy use by the police department for fy 2015 was 13 less than in fy 2012
from fy 2014 to fy 2015 town hall made significant progress in lowering
energy consumption reducing total energy use by 19 as part of the ongoing
renovation of this historical building new energyefficient windows have been
installed in town hall that will assist in reducing heat loss from the building
during the colder winter months in addition the town is in the final phase of an
upgrade of the remaining compact fluorescent lights cfls in the stairwells to
more energy efficient leds as well as the implementation of dimming controls
and light sensors in several rooms to reduce energy waste
although electricity use in the public libraries increased slightly above that of fy
2014 to 181534 kwh southworth public library and north dartmouth public
library have largely maintained the significant reduction in energy use that
followed fy 2013 where 204499 kwh of electricity was consumed in addition
while gas usage has been rising steadily throughout the last five fiscal years the
town recently implemented a new control system for southworth librarys
hvac equipment that is expected to save the town 37500 kwh of electricity
and 3500 therms of natural gas annually paying for itself in just over five years
as previously mentioned the dartmouth council on aging consumed less energy
in fy 2015 than in fy 2014 this reduction marks a 7 deviation from the trend
of rising energy use that could lead to significant savings if sustained
overall despite the fact that town energy use increased by 07 from fy 2014
to fy 2015 reductions in energy use occurred in many of the towns
departments it should be noted however that electricity usage data for the
towns streetlights were only available for fy 2015 and part of fy 2014 in
addition efforts are currently in progress to track heating oil in several buildings
as a result this energy use was not included in this report while greenhouse gas
emissions from electricity use have declined slightly since fy 2012 emissions
from natural gas have risen much more sharply as demonstrated the trend of

                                                                                    33

rising natural gas usage is an important area for the town to improve on
especially when taking into consideration that buildings are responsible for over
40 of global energy use the town of dartmouth acknowledges that its facilities
represent a magnificent opportunity to make efficiency improvements
the town of dartmouth is committed to monitoring energy use throughout its
facilities in order to identify opportunities for practical energy efficiency
measures that have the capability of saving electricity and natural gas money as
well as preventable greenhouse gas emissions g4en6 in fact dartmouth has
continued to search for energysaving opportunities throughout buildings like the

town vehicle energy use
dartmouth has also invested in energy efficiency on the road with the five hybrid
vehicles and six affordable electric bmw i3 cars it has acquired for use by
municipal employees chagrining stations have been installed at town hall the
water department office and the department of public works building that are
publicly accessible
besides the recent addition of electric vehicles to dartmouths municipal fleet the
majority of the towns vehicles run on conventional fuels primarily gasoline or
diesel due to the fact that town employees almost entirely utilize one of two
townowned fueling stations to refuel municipal vehicles it is possible for
dartmouth to track vehicle fuel consumption as a result information on the
towns fuel usage for fy 2015 can be found in the table below as the town is
currently in the process of cataloging its fuel usage moving backwards data for

goal of meeting retrofitting standards by 2016 for the conservation of toilet and
sink use as a result of a massachusetts mandate for improved municipal energy
efficiency as of the end of the fiscal year all retrofits for this project were
completed

regulations levied by the massachusetts department of environmental protection
dep g4en9
the major water source in dartmouth affected by the withdrawal of water is the
paskamansett river the paskamansett runs through dartmouth and according to
state mandate regarding water pumping when a water sources depth falls below
a specified amount water is no longer allowed to be pumped from adjacent wells
until the water level again increases to an acceptable level
as of dartmouths 2015 water quality report the towns water has been
supplied from 14 groundwater wells wells a b c f1 and f2 located at 299
chase road have a combined capacity of 1555 gallons per minute gpm wells
d e1 and e2 are located in the area of 687 chase road and have a combined
capacity of 1550 gpm wells v1 v2 v3 panelli1 and panelli2 have a
combined capacity of 1370 gpm in addition there is one well on route 6 that is
currently inactive
in 2015 the water division completed the expansion of the panelli well site the
project included the installation of four new water supply wells a pump station
extension of water mains and underground electrical service and improvements
to the access road the four new wells will provide over 450 gallons per minute to
our current supply more information about the towns water supply can be

utilizing grant funding the conservation commission is able to make significant
environmental protection expenditures and investments that benefit the local
environment and community several projects benefited or continue to benefit
from this funding in 2015 a storm water runoff remediation for an urbanized
area received grant funding of 179000 a boat launch improvement project was
awarded 25000 in grant funding and the initial steps to prepare the acquisition

comprised of a sevenmember committee the conservation commission is one
of the entities taking care of and watching over the local lands of biodiversity
value the commission applies the massachusetts wetlands protection act and
the dartmouth wetlands protection bylaw their enforcement power covers
large areas adjoining salt and fresh water bodies and protects wetlands
surrounding areas such as beaches lakes marshes ponds rivers streams and
tidal flats in 2013 the town participated in at a technical review level
environmental restoration salt marsh projects that have reduced invasive species
and increased biodiversity by restoring native salt marsh species as of 2015 the
conservation commission continues to monitor these areas in their ongoing work
on salt marsh projects the increase of native species and the reduction of
invasive species will occur following the completion of the salt marsh projects
approximately 85 acres of restoration projects occurred in dartmouth in 2013
the goal of the salt marsh restoration projects is to increase salinity levels in
coastal estuaries for the purpose of reintroducing native salt marsh species g4

working closely alongside the conservation commission the dartmouth natural
resources trust dnrt is a private entity that acts to conserve natural land and
wildlife in the town the dnrt owns over 1700 acres of land g4en13 in
the last few years the dnrt has acquired a significant amount of land that it has
done work to restore or preserve including
      the 29acre peters creek reserve on the east side of the slocum river
       acquired in 2013
       the 62acre wernick farm reserve on north albro avenue acquired in
       2014
      the 112acre paskamansett woods reserve on chase road acquired in
       in 2015
the involvement of local individuals corporations and organizations make
additional improvements to the town possible through hours of service monetary
donations and partnerships some of these projects include the restoration of
several salt marshes two of which were still in the works during 2015 ie round
hill marsh and star of the sea drive wwwtowndartmouthmaus
over the past few years the 116acre round hill marsh has received 277
million in restoration funding from the us fish and wildlife service a grant that
taps off the 13 million in superfund money from the new bedford harbor
trustees council the funds are designed to enhance the larger 70acre meadow
shores marsh so as to preserve and restore the commonwealths natural storm
barriers as well as create local jobs and thus create local revenues during 2015

                                                                                 38

work on the round hill salt marsh restoration project continued the remediation
work involved removing up to 75000 cubic yards of fill material beneath the
marsh revegetating and replacing the defunct wooden culvert beneath ray peck
drive httpswwwfwsgovhurricanesandyprojectsroundhillhtml
besides the round hill marsh the only other salt marsh restoration project which
is still ongoing  of seven is the star of the sea drive located on bird island
unique to the other salt marsh restoration projects of dartmouth the sea drive
also includes a public access linking approximately 60 dartmouth conservation
commission residentuse trails
not only is the sea drive a useful activity site for dartmouth residents its
restoration is intended to maintain several life sources in danger acquired in
1992 and occupying 4375 acres sea drive was once mined for sand due to the
excavation top soil at sea drive is a rare resource thus as part of the restoration
project dartmouth is committed to encouraging the growth and resources
necessary for such of the naturally located grey birch scrubby oaks and
bayberry the insectivorous sundew and cranberries the restoration project is
dedicated to not only restoring the soil conditions necessary to encourage the
growth of these important life forms but also to the resources for resident
physical activity in fact one of the restorations implementations is the
construction of an aesthetically appealing bridge to encourage the trail public
access and thus social benefits of resident physical activity wwwdnrtorg
during 2015 work on the starofthesea salt marsh project progressed this
project involves the removal of a portion of an historic causeway to improve tidal
flushing a 10 acre salt marsh the project also includes the construction of a
pedestrian walkway over the improved tidal channel to provide a link to existing
hiking trails that exist on adjacent protected parcels 2014 dartmouth town

parsons reserve daffodil farm




the dnrt has been pleased to open its beautiful daffodil trails to the public in
recent years this 32acre reserve is home to fields of daffodils that serve as an
environmental and aesthetic benefit to the community since this long stretched
trail is filled with booming daffodils in the spring many visitors come to see the
beauty of nature and enjoy the peaceful surroundings
however the popularity of this exclusive place in dartmouth has caused
dilemmas for the community in 2015 dnrt counted 12000 visitors in the
period between early april and early may a major increase compared to only
3000 in all of 2012 some of the challenges include visitors especially those
wandering off trails to take pictures and harming the daffodils as well as the issue
of limited parking spaces in order to combat these challenges dnrt created
several photo areas for visitors as well as widened the paths an increase of park
rangers posted regulations and policies on signs and also a proposed crosswalk
are all under way most environmental and social changes are costly and with
much consideration dnrt is now asking for 2 donation per person for non
members when visiting the fields dnrtorg 2014changesdaffodilfields
in addition to conservation efforts the dartmouth pathways committee has
worked to improve bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure through advocacy and
education while supporting coordinated regional efforts to link existing and
future pathways throughout the southern coast these efforts in turn will
improve recreational opportunities fostering a healthier community for residents

temperature composting process to stabilize the dewatered biosolids produced at
the plant these biosolids contain on average 2022 solids and are mixed with
amendment wood mulch on a volumetric ratio of one part biosolids to two parts
amendment this amendment is also produced at the facility in the brush grinding
operation the facility accepts brush from residents and private contractors and
uses a tub grinder for grinding purposes followed by screening in a trommel the
duration of the composting process is approximately 20 days to provide aerobic
decomposition stabilization and disinfection of the biosolids after a minimum
curing period of 30 days the finished compost is sold by agresource to its clients

the likely expectation of every local employer the town of dartmouth too aims
to give municipal employees 24 weeks notice in certain situations however
giving this amount of notice is not practical as some changes must be made
immediately due to the environment dartmouth realizes this and has made a
point to quickly adapt to any operational changes so as to not disrupt its residents
and stakeholders
this notice differs in collective bargaining agreements during which notice
periods occur several months prior to the formalization and signatory of the
contract this notice allows for consultants and attorneys to validate all language
contained in the contract
the town of dartmouth has and will continue to abide by all state and federal
laws and regulations with respect to the use of child forced or compulsory labor
the standard law used by massachusetts is massachusetts general law c149
s33b c149 s56105 and federal laws 29 usc 212 and 29 cfr part 541 at no
time and under no circumstance does the town of dartmouth in any way and by
any means use children forced or compulsory labor in their operations this

means of labor will no longer reside within the towns borders and will be
subject to state and federal fines and punishments
