participants believe that telekom albania is the most active company related to support technology and
innovation initiatives



a understanding the digital divide
despite the large proliferation of information and technology services approximately 39 billion people
approximately 53 of the global population do not use the internet european countries feature the

corporate responsibility report 2016                                                              68

smaller percentage of noninternet users followed by the cis countries the former soviet union

                source itus ict facts and figures 2016 report estimated figures for 2016


while almost 1 billion households worldwide now have internet access out of which 230 million are in
china 60 million in india and 20 million in the worlds 48 least developed countries the most
representative indicator of the digital divides extent is the fact that 84 of households in europe are
connected to the internet while the respective figure for households in africa is 154 at the same
time internet penetration rates for men are higher compared to women in all regions of the world and
are extremely low in the worlds least developed countries ldc as the global internet user gender
gap increased to 12 in 2016 compared to 11 in 2013

corporate responsibility report 2016                                                                69

and included in the the state of lte november 2016 report albania demonstrates a 614
consistency availability of 4g networks which means that on average the countrys 4g users can find an
lte signal over half of the time they try to connect and average 4g speeds slightly exceed 202 mbps
which is above the global average 4g speed of 174 mbps however despite the continuous efforts to
bridge the digital divide the country faces corresponding challenges to provide modern ict services to a
wider population these efforts are undermined by the fact that only 38 of adult population had a
bank account and the countrys overall unemployment and youth unemployment were 173 and
321 respectively in 2015 based on world banks estimates these figures are vital to strengthen
digital economic activities and promote economic development therefore the respective
communications and internet penetration rates are significantly lagging according to itus ict

to 87 and 96 respectively in 2015

2 energy and climate change
a measuring electricity consumption in mobile network
reducing energy consumption in mobile networks is a challenging goal for any telecommunication
company as deployment of a growing network requires installation of new base stations bts and new
equipment added within the mobile network as part of the efforts to upgrade its mobile network to
ensure optimal and fast communication for all its subscribers especially for the 4g service the
company has increased the number of bts to 538 in 2016 compared to 520 in 2015 in order to reduce
electricity consumption in its mobile network telekom albania

corporate responsibility report 2016                                                               103

   has 424 bts connected in the electricity grid compared to 416 in 2015
   replaced old equipment eg indoor rectifiers with high efficiency outdoor rectifiers to transform
    131 sites from indoor to outdoor which increased energy efficiency by 3 on average
   activated hybrid operation in 10 sites to reduce total working hours with electricity from the public
    grid see section vi5b

the overall amount of electricity used for our mobile networks operation was 134785 mwh in 2016
compared to 147973 mwh in 2015 the reduced electricity consumption can be mainly attributed to
the telekom network single radio access network sran modernization project to move from
separate installations for each radio technology to single installations with a common transport and
operational and management system which allows the efficient use of the frequency spectrum
simplifies network architecture and facilitates efficient shared use of hardware




                  electricity consumption in mobile network for 2015 has been restated




                    we reduced electricity consumption in our
                            mobile network by 89

b measuring electricity consumption in buildings
as every company we also consume electricity in our buildings which include our offices and data
centers and therefore strive to reduce this impact through programs as we
  enabled power saving mode in all desktop computers to shut down after a certain idle time except
    for a few computers operating continuously
  installed a smart automation feature to centrally control the office airconditioning system
  initiated the pilot operation of an hvac centralized intelligent controller in one of our buildings
  invested over 20000 to install window sun protection films in three buildings in lapraka and
    kashar as well as two pilot shops in order to minimize uv radiation risks improve working
    conditions and increase energy efficiency

corporate responsibility report 2016                                                             104

   replaced the existing lighting systems with energy efficient led lighting
   installed led outdoor lighting in our premises in lapraka
   utilized desktop virtualization technology and installed 300 thin clients terminals with fewer
    hardware components and lower energy requirements
   enabled turning off idle servers and platforms inside our data centers eg dns servers
   replaced 6 airconditioning units in data centers and installed higher efficiency rectifier and ups
    units in two data centers
   implemented an employee awareness campaign to reduce energy consumption which included
    posters in company premises email sent to all employees and information posted on intranet




in 2016 energy consumption in our offices and data centers was approximately 47196 mwh
compared to 49194 mwh in 2015 while
  electricity consumption per employee was approximately 107753 kwh
  electricity consumption per m² in our offices was 220 kwh compared to 162 kwh in 2015

  corporate responsibility report 2016                                                                       105




            electricity consumption in buildings for 2016 includes offices data centers and 17 own shops
 electricity consumption in buildings for 2015 has been restated includes offices data centers and 18 own shops
electricity consumption for 2014 and 2013 includes offices data centers and warehouses in lapraka and kashar as
                                              well as an own shop in lapraka



                         we reduced electricity consumption in our
                                     buildings by 4

  c measuring diesel consumption
  we use diesel generators to produce electricity in cases electricity supply via the public energy providers
  is infeasible for periods of time or as the main electricity supply in isolated areas where grid connection
  is difficult or impossible

  in 2016 the total diesel consumption reached 634244 lt 631244 lt from generators in mobile network
  and 3000 lt from generators in buildings which corresponds to 6340 mwh 6310 mwh in mobile
  network and 30 mwh in buildings compared to 7276 mwh in 2015 in order to reduce diesel
  consumption within 2016 the company
    switched off standby generators in 36 sites
    constructed medium voltage power lines for 3 sites and transformed them to sites with standby
       generators instead of 24hour continuously operating generators
    activated hybrid operation in 10 sites to reduce total working hours from standby generators see
       section vi5b

corporate responsibility report 2016                                                           106




the overall decrease in diesel consumption is mainly the result of the reduced use of generators to
produce electricity as they were used less frequently due to fewer power disruptions compared to
2015



                we reduced our total energy consumption from
                              diesel by 128

d reducing transportation impact from vehicle fleet
our company operates a number of vehicles which are used to service and develop telekom albanias
telecommunication network distributes its products and service its customers throughout the country
in order to reduce the impact of this activity we
  apply a system to monitor vehicle routes
  regularly service the entire vehicle fleet to ensure compliance with the manufacturers technical
     standards
  gradually replace companyowned vehicles with leased vehicles which are newer and have lower
     energy consumption
  utilize a privatelicensed contractor to daily transport employees to and from the companys
     headquarters
  operate our own minibus to transport employees working on shifts at company offices
  encourage rational use of company vehicles through a vehiclesharing platform via the intranet for
     vehicles used by nonmanagerial employees which applies to all employees except sales
     employees who use company vehicles on a daily basis due to their activities

   we monitor materials used
   we reduce materials used
   we reuse materials used
   we recycle materials used
   we properly dispose materials produced

telekom albania has entered into contracts to recover andor recycle used faulty and endoflife
products and materials the company only utilizes licensed contractors and certified waste management
companies in order to ensure that waste management is conducted in accordance with the respective
legal provisions and international practices all waste including hazardous waste is stored locally in our
contractors premises until their quantities become feasible for transport while there was no waste
shipped abroad during 2016

b using environmentally friendlier bags
we recognize the significant repercussions of plastic bags on the environment and we only use paper
bags and biodegradable bags in all of our shops made of polyethylene with reverted technology which
degrade after a few years if not recycled completely

c managing paper and plastic use and recycling
we use office paper and plastic for various purposes such as billing
and promotional and communication campaigns and materials in the
last years we have implemented various initiatives to reduce office
paper and plastic consumption as we
  offer free ebilling solutions to all customers and employees
  have embedded a paper saving message in the official email
     signature of all company employees
  electronically exchange documentation such as offers purchase
     orders contracts qualification documentation and surveys
  have made our cr reports available only in electronic form since
     2011
  have developed an internal email communication policy
  use only centralized printers one per each floor in each building
  have set twosided printing as the default printing option for all
     employees since 2014
  offer prepaid customers the option to charge their accounts with
     evouchers and encourages its customers to do so through bonus
     airtime to those who select this option
  implement internal awareness campaigns to reduce paper
     consumption and increase recycling of waste paper which were
     effectively communicated to all employees within 2016
  implement the documents retention project during which we
     review certain very old documents and recycle them if not needed
     anymore
  implement a plastic recycling program in our headquarters and
     warehouse as well as our own shops through which we gathered

    and recycled 270 kg of plastic within 2016 compared to 275 kg in 2015 which corresponds to over
    06 kg per employee
   do not use at the moment recycled paper or any other recycled materials




                we reduced our total office paper consumption
                                  by 106


                 we increased the quantity of total office paper
                               recycled by 123

d implementing responsible special waste management
hazardous waste we recognize the substantial or potential threats that hazardous waste may pose to
public health or the environment and we consider its management as a highly important issue as a
result we implement recycling programs for the following types of waste
  lead batteries which are installed in many bts and are activated in case of electricity supply
     interruptions batteries are replaced when their life span has expired as lead is a hazardous
     material for the environment
  oillubricants which are used in generators located in bts and partially in office buildings we
     cooperate with a licensed company to collect and forward for recycling the entire quantity of the
     rejected lubricants during generator maintenance
  oil and air filters

technical waste the daily operations of all telecommunication companies generate different types of
technical waste these include
  waste electrical and electronic equipment weee such as endoflife electronics and electrical
    devices which are forwarded for recycling
  accumulators which are used as energy storage devices before forwarding them to recycle we
    test them to determine their operational status during their storage in our warehouse upon de
    commissioning
  mobile phones batteries and accessories for which we introduced a new recycling program in
    2014 with collection points in company offices in lapraka and kashar as well as in own shops for
    all employees and customers it must be noted that telekom albania is the only company in albania
    with a recycling program for mobile phones batteries and accessories

4 electromagnetic fields
a following the precautionary principle
the potential effect of electromagnetic fields emf on the human health has been the subject of
extensive international research studies telekom albania complies with the limits set by the
international commission on nonionizing radiation protection icnirp and recommended by the
world health organization who for transmitter antennas and mobile phones which have been
included with the relevant legislative framework these organizations utilize the current scientific
knowledge to repeatedly review the current limits and have confirmed the safe use of mobile
technology as the general scientific consensus is that there are no health risks associated with exposure
to electromagnetic fields emitted by antennas and mobile phones below international standards



      policy electromagnetic fields
indicating our commitment to address the genuine public interest in the mobile communication
technology we have developed the respective emf policy through which we
    establish internal responsibilities and flows of activities to handle any complaints and enquiries on
     technology health and other related issues
    support the establishment of a national database on locations with emf emissions
    comply with the national safe exposure guidelines and the icnirps guidelines regarding emf for all
     our bts and provide all the necessary data to indicate our compliance to any interested party
    cooperate with our stakeholders in order to inform the general public and encourage local
     authorities to cooperate with mobile operators in relevant programs
    provide the manufacturers information on sar values for their mobile devices to our customers
     through our website and shops
    cooperate with local authorities to handle enquiries from citizens related to network development
    fully support improvement of scientific knowledge regarding any emf impacts to the public health
    continuously evaluate scientific data ourselves


it must be noted that we conduct scheduled and adhoc emf radiation measurements by specialized
employees during 2016 we conducted 4 emf measurements all of which were scheduled while no
cases of radiation levels exceeding the national and internationally recognized limits were found

b informing fellow citizens on emf
we continuously try to identify ways in which citizens can be informed regarding how mobile telephony
functions in order to ensure that everyone can have access to credible and accurate information for
this reason we publish detailed information on our corporate website for all citizens

during 2016 we continued our information campaign to correctly inform and improve the perception of
our stakeholders regarding mobile telephony technology and its relation to health within this context
we provide documented materials on our website to correct information regarding mobile telephony to
citizens and customers furthermore we
  trade only mobile phones that comply with the defined sar exposure limits
  display the sar value of every mobile phone sold in telekom albania shops in its respective price
      tag
  provide information to reduce sar exposure in the corporate website

furthermore during 20112014 the company supported a project of the polytechnic university of
tirana faculty of it to measure and publish the electromagnetic emissions in critical spots located
within high density populated areas such as hospitals and schools within this context measurements
were performed in over 80 locations close to companys bts in the main cities of albania which
indicated that emissions for all companys bts are significantly lower than the icnirp limits

corporate responsibility report 2016                                                             114




 did you know specific absorption rate
mobile telephony functions are based on the emission of electromagnetic waves every mobile phone
emits radio frequency electromagnetic energy which can be measured through the specific absorption
rate sar in watts per kilogram of body weight wkg the sar value of a mobile phone indicates the
maximum degree to which the head may absorb electromagnetic fields during a phone call with the
device

since 1999 the eu council has set a maximum limit of 2 wkg for cell and smart phones which applies
to all european countries all manufacturers are required to check and ensure that they comply with the
limit value even at maximum transmission power for all phones and disclose the maximum values
measured as sar value in their product manuals or user operating guides in order to reduce their
overall exposure persons can keep their mobile device away from the head and body through
     using an earpiece wired or bluetooth
     using the loudspeaker function including video calls
     placing the device on a surface when sending data
     texting instead of calling



5 other impacts
telekom albanias environmental strategy includes monitoring of its performance related to a wide
range of relevant aspects in order to implement respective programs

a assessing our visual impact
despite telecommunications having a relatively small visual impact on the environment compared to
other industries and sectors we apply a number of practices such as
  we build new bts with smaller size compared to the old construction design
  we locate bts in installations in cooperation with the other mobile telephony companies within
    2016 we increased the number of bts shared with another operator to 123 compared to 119 in
    2015
  we perform the necessary modifications to the existing telecommunication infrastructure


b assessing our noise impact
the noise impact of telekom albania is insignificant since
  our buildings are located within urban areas
  we use generators in buildings only in cases of electricity failure
  bts powered by electricity have very low noise levels and bts using generators are located in
    remote areas
  in urban areas we use closed type power generator systems with noise levels of 64db at 7m
    distance while we use open type power generator systems in rural areas with noise levels of
    105db at 7m distance which comply with the respective legislative provisions
  in cases where sound levels from generators should be reduced we install noise isolation or hybrid
    systems in order to reduce their operating time and reduce or eliminate the noise within 2016
    we activated hybrid operation of power supply unit psu systems to 10 bts increasing their
    number to 12 stations

c assessing our impact on biodiversity
the influence of our activities on biodiversity is insignificant however we take this important
environmental issue into consideration as our company

corporate responsibility report 2016                                                                 115

   has not placed any of its facilities and operation sites near protected natura or ramsar areas or
    near other areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas as a result there are no iucn
    red list species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations
   builds bts with the least possible repercussions on environment
   conducts environmental impact studies for bts in order to identify the potential impacts of bts
    construction on the natural environment
   ensures that bts located outside populated areas have small surface requirements and the land is
    reverted to its previous condition prior to bts installation or the installation is left for the owners
    use upon request after the bts has been decommissioned
   do not generally staff its bts on a permanent basis and ensures limited transportation activities to
    these sites
   restores potential negative repercussion which our offices and bts might have on the ecosystems

it should be mentioned that according to law no 89902312003 for environmental assessment an
environmental impact study approved by state authorities has to retroactively accompany every mobile
telephony bts antennas in albania our company complies with the respective provisions and all of its
bts are licensed by the relevant authorities as authorized by the national ministry of environment

d monitoring water consumption
we consume water solely for our employees hygiene watering of plants and cleaning of work areas
water scarcity is highlighted as an extremely important environmental aspect due to intensification of
needs and demand for this precious resource during the last years our company is aware of its relative
scarcity and therefore strives to reduce water consumption where feasible
  water supply is performed exclusively from public water suppliers who are also responsible for the
     sustainable withdrawal from the water resource system therefore we do not affect other water
     sources
  bottles of drinking water are available for all employees and
     guests
  we implemented an internal awareness campaign to reduce
     water consumption which was communicated to all employees
     within 2016
  all wastewater is directed to urban wastewater treatment plants
     through the sewerage system and is treated in the municipality
     wastewater facilities
  at the moment we do not recycle or reuse water for our
     operations
  no water leakages were noticed nor are other water sources
     affected due to operations
  there were no planned or unplanned water discharges and no
     significant spills of chemicals or fuels or any other material

corporate responsibility report 2016                                                                116




             water consumption refers to the companys main buildings in lapraka and kashar



e monitoring our impact on the ozone layer
we use refrigerants in our premises shops and bts in the fire suppression system which utilizes fm
200 a fire suppression agent from carbon fluorine and hydrogen  cf3chfcf3 fire extinguishers which
utilize co2 and the airconditioning systems during 2016 the total quantity of fm 200 stored in all
three telekom albania buildings and telekom sites reached 11756 kg while there were no fire incidents
in our premises and our bts

f promoting environmental awareness
employee awareness we recognize the importance of employee awareness about the environment
and therefore strive to adopt environmentally responsible behaviour within the workplace to achieve
this we implement internal awareness campaigns to reduce water and energy consumption as well to
promote the importance of recycling at the same time we have placed recycling bins in our offices and
own shops so that paper and plastic may be collected separately

furthermore telekom albania started a project to redesign and upgrade the komuna e parisit park in
tirana which is a multigenerational recreation amenity in one of tiranas most crowded
neighborhoods within this context we planted over 1000 trees landscaped the parks green areas and
installed new benches

public awareness besides our standing objective to reduce our own environmental footprint we also
aim to increase our customers awareness to reduce their own environmental footprint therefore we
inform sensitize and encourage participation of the general public through systematic initiatives within
this context we rolled out the green tirana 4week project for students 15 to 18 years old in
cooperation with the nonprofit organization aiesec in order to instill a culture of environmental
protection and recycling approximately 100 high school students in tirana participated in the project
and learned about environmental problems their causes and effects as well as solutions to mitigate
their impact
