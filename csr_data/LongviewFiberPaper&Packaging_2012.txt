10  longview fibre paper and packaging inc sustainability report

working safely each day
for our families
imagine if 1100 people drove round trip from portland ore to boston nine times
and arrived safely no accidents occurred and no mistake was made that caused an
injury thats what it was like when our mill reached one million safe hours worked in
february from sept 1 2011 to feb 10 2012 mill employees in longview wash
went home safely to their families each day
part of what makes this milestone significant is our operations size our mill is the
largest pulp and paper mill in the western region of the united states in terms of total
capacity the mill can produce more than one million tons of paper per year which is
more than can be produced at any other paper facility in seven us western states
two locations within our container plant network have also set site records recently
cedar city utah reached six years without a recordable injury and our box plant in
longview wash achieved more than 900 safe days as of first quarter 2012
its all about continuous improvement in 2006 our incident rate was 86 weve
made major strides each year and finished 2011 with a 157 incident rate ir this
improvement includes a 27 percent reduction in just one year 2011 more employees
are going home safely every day to their families
in fact 2011 was the first year when all operating units performed below their industry
sector ir average we have crossed over from the past belowaverage performance to
firstquartile ir performance when compared to peers in both mill and container plant
sectors to keep driving improvements we are focusing on leading indicators as the
number of incidents decrease we are looking more at contributing factors such as the
identification of hazards and behaviors that are precursors to incidents                       one million safe hours
in the end there are 1754 reasons to keep improving safety at longview  each of              worked at the mill

did you know
do you know the positive story about forestry
in the united states

wood is a renewable resource


about onethird of the united states is forested and our total
forest area of 751 million acres has been stable for about
100 years


annual net us forest growth surpasses harvest by as much
as 72 percent


the us has three times the amount of reserved forest land
that we had in 1953


a single tree can absorb more than 10 pounds of co2 each year                      193 million acres
                                                                                    of trees sfi
in the us forests and forest products store enough carbon
each year to offset approximately 10 percent of the nations                        certified in
co2 emissions                                                                      north america

according to the washington forest protection association and
the department of natural resources washington state is a net
producer of carbon sequestration

making better use
of our raw material
are we getting the most that we can from the resources we are using how can we
change our processes to better optimize resources these are questions frequently
asked at our longview wash mill site and across our container plants
fiber from wood is the key ingredient needed for making our products we use fiber
that comes from sources certified by the sustainable forestry initiative our fiber
supply comes primarily from sawmill waste and chips from logs unsuitable for
sawmill use
at longview we also use recycled fiber including corrugated material left over from
our own box plants in 2011 the recycled fiber used was 34 percent of our total fiber    making more
consumed
                                                                                          paper from the
our operations are becoming more sustainable by using fiber more efficiently some of
the ways we have been making better use of raw materials include                         same amount of
                                                                                          resources
   we are striving to improve our yield by making more paper out of the same
    amount of raw material primarily fiber
   we are working to decrease the amount of fiber we lose during the papermaking
    process at the mill we have reduced fiber loss by 33 percent since 2008 as of
    first quarter 2012
   by increasing yield and reducing fiber loss this means we are making more
    saleable paper from the same amount of resources
   through better processes we have reduced our material waste on the paper
    machines by approximately onethird since 2006 when compared to yearend
    2011 this results in a higher level of prime paper production while using the
    same amount of energy


its all about getting more from our resources to produce quality paper containerboard
and corrugated boxes for our customers  resources such as fiber energy and water

energy                         reducing energy consumption
                               making good use of our resources also means using energy more efficiently our mill
                               site is now in the top quartile of energy efficient mills which is a dramatic improvement
                               since 2007 we have reduced mill energy use by more than 20 percent since 2007
                               for example in 2003 to make less paper than we do now we burned 25000 tons of
                               wood waste per month now we are burning about 16000 tons of wood waste per
                               month which represents a more than 30 percent reduction we have also reduced
                               fossil fuel use by 72 percent from 2001 to 2011
        reduced mill
                               from an economic perspective we reduced energy costs at the mill in 2011 by more
       energy use by           than 7 percent when compared to 2010 levels

        more than 20
percent since 2007

decreasing water use while
increasing production rates
we have also reduced the amount of water used at the mill as you can see in
the chart below we have reduced the gallons of water used per pound of paper
production by 50 percent over the past 10 years this decrease has occurred due
to production process improvements since 2004 we have reduced the number of
paper machines that run while increasing the tons of prime paper produced overall      reduced gallons
the volume of water we use has decreased by 37 percent since 2004 even without
factoring in production increases                                                        of water used per
while we draw large amounts of water from the columbia river we recycle and reuse        pound of paper
much of that water before we clean treat and return it to the source by improving our
processes we have reduced the overall volume of water used                              production by 50

                               causes primarily through a grassroots approach here are just a few examples
