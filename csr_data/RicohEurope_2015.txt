    to our stakeholders




             since its establishment in 1936 ricoh has constantly pursued the creation of new value through

             stantly changing we have resolutely embraced change to foster new innovations all the time
             while charting corporate growth


                in recent years the pace of change has accelerated fueled by greater informatization and
             networks around the world as well as evolving customer value perceptions and diversifying life
             styles in addition society has a mountain of issues to address on a global scale from environmental
             concerns to poverty human rights and natural resource and energy consumption
                the ricoh group has a mission to provide excellence in its efforts to improve the quality of life
             for all and to drive sustainability and going forward the overriding objective will be to anticipate
             customers changing needs and create new value linked to approaches that mitigate issues that
             impact society this is how we will achieve further growth


                the three years of the current midterm management plan have been set as a time to ensure
             longterm growth of the group the plan is founded on two basic strategiesto reinforce
             and develop earnings power for core businesses and to achieve growth by creating new profit
             generatorsand the ricoh group is actively implementing measures for these strategies in fiscal
             2015 the first year under this midterm management plan we were able to secure a larger global
             share of the multifunction printer mfp market and reinforce the revenue base in our core office
             business domain meanwhile in the production printing business we were able to acquire a
             firmer footing for fullscale development of business in the commercial printing domain in
             addition in the industrial business domain as a business pillar for the future we established a
             structure to underpin swift decision making and promote effective management infrastructure
             matched to business pursuits and began to accelerate the expansion of associated activities also
             in areas where the ricoh group has not yet made business inroads efforts yielded the buds of
             new businesses


                in 2016 ricoh will celebrate its 80th year in business we are leveraging the collective talents
             of our people in keeping with our corporate tagline of imagine change we will look into the
             future to the tomorrows of our customers the human race and the environment and we will
             strive to improve corporate value by constantly creating new value that serves a real purpose in
             the world and by meeting the expectations of all stakeholders includingbut certainly not limited

    keen to create value in priority sectors
    within the ricoh group we are reinforcing efforts to provide products and solutions specifically for
    certain business sectors such as healthcare education finance and manufacturing a prime example
    in the healthcare sector is support for a smooth workstyle at medical facilities to improve patient satis
    faction while also reducing the administrative workload on staff and preventing medical errors our
    responses include automating the separation of specialized documents such as prescriptions indexing
    photographic images of an injury or condition in the patients electronic medical records preventing
    medical errors in drugdispensing procedures with a printer capable of sorted output and providing
    support for community healthcare coordination using videoconferencing  web 5

    the kitasato university hospital case study

    looking ahead to 2025 and a superaged society
    where one in four people in japan will be over the
    age of 75 the total support center at kitasato
    university hospital took the lead in establishing
    the sagamihara machida area nursing and
    medical care zone infrastructure building
    consortium this consortium involves 107 office
    sites including hospitals pharmacies regional
    comprehensive support centers and athome care

    fields not only doctors and nurses but also phar
    macists social welfare counselors care managers
    and nursing care providers share patientspecific
    information to ensure proper care each work
    environment can be hectic so the consortium
    opted for videoconferencing which is more effec
    tive in promoting communication than trying to
    gather individuals together for a meeting in a
    single location the ricoh group is contributing
    to enhanced communication practices by creating
    the required network we set up the compact

    participants to initiate remote meetings and train

    ing sessions anytime anywhere ricoh ucs
    closes the distance between places that typically
    prevent facetoface contact and lets the people
    involved in the discussion see each other even
    medical services and nursing care providers on
    roundtheclock schedules can dash over to a
