customers as well as to promote sustainability in society with optimally targeted investments we can achieve production cost
savings and develop our business operations in those areas where we perceive growth opportunities at the same time we
safeguard jobs

for example

  by investing in a mobile fleet we can improve the efficiency of fleet utilisation and save in transportation
  by ensuring that our mineral aggregate quarrying sites are in reasonable locations enabling longterm use we can better
  take into account the requirements of the surroundings and shorten transportation distances
  by investing in the recycling of materials we save the environment and material costs

sustainability  environmental responsibility



we improve our energy efficiency and save the environment
we minimise the environmental impact of our operations use natural resources sparingly
generate as little waste as possible and sort it appropriately
by recycling raw materials we reduce both the amount of                                   in addition we produced a significant amount of low
waste and the need for virgin materials in the production of                              temperature asphalt lowtemperature asphalt is produced
the products and services we offer to our customers we                                    at a substantially lower temperature than normal asphalt and
strive for the highest possible energy and material efficiency                            thus reduces fuel consumption emissions and odour
                                                                                           pollution gas emissions generated by energy consumption in
our most energyconsuming operations are asphalt                                           production are halved when the temperature is brought down
production and construction sites in 2015 we started using                               by 15 degrees celsius
a certified energy efficiency monitoring system in finland to
comply with the energy efficiency law we have taken                                       we have a paving laboratory in each of our operating
measures required by the energy efficiency legislation in our                              countries in finland our laboratories in tuusula and in oulu
other operating countries too                                                             are the only officially accredited asphalt industry laboratories

in 2016 our target is to develop the monitoring and reporting                             ecological earthworks
of energy consumption in all of our operating countries our                               as a major northern european construction group we use
longterm goal is to expand the energy efficiency monitoring                               large volumes of different mineral aggregates as raw
system to all operating countries and improve energy                                       material for this reason we have approximately 300 mineral
efficiency by unifying our operation models                                               aggregate areas around our operating countries
our mineral aggregates and paving operations require                                       we aim to reduce the environmental impact of quarrying by
permits in 2015 our operations in all operating countries                                investing in large longterm mineral aggregate quarrying
were granted 21 new mineral aggregates permits 19                                         sites near urban growth centres this makes transportation
environmental permits and 24 registrations of asphalt                                      distances shorter and allows us to make investments that
plants                                                                                    reduce the impact that the sites have on their immediate
countryspecific laws and requirements define those projects                               surroundings these investments include noise and
that require a separate environmental impact assessment                                    protection barriers and stable and impermeable support
eia we launched one eia project during the reporting year                              areas we also ensure that areas that have been used for
                                                                                           mineral aggregate quarrying can be turned into construction
we made environmental investments of approximately eur                                     areas if needed mineral aggregate quarrying sites may be
750000 investments were mainly associated with                                           zoned for residential or recreational use in which case the
equipment and machinery purchases for the production of                                    quarrying needed for construction has already been carried
recycled asphalt and lowtemperature asphalt for example                                 out as part of mineral aggregate operations

we develop environmentally friendly paving                                                 utilising byproducts
most of our environmental footprint comes from our own                                     our goal is to constantly develop the recycling of raw
production especially our paving and mineral aggregates                                   materials and to utilise waste generated as a byproduct of

 includes the effect of discontinued operations

the company has recorded the deferred tax assets from tax losses to the amount it considers based on its profit forecasts to
be utilisable in the future the amount of tax losses has increased especially due to nonrecurring items which are not expected
to reoccur in the future a large part of the tax losses in finland arise from the damages that the district court ordered in 2013
related to the asphalt cartel at the end of 2015 tax losses in the groups finnish companies totalled eur 194 million 231
and they can be carried forward for 10 years the amount of tax losses in the groups norwegian companies stood at eur 115
million 121 at the end of 2015 and they can be carried forward indefinitely the amount of the companys tax losses from
which deferred tax asset has not been recorded is not material

no deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of the undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries because the funds are
permanently invested in operations abroad

goodwill impairment tests

goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indications of possible impairment the tests are carried out
as valueinuse calculations of individual businesses in accordance with the smallest cashgenerating unit principle in
impairment testing the discounted present value of the recoverable cash flows of each cashgenerating unit is compared with
the carrying amount of the unit in question if the present value is lower than the carrying amount the difference is recognised
through profit or loss as an expense in the current year

the goodwill impairment tests carried out during the fourth quarter of 2015 showed that the present values of the future cash
flows exceed the carrying amounts in all segments

forecasts and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing

cash generating units cash flow forecasts are prepared for a four year planning period based on management estimates based
on actual past performance main assumptions used in the preparation of the cash flow forecasts are the growth of the market
in question the companys profitability development as well as measures which the company has committed to

main assumptions in the goodwill impairment testing are long term growth and discount rate cash flow forecasts beyond the
four year planning period are based on the assumption of 1 percent annual growth which was lower than european central
banks target inflation rate over medium term in effect at the time of the impairment testing weighted average cost of capital
wacc calculated for each individual unit is used as the discount factor wacc takes into account riskfree interest rate
illiquidity premium expected market rate of return the industrys beta value country risk and debt interest rate including
interest rate margin calculated for each unit when determining the debt interest rate level in 2015 the company took into
account the following segmentspecific interest rate levels interest rate levels for project loans in building construction in
finland as well as interest rate levels for finance lease liabilities related to paving and infra projects business operations the
components of discount factor are weighted according to average target capital structure of the sector pretax wacc is
determined separately for each tested unit in the calculation of the segmentspecific discount rates in 2015 the company
used countryspecific discount rates that were weighted with countryspecific operating capital

sensitivity analysis

in connection with the impairment tests sensitivity analyses are made to determine how possible changes in key assumptions
of the unitspecific impairment tests would affect the results of those tests the key assumptions affecting the present value
of cash flows are the development of market and competitive conditions and the discount factor in the sensitivity analyses the
calculation variables affecting these assumptions are varied and the effects of the changes on the margin between the carrying
value and present value of the cash flows are examined

sensitivity analysis prepared in 2015 shows that reasonable and ordinary variation to key assumptions used in the testing would
not cause a need for impairment in paving infra projects nor russian operations segments the most significant risk for
impairment of goodwill arises from the building construction finland operating segment where the units recoverable cash
flow exceeds the units carrying amount by eur 371 million

instruments within level 1 of the hierarchy are traded in active markets hence prices are obtained directly from the efficient
markets fair values of instruments within level 2 are based on observable market inputs and generally accepted valuation
methods fair values within level 3 are not based on observable market data but on quotations provided by brokers and market
valuation reports

foreign exchange rate risk
the aim of foreign exchange rate risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the possible impacts that changes in
exchange rates could have on the future values of cash flows business receivables and liabilities and other items in the
statement of financial position exchange rate risk mainly consists of translation risk and transaction risk

translation risk consists of foreign exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the income statements and the
statement of financial position of foreign group companies into the groups functional currency translation risk recorded in
accounting is caused by equity investments in foreign entities and their retained earnings the effects of which are recorded
under translation differences in shareholders equity lemmink채inen group has foreign net investments in several currencies
the key currencies in which the group was exposed to translation risk in 2015 were the russian rouble and the norwegian
krone the change in translation differences in 2015 was eur 42 million 186 of which eur 25 million 158 was
attributable to the russian rouble and eur 16 million 27 to the norwegian krone reportable translation risk is also caused
by the reporting periods income statement the impact of which can be seen among others directly in the groups reportable
net sales and operating profit in euros in 2015 the impact of exchange rate changes 2015 actuals compared to 2015 actuals
recalculated with 2014 foreign exchange rates on the groups net sales was eur 672 million 732 of which eur 456
million 400 was attributable to the russian rouble and eur 171 million 197 to the norwegian krone and their impact
on the operating profit was eur 05 million 50 of which eur 10 million 43 was attributable to the russian rouble
and eur 03 million 06 to the norwegian krone in accordance with the treasury policy lemmink채inen group protects itself
from translation risks primarily by keeping equity investments in foreign entities at an appropriately low level and thus does not
use financial instruments to hedge the translation risks

transaction risk consists of cash flows in foreign currencies from operational and financial activities the group seeks to hedge
business currency risks primarily by operative means the remaining transaction risk is hedged by using instruments such as
foreign currency loans and foreign currency derivatives the group companies are responsible for identifying reporting
forecasting and hedging their transaction risk positions internally the group treasury is responsible for hedging the groups risk
positions as external transactions in accordance with the treasury policy the transaction risk positions of the group were
mainly due to sales and purchases within the next 12 months and receivables and liabilities in the statement of financial
position

the key currency pairs in which the group was exposed to transaction risk in 2015 and 2014 were eurrub and eursek in
2015 the group did not apply hedge accounting to transaction risk hedging

sensitivity analysis of transaction risk
the following assumptions have been made when calculating the sensitivity caused by changes in exchange rates

     the exchange rate change is assumed to be  10
     the position includes both external and intragroup financial assets and liabilities denominated in swedish kronas and
     russian roubles and derivatives hedging these items
     the position does not include forecasted future cash flows
     taxes are excluded in sensitivity analysis

the aim of lemmink채inen groups interest rate risk management is to minimise changes affecting the result cash flows and
value of the group due to interest rate fluctuations the group treasury manages and monitors the interest rate position the
groups interest rate risk primarily comprises fixedrate and variablerate borrowings interestbearing financial assets and
interest rate derivatives interest rate changes have an effect on items in the income statement and consolidated statement of
financial position

the interest rate risk is managed by aligning the groups average period of interest fixing term with the interest rate sensitivity of
the business the interest rate sensitivity position of the groups business is estimated to be about 15 months in accordance
with treasury policy average interest rate fixing term and fixedfloating ratio of the debt protfolio is being followed

the group can have both variable and fixedrate longterm borrowings the ratio of fixed and variablerate borrowings can be
changed by using interest rate derivatives the group has used interest rate swaps for managing interest rate risks during 2014
a part of the interest rate swaps were used for hedge accounting and a hedging result of those derivatives have been recognised
in interest expenses in 2014 there was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedge accounting during the financial year
2014 hedging instruments assigned to hedge accounting have matured in 2014 and hedge accounting was terminated during
that reporting period

interest rate fluctuations in 2015 did not have any unusual effect on the groups business but a significant rise in the level of
interest rates may have a detrimental effect on the demand for housing

sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk
the following assumptions are made when calculating the sensitivity caused by a change in the level of interest rates

      the interest rate change is assumed to be 1 percentage point
      interest rate changes have been calculated for a 12 month period
      the position includes variablerate financial liabilities variablerate financial assets including cash and cash
      equivalents and interest rate derivatives
      market interest rate is assumed to be positive at the start of the year for all other instruments except for interest rate
      derivatives
      all factors other than the change in interest rates remain constant
      taxes have not been taken into account when calculating sensitivity

commodity price risk
the groups paving operations are exposed to bitumen price risk the price of bitumen is mainly determined by the world market
price of oil the group protects itself against the bitumen price risk with price clauses in sales agreements fixed purchase
prices and derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied group treasury regurarly follows the bitumen position of the
group

credit risk
credit risks arise when a counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligations casusing the other party to suffer a financial
loss lemmink채inen has defined a credit policy for customer receivables that aims to boost profitable sales by identifying credit
risks in advance and controlling them the credit policy sets the minimum requirements concerning trade credit and collections
for lemmink채inen group the groups credit control function defines credit risks and the business units are responsible for
managing them

most of the groups business is based on established and trustworthy customer relationships and on contractual terms
generally observed in the industry the group is exposed to credit risk mainly through the groups trade receivables and
receivables associated with deposits and receivables the maximum amount of credit risk is the combined total values of the
aforementioned items as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position the amounts and due dates of the
groups trade receivables are presented in the table below the group does not have any significant credit risk concentrations as
trade receivables are distributed among many different customers in a number of market areas the business unit that made the
contract actively monitors the receivables situation if the business units renegotiate the terms of the receivables they must do
so in accordance with the requirements of the groups credit policy the risk of credit losses can be reduced by means of
guarantees mainly bank guarantees and bank deposits in addition lemmink채inen uses factoring arrangements which also
mitigates the credit risk lemmink채inens credit losses have been minimal in relation to the scale of its operations the main
risks are associated with business in russia as a general rule construction projects in russia are only undertaken against
receipt of advance payments if in exceptional situations a credit risk is taken the amount permitted is always proportional to
the expected margin on the project in question receiveables transferred for legally enforceable collection are recognised as
credit losses

the group is exposed to counterparty risk when investing liquid assets and using derivative instruments liquid assets are
invested in shortterm bank deposits certificates of deposit issued by solvent partner banks and commercial papers issued by
corporations with a good credit rating the group treasury is responsible for the management of the groups counterparty and
credit risks related to cash financial investments and financial transactions the treasury policy specifies the approved
counterparties and their criteria at the end of 2015 the counterparty risk was considered to be low
