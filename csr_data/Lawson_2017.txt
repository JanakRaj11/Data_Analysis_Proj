next we would like you to describe the midterm management
vision and your business plan for ﬁscal 2017
we developed the midterm management                stores is important of course but even should       we consequently expect our convenience store        investments in such advances as introduction
vision in april 2017 to serve as a benchmark        the size of the chain as a whole expand we           operations to see an increase in consolidated       of nextgeneration systems entry into new
for measuring lawsons future operations           would have no future if the individual stores         operating profit of approximately 6 billion yen    businesses and conversion from other chains
this benchmark anticipates management               did not meet customers expectations this            with loss reduction in our overseas operations      will certainly be essential if we are to achieve
objectives through fiscal 2021 three years         600000yen target which represents an               taken into account we project an overall           mid to longterm growth although our short
beyond the 1000day action plan the               increase in daily sales of nearly 10 will be far    decrease in profit however due largely to         term business results for fiscal 2017 and 2018
vision clearly states our aim of achieving          from easy to achieve but we must achieve it          the following and other investments targeting       will most likely be extremely austere due to
average daily sales per store of 600000 yen        at all costs if we are to compete successfully        future growth investments in nextgeneration       such expenditures for investment in future
by lawson stores in japan increasing               with our major competitors i believe we              systems anticipatory costs assumed in the          growth however we have decided that now
the number of stores to 18000 and earning          can do this only by uniting the capabilities of       financial services business leading to losses       is the time for investments we cannot avoid
