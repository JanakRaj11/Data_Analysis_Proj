foreword by the executive board
 in 2013 the energy world again saw a number of signiﬁcant changes in the netherlands a
 widely supported energy agreement was reached last year and the earthquakes in the north
 of the country as a result of gas production received a good deal of attention meanwhile
 in germany the energy transition energiewende resulted in a new record in 2013 in terms
 of sustainable energy generated in that country so far in addition in many european
 countries the production of shale gas was hotly debated the pace of change is rapid but
 what remains is the demand for a reliable sustainable and affordable supply of energy
 we are convinced that gas and gas infrastructure can continue to play an important and
 connecting role in the provision of energy of the future


 gasunies position in europe
 the gas market is an international one thanks to our extensive network in the netherlands
 and germany as well as our connection to the market for liqueﬁed natural gas lng through
 the gate terminal gas can ﬁnd its way from all parts of the world to northwest europe
 building on our strong position in crossborder gas infrastructure we play an important
 part in the current european energy supply and we aim to continue to play this role in
 enabling the transition towards a sustainable reliable and affordable energy future for the
 netherlands and for europe as a whole


 new sustainable applications of gas
 in 2013 a number of important steps were taken in using gas to achieve a cleaner and more
 sustainable supply of energy gas in the form of lng is ideally suited for instance as a
 cleaner alternative to diesel fuel for heavy goods vehicles and ships next to gate terminal on
 the maasvlakte we recently opened with our partner vopak a facility for ﬁlling lng road
 tankers and loading and unloading small lng vessels there are plans to expand the facilities
 for smallscale lng distribution in the form of a breakbulk installation


 we also continued to see growth in the large and smallscale generation of sustainable
 energy the development of powertogas could create an important new link between
 the electricity and gas networks thanks to the unique storage possibilities offered by gas
 infrastructure any excess of sustainably generated energy can be collected and stored in the
 form of hydrogen gas


 the importance of our infrastructure for society
 in its policy on government participations published in october 2013 the dutch government
 indicated that it attached great value to securing the public interests represented by the
 states participation gasunie manages essential infrastructure and the public must be able
 to count on the transport of gas being safe reliable and affordable our transport rates are
 among the lowest in europe and the high liquidity of our gas trading platform ttf has a
 favourable effect on price developments and on the security of supply

    trustworthy international hub
    the importance of having a wellfunctioning gas infrastructure for a reliable energy supply
    was again underscored in early 2013 the long winter in northwest europe led to a great
    demand for natural gas our network functioned as an international hub and in this way
    was able to continue to supply the netherlands surrounding countries with gas the volume
    of gas transported through the netherlands to other countries was 13 more than the
    previous year  an alltime record for us


    our results
    our net result for 2013 was  464 million 2012  359 million and with a dividend payment of
     325 million 2012  215 million we were able to make a substantial ﬁnancial contribution
    to the dutch treasury the dividend payment for this year has been increased to 70 of
    the result after taxes due to the oneoff release of part of a pension provision in 2013 our
    revenues increased partly due to a number of new network facilities becoming operational
    such as the nitrogen buffer at heiligerlee in addition the results also beneﬁted from our
    continued focus on lowering operating costs and increasing efﬁciency


    in 2013 we met and in fact exceeded our targets relating to security of supply however we
    failed to meet certain targets relating to safety we deeply regret that in november 2013
    a fatal accident occurred involving one of our contractors during the laying of a pipeline
    we have taken measures to improve our safety performance and restore it to the desired
    level safety  both for employees and for the communities in which we work  remains our
    highest priority


    earthquakes
    there is currently considerable commotion in the dutch energy world earthquakes resulting
    from gas production in the north of the country have led to a clash between economic and
    social interests we believe that the government needs to pay serious attention to the
    safety and rights of the inhabitants affected and to compensate them for damage caused
    in particular the government should reduce the chances of any recurrence minimise the
    consequences of any recurrence and strengthen the economic power of the region the
    minister of economic affairs has already taken a number of steps key aspects are security of
    supply and public conﬁdence in gas production


    a national energy agreement in the netherlands
    in 2013 the national energy agreement for sustainable growth came into being under the
    auspices of the social economic council in reaching this agreement the government
    employers and trade unions environmental organisations and other social groups jointly
    took an important step the agreement which enjoys wide support focuses on renewable
    energy sources such as wind and solar power mapping out a steady course towards a
    sustainable energy future gasunie is convinced that gas will continue to play a part in the
    energy mix of the future with gas as the cleanest fossil fuel combining ﬂexibly with energy
    from sustainable sources we can make the transition to a renewable supply of energy
    reliable and affordable this will require close cooperation between the operators of gas and
    electricity networks and supply chain partners at both eu and regional level we will be
    doing our best to bring this about in the coming years

                                                                                                               7


connecting through cooperation
as a member of netbeheer nederland we have helped to draw up the dutch renewable
energy action plan 2030 the main objectives for the energy network of the future are added
value better usage and smart expansion in this way the energy system can be adjusted to
meet future requirements relating to ﬂexibility and large quantities of renewable energy
while reliability and safety remain guaranteed


we are also participating in international efforts to establish a sustainable energy supply
working together with network operators in france belgium denmark and sweden for
example we have launched an initiative to make the provision of gas co2neutral by 2050 in
this we focus on reducing emissions and further developing powertogas breakbulk lng
and green gas
we will also be increasing our efforts within the company to facilitate the energy transition
in early 2014 we set up a special department to coordinate and encourage projects in this
ﬁeld where possible we shall undertake such projects jointly with others


                            society relies on gas and counts on it to be always available over the past 50
                                   years we have worked hard to build up this trust and we will continue
                                            to do so gas plays an important role in a reliable sustainable
                                                                             and affordable energy supply
                                                                                  han fennema ceo gasunie



our organisation
in 2013 there were a number of changes in the membership of the executive board and
the supervisory board on 23 april 2013 we took leave of three members of the supervisory
board and are very grateful to them for all the work they have done for gasunie over the
years on 1 october 2013 we welcomed martika jonk and willem schoeber as members of the
supervisory board

interim ceo on 1 march 2014 geert handed over to the new ceo han fennema and left
the company we are very grateful to both paul and geert for the sizeable contributions they
have made to gasunies success


stakeholders
if we are to achieve our goals it is vital that we maintain a harmonious relationship with
those with whom we live and work we therefore maintain close links with many of our
stakeholders and continuously seek to balance the interests of all as part of that endeavour
we aim to communicate transparently and coherently about what we do this is why for the
ﬁrst time we are issuing our account of gasunies activities over the past year in a single
integrated report


we wish to express our appreciation and gratitude to our employees for their commitment
over the past year our plans for 2014 and the years thereafter are ambitious but thanks
to the tireless efforts and professional qualities of our employees we are in an excellent
position to realise them

business model
 the three business units have different business models the business models of gts and
 gasunie deutschland are largely similar the activities of gts and gasunie deutschland are
 both regulated in contrast to those of participations  business development which are
 not or only partially regulated


 the core activity of gts and gasunie deutschland is the transport of gas in the netherlands
 and north germany respectively both companies are fully independent transmission
 system operators tsos their income and returns are regulated by national regulatory
 authorities the dutch authority for consumers and markets acm in the netherlands and
 the bundesnetzagentur bnetza in germany


 a major focal point for our future is facilitating stimulating and developing the transition
 towards a sustainable energy system in this we focus on innovations eg in the ﬁeld of
 green gas and powertogas and new productmarket combinations for natural gas eg
 utilising lng in the maritime and transport sector these new activities should generate
 extra income and contribute to making optimal use of our existing gas infrastructure
 activities these activities are being developed by the business unit participations 
 business development


 our revenues are almost entirely generated from activities relating to the gas infrastructure


 gtss business model
 in its service provision gts focuses on selling the available capacity in a reliable network
 with competitive conditions customers enter into contracts which allow them to book
 capacity at certain entry or exit points in the network for a certain period year month or
 day customers can feed gas into the network at entry points and they can retrieve gas
 from the network at exit points for all services customers pay an allin tariff for the capacity
 booked this capacity tariff entitles customers to feed gas into and retrieve gas from the
 relevant network point for the period that has been agreed there is no tariff for actual usage
 of the network point customers can trade gas amongst themselves at a virtual market place
 called title transfer facility ttf a liquid and competitive capacity market is important to
 gts because it makes the gts infrastructure more attractive to its customers


 the gts network forms part of the european gas network it competes with other networks
 with regard to transport of international gas ﬂows


 costs
 the variable costs that gts makes for using the capacity booked by its customers consist
 mainly of energy costs ie gas and electricity for compressors to transport the gas and
 electricity for producing nitrogen to blend the gas to the right quality these variable costs
 also referred to as uncontrollable costs form part of the allin capacity tariff

     retroactive settlement
     in a year with an unusually cold winter it can happen that gtss revenues do not actually
     increase signiﬁcantly because customers have already booked their winter capacity
     however the actual energy costs of transporting larger volumes of gas in a cold winter do
     increase leading to a lower operating result conversely an unusually mild winter leads to
     lower energy costs


     these energy costs are subject to a system of retroactive settlement with a limited risk for
     gts allowing these uncontrollable ﬂuctuations in the operating result to be corrected in a
     later year in compliance with current ifrs rules in the annual accounts of gts no accounts
     payable or receivable have been included for these settlements with regard to energy costs
     which may be either positive or negative depending on whether the winter is unusually
     mild or extremely cold


     tariﬀs
     the tariffs that gts charges its customers are regulated they are determined according
     to the acm calculation rules as of 2014 a system of income regulation will be applicable
     the tariffs are calculated by dividing the permitted revenues by the estimated capacity
     bookings if the actual revenues deviate from this the difference will be settled in later years
     the permitted revenues are based on costplus regulation gts is allowed to earn back the
     efﬁciently incurred capital costs and operational costs including a return that is in line with
     the market the permitted capital costs are derived from the regulated asset value which is
     also referred to as regulated asset base rab while the permitted operational costs consist
     mainly of costs for planning metering and billing management and maintenance and the
     uncontrollable energy costs mentioned above


     investments and return
     the design and use of the network determine the total available capacity gts is legally
     bound to invest efﬁciently in sufﬁcient transport capacity in order to be able to satisfy
     the total market needs to this end the legal point of departure is that the gas supply
     for smallscale users in the netherlands is guaranteed for a day with an average effective
     temperature over 24 hours as measured at the royal netherlands meteorological institute in
     de bilt of minus 17c


     new investments  if they are deemed to be efﬁcient by acm  are added to the rab and
     contribute to the revenues as of the year after becoming operational


     in 2013 acm laid down for a period of three years 20142016 the method by which gts is to be
     regulated the main parameters deﬁning this method of regulation are
      cpi the tariffs may be indexed annually on the basis of inﬂation in line with the
        consumer price index
      the wacc weighted average cost of capital the allowed return on the regulated asset
        value for the years 20142016 acm has set the real pretax wacc at 36 this is based on
        a 5050 equity to debt ratio a nominal cost base for loans of 385 and a nominal return
        on equity of 56

                                                                                                     13


 the productivity improvement to be realised during the regulation period on the total
   operational and capital costs excluding uncontrollable costs for the years 20142016
   this productivity improvement or frontier shift has been set at 13 per year for the
   current regulation period acm has not conducted an individual efﬁciency benchmark
   survey for gts but it intends to do so in the next regulation period


in practice gts can achieve a higher or lower return compared to the return on efﬁciently
incurred costs determined by acm this depends on the level of the actual costs


gasunie deutschlands business model
the business model of gasunie deutschland is largely identical to that of gts the main
differences between the dutch and the german regulation models are as follows
 the permitted return on capital consists of the real interest costs and a competitive
   return on equity up to a maximum share of 40 of equity in the total capital the
   permitted nominal return on equity for all investments is on average approximately 74
   for the current regulation period from 2013 up to and including 2017
 new investments receive a return on capital from the beginning and immediately
   contribute to revenues
 for each regulation period bnetza carries out an individual efﬁciency benchmark on the
   total costs of a network company for the current regulation period 20132017 gasunie
   deutschland has received an assessment rating of 100 efﬁcient


participations  business developments business model
participations  business developments activities are  like the activities of gts and
gasunie deutschland  capital intensive and relate mainly to gas infrastructure


the main activities have been allocated to separate participations which often cooperate
with external partners these include amongst others the lng terminal in rotterdam
gate the pipeline to england bbl nord stream and the underground gas storage facility
zuidwending


the operating risks and proﬁtability targets of these activities are higher than those of fully
regulated activities because the participations compete in the free market


investments
the construction of new infrastructure does not start until we have signed commercial
sales contracts for a sufﬁciently long period these contracts form the basis for the earning
capacity of the participations we try to further improve the return on these activities by
means of additional contracts


revenue ﬂow
customers buy capacity and thereby also the right to utilise the infrastructure during the
contracted period


for these participations we also apply the openaccess infrastructure policy as an independent
party we provide services to our customers in a nondiscriminatory and transparent way we
construct and operate infrastructure but we do not participate in activities in the ﬁeld of the
upstream supply trade and downstream delivery of gas or lng in this way we can with our
participations facilitate a wellfunctioning gas market and gas trade

14


       the lng terminal in rotterdam gate the pipeline to england bbl and the underground
       gas storage facility zuidwending all have to deal with legal regulatory frameworks and
       regulators for instance we need prior consent for providing services outside the regulatory
       frameworks through our participations usually a term is agreed on during which such an
       exemption from regulation for certain aspects is allowed after this period we will carry
       out part of our services within regulated frameworks european legislation to facilitate a
       wellfunctioning european gas market therefore affects the business model of participations
        business development


       participations  business development is looking for opportunities to develop new
       proﬁtable activities these should be activities that contribute to gasunies strategy of
       supporting the functioning of the gas market and realising the transition towards a
       sustainable energy system



     participations

       we participate usually in cooperation with other parties in a number of projects that
       contribute to the security of supply in the ﬁeld of gas in europe the most important of these
       are mentioned below


       gate
       the increasing need for natural gas combined with declining european production requires
       additional import that is why we participate in gate gas access to europe this terminal
       located on the maasvlakte in rotterdam is the ﬁrst import terminal for liqueﬁed natural
       gas lng in the netherlands at the terminal lng is stored regasiﬁed and pressurised
       for distribution to the dutch gas transport network gate allows quick access to the large
       nearby potential consumer markets for natural gas in northwest europe gasunies interest
       in the terminal is 475


       nord stream
       nord stream is a pipeline through the baltic sea that connects russia with europe it has
       provided the european pipeline network with an extra connection to gas ﬂows from russia
       thus contributing to a stable gas supply in europe our interest in nord stream is 9


       nel
       the nordeuropäische erdgas leitung nel is the connecting pipeline between nord stream
       and our german network it allows gas from russia to ﬂow directly into our network our
       interest in this pipeline is 2513

                                                                                               15


bbl
bbl is a pipeline from balgzand in the netherlands to bacton in the uk the pipeline
contributes to a stable supply of gas in the united kingdom which to a large extent depends
on imported gas for its gas supply gasunie has an interest of 60 in bbl


gasunie zuidwending
this facility for underground gas storage compensates for shortterm ﬂuctuations in
the supply and demand of natural gas the high ﬂexibility of this buffer is important
for balancing the portfolios of the zuidwending customers and the gts network this
gas storage is unique in the netherlands  never before was natural gas stored here in
underground layers of salt we have a 100 interest in gasunie zuidwending

our strategy
strategy

 enabling a safe reliable affordable and sustainable energy supply is central to our strategy
 through the connecting role of our infrastructure we anticipate the energy needs of
 customers and consumers in order to be able to continue to do so we work in an innovative
 and pioneering way in the ﬁeld of energy  and of gas and natural gas in particular


 developments in our environment
 our strategy takes into account the opportunities and challenges of the rapidly changing
 energy market our point of departure here is the role of gas infrastructure in the sustainable
 provision of energy we aim to expand our leading european position and in doing so
 we are always looking for possible collaborations with partners both nationally and
 internationally


 transition towards a more sustainable energy supply
 the developments of internationalisation and decentralisation go hand in hand with the
 increase of energy from renewable sources on the one hand the energy market is becoming
 increasingly international on the other hand the opportunities for decentralised energy
 generation are also expanding in 2013 in the netherlands the government employers and
 trade unions environmental organisations and other social groups signed the dutch energy
 agreement for sustainable growth this agreement focuses on renewable energy sources
 such as wind and solar power we are anticipating this by actively looking for collaboration
 with international and distribution network operators both gas and electricity to
 guarantee a costefﬁcient and reliable transition towards a renewable society


 in 2013 the dutch network operators united in netbeheer nederland drew up the dutch
 renewable energy action plan 2030 this plan outlines the developments and challenges
 of renewable energy and sets out the actions required to ensure a sustainable supply of
 energy by scaling up existing pilot projects the network operators and other parties aim to
 stimulate energy saving and help make the supply of energy particularly the local supply
 sustainable we are an active participant in this


 the transition towards a sustainable energy supply can only succeed if we take advantage of
 the strengths of the different sources of energy and their infrastructures and combine these
 into a total energy system gas and gas infrastructure play an important role in this


 earthquakes and shale gas
 in 2013 two other subjects were also high on the social and political agenda the earthquakes
 resulting from the gas production in the province of groningen and the discussion about
 the production of shale gas have dented the reputation of gas and diminished support for
 it gas makes the development of renewable energy such as wind and solar power reliable
 and affordable by deploying gas as a ﬂexible partner for generating electricity optimum
 use can be made of the existing infrastructure what is more gas is an energy carrier that

22


     is also developing into a renewable type of energy though the production of green gas and
     hydrogen we therefore think it is important for gas to continue to play a major part in the
     provision of energy in the future the gas industry including gasunie must continue to
     emphasise that gas is still one of the netherlands major assets


     gasunies shareholder structure
     in october 2013 the dutch government published its policy on government participations
     this document explains that the state aims at least for the next few years to continue to
     exert an inﬂuence on state companies such as gasunie the main reason for this is that we
     manage infrastructure that is crucial for the functioning and further development of the
     dutch economy this means that the state will not be looking for private ﬁnancial parties to
     make riskbearing investments in gasunie


     the policy document has not greatly affected our strategy and corporate governance we
     have been serving the public interest for years and work continuously on optimising our
     value  which also beneﬁts dutch society of course our strategy will continue to meet the
     policy documents requirements that apply to state shareholdings


     on 21 february 2014 the minister of finance on behalf of himself and the minister of
     economic affairs sent a letter to the house of representatives opening up the possibility of
     entering into strategic partnerships through crossshareholding participations with foreign
     network operators that are certiﬁed in accordance with european legislation


     strategic themes
     for the long term we focus on three strategic themes that contribute to enabling a reliable
     affordable and sustainable energy supply
      optimising the value of our existing assets
      strengthening our leading position as a crossborder gas infrastructure company in
        europe
      enabling the transition towards more sustainable use of energy



     one of the cornerstones of european energy policy is creating a wellfunctioning internal
     gas market crossborder gas infrastructure companies such as gasunie are at the centre of
     realising this policy
     klausdieter borchardt director internal energy market directorategeneral for energy
     european commission




     optimising the value of our existing assets
     our gas infrastructure activities are central to our strategy  and will continue to be so in
     this our primary focus lies on carrying out our legal tasks regarding gas transport and gas
     transport services by network operators gts and gasunie deutschland in order to facilitate
     a wellfunctioning gas market through our network operators we ensure the management
     proper functioning and development of the gas transport network by means of transport
     services and related services quality conversion and guaranteed security of supply our
     guiding principle here is operational excellence safety reliability and efﬁciency

                                                                                                         23


  strengthening our leading position as a crossborder gas infrastructure company in europe
  in an increasingly consolidating market we take up the challenge to maintain and where
  possible strengthen our leading position as a crossborder gas infrastructure player in this
  we aim to make sure that our infrastructure is the preferred route for market players for
  their gas transport this will beneﬁt the commercial and physical deployment of our assets
  in addition it also strengthens our position as the ideal negotiating partner for regulatory
  authorities in turn this enables us to exert a positive inﬂuence on appropriate legislation
  our positioning as an innovative service provider also contributes to this


  enabling the transition towards more sustainable use of energy
  the issues in the ﬁeld of energy and sustainability are more challenging than ever on the
  way towards a cleaner energy future that is affordable reliable and above all feasible we
  want to take advantage of any opportunities that arise we therefore believe in a sustainable
  future in which gas will play an ongoing role


  as the share of sustainably produced energy in the energy mix increases the need for
  ﬂexibility and backup will also increase gas and gas infrastructure can provide the
  ﬂexibility that energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar power inherently
  lacks gasﬁred power stations can quickly increase or decrease production enabling them
  to deal ﬂexibly with ﬂuctuations in supply and demand gastopower


  by means of smart energy conversions gas infrastructure can also be used to temporarily
  store any surpluses of sustainably produced electricity as gas powertogas we are
  therefore investing in research into technology that enables the conversion of electricity
  into gas such as hydrogen and methanised gas this will help us to give the energy supply an
  innovation boost and make it cleaner and more efﬁcient



corporate social responsibility

  corporate social responsibility csr and social commitment are very important to gasunie
  we have a public role and through our activities we make a signiﬁcant contribution to
  the economy providing safe and uninterrupted gas supply is our primary task which we
  perform with due respect to our environment


  core themes
  in 2013 we examined whether our existing csr policy still reﬂects our current situation
  based on the outcome of that research we deﬁned core themes to which we will devote
  extra attention in the future we have visualised the key aspects of our csr policy in what
  we refer to as a csr house its foundation is formed by good performance in the ﬁelds of
  safety security of supply and care for our employees our satisfactory performance in these
  ﬁelds determines our licence to operate  only then can we start building the rest of the
  house building on this foundation there are three themes with which we want to further
  distinguish ourselves in the future energy transition environs management and footprint
  reductionsustainable procurement we have selected these themes because we think that
  in the coming years they will be very important to us in carrying out our strategy properly
  we will elaborate on this in the section results in the ﬁeld of safety environment and supply chain
  responsibility

     energy transition
     there are many ways in which gas can contribute to a sustainable energy supply the ﬁrst
     steps towards achieving this are often the hardest but we are trying to take them anyhow
     preferably in collaboration with other parties when it comes to the subject of energy
     transition we focus on the following areas
      powertogas
      green gas
      breakbulk lng
      decentralised energy


     together with the european gas infrastructure companies fluxys belgium and energinetdk
     denmark we set up the initiative to make the provision of gas co2neutral by 2050
     on 24 april 2013 during the gas week in the european parliament in brussels the gas
     infrastructure companies grtgaz france and swedegas sweden joined this initiative


     before we can achieve our common goal many steps still need to be taken  for instance
     in the ﬁeld of technological development and innovation powertogas ie storing
     sustainably produced electricity as hydrogen or methanised gas is an option that can
     contribute to a sustainable energy supply as is largescale production of green gas
     breakbulk lng provides the shipping and road haulage sector with an opportunity to emit
     less co2 and other harmful substances


     initially we are focusing our efforts on making gas transport co2neutral broader measures
     that contribute to co2neutral gas provision will need to be worked out in more detail in the
     coming years in cooperation with supply chain partners



     it is inspiring to see how gasunie is proactively tackling the sustainability issue and the
     challenges the energy sector will face in the long term
     jeroen dijsselbloem minister of finance



     environs management
     the environment in which we operate is becoming increasingly complex it consists of a
     growing number of stakeholders from various parts of society such as political parties both
     local and national local residents and environmental groups and associations each with
     their own interests it is not uncommon for objections to be raised against our project plans
     sometimes from unexpected corners communities around us are becoming more assertive
     better organised more highly educated and perfectly capable of accurately processing
     the available information eg through social media this sometimes results in delays in
     planning higher costs and more efforts than planned before a project can run smoothly


     our company therefore needs a strategic approach with regard to the communities in which
     we operate in order to ensure that for instance our projects are completed on schedule
     innovative and proactive environs management will enable us to organise contacts with our
     surroundings in such a way that we can either avoid conﬂicts or together with the relevant
     parties solve them at an early stage in this way we also hope to prevent budget overruns
     complete projects on schedule and even save costs

                                                                                                 25


footprint reduction
footprint reduction touches the core of our operations it means that we want to limit
as much as possible the impact of our activities on the environment our footprint we
have therefore set up an extensive footprint reduction programme this is mainly aimed
at reducing the emission of greenhouse gases by restricting and preventing methane
emissions making maximum use of available energy and ensuring effective combustion
we can achieve this for instance by developing metering and regulating stations that no
longer emit methane by researching alternatives for venting gas by reusing vented gas and
residual heat from compressors and by saving energy


from the co2neutral 2050 objectives we have derived the following footprint objectives
 in 2014 we will set up a transparent and auditable reporting system for all emission
   sources that have been identiﬁed we have also set a cumulative objective for 2014 for
   the reduction of co2equivalent emissions more details on this are given in the section
   results in the ﬁeld of safety environment and supply chain responsibility
 by 2020 we aim to have achieved a 20 reduction in direct co2 emissions or
   124 kilotonnes co2 equivalent compared to 1990 2020 ambition this concerns
   exclusively scope 1 of the ghg protocol


by 2030 we will have reduced our co2 emissions by 40 compared to the emissions in 1990
measured over the full scope 1 2 and 3 of the ghg protocol for more details see p 50 in
addition we are examining how our activities in the ﬁeld of sustainable procurement can
help us achieve our footprint reduction objectives eg by applying the co2 performance
ladder


embedding csr policy and accountability
the executive board is responsible for formulating our csr policy and objectives and for csr
performance in practice the policy is drawn up in consultation with the supervisory board
each department is responsible for providing input with regard to csr policy in their own
area of expertise as well as for its execution and adjustment


in determining objectives with regard to csr the relevant departments are also consulted
on whether the necessary preconditions are present and sufﬁciently embedded within our
organisation

26




     we are expanding our transport
     capacity towards the north to
     make sure that denmark can
     import sufﬁcient volumes of
     gas from the rest of europe

                                                                                                     27


our results in 2013
our customers and the market

 optimising the value of our existing assets
 our gas transport and infrastructure activities are central to our strategy in carrying out our
 strategy we strive for operational excellence


 a gas transport record
 the year 2013 started with a long cold winter in the netherlands germany and the
 surrounding countries this led to a high demand for natural gas an ever larger share of
 the transported volume relates to the throughput of gas from and to foreign countries
 increasingly our network functions as an international hub in the throughput of gas


 in 2013 we transported 1365 billion kwh 140 billion m3 of gas of which 1131 billion kwh
 116 billion m3 ﬂowed through our dutch network and 234 billion kwh 24 billion m3 through
 our german network for gts this was 104 billion kwh 11 billion m3 more than in 2012  a
 new annual record the previous record year was 2010 when we transported 1080 billion
 kwh 111 billion m3 the volume transported through our german network is more or less the
 same as last year


 with the transport of gas and related services we generated revenues of  1311 million
  1083 million in the netherlands and  228 million in germany


 transport costs
 partly due to the unusually long winter our transport costs in 2013 in the netherlands and
 germany were higher than expected another reason for the increased transport costs in
 germany was a tenday interruption in danish gas production from the north sea in may as
 a result the stocks in the danish gas storage facilities reached the lowest level ever they had
 to be replenished and this led to constant large gas ﬂows to denmark during the summer
 the interruption in production in denmark was also alleviated by extra imports from other
 western european countries that were transported to denmark through our network with
 the connection of nel to our network in heidenau we signiﬁcantly improved the situation
 of transport to the north from november 2013 onwards less compression is required which
 reduces our costs


 transport revenues
 we have noticed an important shift with respect to the capacity contracts  customers
 increasingly prefer shortterm contracts this means that transport revenues are subject
 to greater volatility and unpredictability in 2013 less capacity was booked with gasunie
 deutschland than expected in spite of the fact that decreasing entry bookings and cancelled
 contracts had already been taken into account given the method of turnover regulation
 used a rise in tariffs for 2014 is unavoidable


 despite this volatility the permitted revenues for the years 20122016 will increase due to
 the fact that new infrastructure is now in operation until 2016 the full use of nel will lead
 to a signiﬁcant increase in revenues which are guaranteed by longterm bookings the

28


     revenue will also increase as a result of other new investments which have been allowed and
     approved by the regulatory authority


     increased efﬁciency
     in 2012 we drew up an efﬁciency programme that should enable us to achieve structural
     savings of  60 million from 2012 up to and including 2014 this efﬁciency masterplan is
     making good progress it is on schedule and by the end of 2013 we had managed to achieve
     a cost reduction of approximately  40 million


     safety performance constant attention
     we measure our safety performance using two indicators the frequency index and the
     number of pipeline incidents in 2013 we unfortunately failed to meet either of these
     objectives with regard to pipeline incidents we aim for zero and have set a signal value
     of ﬁve as maximum in addition with regard to the number of reportables personal
     accidents we have set a signal value for the frequency index of four as maximum with
     zero fatalities however in november 2013 a crane operator employed by one of our
     contractors was sadly killed in a tragic accident six pipeline incidents occurred exceeding
     our signal value of ﬁve of course the causes of all of these incidents will be investigated
     and appropriate measures will be taken to reduce the number of incidents a more detailed
     report of our safety performance can be found in the section results with respect to safety
     environment and chain responsibility


     high level of security of supply
     in addition to safety security of supply has a high priority within our company the number
     of interruptions and disruptions in gas supply related to quality issues remained well
     within the established standards in 2013 there were three transport interruptions in the
     netherlands which is well below the maximum of nine an investigation report is drawn up
     for each transport interruption based on the conclusions of these reports we deﬁne points
     for improvement in order to further minimise the risk of interruptions in 2013 there were no
     interruptions to transport in germany


     we continue to implement improvements to the gas infrastructure in 2013 this again
     gave rise to maintenance and renovation projects that require proper coordination
     with customers and distribution network operators thanks to timely communication
     and consultation about planned activities we can maintain security of supply for our
     stakeholders at the desired level

                                                                                                              29


expansion of transport capacity
in the past year we rolled out the last leg of our northsouth project odiliapeelmelick and
made a start on the construction of a new pipeline between beverwijk and wijngaarden
both projects were the result of our open seasons during which we asked customers about
their longterm transport needs customers entered into contracts for additional transport
capacity and on that basis we have expanded our transport capacity


another project resulting from an open season was the newbuild project exell exit ellund
in germany this concerns a number of extensions of the existing network to compensate for
declining production capacity in denmark and to meet the increasing demand for natural
gas in north germany see also expansion towards the north on p 36


in order to give customers an opportunity to indicate their capacity needs as of october
2019 gts started a new open season in the netherlands in december 2013 based on
customers responses we can combine the individual capacity needs of customers and
set up an investment programme that is as efﬁcient as possible if this leads to expansion
investments gts will aim for a delivery date in the autumn of 2019



               largely thanks to the ﬂexible approach taken by gts connecting a horticulture company in
                       noordbrabant to the gts grid was done more quickly than seemed possible at ﬁrst
                                                                            willem bijlsma tenergy consult




multiyear replacement programme in the netherlands
in order to be able to meet future standards in safe and reliable gas transport gts launched a
largescale multiyear replacement programme in 2012 this programme which is expected
to run for 1520 years involves the renovation and partial replacement of valve stations
metering and regulating stations and gas receiving stations the ﬁrst dozens of stations
were renovated in 2013 we will use the lessons learned from this exercise to improve
planning and execution in the coming years


gas storage in the netherlands
on 1 october 2013 on the basis of capacity contracts with customers we expanded the gas
storage in zuidwending by adding a ﬁfth cavern and a sixth compressor this expansion was
completed well on time and within budget


following a ﬁre in one of the transformers at the end of january 2013 we took the
precaution of replacing a second transformer and modifying three others by august 2013 all
transformers were operational again


at the moment we are examining the feasibility of further expansion this includes looking
at alternative forms of energy storage in caverns where we focus for instance on the
storage of nitrogen hydrogen highcaloriﬁc gas and highpressure air the opportunities we
see there make us optimistic about the longterm development of zuidwending

     stable developments in regulation
     the netherlands
     on 2 october 2013 acm published the method decision and the xfactor decision to be used
     for gts for the years 20142016 in the method decision acm determines the regulatory
     framework for the ﬁve statutory duties of transport balancing quality conversion existing
     connections and new connections the xfactor decision determines the annual efﬁciency
     deduction that gts must apply to its revenues and tariffs the design and structure of the
     method decision is consistent with earlier decisions this is beneﬁcial to the predictability
     and stability of the regulatory framework by introducing a system of revenue regulation
     the method decision will also present a robust framework to cope with rapidly changing
     european rules concerning the provision of services by national network operators revenue
     regulation is a system that is used in most of europe it determines the permitted revenues
     and calculates the difference between the permitted revenues and the actual revenues ex post
     facto


     in order to ensure the quality of our services in the long term it is essential that all costs of
     capital are included in calculating the weighted average cost of capital wacc however in
     its calculations acm failed to do this and set the wacc at 36 for gts this may lead to the
     undesirable situation that it will not be able to earn back its efﬁciently incurred costs gts
     has ﬁled an appeal against this


     the abovementioned decisions of acm may have a large impact on for instance the volume
     of the expected revenues in the regulatory period 20142016 and the following regulatory
     periods as a result of acms ﬁnal decisions an assessment was carried out of the monetary
     value of our gas transport network in the netherlands this was done by comparing the
     carrying amount of the assets with the expected revenues and an assessment was made of
     the extent to which the carrying amount could be earned back the carrying amount of the
     assets was not changed on the basis of this assessment


     now that acm has established the method and xfactor decision for the years 20142016
     preparations will start for the regulatory period from 2017 onward


     germany
     in germany the system of revenue regulation has been applied for quite some time the
     german regulator bundesnetzagentur bnetza has determined the new permitted revenues
     for the regulatory period 20132017 the permitted revenues of gasunie deutschland for this
     period are based on an efﬁciency benchmark for the year 2010 in 2012 bnetza determined
     the cost level and in december 2013 gasunie deutschland was rated as 100 efﬁcient for the
     current regulatory period


     at the end of 2013 bnetza started a consultation process to map the effects of revenue
     regulation including efﬁciency benchmarking bnetza is required by law to make the report
     of this available before the end of 2014 the adjustments are expected to be carried out in
     the next regulatory period as of 2018 at the moment we cannot yet predict how this will
     actually affect gasunie deutschland

                                                                                                  31


based on the decisions of bnetza with regard to the permitted revenues and the efﬁciency
benchmark an assessment was carried out of the monetary value of the gas transport
network in germany just as in the netherlands this assessment did not result in a value
change of the assets


preparations for the new balancing regime
in 2013 gts made preparations in order to be able to adjust the balancing regime in 2014
a balancing regime is the method by which the network can be kept at the right pressure
ensuring that on balance the same amount of gas is retrieved from the network as is
fed into it the dutch regime needs to be adjusted because the european union wants
gas transport between the various countries to be better connected in order to promote
crossborder trade after adjustment the regime will ﬁt in with those of other countries
one of the new regimes characteristics is that at the end of every gas day any imbalances
are settled in addition shortages or surpluses in gtss network will in future be traded on
the gas exchange ice endex


certiﬁcation
certiﬁcation of gts gasunie deutschland bbl company and goal
in 2013 gts gasunie deutschland bbl company and goal gasunie ostseeanbindungsleitung
the network operator of nel were certiﬁed by their regulators as independent network
operators this certiﬁcation a new requirement introduced in the european third package
for energy legislation was given by acm bnetza and ofgem following a favourable report
by the european commission on the four network operators


nta 8120 certiﬁcation
in all phases of the life cycle of electricity and gas networks regional and national network
operators and regulatory authorities want to prevent irregularities interruptions and
incidents and manage their consequences they therefore decided to further develop
their safety quality and capacity management by means of a netherlands technical
agreement nta for asset management nta 8120 sets out the requirements that the asset
management system must meet deﬁning in more detail the speciﬁc requirements of safety
quality and capacity management in 2013 gts started preparations to set up a framework
for its asset management in accordance with nta 8120 and to further professionalise it
the intention is that in 2014 gts will receive certiﬁcation from an independent authority

32


     transfer of gasunie assets to gts
     as of 1 january 2014 ownership of the gas transport network in the netherlands and the
     related assets liabilities and activities were transferred from gasunie to gts this transfer is
     part of the certiﬁcation of gts as an independent network operator


     as a national network operator gts will continue to use the services of gasunie to this end
     gts and gasunie have entered into a number of agreements that establish the framework
     for their collaboration these include the policy framework that guides the activities to be
     carried out by gasunie so that security of supply and safe and reliable gas transport remain
     guaranteed


     changing gas composition
     as a result of the internationalisation of gas ﬂows in europe the variation in gas
     composition in our net is increasing in addition the production of natural gas in
     northwest europe including production from the dutch gas ﬁelds will decline this
     has consequences for the user in the netherlands we have two separate gas transport
     networks one for lowcaloriﬁc and one for highcaloriﬁc gas the settings of domestic
     appliances and much of the industrial equipment in the netherlands are geared to the
     relatively constant composition of the lowcaloriﬁc groningen gas g gas the increasing
     variation in gas composition affects these settings


     the ministry of economic affairs has asked a number of parties in the market to take steps
     to give the endusers of gas sufﬁcient time to adjust their equipment if necessary for
     the g gas market there will be a transitional period that will run to 2021 at least during
     this period gts will ensure that the market in the netherlands will receive gas with a
     composition similar to that of g gas


     the ministry of economic affairs has also made a transitional arrangement for users of the
     highcaloriﬁc h gas this arrangement runs until 1 october 2014 by which time they will have
     had ﬁve years to adjust their equipment in the netherlands approximately 80 companies
     use h gas while all other companies and households use g gas


     due to the constant composition of gas in the netherlands there has until now been no
     need to make a party legally responsible for gas quality however because of the increasing
     variety in composition the minister of economic affairs has announced that this new
     statutory duty is to be assigned to gts as a consequence of this change in legislation gts
     has been given the task if necessary of adjusting not only the wobbe index but also other
     characteristics of gas the requirements for gas will be laid down in a ministerial regulation
     on gas quality mr gaskwaliteit this mr is expected to come into force on 1 july 2014


     the consequences of declining gas production are also noticeable in germany german
     production is rapidly decreasing while demand from neighbouring network operators for
     ﬁxed capacity at gasunie deutschland is increasing due to the declining production of
     lowcaloriﬁc l gas and g gas this increasing demand can no longer be covered by l and
     ggas capacity the technical measures required have already been laid down in the german
     netzentwicklungsplan nep 2013 in the german energy law energiewirtschaftsgesetz enwg
     and the german gas industrys cooperation agreement kooperationsvereinbarung it has
     been established that market conversion from l gas to h gas is needed the aim is to have

                                                                                                33


a fully converted market by 2030 from that year g gas will no longer be imported from
the netherlands conversion of the ﬁrst gasunie deutschland markets will take place in
20162017


consequences of earthquakes in the netherlands
in 2013 the minister of economic affairs published new ﬁndings on the link between gas
production from the groningen gas ﬁeld and earthquakes in the province of groningen in
this context in a research project commissioned by the ministry of economic affairs gts
examined the relationship between the volume of natural gas to be produced and security of
supply


in january 2014 the minister published his conclusions and the measures to be taken one of
these measures is to limit the volume of gas that can be produced from the groningen
gas ﬁeld from 2014 up to and including 2016 in 2014 and 2015 production of up to
425 billion m3 per year will be allowed and in 2016 40 billion m3 in addition production
from the ﬁve clusters around loppersum will be limited to 3 billion m3 per year these
measures will make sure that during periods of high demand sufﬁcient gas will remain
available to meet this demand


in addition research has been carried out into whether the potentially increasing force
of the earthquakes will increase the risk of damage to the gas transport network at the
moment it seems advisable to strengthen a number of structures and to replace certain
lengths of pipeline the consequences will be looked into further in 2014

     strengthening our leading position as a crossborder gas infrastructure
     company
     in an increasingly integrating market we take on the challenge of maintaining and where
     possible strengthening our leading position as a crossborder gas infrastructure player


     cooperation at european level
     the transport of natural gas takes place in a market with internationally operating parties
     the customers of gts and gasunie deutschland also operate partly across borders this calls
     for an international approach connecting gas markets will create a bigger market with
     more suppliers this generates more competition which has a positive effect on prices all
     gas consumers in the region will beneﬁt from this


     auctioning via prisma
     on 1 april 2013 gts and gasunie deutschland started to offer dayahead capacity including
     bundled capacity where possible at a number of border points this capacity is auctioned on
     the prisma platform which was cofounded by gts and gasunie deutschland prisma is a
     new european booking platform for shippers developed by 19 european network operators
     the platform offers an opportunity for auctions at border points allowing capacity on both
     sides of the border to be bundled in addition shippers can book capacity at domestic exit
     points the platform also facilitates a secondary market which allows customers to offer
     for sale capacity they have already booked for shippers prisma is a uniform point of entry
     for buying and selling capacity products in various european countries as of 2014 gts and
     gasunie deutschland will start auctioning the capacity that is already available at all of their
     border points via prisma


     together with the largest european network operators gts and gasunie deutschland have
     ensured that prisma the european trading platform for gas capacity is one of the leading
     parties in the ﬁeld of booking gas transport capacity that is a huge step forward towards an
     integrated european gas market
     götz lincke managing director prisma european capacity platform



     implementation of network codes
     in order to stimulate the development of a competitive european gas market the tsos
     are cooperating in for instance entsog european network for transmission system
     operators gas within entsog stakeholders can amongst other things coordinate their
     plans in the ﬁeld of european network codes the tenyear network development plan and
     the promotion of transparency in 2013 several developments took place in the context of
     european legislation and regulations guidelines and network codes


     the eu strives to deal more efﬁciently with the capacity available at interconnection
     points the european commission has therefore commissioned the development of the
     network codes cam capacity allocation mechanisms and cmp congestion management
     procedures in 2013 gts and gasunie deutschland worked hard on preparing the
     implementation of these two codes the introduction of cam and cmp makes it possible
     to fully exploit the connections between the network of gasunie and the networks that
     surround us this has positive effects on the development of the ttf gas trading point
     prisma also already complies with these codes

                                                                                                    35


growing gas trading points
gasunie wants to expand the current leading position of the ttf gas trading point the most
liquid and prominent hub of continental europe trading on the ttf should therefore be
made as attractive as possible a welldeveloped gas exchange such as ice endex can play an
important role in this particularly if the same trend develops on the european continent as
in the united kingdom where a shift is taking place from bilateral trade to gas trade via an
exchange


ttf
ttf is the dutch virtual trading point where gas can be traded over the past ﬁve years ttf
has grown into one of the most prominent liquid gas hubs in europe alongside the english
national balancing point nbp despite the declining demand for gas in northwest europe
ttf managed to maintain its high level in 2013 a wellfunctioning gas trading point attracts
traders who each bring along their own gas this is good for security of supply and also
ensures that supply and demand can function properly a high level of liquidity raises the
conﬁdence of market parties and has a positive effect on pricing


in 2013 a total of 8287 billion kwh of gas was traded via ttf compared to 7569 kwh in 2012 
both via bilateral trade over the counter otc and via exchanges the physical volume
ﬂowing through ttf the net ttf volume increased in 2013 from 417 billion kwh in 2012 to
447 billion kwh this means that just as in 2012 the physical ttf volume is larger than the
domestic gas consumption in the netherlands in other words both the netherlands and
other countries use ttf to meet their demand for gas in 2013 the number of active ttf
traders was 113 well above that of 2012 104


ice endex
on 1 march 2013 the energy exchange apx endex was split into an electricity part spot
trade and clearing and a derivatives and spotgas part the derivatives and spotgas part
continued as ice endex with intercontinentalexchange ice as its major shareholder
gasunie has a share of 2088 in ice endex


gaspool
we also see growth at the northgerman virtual gas trading point gaspool which is
signiﬁcantly smaller than ttf in 2013 the traded volumes and liquidity of gaspool both
increased the traded volume was 1251 billion kwh and the net volume 444 billion kwh
compared to 981 billion kwh 2013 and 389 billion kwh respectively in 2012 at the end of
2013 355 traders were active on gaspool considerably more than in 2012 314 traders this
growth is expected to continue in the coming years

     developments in crossborder infrastructure
     expansion towards the north
     due to various developments there is a growing need for extra transport capacity through
     germany towards the north for instance domestic gas production in denmark is in
     decline and there is more demand for natural gas in schleswigholstein and the hamburg
     region as a consequence of the german energiewende we have therefore initiated an
     expansion project called exit ellund exell this will be carried out in two phases in phase
     1 a new compressor station will be built at embsen this is expected to become operational
     on 1 october 2014 in phase 2 a new compressor station will be built at quarnstedt a
     65kilometre pipeline will be laid between fockbek and ellund and a new metering and
     regulating station will be built at ellund the pipeline is expected to be completed by the
     beginning of 2015 and both stations are expected to be completed in late 2015 or early 2016
     the entire exell project is part of the german netzentwicklungsplan nep



     at energinetdk we are very pleased with the good longterm collaboration we have with
     gasunie we work together in many different areas varying from the capacity expansion at
     ellund market integration and green gas to initiatives that ensure a reliable gas market that
     will become increasingly greener in the future
     søren juel hansen head of development at energinetdk




     the connection with the united kingdom
     for the united kingdom the bbl gas pipeline between balgzand and bacton forms an
     important connection with the gas market on the european mainland due to the prolonged
     cold winter of 20122013 large differences arose between gas prices on the continent and
     those on the british gas market as a result in march 2013 bbls capacity was temporarily
     completely sold out


     connection to the russian gas supply
     after becoming partially operational at the end of 2012 nel nordeuropäische erdgasleitung
     became fully operational on 1 november 2013 nel is the connecting pipeline between nord
     streams landfall point in greifswald north germany and our own german network as a
     consequence of the licensing process for nel we decided to use an alternative route over a
     distance of 40 kilometres which resulted in the project being delayed


     when nel became fully operational nord stream was also able to offer its full capacity of
     537 billion kwh 55 billion m3 per year to the market as a result northwest europe is now
     well connected with russian gas supplies increasing security of supply


     in 2014 nord stream shareholders including gasunie are expected to receive dividend from
     nord stream for the ﬁrst time


     nel is managed by goal gasunie ostseeanbindungsleitung gmbh goal acts on behalf of
     gasunie as a jointventure partner in nel together with nel gastransport gmbh eon
     global commodities se and fluxys deutschland gmbh in september 2012 goal exercised
     its right to take over 513 of the share of eon global commodities se in nel 10 this
     transaction took place on 1 november 2013 when nel became fully operational this
     increased goals share in nel to 2513

                                                                                                    37


the transition towards more sustainable use of energy
gasunie believes in a sustainable energy supply for this reason we participate in various
initiatives


seeking smarter energy solutions together with partners
new lng services
liqueﬁed natural gas lng is a cleaner transport fuel than for instance diesel fuel the
shipping industry is facing increasingly stricter rules regarding the emission of sulphur a
ship running on lng emits no sulphur oxide and very little nitric oxide if any in this way
gas contributes signiﬁcantly to reducing emissions in shipping in the same way trucks
that use lng also signiﬁcantly reduce the emission of ﬁne particles engines running on
lng produce less noise reducing noise pollution what is more lng as a portable fuel
could be the solution for industries that need gas but are located in areas that lack a gas
infrastructure


gate the lng import terminal offers its customers opportunities to open up new markets
at the moment new services and associated facilities are being developed to make this
possible in 2013 for instance the focus was on facilitating breakbulk services whereby lng
is transhipped from the storage tanks of gate onto smaller ships and trucks


from 2013 gates customers will be able not only to unload lng but also to load lng known
as backloading gate invested in the technical facilities required for this and smaller boats
can now be received for loading and unloading gate also constructed a truckloading bay
where trucks can load lng in 2013 the ﬁrst backloadings took place and the ﬁrst small ships
were received as planned the truckloading bay became operational on 21 january 2014


the new services have been wellreceived and are leading to more activity at the terminal
we expect continued growth in break bulk and together with our gate partner vopak and
in close cooperation with gate we are therefore expanding our facilities still further


at the moment prices on the international lng market are such that importing lng for
injection into gtss natural gas network or selling at ttf are often of little interest to gate
customers


in 2013 gasunie lng holding bv took over 25 of the shares in gate terminal bv from dong
energy gasunies total interest in the terminal now amounts to 475

         powertogas
         to enable the transition towards a more sustainable energy supply new solutions are
         needed for the storage and transport of energy the supply of electricity from wind and solar
         power varies greatly depending on weather conditions sometimes there is too much
         and sometimes there is too little powertogas in combination with the existing gas
         infrastructure offers a solution for this problem in an electrolysis installation electricity
         generated from wind can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen by combining the
         hydrogen with carbon dioxide even methane can be produced this is a process that is clean
         and sustainable


         both the hydrogen and the methane can then be fed into the gas infrastructure in this way
         surpluses of sustainable energy can be stored for later use and overload of the electricity
         networks can be prevented gas is easy to store and it is also the cheapest form of energy
         to transport this creates a new role for the natural gas infrastructure namely as a place of
         storage and a means of transport for sustainable energy we regard this as an important step
         towards ensuring the sustainability of tomorrows energy supply


         powertogas initiative in schleswigholstein
         in germany various initiatives are currently being taken to integrate powertogas as a
         new technology into the energy system the new german government has set longterm
         objectives to stimulate the development of powertogas dvgw the german technical
         and scientiﬁc association for gas and water of which gasunie deutschland is a member
         has carried out a feasibility study into powertogas although the results were positive
         substantial steps still need to be taken


         in addition gasunie deutschland started a joint project with arge netz which is supported
         by the schleswigholstein ministry of energy transition agriculture the environment and
         spatial planning the aim of this project is to develop plans for the largescale development
         and deployment of powertogas in schleswigholstein


     endusers need to show us what they want  otherwise the energy sector will not build it in
     the virtual power matching city we as residents indicate what our wishes are with regard to
     the use of sustainable resources independence energy use and costs that is then built and
     we test the result directly in practice
     theo wieleman participant in pmc and multidisciplinary projects engineering manager at gasunie



         development of smart grids
         the share in the future fuel mix of smallscale sustainable energy sources such as wind and
         solar power or biomass in the form of green gas is expected to increase combining these
         different energy systems ensures that the capacity of these sources is exploited to the fullest
         extent these linked digitally controlled energy networks or smart grids are essential for
         achieving a proper match between energy supply and demand thanks to the great ﬂexibility
         with which it can be deployed natural gas plays an important role in these smart grids


         the development of smartgrid concepts is leading to a smarter use of energy sources
         and infrastructure at relatively low costs smart grids enable consumers to manage their
         home energy needs and select their own energy source sustainable energy if available and
         otherwise the least polluting fossil fuel ie natural gas in due course consumers will be

                                                                                                    39


able to use smart grids to generate  very efﬁciently and sustainably  their own electricity
using gas thanks to their connection to the gas infrastructure they will not need to invest
heavily in a new electricity infrastructure  something that will be necessary in an allelectric
house


powermatching city
in 2013 the dutch minister of economic affairs launched phase 2 of powermatching city
pmc in groningen in this pilot project 40 households in the city of groningen are testing
the unique concept of a smart grid that makes use of both gas and electricity gasunie is
participating in this project because we are convinced of the importance of decentralised
energy solutions in a sustainable energy supply


phase 1 of pmc demonstrated that the technology of this type of smart grid works well at
the un conference for sustainable development in brazil rio 20 it was pronounced one of
the 100 most sustainable projects in the world


phase 2 of pmc is on a larger scale the number of households has been doubled and
consumers have been given an opportunity to manage their energy consumption on the
basis of cost and source of energy this unique research project will provide insight into the
extent to which the cost and the source of energy affects people in their choice and use of
energy  a question that has not been explored in practice before


research into energy transition edgar
energy delta gas research edgar is a dutch initiative aimed at bringing together the
knowledge available in the netherlands in the ﬁeld of gas it is the largest natural gas
research project in europe focusing on sustainability the aim is to examine the options
for a sustainable energy future in the light of the netherlands strong position in the gas
market participants in edgar come from industry gasunie gasterra kiwa enexis liander
and stedin and from scientiﬁc institutions ecn university of groningen delft university
of technology and hanze university of applied sciences these partners have set up an
innovative programme in which they themselves have invested  22 million in addition the
consortium has received a subsidy of  22 million  10 million from the ministry of economic
affairs  10 million from the european fund for regional development via the northern
netherlands provinces and  2 million from the province of groningen edgar aspires to
become an international centre of excellence in the ﬁeld of gas and sustainability various
edgar studies eg into green gas and smart grids were completed in 2013


testing ground for research into energy transition entrance
gasunie is one of the initiators of the energy transition centre entrance a project we
launched in 2013 together with bam gasterra hanze university of applied sciences and
imtech entrance is a testing ground for energy systems of the future at the zernike campus
in groningen a practiceoriented living laboratory entrance was set up  a facility where
various functions of smart energy networks are being developed tested and demonstrated
in a reallife environment research is being carried out into the integration of wind and
solar power new decentralised energy systems and smart energy management systems


together with other parties we plan to expand entrance with speciﬁc projects in this way
we are contributing to the integration of innovative gas applications into the energy system
of the future

       revenues
       revenues were  21 million higher than in 2012 this was mainly the result of additional
       revenue from new assets such as the heiligerlee nitrogen buffer the connection of
       the epe caverns and the compressor station at wijngaarden these additional revenues
       compensate for the efﬁciency deductions on the tariffs as determined by the regulators in
       the netherlands and germany


       operating result
       the operating result rose by  126 million in addition to the higher revenues mentioned
       above expenses turned out lower due to the release of a part of the pension provision in

iinvestments
over the past few years gasunie has invested heavily particularly in the development of the
gas roundabout for instance 2013 saw the completion of the expansion at zuidwending
and the nel while in 2014 and 2015 the expansion projects at beverwijkwijngaarden and
exitellund will be completed at the moment no further largescale expansion investments
have been planned for the time being we are able to meet the capacity needs of the market
from our existing capacity and the capacity being built in 2012 we started a multiyear
replacement programme in the netherlands this programme is expected to result in an
annual capex of approximately  150 million


in the coming years we will focus on initiatives relating to market coupling and market
integration and on developing new proﬁtable activities that contribute to the transition
to a more sustainable energy supply finally both in the netherlands and in germany we
will start preparing for the switch in the market from lowcaloriﬁc to highcaloriﬁc gas in
the netherlands this means that we will need to invest in increasing capacity for blending
highcaloriﬁc gas with nitrogen


for the next three years we expect an average annual capex of  400 to 500 million

     expected ﬁnancial results
     on the basis of current insights gasunie expects to achieve a higher operating result from
     normal business operations in 2014 revenues will rise due to the fact that a repayment
     obligation based on the method decisions of gts from the past will no longer apply
     normalised revenues are expected to be slightly higher compared to those of 2013 the
     efﬁciency deductions as determined by the regulators in the netherlands 13 and germany
     15 will be offset by revenues from new assets such as the new odiliapeelmelick pipeline
     which was part of open season 2012


     operating expenses are expected to be higher in 2014 due to increasing maintenance
     costs for the network this is directly related to the multiyear maintenance programme
     that started in 2012 the ﬁnance costs will be lower in 2014 due to the repayment of
     interestbearing loans at the end of 2013 it is expected that the balance sheet total in 2014
     will rise to  10800 million 2013  10606 million as a result of the investments made in
     expansions


     financing
     we managed to offset most of the debt repayment peak of october 2013 with the revenues
     from two bond loans that in anticipation of this peak had already been issued in 2012 as a
     result gasunie did not need to attract any additional bond loans in 2013 the debt repayment
     peak was related to the redemption of a ﬁveyear bond loan of which the outstanding sum
     of  1116 million originally  1400 million had to be repaid gasunies remaining ﬁnancing
     requirement was met by attracting shortterm deposits on the money market and by issuing
     commercial paper under the euro commercial paper ecp programme this was the ﬁrst
     time that gasunie made use of this new programme the fact that this shortterm note
     could be successfully placed with investors indicates that the circumstances in the ﬁnancial
     markets remain positive for ﬁnancially solid parties such as gasunie


     in addition  150 million was drawn under the loan facility with the european investment
     bank this draw concerns a sevenyear loan with a variable interest rate and linear
     repayment the margin of the loan facility agreed in december 2012 has now been used fully
     when the facility was agreed in december 2012 both parties already intended to increase it
     by  100 million over the course of 2013 the facility was therefore extended by this amount at
     the end of 2013 no use was made of this additional margin in 2013


     as a result of the abovementioned activities the total interestbearing loan at the end of
     2013 was  4611 million a decrease of  598 million compared to the end of 2012 due to the
     debt repayment peak in october the balance sheet item cash and cash equivalents
     is also lower  87 million at the end of 2013 end of 2012  909 million as a result the net
     debt position interestbearing loan minus cash increased in 2013 by  224 million to
      4524 million


     in 2014 no bond loans will be repaid we will wait to see how cash ﬂow develops before
     deciding how best to meet our ﬁnancing requirement in 2014


     solvency at yearend 2013 was 49 2012 44 the high level of cash at the end of 2012 meant
     that solvency was temporarily low corrected for this effect solvency at the end of 2012 would
     have been 48 it is not only essential that liquidity be maintained at an adequate level and

                                                                                                   43


  that there is a sufﬁcient spread of ﬁnancing alternatives but being able to attract ﬁnancing
  as efﬁciently as possible is also very important to adequately meet these objectives we
  will make use of the euro medium term note emtn programme the ecp programme
  mentioned above and gasunies own activities on the private money and capital markets
  gasunie also has credit facilities the most important of which is a committed  800 million
  standby credit facility that was agreed in october 2010 for a term of ﬁve years no use was
  made of this facility in 2013 one of the measures we will take in 2014 to keep our liquidity
  position at a sufﬁcient level is to renew this standby credit facility


  credit ratings
  in 2013 rating agency standard  poors lowered gasunies longterm credit rating from aa
  with a negative outlook to a with a stable outlook this was the direct result of standard 
  poors lowering of the longterm credit rating of the dutch state in november 2013 in 2013
  rating agency moodys investors service left gasunies longterm credit rating unchanged at
  a2 with a stable outlook



results in the ﬁelds of safety the environment and
supply chain responsibility

  safety always a priority
  an important enabling factor for carrying out our activities is the safety of our employees
  and the communities in which we work a priority for us is therefore to create a safe and
  healthy workplace and to minimise risk to the natural environment since safety is an
  important indicator of the quality of our work we want to be one of the best international
  gas infrastructure companies in terms of safety performance european benchmarking of
  similar gas transport companies carried out by marcogaz the representative body of the
  european natural gas industry on all technical issues shows that we are already one of the
  best within our reference group and we naturally strive to maintain this position


  research into safety culture and behaviour
  we pay a great deal of attention to the safety behaviour of our employees to ﬁnd out
  whether we can improve this even more we started a study in 2013 into the internal
  safety culture and safety behaviour of our employees the study is intended to serve as a
  thermometer giving us insight into where we are now what is going well what can be
  improved and which trends we see we aim to work towards a culture in which people
  automatically think of and choose safe options that are not subject to pressures of time
  or money we intend to repeat this study regularly so that we will gain insight into
  developments over time and can determine how effective our projects and actions are


  our results in the area of occupational safety
  in november 2013 despite all our efforts in the ﬁeld of safety a fatal accident with a crane
  occurred involving one of our contractors  an accident we deeply regret we will follow
  closely the investigations by the contractor and the health  safety inspectorate into the
  cause of this tragic accident and together we will determine what measures need to be
  taken in order to prevent such an accident occurring again

     by reportables we mean all injuries resulting in fatalities absence replacement work or requiring medical treatment

     other than ﬁrst aid


     we also record the number of potentially dangerous incidents incidents that did not result
     in injury but could have had serious consequences in 2013 we registered 20 of these in
     2012 17 we carefully analyse these dangerous incidents to prevent a recurrence


     process safety new kpis
     besides occupational safety we also work hard on process safety process safety relates to
     large incidents whereby hazardous substances andor large amounts of energy are released
     inspections which we carry out as a consequence of the eu directive on major accident
     hazards domah showed that our performance could be better in 2013 we therefore
     mapped out how we could improve our efforts in this ﬁeld employees explored this topic
     together in brainstorm sessions we also used benchmarks as input for our discussions
     based on the outcomes of these sessions we drew up some twenty kpis covering the most
     important aspects of process safety as of 2014 we will apply these to measure monitor and
     improve our performance in process safety


     technical safety safe management and maintenance of our pipelines and installations
     all our installations including our transport installations comply with the legal
     requirements for external safety to keep our underground pipelines in good condition
     we take both preventative and corrective measures in particular we carry out ongoing
     inspections which play a key role in helping us to ensure the integrity of our transport
     system


     we inspect our underground pipelines both on the inside and on the outside for inspecting
     inside the pipelines we use intelligent pigs robots that are carried through the pipelines
     by the gas ﬂow in 2013 in the netherlands we inspected some 267 kilometres of htl
     pipelines 2012 295 in this way and 196 kilometres of rtl pipelines 2012 280 in germany
     we inspected 278 kilometres we also checked another 76 kilometres of pipelines for which
     we could not use the robots and instead used an aboveground inspection method the
     external corrosion direct assessment ecda ecda is a method we developed ourselves for
     inspecting pipeline segments that cannot or only with difﬁculty be examined by pigs in
     2012 we inspected more than 80 kilometres using ecda


     besides providing information placing marker poles above the pipelines and carrying out
     visual inspections we also carry out aerial surveys of our pipeline routes by helicopter
     in 2013 these aerial surveys revealed a variety of anomalies where necessary we took
     immediate action to maintain a safe situation

                                                                                                   45


corrosion assessment new insights
in 2013 we gained new insights and made new calculations regarding corrosion in practice
it turns out that corrosion does not take place as quickly as used to be thought we have
therefore modiﬁed our pipeline inspection policy accordingly as a result we can use our
inspection tools more efﬁciently without affecting the technical safety of our pipelines


external safety bottlenecks resolved
in 2011 the decree on the external safety of pipelines came into force in the netherlands the
decree which is designed to ensure that pipelines are situated in safe locations requires
that measures are taken within three years to resolve bottlenecks at locations that have
vulnerable objects within the 106 contour to comply with this legislation in 2010 and
2011 we mapped out existing and potential bottlenecks we then asked all local authorities
involved whether the situation we had mapped out indeed reﬂected the situation on the
ground eg with regard to the presence of people and buildings on that basis our route
managers have since developed and applied appropriate measures in each case


we made good progress in this regard in 2013 most bottlenecks have now been cleared the
few remaining locations where we have not yet been able to take appropriate measures will
be dealt with at a later date at a few other locations we are still waiting to see whether the
proposed measure has actually solved the issue


from 2014 onwards we will take additional measures in situations that pose a risk to groups
of people in such cases the risk to each individual remains within the safety norm but
it concerns a larger number of people at any one time although in these cases there is no
direct legal obligation to take measures in consultation with the ministry of infrastructure
and the environment we have decided to take measures anyway since with relatively little
effort we can reduce risk for a larger group of people


pipeline incidents
to guarantee safe and reliable gas transport our infrastructure should not be disturbed
we therefore strive to make sure that no natural gas is released as a result of damage to our
pipelines excavation works are the main cause of damage to our underground pipeline
network


in 2013 we reported six incidents of pipeline damage caused by mechanical excavation in
none of these cases did any gas leak into the air in 2012 there were ﬁve such incidents one
of which involved a gas leak in addition due to a structural defect there was one incident
of pipeline damage with a very minor gas leak there were no incidents of pipeline damage
due to excavation at gasunie in germany in 2013 2012 1

     our results compared with others european benchmark for pipeline incidents egig
     as all european gas transport companies record their pipeline incidents in the same way
     we can easily compare our performance in this part of the gas transport chain with that
     of other companies with regard to pipeline incidents with gas leaks we score better than
     the european average source database of the european gas pipeline incident data group

     safety opportunities for improvement
     we go to great lengths to make sure that our safety performance is excellent however in
     some respects there is still room for improvement


     investigation of pipeline incidents
     in 2013 several incidents took place in which our pipelines were damaged during excavation
     works a remarkably high number of these incidents occurred during activities which we
     had commissioned and even supervised ourselves this was despite the fact that we have
     invested considerably in providing supervision and specifying procedures precisely with the
     aim of reducing the chances of damage to our pipelines as much as possible


     we take such matters very seriously and are keen to learn from these mistakes and take
     measures to prevent a recurrence we therefore analysed the relevant incidents in detail
     including interviewing those involved the investigation showed that the fault did not lie
     with a lack of appropriate procedures or tools but rather that for various reasons they were
     not always fully followed or used we have therefore added two additional managers to our
     own team of supervisors extra attention will be paid to following a uniform way of working
     in accordance with the agreed procedures this will be monitored closely

                                                                                                   47


increasing safety regarding integrity of purchased materials
over the past few years as a result of incidents involving materials such as pipe tees
line pipes and reducing tees we have conducted several investigations into the supply of
materials that do not conform to the speciﬁcations in our orders from our own internal
research and external research by the sector it appears that statements made by suppliers
regarding the composition and requirements of the products delivered cannot always be
relied upon to be accurate even if the suppliers are being supervised by an independent
inspectorate this does not necessarily mean that the materials deviate from the order to
such an extent that they pose a threat to process safety but it is certainly true that they are
more likely to do so if the properties of the materials are not as ordered moreover if the
discrepancy is discovered just before the materials are needed the project may be delayed if
the materials require further inspection and no other demonstrably correct materials are
available


we have therefore reviewed our materials purchasing policy to increase the reliability of
the delivered materials  and thus reducing process safety risks as well as project risks  we
are modifying our purchasing strategy and the supervision of the delivered materials part
of the new policy will be for us to buy materials under the supervision of an independent
inspectorate we will also check the qualiﬁcations of our suppliers by scrutinising their
technical skills their organisation and their quality management these qualiﬁcations
will need to be renewed periodically in the meantime we will check the reliability of our
suppliers by carrying out spot checks since this process is very timeconsuming we will
look for suppliers with whom we can build up longterm relationships


the qualiﬁcations process will be carried out at the beginning of 2014 we will focus on
suppliers who are important to our multiyear replacement programme


supply chain management
the world is facing some major challenges in the ﬁeld of energy global demand is
increasing while the emission of greenhouse gases such as co2 is giving rise to climate
change a transition towards a more sustainable energy supply is therefore necessary as part
of the gas value chain we are keen to contribute to this transition we currently do this in
various ways for example by developing sustainable business activities dealing responsibly
with the environment and reducing our own carbon footprint in our policies we also
support the dutch governments objectives 20 less co2 in 2020 compared to 1990 annual
energy savings of 2 and 14 sustainable energy generation in 2020


gas value chain
as a natural gas transport company we play an important role in the gas value chain
which stretches from production to user applications it is a chain that links together gas
producers suppliers shippers national and international network operators gas transport
companies industries and power stations connected directly to the national grid as well as
endusers and domestic households

48


     cooperation within the chain
     in this continuously changing market and society cooperation within the chain is crucial
     we participate in both horizontal and vertical cooperation we take part in a wide variety
     of relevant international national regional and local partnerships they focus on many
     different aspects of the gas value chain such as the exchange of knowledge and best
     practices the development of clean and efﬁcient energy applications and the development
     of the green gas market in the netherlands


     we also take part in a number of national and european working parties including the cen
     and iso standardisation committees aimed at establishing standards and norms for gas
     transport management systems a good example of cooperation in this ﬁeld is the pipeline
     integrity management system pims which we developed inhouse this is a tool for
     determining and managing pipeline integrity we have signed cooperation agreements with
     many other gas transport companies which has resulted in various of these parties also
     implementing pims


     we also participate in several vertical collaborations in the ﬁeld of energy such as gas
     infrastructure europe gie entsog marcogaz energy delta institute edi and energy
     valley


     green gas
     we are dedicated to promoting green gas as an efﬁcient and sustainable energy option it
     is the dutch governments target to have ﬁve billion m3 488 billion kwh of green gas being
     used in the country by 2030 gasunie is eager to contribute to the development of the green
     gas market in the netherlands we are active in the feedin of green gas and its certiﬁcation
     the netherlands strong infrastructure will provide a solid foundation for this and enable us
     to take the next step towards a more sustainable energy supply


     biogas from fermentation and gasiﬁcation has a huge production potential for the future
     as production increases we shall see green gas hubs being built  centralised facilities to
     which biogas producers are connected in these facilities biogas will be upgraded to natural
     gas quality and will then be transported through our gas transport network and regional
     networks and delivered to industrial and domestic users as green gas


     investing in a market that is not yet welldeveloped naturally involves risks however we
     are keen to promote the development of a greengas market and have therefore been
     working with others to develop ways in which green gas can be safely fed into our network
     the market has shown a great deal of interest in feeding gas into our national transport
     network also via green gas hubs here too we play a facilitating role for instance by
     participating in the green gas taskforce

                                                                                                    49


vertogas
vertogas one of our subsidiaries is an autonomous and independent company that
facilitates the trade in green gas through its certiﬁcation system vertogas certiﬁcates state
the origin of the green gas and the types of biomass used in its production this provides
greengas traders and customers with a guarantee that they are dealing with genuine green
gas a recognised green gas certiﬁcation system is essential for the further development
of the greengas market the dutch gas act 2013 recognises vertogas as a certiﬁcation
authority for green gas this legal status will take effect in 2014


greengas cars
cars that run on green gas release less co2 and ﬁne particles than cars that run on other
fuels in 2012 as a part of our footprint reduction policy we started to greenify our ﬂeet of
vehicles we initiated a pilot project with 21 company vehicles used by staff to maintain our
gas transport network in due course we aim to have our whole ﬂeet of 284 vehicles running
on green gas reports so far are positive we also give employees who are eligible for a lease
car the opportunity to choose a lease car that runs on green gas in 2013 several employees
already availed themselves of this opportunity


environmental performance
minimising our impact on the environment
some of our business activities  activities characteristic of the gas industry  have an
impact on the environment these include the laying of pipelines the construction of gas
installations the pressurising transporting and blending of natural gas metering and
regulating gas ﬂows reducing gas pressure and maintaining installations such activities
require energy and that brings with it the occurrence of emissions in addition substances
we use to ensure the safe functioning of gas transport installations such as glycol and
lubricating oil also affect the environment as do the activities in our ofﬁces albeit a
limited one


we do everything in our power to keep harmful emissions to soil water and air to a
minimum and we have a drawn up a policy with concrete environmental objectives that is
designed to help us achieve this


certiﬁed environmental care
to guarantee that we take the environment well into account in relevant business processes
we have an environmental management system ems that is certiﬁed to the iso 14001
standard to ensure compliance with this standard our management system is checked
annually by an external auditing agency

     co2 emissions
     it is our ambition to take a leading role in reducing co2 emissions in cooperation with a
     number of other companies we aim to have in place co2 neutral energy provision by 2050
     in order to fulﬁl this ambition we have set out a strategy with an interim milestone this
     milestone is a 40 reduction of co2 equivalents3 by 2030 this is in line with related develop
     ments in europe we can achieve this reduction across the whole scope of the green house
     gas protocol ghg protocol as explained below we will continue to observe the reduction
     target that we had already set for 2020


     in an absolute sense our target entails a reduction of 124 kilotonnes of co2 equivalents last
     year we adjusted this target upwards compared to previous years from 93 to 124 kilotonnes
     this is due to new insights into the calculation of the base year a number of emission
     sources were not included in the original calculation because they were not yet known at
     the time but over the past few years we have gained more and also better information
     about emissions this is why we decided to adjust the total amount of co2 equivalents for
     the base year 1990 from 478 kilotonnes of co2 to 618 kilotonnes


     in the future emissions of greenhouse gases co2 equivalents could play a fundamental role in
     governments decisionmaking in the ﬁeld of energy that is why we need to develop an unambiguous
     and transparent way of reporting within our sector so that the right choices can be made in antici
     pation of this development we report about our co2 emissions as transparently as possible
     ronald kenter quality  environment coordinator at gasunie



     the emissions that we now understand better are fugitive emissions such as small leaks
     of natural gas at connections or appendages they are found at gas receiving stations
     metering and regulating stations and valve stations
     as of 2013 we have been reporting in accordance with the standard of the greenhouse gas
     protocol ghg protocol this protocol for greenhouse gases distinguishes three scopes
     ranked according to the origin of the greenhouse gas these scopes are


     scope 1
     scope 1 includes all emissions that are a direct result of our own activities eg the
     co2 emissions of gasﬁred compressors and engines used for compression our own
     gas consumption for heating buildings and for the boilers at gas receiving stations
     scope 1 also includes the co2 equivalents from methane emissions and the emission of
     hydroﬂuorocarbons hfcs which are used in cooling processes


     scope 2
     scope 2 includes the indirect emissions of energy that has been procured eg from an
     electricity company in our case the co2 equivalents in scope 2 come mainly from the use of
     electricity for electrical compressors and for the production of nitrogen scope 2 also includes
     the electricity consumed in our ofﬁces and our installation buildings


     scope 3
     scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions resulting from our business operations eg
     road air and rail travel and energy required for producing the nitrogen we procure
     in 2013 a number of network operators in the netherlands developed a new model for
     3 using global warming potential gwp co2 and ch4 emissions can be converted into a measure of the enhanced greenhouse effect

       the co2 equivalent emissions the gwp for co2 is set to 1 and the gwp for ch4 to 25

                                                                                                                                                 51


reporting co2 emissions on the basis of the green house gas protocol we are applying this
model as of the year under review since the model is not entirely the same as the model of
previous years our current report only includes the totals of scopes 1 2 and 3 when referring
to years prior to 2013


                                                                               co2 equivalents in kilotonnes

3 tot  total



the total co2equivalent emissions in 2013 were higher than in 2012 this increase is mainly
due to the fact that since last year we have come to understand our co2 emissions better
as explained above as of 2013 we have therefore adjusted our co2 emissions upwards by
approximately 90 kilotonnes this adjustment does not apply to the years prior to 2013


co2 equivalents due to natural gas consumption rose by approximately 36 kilotonnes of
this quantity about half was due to the deployment of a ﬂare on the lng terminal at the
maasvlakte location co2 equivalents due to electricity consumption rose by 29 kilotonnes
due to the deployment of additional electric compressors

     methane emissions in 2013 were higher than in previous years this increase is also due to
     the fact that we are now able to measure fugitive emissions of natural gas more accurately
     fugitive emissions at gas receiving stations metering and regulating stations and valve
     stations are measured on the basis of limited random checks at all stations we measure all
     gas receiving stations separately so far we have mapped the emissions of 40 out of the 1150
     stations in 2013 we also recalculated the emissions of the compressor stations


     in germany methane emissions rose compared to 2012 this is because at two installations
     heidenau and folmhusen a number of tests had to be carried out for the purposes of
     commissioning activities during these tests the pressure had to be reduced


     methane emissions not only occur in the form of fugitive emissions but are also due to gas
     venting during maintenance work venting is needed to enable work to be carried out safely
     of course we try to prevent these emissions as much as possible see below recompression
     for work on pipelines methane is also released when the compressors are started and stopped
     and during the use of measuring equipment


     footprint reduction
     in 2013 we continued to investigate ways of reducing our footprint and carried out
     various projects for this purpose including an elaborate leak detection and repair ldar
     programme which we carried out at our large compressor stations and the lng maasvlakte
     location for this we measured 22 locations and assessed a total of 421000 potential sources
     of leaks gasunie deutschland also carried out many inspections in the context of our ldar
     programme on the basis of these details we will be able to take appropriate measures to
     reduce the number of identiﬁed leaks


     measuring methods
     there are several common ways of estimating fugitive emissions of natural gas such as
     bagging epa21 and the marcogaz method however these different methods yield different
     results we measured our fugitive emissions by using the epa21 method in 2014 we will
     compare the different measuring methods to obtain more certainty about the accuracy of
     this method in 2014 we will also carry out more emission measurements at stations and
     take further measures to reduce natural gas emissions

                                                                                                                                       53


recompression for work on pipelines
we try to avoid venting gas during pipeline activities as much as possible however it
is sometimes necessary to vent the gas so that work on the natural gas pipelines can be
carried out safely for some years we have been using a recompression unit with which
we recompress as much as possible of the gas that would otherwise have had to be vented
and transfer it to another pipeline this reduces the amount of gas vented in 2013 we
recompressed almost 23 million m³n of natural gas which is equal to 33 kilotonnes of co2
equivalents


use of the mobile recompressor is rather costly a minimum of some  20000 each time the
more gas that is recompressed during operations the more costefﬁcient this recompression
becomes in 2013 we estimate to have saved nearly half a million euros on natural gas costs
by deploying the mobile recompressor


we apply various techniques to empty our pipelines of gas the table below gives an
overview of the volumes of natural gas that have been released using these techniques

in 2013 more gas was vented than in 2012 the main cause for this was that during the
dismantling of an unexploded bomb dropped during wwii we had to vent natural gas in
one of the pipeline segments for safety reasons this released approximately 245000 m3
of natural gas in addition we had to vent a pipeline segment when we were installing
new equipment at the compressor station in ommen the netherlands this released
approximately 240000 m3 of natural gas


waste
the very diverse activities we carry out result in waste in the light of safety considerations
environmental regulations the need for good environmental care and maintaining good
cost control we naturally want to dispose of this waste responsibly we comply with the
regulations laid down in the environmental management act and the various environmental
permits that we obtain for our activities


as part of our legal and social responsibility with regard to waste we apply lansinks
ladder lansinks ladder states the priority with which waste should be managed
prevention reuse recycling incineration and landﬁll

     1 there are various reasons for the rise in the volume of hazardous waste in the netherlands in 2013 some condensation tanks

      underwent periodical cleaning during which polluted water was released in addition pipeline segments were cleaned using

      blasting grit which is processed as a hazardous substance in projects and other operations soil and rubble was released that was

      contaminated with asbestos

     2 an extra quantity of nonhazardous waste was released in 2012 due to the large number of projects carried out in that year

     3 due to the sharp drop in nonhazardous waste at gasunie deutschland the percentage of hazardous waste in the total amount of

       waste rose although the quantity of hazardous waste itself did not nonhazardous waste 758 was reused in germany as much

       as possible hazardous waste 242 was burned completely


     in 2013 we disposed of a total of 203 kilotonnes of waste which was less than in 2012 this
     reduction was due to fewer large projects being conducted in 2013


     the everdiminishing availability of raw materials makes it increasingly attractive to use
     waste as semiﬁnished products this makes waste valuable  although it also means that
     requirements regarding the separation of waste at source will be stricter than before at our
     locations waste such as chemicals oils fats and detergents are collected separately and
     then taken by accredited waste collection agencies to approved waste processing plants


     approximately 9 of the waste collected comprises metal almost 95 of this metal waste
     was reused in 2013 metal waste is generated mainly during large projects and operations at
     our installations
     we try to keep waste incineration to a minimum waste separation methods that enable
     reuse are continually improving as a result of this a downward trend is noticeable in the
     quantity of waste incinerated in the netherlands in germany nonhazardous waste is
     reused as far as possible while hazardous waste is incinerated


     we prefer to have the waste resulting from our operations in the netherlands processed in
     the country itself to prevent unnecessary transport if it has to be processed elsewhere we
     make it clear that the use of child labour in processing the waste is totally unacceptable

                                                                                                                                   55


our own energy usage
natural gas
for the transport of natural gas we make use of gas turbines and gas motors many of these
run on natural gas we also use natural gas to heat gas at gas receiving stations because gas
cools off when pressure is reduced finally we use natural gas for heating our ofﬁces and
utility buildings


the amount of natural gas we transport and the fuel we use for compression depends
among other things on the weather and the demand for natural gas in 2013 as a result of
the prolonged winter we used 1687 million m3 of natural gas a small increase compared to
the previous year

 energy consumption in gud was higher in 2010 compared to 2009 because gas consumption at head oﬃce was included in the total

 for the ﬁrst time



electricity
we use electricity for the production of nitrogen at the installations in ommen and koot
stertille for the compression of natural gas in grijpskerk anna paulowna scheemda and
wijngaarden for liquefying natural gas at the lng installation on the maasvlakte for the
compression that is required for storing natural gas in salt caverns zuidwending and for
our ofﬁces and utility buildings


our electricity consumption in 2013 was as follows
electricity consumption                                           2009          2010         2011          2012          2013

in 2013 less electricity was needed for the production of nitrogen at ommen and
kootstertille nevertheless electricity consumption in 2013 increased compared to the
previous year there are several reasons for this since 2006 as a result of putting the
new electric compressors into operation at the locations in grijpskerk anna paulowna
scheemda wijngaarden and zuidwending electricity consumption for the purpose of
compression has increased in 2013 the compressors in wijngaarden and anna paulowna in
particular were deployed more often because of the long winter together the installations
at scheemda zuidwending anna paulowna and wijngaarden used approximately 85 of the
total volume of electricity in addition the lng tank at the maasvlakte site was reﬁlled


water consumption
we mainly use water for the cooling process in our lng installation at the maasvlakte site
for cleaning purposes and sanitary facilities in 2013 we used approximately 87 million m3
of surface water and 46541 m3 of mains water the consumption of surface water for cooling
in the production of lng in 2013 was signiﬁcantly higher than in 2012 because the lng
installation was deployed more often for liquefying natural gas in 2013 the mains water
consumption at gasunie deutschland was 1791 m3

in 2013 we took on 48 new
employees aiming for an
even spread across age
groups

developments in the labour market

 over the past few years our organisation has changed from a dutch into a european
 infrastructure company we operate in a dynamic and competitive environment in which
 the transition towards a more sustainable energy supply plays a key role this development
 requires new skills and knowledge eg in the ﬁeld of mergers and acquisitions
 underground gas storage activities and sustainability the labour market is also subject to
 change globally we can distinguish three trends that are particularly signiﬁcant for us
  despite the high level of unemployment in the netherlands we are still seeing a shortage
       in the labour market of technically trained people
  in addition the retirement age is gradually moving over a number of years from 60 to 67
       this means that our employees and the structure of our organisation will need to meet
       new requirements
  as an organisation we want to be able to respond alertly and quickly to current
       developments in the energy sector and to interesting business opportunities
 these developments require an hr policy that focuses on the sustainable employability of
 employees we will explain this in more detail in the section on organisational development


 proﬁle of our employees
 compared to 2012 the size of our workforce rose from 1701 to 1731 employees in 2013 274
 work at gasunie deutschland and 1457 at gasunie nederland the malefemale ratio in the
 netherlands is 85 men and 15 women at gasunie deutschland the ratio is 81 men and
 19 women the average age in our company fell slightly to 465 2012 471

     resourcing
     in 2013 gasunie nederland took on 48 employees we aim for an even spread across the age
     groups in our workforce since we have a relatively large number of older employees our
     current preference is to ﬁll external vacancies with younger employees


     from the point of view of recruitment and selection employees in the ﬁelds of it finance
     technology and legal affairs are particularly important for us in our labour market
     communication policy we therefore focus on graduates in these target groups in particular
     those with a technical degree besides using our own company website and job sites we do
     this in various ways for instance we make our building available to student associations
     use social media and are present at graduate recruitment fairs because in some ﬁelds there
     is a real shortage of technicians with upper secondary vocational education we developed
     a facebook page for this target group in 2013 in addition we give guest lectures at regional
     training centres we also offer potential employees an opportunity to get to know our
     company as interns or trainees in 2013 we had 58 trainee posts and student traineeships in
     2013 5 trainees took part in our formal trainee programme


     as part of our commitment to make the organisation even more efﬁcient we looked at
     the ratio between permanent staff and secondees in 2013 from now on departments
     who used to employ secondees on a longterm basis will be required to employ permanent
     staff instead we checked whether these positions were crucial and whether the required
     knowledge and expertise are difﬁcult to ﬁnd in the labour market this has led to an increase
     in the number of permanent employees in our it department for instance

                                                                                                  59


organisational development
sustainable employability
our employees will have to carry on working until at least the age of 65 this means that
sustainable employability has become even more important by sustainable employability
we mean the extent to which our employees are willing and able to continue to work in
a productive motivated and healthy way either within or outside our organisation we
therefore stimulate internal and external mobility partly because employees who change
jobs regularly will ﬁnd it easier to adapt to changing circumstances at a later age it is also
important to us as employers that employees together with their managers continuously
look for ways in which gasunie can make the most of their talents other key aspects of
our sustainable employability policy that we will continue to work on in the coming years
include the following


 training and development
   we believe in the concept of lifelong learning we think it is important for our
   employees to be able to develop and pursue personal growth during their careers as
   this helps to improve sustainable employability we offer our employees the opportunity
   to follow speciﬁc courses and training programmes given the fact that the educational
   level of our employees is very diverse we offer additional training programmes for
   various target groups we also offer many individual tailormade programmes in 2013
   we spent  2343000 on courses and training programmes per employeeyear  1653


 competence management
   in our hr policy we focus on the knowledge and skills that our organisation needs
   in order to achieve its objectives we apply this competence management in the
   assessment of our managers and in the process of assessment and recruitment in this
   we increasingly use the 360 feedback method this means that we collect input from
   various people from the employees work environment furthermore when we appoint
   managers we focus more strongly on competences such as developing other peoples
   qualities and coaching leadership in the past as a mainly technical company we
   traditionally placed most emphasis on technical knowledge


 management development
   over the past few years we have invested a great deal in management development
   partly through the internal training programmes gu 2012 and the gasunie leadership
   programme glp we are convinced that the development of an organisation starts with
   the development of its management after completing the glp participants indicated
   that they felt gasunie can be managed more professionally and dynamically but that this
   requires good organisation and constant attention we are now working on a followup
   programme to address this point

     performance and career development
     we believe that our employees are responsible for their own career it is the task of the
     management to ensure that the development of employees is not only relevant to their
     current position but to their entire career this will enhance their sustainable employability
     we have an annual performance cycle during which we monitor and assess the performance
     and development of our employees the cycle starts by drawing up working objectives
     halfway through the cycle a performance review takes place in which employee and
     manager evaluate the extent to which the objectives have been achieved during this
     performance review meeting the aspirations and required development of the employee
     will also be discussed in the annual personnel review these are then considered in relation
     to the growth opportunities that the manager sees for the employee the annual appraisal
      when the employees performance is assessed with regard to focus on results knowledge
     and skills  forms the end of the cycle


     terms of employment
     some of our employees are covered by a collective labour agreement drawn up on the
     basis consultations with the trade unions others are not covered by the collective labour
     agreement see also opting out of the collective labour agreement both groups however are
     eligible for an annual individual pay rise of between 0 and 5 up to the maximum pay
     level in addition a collective pay rise may be agreed on following a collective bargaining
     agreement


     as of 1 july 2013 we granted a structural collective pay rise for all employees in the
     netherlands regardless of whether they are covered by the collective agreement or not
     we decided that this should take the form of an equal amount  1000 for everyone this
     is because the relative pay levels in the company had become somewhat skewed over the
     years in cooperation with the trade unions and the works council we have initiated a joint
     inquiry into the possibility of setting up a new more balanced reward structure in which
     transparency ﬂexibility and alignment with the market are key


     gasunie deutschland applies the collective labour agreement agreed on by weg the
     german association of german oil  gas producers and igbce the trade union that makes
     salary agreements for the gas transport sector this agreement covers 165 employees the
     84 employees in higher positions are covered by an agreement reached by gasunie in the
     netherlands and gasunie deutschland the management team participates in the gasunies
     companywide target system

                                                                                                     61


pension
in 2013 we reached agreement with our employees on a new pension scheme one of
the main considerations was that it should be in line with the market as of 1 july 2013
the ﬁnalsalary scheme was replaced by an averagesalary scheme collective deﬁned
contribution scheme the company pays a deﬁned contribution ie a premium agreed
in advance based on a conditional average salary the scheme aims to achieve an annual
accrual of 2 of the pension base


gasunie deutschland has also introduced a new and competitive collective deﬁned
contribution pension scheme for everyone who joined the company in or after 2012


flexible terms of employment
as one of gasunies terms of employment employees receive an annual ﬂexibility budget
employees can use this budget in a number of different ways at their own discretion for
instance they can use it to buy spare time or receive it as a cash payment


equal pay for men and women
men and women doing the same job receive the same pay but the average salary of women
in our company is 87  lower than the average salary of men on average women working
fulltime earn  52641 men  57678 this difference is due to the fact that relatively more
men have reached their maximum salary because they have been employed for longer the
maximum salaries within the various function groups are of course the same for both men
and women


opting out of the collective labour agreement
of the total workforce in the netherlands 1102 76 are covered by a collective labour
agreement since 2008 we have offered those of our employees with at least higher
secondary vocational education an opportunity to opt out of this agreement this allows
them to make ﬂexible agreements on working hours they are also eligible for a bonus if they
reach agreed targets in this way we seek to encourage managing on results rather than
managing on presence


performancebased pay
our employees pay depends partly on whether collective andor individual targets are met
we set targets for those activities that are crucial in helping us implement our strategy such
as safety ﬁnance security of supply and corporate social responsibility for those employees
who are not covered by the collective labour agreement the collective targets are converted
into individual targets if all targets are achieved in full a bonus of  500 gross is paid if
some but not all targets have been reached the bonus is paid pro rata


in 2013 not all collective targets were met based on the performance achieved employees
covered by the collective agreement and those in a young development pay scale were paid
a bonus of  167 the bonus was paid to parttime employees pro rata

     and pipeline incidents is being adjusted for operating result ebitda will be replaced by
     roic return on invested capital the csr target will focus on reducing co2 emissions


     diversity and equal opportunities
     we aim for diversity throughout our organisation seeking to create a culture in which
     everyone is occupied in ways that make the most of their talents and strengths  regardless
     of say their gender or ethnic origin talents can ﬂourish better if we create more diversity
     in our organisation that is why for a number of years we have been working with inﬂow
     targets to attract more women and employees who are distanced from the labour market
     the targets relating to the number of women vary depending on the current numbers of
     male and female students graduating from degree programmes that are relevant to our
     business in addition we have joined various external initiatives for raising awareness in the
     ﬁeld of diversity together with others we try to combat prejudice in special programmes
     eg talent to the top and professional board forum during internal workshops through
     coaching and in our labour market communications we also look at each vacancy to see if
     there are opportunities for employing disabled young people


     health and wellbeing
     we aim for the lowest possible level of absence due to sickness in 2013 absence due to
     sickness at gasunie in the netherlands was 31 2012 33 in germany the rate was 35

in 2013 our zero absence rate was 43 ie 43 of our employees did not report sick during
2013 in 2012 that rate was 444 the dutch national average is 30


workrelated sickness absence
when our employees report sick they can state whether their absence is related to their
work in 2013 employees indicated nine times that their sickness was related to work in
2012 14 in 2013 as in 2012 one report was made to the netherlands centre for occupational
disease ncb


employee survey
once every two years we conduct an employee survey one of the topics into which we seek
to gain more insight through the survey is how our employees cope with pressure of work
the outcomes of the survey are discussed with each department and if there is reason to do
so the employees and manager of each department jointly look for opportunities to improve
the situation


code of conduct
we have drawn up a code of conduct which describes what we expect of our employees
with respect to acting with integrity the code includes rules for treating colleagues with
respect ethical issues bribery and corruption using alcohol and drugs dealing with
commercially sensitive information the use of social media and making calls while driving
if the code of conduct is violated we take appropriate steps in 2013 we found no incidents
of bribery or corruption other types of violation of the code in 2013 were addressed and
appropriate measures were taken by the management


employee participation
elections to the works council took place at the beginning of the year and the new council
ofﬁcially started on 1 april 2013 the works council reports as follows about the year under
review
the works council is committed to putting modern employee participation into practice
that is why we ensure that we are involved as a partner in any changes at an early stage
in addition we urge management and relevant employees to plan such changes jointly
in mutual consultation this will stimulate employee participation with responsibilities
placed low in the organisation and managed on the basis of coaching leadership


in a number of cases the involvement of the works council has led to proposals being
changed in the case of parts of two requests for advice the council recommended that
they not be implemented as a result the relevant decision was postponed which meant
there was time not only for further research but also for dialogue between management and
employees we expect this to result in better proposals that enjoy broader support


with regard to the appointment of the new ceo the council discussed the proﬁle with
the chairman of the supervisory board it did not prove feasible on this occasion to involve
the works council in the selection of candidates however the works council had an
opportunity to speak with the preferred candidate before making its recommendation in
the coming year the council the management and the trade unions will discuss together
how and to what extent managements wish to establish a new pay structure or system can
be met

gasunie in society
relationship with stakeholders

 having a good relationship with our environment is very important for our licence
 to operate we maintain strong ties with a large number of stakeholders such as the
 shareholder representatives of national regional and local politics authorities regulatory
 bodies employees the works council our customers suppliers the local community the
 media and nature conservation and environmental organisations we are committed to
 striking the right balance between the interests of everyone involved


 structural stakeholder dialogue
 internal
 good communication within a company leads to better cooperation and increases the
 involvement of employees at all levels of the company this is not just a matter of efﬁciently
 providing information dialogue among employees also improves the working process
 and mutual cooperation that is why this has become a key objective in our internal
 communication policy


 our intranet methanet plays a central role in our internal communications in 2013 we
 signiﬁcantly expanded the functionalities of methanet it has become more personal and
 more interactive people can now comment on messages and respond to each others
 questions and remarks employees can create their own proﬁle in which they say something
 about their work this makes it clear to others who to turn to for speciﬁc matters employees
 can also create and manage special interest groups forums which can be used to share
 knowledge and discuss relevant topics


 we regularly organise employee meetings that focus on the exchange of information on
 a wide variety of topics besides meetings for people from all over the company we also
 hold more speciﬁc meetings for departments business units or managers in addition we
 organise themed sessions for which employees can sign up at the end of 2013 for instance
 we held a number of pizza sessions about the core values of our company we ﬁnd the
 feedback we receive from such meetings very valuable


 external
 we often have a shared interest with external stakeholders even though we may sometimes
 have a different perspective we always try to ﬁnd constructive ways to keep in touch
 with our stakeholders and to this end we create various platforms and opportunities for
 discussion


 good relationships with local residents
 we consider it very important to maintain good relationships with the people who live near
 our locations pipelines and installations we own and manage one of the most elaborate
 and densely packed gas transport networks in the world over 15500 kilometres of pipelines
 lie under the ground in the netherlands and germany in one of the most densely populated
 areas in the world this means that we have many neighbours and we want to treat them
 all with respect our reputation for doing so built up over the years is good  and we would

66


     like to keep it that way that is why as far as possible we involve the people who live close to
     our operations in our plans we create opportunities for dialogue such as information and
     discussion evenings and open days we attach great value to the feedback we receive from
     our stakeholders during these consultation sessions


     laying a new gas pipeline is a major operation that can give rise to a lot of unrest
     in the immediate vicinity thanks to the short lines of communication between
     gasunie and our municipality we experienced the pipeline construction as a
     bestpractice project preparations were good execution was quick and there was
     proactive communication between all parties involved

     supply chain partners
     we also maintain close relationships with our customers shippers and companies directly
     connected to our network through regular annual meetings for these groups in 2013 gts
     again organised shipper meetings and industry days these serve as information meetings
     and networking platforms for the stakeholders involved during these meetings we
     exchange ideas with customers about developments in the gas market and within gts


     governments and authorities
     various parts of our company maintain regular contacts with authorities at many different
     levels on the one hand laws regulations policies and other government decisions have
     a large impact on our activities on the other hand due to our role in the provision of
     energy we form an important discussion partner for the government we want to be a
     serious constructive partner for governmental authorities our activities mean that we
     frequently need to consult with local and other authorities eg on legislation regulations
     and licences and we are often also involved in consultations at the political level in
     particular through our ofﬁces in the hague berlin brussels and moscow on the one hand
     our local presence there helps to foster good longterm relationships with governmental
     stakeholders and on the other hand it is easier for the authorities to use our local
     representatives who have a great deal of specialist knowledge as a single point of contact
     for their questions on gas and gas transport


     social organisations
     crossborder or crosssector policy issues are usually discussed through industry
     organisations for this reason we are members of a number of such organisations such
     as netbeheer nederland the european network for transmission system operators gas
     entsog and gas infrastructure europe gie we are also represented on the board of many
     of these organisations


     stakeholder feedback
     customer satisfaction survey
     through an annual customer satisfaction survey carried out in the netherlands by gts we
     ask our customers for their opinion on various aspects of our services customers gave gts
     a score of 72 out of 10 for its services during 2013 the same score as in 2012 for certain
     aspects of our services eg customer service through our new website and our customer
     desk our scores in 2013 were higher than the year before however customers felt that
     some areas eg following up on appointments and the search function on our website
     could be improved

                                                                                                   67


new platforms
we wish to play an active role in the energy debate so that we can exchange ideas on
important themes we are therefore proactively seeking contact with relevant stakeholders
to an increasing extent these are parties who are involved in the provision of energy from a
social point of view eg ngos and lobby groups or on the grounds of their profession eg
architects or scientists as a result we are increasingly present on new platforms in 2013
for instance we became an active participant in the annual sustainability festival springtij
on the island of terschelling


handling complaints
in carrying out our operations we take our surroundings into account as much as possible
any complaints we receive  by telephone email or otherwise  are directed in the ﬁrst
instance to our corporate communications department who then deal with them in
consultation with the relevant department we aim to respond as quickly as possible and to
the satisfaction of all parties concerned customers of gts can address their complaints to
the gts customer desk


strategic environs management
we frequently need to carry out works at new and existing locations since we are
committed to maintaining a good relationship with our neighbours prior to embarking on
new projects we carry out an analysis of the surrounding area and contact stakeholders
at the earliest possible stage in 2013 as part of our csr policy we started developing
a gasuniewide approach for environs management in doing so we also look at what
has been achieved with strategic environs management sem an approach that has
successfully been used by large organisations such as the port of rotterdam we also started
pilots with social media to ﬁnd out for example how we can use facebook and twitter
our new website gasuniebouwtnl plays a central role in this the ﬁrst results are very
promising


strategic environs research
in 2013 we hired a specialist agency to examine what key stakeholders think of our company
we felt that our 50th anniversary was a good time to commission a comprehensive
study to ﬁnd out how strategically relevant parties view gasunie and how they think and
expect gasunie will develop in the future more than forty stakeholders from our political
industrial policymaking and social environs participated in this study the stakeholders
said that they see an important role for gasunie in the european energy infrastructure in the
transition towards a sustainable energy supply they also showed interest in our companys
strategy and vision for the future we intend to repeat this study in a few years time so that
we can measure how we are developing in relation to our surroundings

     stakeholder dilemmas
     in our work we are continuously balancing the interests of different stakeholders we
     only expand our network if our customers ask us to do so our primary aim is to guarantee
     security of supply similarly we carry out maintenance work on our pipelines and
     installations the activities that follow from this can sometimes cause a public nuisance
     this results in dilemmas that each time require a good balancing of interests and good
     dialogue with the people who are directly involved


     pipeline route bergambacht alternative location
     in order to ensure stability in the supply of gas in the netherlands we wanted to lay a
     pipeline through the village of bergambacht the plot of land through which we had planned
     to lay this pipeline was zoned for agricultural use this meant there would be nothing to
     prevent the pipeline being laid through it however during discussions with the local
     council it turned out that in due course the council intended to build a small residential
     area at this location the council had included this residential area in its municipal planning
     document but had not yet drawn up a zoning plan for the intended location the council
     then proposed an alternative route for the pipeline we considered this carefully and decided
     to adopt it as our preferred option these adjustments lengthened the preparatory phase
     but the pipeline is now located such that it does not thwart the councils plans


     new general terms and conditions for laying pipelines
     in 2010 the existing system of building leases with rent paid to the owner for the right to
     lay pipelines through his land eg agricultural land was revised at that time gasunie and
     the dutch agriculture and horticulture organisation lto agreed to also revise the general
     terms and conditions for laying pipelines lto represented some 50000 agricultural
     entrepreneurs we have a relatively large number of pipelines in agricultural land which
     is why lto is an important stakeholder for us we have an interest in reaching a good
     objective arrangement that as far as possible does justice to the interests of all involved
     and can as such be applied by everyone concerned lto has an interest in an arrangement
     which also takes account of the interests of its members


     during the negotiations we turned out to have different expectations and interests
     with regard to possible legal developments regarding annual rent at ﬁrst our points of
     view seemed irreconcilable but eventually the two sides focused on improvements and
     adjustments separate from any annual rent this helped us to arrive at a transparent
     arrangement that works for everyone involved we agreed to meet again whenever changes
     in legislation make it necessary

                                                                                                     69


social commitment
 we make a positive contribution to society in carrying out our statutory duty as a gas
 infrastructure company however we wish to do more for society and we are doing so in
 various ways such as described in the examples below


 cooperation in the ﬁeld of archaeology
 sometimes our activities take place in areas where archaeological ﬁndings have been made
 or are expected to be made in such cases we cooperate with archaeological consultancy
 raap to ﬁrst search the area for the presence of any archaeological remains


 sponsoring and donations
 we sponsor activities and events and make donations in regions where we are directly
 active particularly to support cultural events and youth sports activities we also organise
 lectures on csr and other subjects at secondary schools and universities we frequently give
 free access to our head ofﬁce and our catering facilities to student associations and other
 relevant organisations we also sponsor student events by providing free use of equipment
 and furniture for holding conferences in 2013 we spent  230880 on sponsoring and
 donations


 in germany we sponsor behinderten sportverband niedersachsen a sports association for
 people with disabilities we are also sponsor of the regional paralympics for disabled
 children in niedersachsen


 employee initiatives
 gasunie greatly values and supports employees social activities many of our employees do
 volunteer work for sports clubs support cultural projects participate in local politics or are
 dedicated to the application of sustainable energy and improving the quality of life in their
 community many of our employees who go to work by bike take part in the dutch national
 campaign fietsen scoort the proceeds of this campaign are used to ﬁnance sustainable
 projects in developing countries we double the amount that our employees collect for this
 good cause


 educational package for safety
 whenever we conduct major infrastructure projects such as laying a pipeline or building a
 station it inevitably involves a great deal of heavy trafﬁc our drivers have therefore been
 trained to focus on safety to raise awareness about safety among local children we have
 also compiled an educational package that we distribute to primary schools in the vicinity
 of our activities in addition we also participated in an episode of a dutch childrens tv
 programme in which we explain why we transport gas and how this can be done safely
 most of the materials are freely available on our website

70


     art
     we believe that art in our ofﬁce environment helps to create a pleasant workplace for our
     employees gasunie has a modest art collection that is displayed throughout our ofﬁces in
     the netherlands and germany each year we organise several exhibitions at our head ofﬁce
     this provides a good platform for the usually young artists in 2013 we spent  15716 on art


     bees project with wageningen university research
     in cooperation with wageningen university research wur we initiated a project for
     studying wild bees wild bees are very important to the agricultural sector but the mortality
     of bee populations in the netherlands is increasing this is partly due to the fact that their
     habitat is continuously shrinking we therefore joined forces with wur to examine whether
     with some adjustments industrial areas can be turned into suitable habitats for this type of
     bee we gladly participate in this research because we feel involved in the agricultural sector
     in the netherlands many of our pipelines are of course located under agricultural land one
     of our locations and various pipeline routes have been converted into habitats for instance
     by sowing ﬂower seed mixes and creating nesting opportunities some gasunie employees
     have been trained by an environmental scientist to collect data which are then processed
     by wur the project which was launched in 2012 will run for three years if it proves to be
     successful we will see if we can create more habitats of this type

     our employees act on the
     basis of our core values
     and risk awareness

                                                                                                     73


risk management
  we face a variety of risks  some general and others more speciﬁc stemming from the
  nature of our operations to be able to manage these various risks and where possible and
  desirable to reduce them we have drawn up a risk management policy


  within gasunie the executive board is responsible for risk management with the
  assistance of the corporate risk management department the executive board has set up
  and arranged an internal risk management and audit system the aim of this system is to
  provide a reasonable degree of certainty that
   care is taken that the companys objectives are being achieved and
   the principal risks facing the company are being properly managed


  our risk management efforts are focused on
  1 managing the risks that threaten our strategic objectives
  2 managing the risks that threaten our operational and ﬁnancial objectives
  3 guaranteeing our compliance with the law and regulations
  4 ensuring the reliability of our ﬁnancial and management reports


  a proper system of risk management and internal control will reduce the number of
  mistakes wrong decisions and unpleasant surprises due to unforeseen circumstances



policy

  our internal risk management procedures are laid down in our risk management policy and
  in the minimum requirements for management control the measures we take to manage
  risks are combined in our risk management framework this framework is designed so that
  risks can be managed both topdown and bottomup


  each year a strategic risk analysis is drawn up which the executive board submits to the
  supervisory board this risk analysis contains an overview of the risks that form a threat
  to the company achieving its strategy and objectives together with the management
  measures adopted a similar process takes place at business unit level using strategic risks
  analyses while at operational level and in the case of projects operational risk analyses and
  project risk analyses are used in these risk analyses the business unit objectives and project
  objectives respectively form the basis for identifying these threats and formulating the
  management measures


  all key processes are covered by the process descriptions laid down in the gasunie process
  house digital manual all staff are subject to our code of conduct in the context of
  the annual accounts external auditors periodically evaluate the main elements of the
  organisation and operation of the administrative system and internal audit measures
  included in it they report their ﬁndings to the executive board and the supervisory board
  once a year the executive board discusses the organisation and operation of the entire risk
  management and audit system with the audit committee

74


      adjustments in 2013
      in 2013 we formalised certain elements of the risk management framework such as the
      interrelation between risk management the business plan cycle and the strategic cycle in
      doing so we make sure we take an integrated approach one which looks at opportunities and
      threats from various angles and also forms part of the existing reporting cycle in addition we
      have included more explicitly how our operational excellence objectives relate to corporate
      process management and our objectives managing processes and operations means
      managing risks



     risk acceptance

      we are responsible for the continuity of a reliable and safe infrastructure for the transport of
      gas in the netherlands and northern germany taking risks is of course an integral part of
      doing business when working out our strategic and operational objectives we identiﬁed
      risks and appropriate measures for managing them the extent to which we accept the
      remaining risks varies per objective and risk category acceptance or rejection of these risks
      is determined on the basis of risk limits laid down in various policy documents processes
      instructions and other company documents


      the table below shows risk acceptance according to the coso erm categories risk
      management within our company is based on the enterprise risk management erm
      framework of the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway
      commission coso erm takes the companys objectives as its point of departure classifying

1st line of defense line management
line management is responsible for controlling its own processes management controls
and aoic administrative organisation and internal audit once a year they report
to the executive board on this and formal account is given by means of a document of
representation an important aspect of managing risks is to have good knowledge of the
processes particularly processes that involve several departments in 2013 many of the
processes detailed in manuals were incorporated into the gasunie digital process house
this process of incorporation will be continued in 2014


2nd line of defense risk management and compliance functions
the second line of defense consists of risk management ﬁnancial control and compliance
functions such as safety and legal for the purpose of management assurance corporate
risk management commissioned by the executive board deﬁnes the policy frameworks for
risk management and advises on risk management within gasunie in addition to providing
support and advice to line management corporate risk management carries out corporate
and strategic risk assessments at unit level each year an independent report of these
activities is presented to the executive board the audit committee and the supervisory
board


3rd line of defense operational audit
the operational audit department helps us to achieve our objectives by assessing
independently and objectively whether the organisation and operation of our management
control measures are effective and efﬁcient operational audit reports to the ceo


our employees act on the basis of our core values and risk awareness thus creating a base

incontrol statement
the executive board is aware that the risk management and audit systems no matter how

or that such systems can fully prevent material inaccuracies loss fraud or violations of the
laws and regulations


with respect to the ﬁnancial reporting risks the executive board states that the internal risk
management and audit systems provide a reasonable degree of certainty that the ﬁnancial
reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies and that the risk management and
audit systems in the year under review functioned properly

     due to its important social
     function gasunie has set
     itself ambitious objectives

                                                                                                   79


governance
report of the supervisory board

  the supervisory board of gasunie supervises and advises the executive board in formulating
  and achieving gasunies objectives strategy and policy the board also acts as the employer
  of the executive board


  supervision
  the year 2013 was a year with special dynamics as it brought a number of challenges
  one matter that needed our speciﬁc attention for instance was the composition of the
  executive board and the supervisory board in considering these matters the supervisory
  board explicitly took the social role and public tasks of gasunie as a signiﬁcant point of
  departure in this report the board explains how it conducted its supervisory tasks and
  outlines the main substantial issues that occupied the board during the year under review


  achieving the objectives
  given gasunies important social function the supervisory board believes it is important
  that the organisations objectives should focus on safe reliable sustainable and
  costefﬁcient performance the same social function also means that those objectives
  should be ambitious after all the organisation wants and needs to continuously
  improve we encourage the achievement of those objectives in part by applying variable
  remuneration based not only on ﬁnancial performance but also and in particular on safety
  security of supply and csr objectives each quarter the executive board reports to the
  supervisory board on the interim results achieved with respect to the objectives


  strategy
  each year the executive board of gasunie draws up a strategic plan that is then submitted
  to the supervisory board in this plan the strategy is analysed and where necessary
  adjusted to take account of new developments the supervisory board approves the current
  strategy and is actively involved in its implementation one of the companys strategic
  pillars  strengthening the leading position of gasunie as a crossborder gas infrastructure
  company in europe  requires not only that the strategic advantages and disadvantages are
  carefully weighed but also that the company has at its disposal a good set of instruments
  for identifying and managing risks and recognising and exploiting opportunities the ma
  guidelines which give guidelines for dealing with mergers and acquisitions were further
  tightened in 2013 and now form a good standardised framework for the coming years


  risks and risk management
  in 2013 the internal control framework was discussed with the supervisory boards audit
  committee each year gasunie draws up a strategic risk analysis sra at both group and
  unit level and operational risk analyses oras at department level the risks at these three
  levels interact with each other and are discussed at group level with the audit committee
  and the board this indepth discussion covered themes such as safety regulation
  sustainability and earthquakes together with the associated management measures the
  supervisory boards comments have been incorporated into the sra the operational audit
  department frequently tests the working of the risk management system and reports its

80


     ﬁndings to the audit committee it is the opinion of the supervisory board that the company
     is pursuing a balanced policy with respect to risks and opportunities and that the executive
     board has kept the supervisory board properly informed about it


     safety
     given the nature of gasunies operations safety is a top priority this applies not only to the
     safety of its own employees and the employees of its contractors but also most particularly
     to the safety of people living or working in the vicinity of our activities the subject of safety
     and monitoring safety performance is a permanent item on the supervisory boards agenda
     the board deeply regrets the fatal accident in november 2013 that took place during the
     laying of the new beverwijkwijngaarden route at its last meeting the board reﬂected on
     this accident at length


     financial reporting
     gasunie draws up monthly reports and reports to the board on a quarterly basis the
     reports are discussed by the audit committee in the presence of external auditors if
     necessary recommendations may be added and the reports are then approved by the audit
     committee with a mandate from the board the annual report is discussed by the whole
     supervisory board and approved it was decided to publish a single integrated annual report
     as of the year under review 2013


     during 2013 we took all the steps needed for the certiﬁcation of the dutch network
     operator gts in accordance with the requirements of acm as a part of this process the
     network assets were handed over to gts as a result of which gts as of 2014 will report as a
     comprehensive network operator in 2014 the supervisory board will attend a workshop on
     regulation with the purpose of obtaining a clearer understanding of the differences between
     ifrs reporting used for external reporting and regulatory reporting used for reporting to
     acm and thus be able to improve supervision of the way in which gasunie will deal with
     this


     compliance with laws and regulations
     gasunie has an internal process of reporting and responsibilities with regard to compliance
     with the laws and regulations and with our gasunie guidelines for internal management
     this process has been laid down in a document of representation that is discussed by the
     audit committee where possible and necessary gasunie will obtain external certiﬁcation
     so that external testing will also take place for instance gasunie is currently working on
     certiﬁcation at nta8120 level the dutch quality standard for asset management


     relationship with the shareholder
     discussions are held regularly at various levels between the organisation and its shareholder
     in addition to the annual general meeting of shareholders the supervisory board has
     incidental discussions with the shareholder as and when required last year there were
     many close consultations about for example ﬁlling the vacancies in the supervisory board
     and the executive board during these discussions the knowledge and insights of the
     shareholder with regard to ﬁlling in these vacancies proved to be beneﬁcial there were also
     close consultations between the board and the shareholder about the policy on government
     participations

                                                                                                81


csr
the board played an active role in deﬁning the new csr policy the board took part in
discussions about this policy and how it should be reported on the board as a whole has
considerable experience and expertise on csr matters as a result of previous and other
current posts held by a number of its members


composition of the supervisory board
at the end of 2012 three members of the supervisory board  messrs van luijk noy and
lont resigned from the board to enable an open discussion about the research report drawn
up at the request of the shareholder about the acquisition in 2007 of the beb network in
germany in mutual agreement with the minister the three supervisory board members
stayed on until the general meeting on 23 april 2013 we are very grateful for the commitment
these three members have shown over the years on 23 april the board announced that
an interim chairman had been found and on 1 may 2013 mr rinse de jong became interim
chairman of the supervisory board


to facilitate the search for prospective new members the board drew up a detailed proﬁle
containing the required competencies besides competencies in the ﬁeld of general
ﬁnancial and socioeconomic management they were looking for speciﬁc competencies
in the ﬁeld of energy legislation public administration and technology the proﬁle was
discussed at length with the shareholder the executive board and the works council the
board was assisted in the search process by an external consultant the board was pleased
to be able to speak with a large enough number of good candidates to be able to make a
wellconsidered choice


unfortunately in the course of the year it transpired that the chairelect had accepted
another position that under the terms of the management and supervision act wet bestuur
en toezicht could not be combined with the position of chairman of the supervisory board
of gasunie the board naturally regrets this development on 1 october 2013 ms martika
jonk and mr willem schoeber were appointed to the supervisory board ms jonk is a partner
in the law ﬁrm cms derks star busmann where she specialises in international energy
matters she was in practice in germany for a number of years and is now located in the
netherlands she is qualiﬁed to practise in both countries mr schoeber is a former member
of the executive board of ewe ag a regional energy company operating in northern germany
and in turkey both bring experience in the ﬁeld of energy and legislation and mr schoeber
in the ﬁeld of technology as well with the appointment of these new supervisory board
members the composition of the board is now clearly diverse in the gender background and
experience of its members

82


     following the appointment of ms jonk and mr schoeber the main competencies are covered
     as follows

     competency                        ms poots      ms jonk    mr vermeire   mr schoeber   mr de jong
     general management                                                                      
     financial management                                                                     
     socioeconomic management                                                    
     energy                                                                                   
     legislation                                                                             
     technology                                                                   
     public administration                                                                    

     it should be noted that the abovementioned competencies in fact have various facets and
     the actual picture is more nuanced than may seem at ﬁrst sight for instance the public
     administrative contacts of mr vermeire relate mainly to belgium and the international gas
     industry whereas those of mr schoeber relate to germany and those of mr de jong to the
     netherlands the competencies are also reﬂected in the composition of the boards various
     committees


     all members of the board are independent in the sense of the dutch corporate governance
     code


     composition of the executive board
     in addition to its tasks of supervising and advising the supervisory board is also charged
     with the task of acting as employer of the executive board in june 2013 the then
     chief executive ofﬁcer mr paul van gelder announced that he would leave gasunie on
     1 september 2013 because he had accepted a position elsewhere the board is very grateful to
     mr van gelder for the way he has led the company during the period of more than three years
     that he was with gasunie and for the changes he introduced to bring the organisation more
     in line with the market


     assisted by an external consultant the board then started the process of ﬁnding a successor
     to this end they drew up a proﬁle which was subsequently discussed with the executive
     board the shareholder and the works council op 18 november 2013 it was announced that
     mr han fennema would be appointed as a member of the executive board of gasunie as of
     1 january 2014 on 1 march 2014 mr fennema was appointed chairman of the executive
     board and ceo


     to ﬁll in the vacancy left by mr van gelder the board asked mr geert graaf until then
     member of the executive board and chief operating ofﬁcer to take on the position of
     interim chairman of the executive board as of 1 september 2013 mr graaf ﬁlled this post in a
     highly professional way meanwhile he announced that he would leave gasunie on 1 march
     2014 after almost 30 years at the company the board regrets this decision and has very great
     respect for the way in which mr graaf carried out his job as interim ceo the board
     is grateful for this and wishes him every success in the future the board also thanks
     mr henk chin sue who was chief financial ofﬁcer until 1 july 2012 and active as advisor to
     the board until 1 july 2013 for his many years of dedication

                                                                                                 83


as of 1 march 2014 the executive board consists of mr han fennema chairman and ceo
and mr rené oudejans member and cfo in consultation with the supervisory board they
will examine which management model would best suit the tasks and responsibilities of
the various regulated and free market activities that gasunie has in its portfolio as a parent
company


in ﬁlling the vacancies in both the supervisory board and the executive board we made
every effort to observe the principle of equal representation of men and women which was
included in the proﬁle the supervisory board meets the criterion of at least 30 men and at
least 30 women however for the executive board we failed to ﬁnd any suitable available
female candidates

meetings to which the executive board was invited were attended by all members of the
executive board

corporate governance
 general
 nederlandse gasunie is a public limited company whose sole shareholder is the dutch
 state the shares are held by the ministry of finance the company is subject to a mitigated
 structure regime the governance structure is based on book 2 of the dutch civil code the
 corporate governance code the companys articles of association and various internal
 regulations various provisions affecting the governance of the company are also contained
 in the gas act


 executive board and executive committee
 until 1 september 2013 the executive board consisted of three people and subsequently two
 people in principle the board meets once a week the board is collectively responsible for
 the management of the company as well as the general affairs of the various subsidiaries
 most meetings take place in the broader context of the executive committee the executive
 committee consists of the executive board plus three directors of the business units and the
 director of legal regulatory and public affairs


 supervisory board
 the composition of the supervisory board and the changes in its membership during 2013
 are described elsewhere in this annual report the board meets at least four times a year
 the board supervises the management of gasunie and supports it with advice in accordance
 with the gas act and the articles of association important decisions to be made by gasunie
 transport services bv are also submitted for approval to the supervisory board of gasunie
 the board has two subcommittees the audit committee which supervises in particular the
 risk management and audit systems the annual and semiannual ﬁnancial reporting as well
 as the ﬁnancing of the company and its pension schemes and the remuneration selection 
 appointments committee the meetings of the committees are discussed at the meetings of
 the complete board on the basis of which decisions are made until recently the supervisory
 board also had a strategic investments committee this subcommittee held preliminary
 discussions about investment proposals for largescale investments this subcommittee
 was dissolved in 2013 this was on the one hand because the number of planned largescale
 investments had declined while on the other hand personnel changes within the board
 meant that it was better to discuss investment proposals directly in the meetings of the board
 as a whole


 compliance with the dutch corporate governance code
 the dutch corporate governance code which applies only to listed companies is also
 applied by state participations and thus also by gasunie where possible the principles and
 bestpractice provisions have been implemented in our articles of association and in various
 regulations since gasunie is not a listed company principles and bestpractice provisions
 that are directly related to stock exchange listing are not applicable


 we conﬁrm compliance with bestpractice provisions ii34 and iii63 which state that
 transactions in which there is a conﬂict of interests carried out by members of the executive
 board or supervisory board must be mentioned in the annual report in 2013 no such
 transactions took place

90


     a few of the principles and bestpractice provisions that might be applicable to our company
     are not applied in accordance with the corporate governance guidelines the few that are
     not adhered to are detailed below


     executive board
     ii212 the remuneration report shall be posted on the companys website


     reason for departing from this best practice
     in our annual report we transparently describe gasunies remuneration policy approved by
     the shareholder and the actual implementation thereof by the supervisory board in the year
     under review the annual report is published on gasunies website


     supervisory board
     iii5 if the supervisory board consists of more than four members the board shall appoint
     from its number an audit committee a remuneration committee and a selection and
     appointments committee


     reason for departing from this best practice
     because their tasks are closely related the remuneration committee and the selection and
     appointments committee are combined to form a single committee


     iii511 the chairmanship of the remuneration committee shall not be held by the chairman
     of the supervisory board or by a former director of the company or by a member of the
     supervisory board who is a director of another listed company


     reason for departing from this best practice
     the supervisory board is of the opinion that its chairman should be closely involved in
     preparing the salary and remuneration policy especially due to the current high proﬁle of
     this policy the supervisory board has therefore decided not to separate chairmanship of the
     board from that of the remuneration selection and appointments committee


     in connection with the departure of the chairman of the supervisory board on 1 may
     2013 the chairmanship of the supervisory board as of that date until the end of the year
     was temporarily separated from the chairmanship of the remuneration selection 
     appointments committee

remuneration policy for the executive board
 the remuneration policy was adopted by the general meeting of shareholders on 23 april
 2010 as proposed by the supervisory board with due account taken of the recommendation
 of the remuneration selection and appointments committee


 context of the remuneration policy
 in just a few years gasunie has grown into an international gas infrastructure company
 with many international customers in a converging european market the company is
 not only active in regulated markets but also develops nonregulated activities and is
 thus creating value for its stakeholders it creates value for the dutch economy primarily
 by developing a strong hub function in a liquid market by enabling the throughput of
 signiﬁcant gas ﬂows by enabling trade and competition between gas suppliers in the
 domestic gas market and by creating ﬂexibility through storage facilities all this makes
 gasunie a very valuable asset to the dutch economy the management of the company
 therefore bears a great responsibility


 the aims and principles underlying the remuneration policy
 the aim of the remuneration policy is to attract motivate and retain executive board
 members of the right quality and experience both from within the company and in the form
 of proven talent from the market the remuneration reﬂects the responsibility borne by the
 management and is considered in the light of the applicable remuneration principles in
 the market as explained below gasunie needs this management talent in order to achieve
 its essential strategic objectives in the context described above this policy is implemented
 based on the following considerations
  in principle having the state as a 100 shareholder gasunie applies the same criteria
    that are applied to the remuneration policy in stateowned companies if the supervisory
    board feels that this may lead to unacceptable risks for the company it will consult with
    the shareholder
  gasunie bases remuneration packages for members of the executive board on a
    market comparison based on a relevant reference group in the labour market this group
    consists of public semipublic private and international companies in a weighted ratio
    of 502525 with activities similar to those of gasunie energy distribution installation
    and construction
  the structure of the remuneration of members of the executive board is determined on
    the basis of market comparisons that also take into account the remuneration ratios
    within the company thus creating a logically continuing salary line from the posts in the
    executive board to the posts under the executive board
  application of the variable remuneration policy depends on short and longterm targets
    with respect to operational and strategic performance being achieved


 remuneration structure
 the remuneration consists of
  a ﬁxed component basic annual salary
  a variable component dependent on the attainment of both short and longterm
    targets as speciﬁed in the pages below
  the employers contribution to the pension premium
  other secondary employment conditions

92


     basic annual salary
     when determining the basic annual salary for members of the executive board the ﬁxed
     component the supervisory board bases its decision on the results of a market comparison
     with a labour market reference group chosen for this purpose the supervisory board has
     veriﬁed that the external consultant who carried out this market comparison in 2009 is
     independent of the members of the executive board at the request of the shareholder the
     supervisory board will limit the sum of the ﬁxed and variable annual salary on appointment
     to a maximum of  350000 2010 level the supervisory board decides on the level of annual
     salary increments if the maximum salary has been reached further growth is limited to the
     structural increments laid down in the collective labour agreement


     variable remuneration
     the variable remuneration is based on the remuneration policy that has been approved by
     the shareholder the maximum variable remuneration is 35 of the basic annual salary the
     targets that must be attained in order to qualify for these bonuses are agreed annually these
     targets should be both measurable and ambitious the supervisory board is authorised to
     adjust the variable component within the limits mentioned below if it is likely to lead to
     unfair outcomes due to exceptional circumstances during the performance period examples
     of this are the downward adjustment of the variable remuneration at the time of the
     depreciations on the acquisition in germany and at the time of a fatal trafﬁc accident which
     fell outside the applied target deﬁnition the supervisory board is also authorised to reclaim
     from members of the executive board a variable bonus that was awarded on the basis of
     inaccurate data ﬁnancial or otherwise


     the supervisory board has chosen performance criteria that relate to the implementation
     of gasunies strategic goals both short and longterm for each pillar of the strategy one or
     more performance criteria have been developed the three strategic pillars of gasunie and
     the associated performance criteria are as follows


      to optimise the value of our existing a ssets ﬁnancial targets and asset utilisation rate
      to strengthen our leading position as a crossborder gas infrastructure company in
        europe economic value added
      to enable the transition towards more sustainable energy use corporate social
        responsibility


     in deﬁning the companys strategy account is explicitly taken of the social impact of
     gasunies activities and their effects on the environment and society criteria have therefore
     also been deﬁned to assess performance in the areas of safety and security of supply given
     the nature of the variable remuneration elements the absence of option packages and
     associated remuneration mechanisms the possibility of carrying out a scenario analysis as
     mentioned in the corporate governance code is not relevant


     in the policy on government participations 2013 it was announced that the government as
     sole shareholder aims for a maximum variable remuneration of 20 to this end the current
     remuneration level will be assessed in terms of reasonableness and a conversion factor for
     all state participations will also be agreed

                                                                                                       93


variable shortterm remuneration
the purpose of the variable shortterm remuneration is to reward the attainment of the
previously agreed challenging targets in a number of primarily operational key areas these
operational targets apply to all gasunie staff attainment of some of these targets ie the
collective gasunie targets will also lead to other groups of employees being rewarded


the criteria for awarding the variable remuneration relate mainly to the implementation of
the strategy the strategy has been approved by the supervisory board and tested against
gasunies public interest this is reﬂected in for example challenging quantiﬁed targets
relating to safety security of supply and costefﬁciency


at the request of the shareholder the variable component is subject to an upper limit of 25
of the individuals basic annual salary a longterm bonus of up to 10 may also be awarded
see below


the breakdown of this 25 for 2013 is as follows

collective gasunie targets 10

with effect from 2014 the objectives for these three key areas will be slightly different for
instance roic will be introduced as a ﬁnancial criterion instead of ebitda and with respect
to corporate social responsibility co2 reduction will replace the number of kilometres
driven furthermore the percentages mentioned after the objective will be changed to 3
5 and 2 respectively

      to be determined by the supervisory board




     variable longterm remuneration
     gasunie also pays its executive board members a variable bonus linked to the value
     creation in the long term the variable longterm bonus has three components the ﬁrst is
     the operational cost index for the tsos which reﬂects the ratio of operating costs to the
     asset base for which the costs are incurred the second component is the asset utilisation
     rate also for the tsos this component indicates the extent to which the assets are actually
     used the commercial utilisation level the third component is the eva economic value
     added this performance is measured over a period of three years and is dependent on the
     development of the eva eva  roic  wacc x invested capital for the nontso part if the
     three components are realised in full the variable salary amounts to 4 3 and 3 of the
     basic annual salary respectively


     procedure
     the targets for eligibility for variable remuneration are agreed at the start of the relevant
     year between the supervisory board and the members of the executive board once
     the chairman of the executive board has discussed a proposal to this end with the
     remuneration selection and appointments committee


     in the following year the extent to which those targets have been met is evaluated by
     the external auditor this result is then adopted by the supervisory board following a
     recommendation to that effect by the remuneration selection  appointments committee


     variable bonuses are paid following approval by the general meeting of shareholders of the
     annual accounts for the year for which the targets were set


     pension provisions
     until 1 july 2013 gasunie had a separate pension scheme for its executive board members
     based on a careeraverage pension with a retirement age of 65 as of 1 july 2013 gasunie
     agreed with the trade unions on a new scheme for its personnel in the netherlands
     see p 61 it has been agreed with the members of the executive board that as of 1 july
     2013 this new scheme will also be applicable to them if a member of the executive board
     stands down before reaching retirement age but continues to be employed by gasunie that
     individuals pension provisions up to retirement age will be set by mutual agreement


     other secondary employment conditions
     gasunie has put together a package of secondary employment conditions for its executive
     board members which also apply to other staff

                                                                                                     95


other conditions
term of ofﬁce
members of the executive board are appointed for a period of four years with a possibility of
reappointment for a further four years members stand down on reaching the age of 62


notice period
for members of the executive board a notice period of two months applies as of 1 july 2013
this notice period for new members of the executive board was extended to 3 months


compensation for dismissal
compensation for dismissal for executive board members will be limited to a maximum of
one years basic salary in accordance with the corporate governance code except where
such a limitation is clearly unreasonable


change of control
executive board members are covered by a change of control clause which states that if
they are forced to leave the company due to a merger or the acquisition of the company
by an external party or in the event of a fundamental change in the nature management
or structure of the company that is beyond the control of the executive board they will be
awarded compensation up to a maximum of one years basic salary regardless of which
party terminates the employment contract


balanced composition
the composition of the executive board with three or two men is not in compliance with a
balanced composition as mentioned in the management and supervision act article 2166
of the dutch civil code which states that a balanced composition means that an executive
board should at least contain 30 women when new members need to be appointed
attention will be speciﬁcally paid to complying with this provision nevertheless when
ﬁlling in the post of chairman of the executive board in 2013 matching the candidates and
the desired proﬁle did not result in a more balanced composition unlike in the case of the
supervisory board where new appointments did indeed result in a balanced composition


remuneration package for 2013
based on the policy outlined above the supervisory board agreed the following basic annual
salaries and variable bonuses for members of the executive board active on 31 december 2013

basis of preparation
the companys consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union and
applicable as at 31 december 2013


new reporting standards
the following new standards and interpretations which are endorsed in the european union
became effective in 2013
 ifrs 1 firsttime adoption of international financial reporting standards  government
   loans amendments
 ifrs 7 financial instruments  disclosure offsetting financial assets and financial
   liabilities amendments
 ifrs 13 fair value measurement
 ias 1 presentation of financial statements  presentation of items of other comprehensive
   income amendments
 ias 19 employee beneﬁts revised
 ifric 20 stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine
 improvements to international financial reporting standards 20092011

110


      the adoption of the aforementioned standards and interpretations affects the presentation of
      the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and requires additional disclosures it
      has no material effect on the companys equity and result in 2013


      as of 2013 under ias 19 employee beneﬁts revised the expected return on plan assets is
      determined on the basis of the discount rate applied in determining pension liabilities


      the abolition of the corridor method under ias 19 employee beneﬁts revised has no effect on
      the equity and result of nv nederlandse gasunie because actuarial gains and losses have been
      completely and directly accounted for in equity after deduction of deferred taxes in the period in
      which they occurred


      the ifrs standards and interpretations of the international financial reporting interpretati
      ons committee that have been published and endorsed by the european union but are not yet
      effective have not been adopted by the company as of the 2014 ﬁnancial year these include
       ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements
       ifrs 11 joint arrangements
       ifrs 12 disclosures of interests in other entities
       ifrs 10 11  12  transition guidance amendments
       ifrs 10 12  ias 27  investment entities amendments
       ias 27 separate financial statements revised
       ias 28 investments in associates and joint ventures revised
       ias 32 financial instruments presentation  offsetting financial assets and financial
         liabilities amendments
       ias 36 recoverable amount disclosures for nonfinancial assets amendments
       ias 39 novation of derivates and continuation of hedge accounting amendments


      the adoption of the aforementioned standards and interpretations has no material effect on the
      companys equity and result in 2014 but has an effect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
      and disclosures because of the abolition of proportional consolidation for joint ventures under
      ifrs 11 joint arrangements it also leads to reclassiﬁcation of some participations and requires
      additional disclosures


      as of the 2014 ﬁnancial year the following new interpretation will become effective but has not
      yet been endorsed in the european union
       ifric 21 levies


      the company expects that adoption of the aforementioned interpretation will have no material
      effect on the companys equity and result and will not require additional disclosures


      as of the 2015 ﬁnancial year the following new standards and interpretations will become
      effective but have not yet been endorsed in the european union
       ifrs 9 financial instruments  classiﬁcation and measurement of financial assets and
         financial liabilities phase 1
       ias 19 employee beneﬁts  deﬁned beneﬁt plans employee contributions amendments
       improvements to international financial reporting standards 20102012
       improvements to international financial reporting standards 20112013

                                                                                                    111


the company expects that adoption of the aforementioned standards will have no material
effect on the companys equity and result but will require additional disclosures


as of the 2016 ﬁnancial year the following new standard will become effective but has not yet
been endorsed by the european union
 ifrs 14 regulatory deferral accounts


adoption of the aforementioned standard has no material effect on the companys equity and
result and does not require additional disclosures


management judgements and estimates
in preparing the ﬁnancial statements management makes estimates and assessments which
affect the assets and liabilities presented as at the balance sheet date and the result for the
ﬁnancial year these judgments and estimates have a signiﬁcant effect on the valuation of ﬁxed
assets the provision for clearance costs and redevelopment deferred taxation pensions and
other equity interests


fixed assets
fixed assets include the gas transport network


tangible ﬁxed assets are valued at cost less straightline depreciation based on the expected
useful life taking into account the residual value and impairments to this end assumptions
were made about the useful life the residual value and the future cash ﬂows of the transport
pipelines in particular


a signiﬁcant part of the operating activities are regulated the future cash ﬂows and related
recoverable amount of the regulated assets are partly based on judgments and estimates about
the cash ﬂows that can be earned within the regulatory framework for more information see
note 1 to the consolidated balance sheet


provision for clearance costs and redevelopment
this provision is recognised in response to management decisions to decommission remove or
redevelop speciﬁc assets within the foreseeable future for instance due to new legislation for
the time being the size of the provision has been determined on the basis of general key ﬁgures
such as unit costs plus a generic project management surcharge during actual clearance and
redevelopment it will be possible to estimate more accurately the costs involved and the
provision will be adjusted accordingly


a provision for longterm general clearance costs is not recognised because it is currently
considered unlikely that the removal of transport pipelines and appurtenances will be
needed the income from alternative use in the longer term less the costs of conservation is
anticipated to offset the costs of removal social or otherwise

112


      deferred tax assets
      a deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences and available
      carryforward losses to the extent that it is likely that taxable proﬁt will be available for setoff
      to this end assumptions have been made about future taxable proﬁts


      pensions
      the costs relating to the deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans and the valuation of deﬁned beneﬁt
      pension liabilities are determined using actuarial calculations to this end signiﬁcant
      assumptions have been made about the market interest rate on highquality corporate bonds
      for the purpose of determining the discount rate the expected future increases in salary the
      expected future increases in pensions and up to and including 2012 the expected return on plan
      assets for more information see note 16 to the consolidated balance sheet


      other equity interests
      the interest in nord stream ag is stated at fair value taking into account a posttax discount
      rate on the expected cash ﬂows the expected cash ﬂows are based on agreements laid down
      in contracts in determining the posttax discount rate management has made signiﬁcant
      assumptions



      consolidation and accounting principles
      the consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial data of nv nederlandse gasunie
      and its group companies group companies are legal entities and companies over which the
      company exercises control


      group companies are fully consolidated from the date on which control of the group company
      is obtained until the date that control no longer exists the items in the consolidated ﬁnancial
      statements are calculated in accordance with consistent accounting policies


      intercompany account balances and unrealised results relating to group companies are
      eliminated unrealised losses are also eliminated except when a loss is an indication of
      impairment

                                                                                                        113

      amount of the assets the recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal
      and its value in use if the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount the
      difference is taken to the proﬁt and loss account due to the nature of the assets it is often
      not possible to determine the recoverable amount of each asset in such cases the recoverable
      amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs is determined


      if there is reason to do so the company investigates whether the impairment of a tangible ﬁxed
      asset recognised in previous periods no longer exists or has decreased


      intangible ﬁxed assets
      exploitation rights
      exploitation rights are valued at cost less straightline depreciation based on the expected
      useful life taking into account the residual value and impairments the residual value of the
      asset the useful life and the depreciation method and terms are assessed at least at the end of
      the ﬁnancial year and adjusted if necessary


      impairments of exploitation rights
      if there is reason to do so the company investigates whether an impairment of the exploitation
      rights exists this involves determining the recoverable amount of the assets the recoverable
      amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use if the recoverable
      amount is less than the current carrying amount the difference is taken to the proﬁt and loss
      account


      goodwill
      goodwill is the surplus of the acquisition price above the gasunie share in the net fair value
      of the identiﬁable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities goodwill is recognised as
      intangible ﬁxed assets after initial recognition goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated
      impairments


      for the purpose of determining any impairments goodwill acquired in a business combination
      is allocated to one or more cashgenerating units that are expected to beneﬁt from the
      synergies of the combination no later than in the ﬁnancial year following the acquisition date

                                                                                                         117


impairment of goodwill
every year and if there is reason to do so the company assesses whether an impairment exists
of goodwill acquired in a business combination and which has been allocated to one or more
cashgenerating units


to that end the company determines the recoverable amount of each cashgenerating unit or
group of cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated the recoverable amount
is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use if the recoverable amount
is less than the current carrying amount the difference is taken to the proﬁt and loss account
impairments of goodwill are not reversed in future periods


investments in associates
participations over which the company exercises signiﬁcant inﬂuence on operating and
ﬁnancial policies are valued using the equity method


the companys share in the result of associates is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account


other equity interests
after initial recognition other equity interests are stated at fair value with unrealised gains or
losses taken to equity until the other equity interests are no longer recognised or are subject to
impairment the accumulated gains or losses are then taken to the proﬁt and loss account


to the extent the fair value cannot be determined reliably the other equity interests are stated
at cost



current assets
stocks
stocks of maintenance materials and parts are stated at average cost net of a provision for
obsolescence


receivables
receivables are stated at amortised cost less a provision for doubtful debts a provision for
doubtful debts is recognised if there is an objective reason to do so


cash and cash equivalents
cash includes available cash in hand and credit balances at banks cash equivalents are held
with the aim of meeting current liabilities in cash and are not normally used for investments
or other purposes an investment is only recognised as cash equivalent if it can be immediately
converted into a known cash amount and is not subject to a material risk of ﬂuctuation in
value

118


      longterm liabilities
      these are liabilities with a remaining term to maturity of more than one year repayment
      obligations on longterm liabilities falling due within one year are presented under current
      liabilities


      interestbearing loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the proceeds less transaction
      costs after initial recognition interestbearing loans are subsequently carried at amortised
      cost based on the effective interest method



      employee beneﬁts
      longterm liabilities for employee beneﬁts concern pension liabilities jubilee beneﬁts and the
      costs of postemployment fringe beneﬁts for nonactive and retired employees


      pension liabilities
      nv nederlandse gasunie and the group companies and joint ventures included in the
      consolidation have several pension schemes in place entitling their employees to a number of
      beneﬁts including a retirement pension and a dependants pension


      as of 1 july 2013 the pension scheme of employees of nv nederlandse gasunie were changed in
      the new pension scheme the company has committed itself to paying a ﬁxed predetermined
      premium this premium is based on a conditional averagesalary scheme which aims to
      achieve an annual accrual of 2 of the pension base the pension savings agreement for the
      executive board based on a conditional averagesalary scheme has also been replaced by the
      new pension scheme


      in ifrs terms the new pension scheme qualiﬁes as a deﬁned contribution plan the pension
      scheme that was in force up to and including 30 june 2013 qualiﬁed as a deﬁned beneﬁt pension
      plan as a result of the change as of 1 july 2013 the balance of pension liabilities and plan assets
      is no longer included in the balance sheet


      the premiums payable in respect of the pension entitlements of the employees of nv
      nederlandse gasunie are paid to stichting pensioenfonds gasunie which administers the
      pension scheme the fund manages the assets for all pension schemes administered by
      stichting pensioenfonds gasunie


      the pension scheme that applies to employees of gate terminal bv is also a deﬁned
      contribution plan


      for employees of gasunie deutschland who joined the company in or after 2012 a new pension
      scheme was implemented which came into force on 1 january 2013 this pension scheme
      which has been reinsured oneonone with a pension fund is a deﬁned contribution plan the
      employers contribution is determined every year on the basis of the gross pension income and
      can be as high as 4 of the contribution base


      the pension scheme of employees of gasunie deutschland who joined the company before 2012
      has not been changed this is a deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan based on a ﬁnal salary scheme the
      entitlements of these employees have not been funded

                                                                                                      119


the provision for pension liabilities is calculated in accordance using the projected unit
credit method of actuarial cost allocation according to this method the present value of the
pension entitlements is calculated on the basis of the number of active service years until the
balance sheet date the estimated salary as at the expected retirement date and the discount
rate to determine the pension costs the expected return on plan assets is also included in the
calculation which as of 2013 will be equal to the discount rate


actuarial gains and losses are fully and directly recognised in equity in the period in which they
occur net of deferred taxation


the net liability in respect of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme consists of the present value
of the gross liability less the fair value of the plan assets if this results in an asset pension
assets are only included in the balance sheet if realisation is possible in the future through the
payment of lower contributions or refunds


actuarial calculations are drawn up by external actuaries every year


provision for jubilee beneﬁts
this provision relates to jubilee beneﬁts paid by nv nederlandse gasunie to its employees on
service anniversaries account is taken of the likelihood that the allowance will be paid and of a
pretax discount rate which incorporates the prevailing market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks inherent in the commitment


provision for the costs of postemployment fringe beneﬁts for nonactive and retired
employees
this provision relates to the allowance which nv nederlandse gasunie pays to its employees
after their retirement it represents the present value of the beneﬁts already committed to
nonactive and retired employees account is taken of the mortality rate and a pretax discount
rate which incorporates the prevailing market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks inherent in the commitment


the assumptions on which this provision is based are tested periodically against mortality
interest and cost developments and adjusted if necessary

120


      provisions
      the amount recognised as a provision is the best possible estimate as at the balance sheet
      date of the expenditure required to meet the existing commitment taking into account the
      probability of the possible outcome of the event


      if the time value of money is material a provision is recognised based on the present value of
      the expenditure deemed necessary to settle the commitment


      the discount rate is determined before taxation and takes into account the prevailing market
      assessments of the time value of money and the risks inherent in the commitment


      provision for reorganisation expenses
      this provision serves to cover the liabilities in respect of nonactive employees arising from
      previously implemented reorganisations


      provision for clearance costs and redevelopment
      this provision is recognised due to management decisions to decommission remove or
      redevelop speciﬁc assets within the foreseeable future for instance due to new legislation



      current liabilities
      these are liabilities with a term of one year or less



      income
      income is the revenues from gas transport and related services to third parties net of discounts
      and taxes such as vat


      if the result of a transaction involving the provision of a service can be estimated reliably the
      income relating to the service is recognised in proportion to the services performed in the
      ﬁnancial year


      services relating to the provision of transport capacity are separate from actual use they are
      deemed to have been supplied if the capacity was at the customers disposal for the duration of
      the agreed period


      the difference between gross income and net income is the tariff settlement repayment
      on 11 october 2011 the dutch regulator acm adopted new method decisions for the periods
      20062009 and 20102013 these decisions established lower tariffs for the period 20062011
      than those charged by nv nederlandse gasunie in the corresponding period in line with
      previous method decisions nv nederlandse gasunie is required to refund the difference to its
      customers by reducing the transport tariffs in 2012 and 2013 the effect of the lowering of the
      tariffs on the income is shown separately in the proﬁt and loss account

                                                                                                     121


capitalised expenditure
capitalised expenditure includes operating expenses incurred by the company in connection
with the production of tangible ﬁxed assets these expenses mainly comprise the costs of own
and hired employees plus a part of the overhead of support departments



other operating expenses
these expenses are determined on a historical basis taking into account the accounting
policies set out above and are allocated to the reporting period to which they relate losses are
recognised in the reporting period in which they are foreseen



finance revenue and costs
included in this item are income and expenses relating to ﬁnancing


interest income is recognised on a pro rata time basis in the proﬁt and loss account taking
into account the effective interest rate for the asset concerned provided the income can be
measured and is likely to be received


interest expenses are capitalised if they relate to the purchase construction or production of
qualifying assets provided the assets need a substantial period before being ready for their
intended use


other interest expenses are recognised on a pro rata time basis in the proﬁt and loss account
taking into account the effective interest rate for the liability concerned



corporate income tax
a deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences a deferred tax asset
is recognised for all deductible temporary differences and available carryforward losses to the
extent that it is likely that taxable proﬁt will be available for setoff


deferred tax liabilities and assets are stated at the undiscounted value of the expected cash
ﬂows the tax rates used for the valuation are those that are expected to apply in the period in
which the deferred tax items will be realised based on the tax rates and tax legislation in force
as at the balance sheet date the movements arising from this are taken to the proﬁt and loss
account except for movements relating to the revaluation of the tangible ﬁxed assets as at
1 january 2004 the tax treatment of the purchase price paid by the dutch state actuarial gains
and losses and the cash ﬂow hedge reserve these movements are recognised directly in equity


tax assets and liabilities deferred or otherwise are netted provided the general conditions for
setting off tax items have been met


nv nederlandse gasunie and its 100 dutch group companies form a ﬁscal unity no corporate
income tax is assigned to these group companies the ﬁscal burden included in the corporate
proﬁt and loss account relates to all the companies in the ﬁscal unity

      gasunie deutschland gmbh  co kg and its 100 german group companies form a ﬁscal unity
      in germany for the purposes of trade tax and corporate income tax including the reuniﬁcation
      surcharge


      tax is calculated based on the recognised result taking into account taxexempt items and costs
      that are either nondeductible or only partly deductible



      cash ﬂow statement
      this statement shows the cash ﬂows generated by nv nederlandse gasunie the cash ﬂow
      from operating activities is determined using the indirect method based on the income
      presented in the consolidated proﬁt and loss account



      financial information by segment
      the information relating to the operating activities for which separate ﬁnancial information
      is available and of which the operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating
      decisionmaker covers gas transport activities in the netherlands and germany as well as new
      business activities

derivative ﬁnancial instruments
cash ﬂow hedge accounting
cash ﬂow hedge accounting is applied to derivative ﬁnancial instruments that have been
speciﬁcally designated for this purpose by management and are used to hedge a highly
probable cash ﬂow while satisfying all other conditions


they are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into
and the fair value is subsequently periodically reassessed the fair value is determined by
discounting future cash ﬂows to the current yield curve


gains or losses on the effective part of the hedging instrument are recognised in the cash ﬂow
hedge reserve in equity net of deferred taxation any ineffective parts are recognised directly in
the proﬁt and loss account


when a hedging instrument is wound up gains or losses on the effective part continue to be
recognised in equity for as long as the underlying cash ﬂow is expected to occur if it is not
expected to occur the gains or losses on the effective part which are recognised in equity are
taken directly to the proﬁt and loss account


effective derivative ﬁnancial instruments designated for hedge accounting are recognised
in the same way as the underlying contract depending on the nature and the term of the
underlying contract the instruments are classiﬁed as either longterm or shortterm


other derivative ﬁnancial instruments
other derivative ﬁnancial instruments used for hedging existing risks such as interestrate
swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value changes in
value are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account


if the fair value is positive the instrument is included under other receivables if the fair value
is negative the instrument is included under other liabilities depending on the nature and
the term of the underlying contract the instruments are classiﬁed as either longterm or
shortterm

      notes to the consolidated balance sheet
      1 impairment tests
      general
      whenever there is reason to do so the company tests whether there is any impairment of
      tangible intangible and ﬁnancial ﬁxed assets


      there is an impairment if the recoverable amount of an asset or group of assets is less than the
      carrying amount the recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal
      and its value in use the value in use is calculated on the basis of future cash ﬂows estimated by
      management these cash ﬂows are based on the business plan for the next three years adopted
      by the executive board as well as on a recent longrange forecast the total planning period
      runs up to and includes 2062 there are no indications that the fair value less costs of disposal is
      higher than the value in use


      when carrying out an impairment test management makes assumptions including those
      regarding short and longterm developments in the regulatory framework makes estimates
      of aspects such as future cash ﬂows and determines the discount rate these assumptions
      estimates and judgements signiﬁcantly affect the value in use


      both in the netherlands and in germany the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of
      the gas transport network are comparable this means that material changes in the recoverable
      amount as a result of for example method decisions for a new regulatory period can only be
      accommodated to a limited degree and may lead to an impairment loss


      impairment tests
      gas transport network in the netherlands
      in 2011 the dutch regulator acm published method decisions and xfactor decisions for the
      periods 20062009 and 20102013 the related decisions on tariffs were adopted in december
      2011 a number of stakeholders and gts appealed against the new method decisions on
      8 november 2012 the dutch industrial appeals tribunal cbb ruled that the objections were
      unfounded this means that gts can maintain the current tariffs established by the acm
      unchanged


      when preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for 2012 management concluded that
      there was no reason to perform an analytical test to determine any possible impairments of the
      gas transport network in the netherlands


      on 1 may 2013 acm published the draft method decisions for the period 20142016 when
      preparing the consolidated semiannual ﬁnancial statements for 2013 it was expected that the
      acm would determine the deﬁnitive method decisions in september 2013


      when preparing the consolidated semiannual ﬁnancial statements for 2013 management
      concluded that there was no reason to perform an analytical test to determine any possible
      impairments of the gas transport network in the netherlands


      on 2 october 2013 acm published the deﬁnite method decisions and xfactor decisions as a
      result the company performed an analytical test to determine any possible impairments

                                                                                                    125


in this test it was assumed that the current regulatory framework will be continued unchanged
the revenues permitted by the regulator for any year consist of an allowance for the cost of
capital invested an allowance for the annual depreciation costs calculated on the basis of
the depreciation periods determined by the regulator and an allowance for the operational
expenses


the allowance for the cost of capital is the result of the regulated asset base and the weighted
average cost of capital wacc in determining the allowance for the cost of capital for the
third regulatory period 20142016 reference was made to the wacc established in the method
decision 36 real pretax comparable to 425 nominal posttax for the regulatory period
from 2017 onwards a wacc is assumed of 55 nominal posttax


the regulator may impose an efﬁciency discount for the regulatory period 20142016 the
regulator will apply an efﬁciency discount of 13 per year


the expected cash ﬂows have been discounted using a discount rate that is related to the
expected allowance for the cost of capital for the relevant period for the years 20142016 the
discount rate is 425 nominal posttax for the years from 2017 onwards a discount rate of 55
nominal posttax has been applied


on the basis of the information available at the time the 2013 ﬁnancial statements were
prepared management has concluded that the recoverable amount of the gas transport
network in the netherlands as at yearend 2013 is not less than the carrying amount


gas transport network in germany
the german regulator bnetza is in the process of determining the permitted revenues for
the regulatory period 20132017 on the basis of the projected permissible costs for the period
possibly reduced by an individual efﬁciency factor in the second half of 2012 bnetza took a
decision on the permissible costs when management was preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements for 2012 the decision with regard to the individual efﬁciency factor was expected in
the ﬁrst quarter of 2013


when preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for 2012 management concluded that
there was no reason to perform an analytical test to determine any possible impairments of the
gas transport network in germany


when preparing the consolidated semiannual ﬁnancial statements for 2013 the
decisionmaking by bnetza with regard to the individual efﬁciency factor had been delayed and
was expected in the third quarter of 2013


when preparing the consolidated semiannual ﬁnancial statements for 2013 management
concluded that there was no reason to perform an analytical test to determine any possible
impairments of the gas transport network in germany

126


      in january 2014 the bnetza announced the individual efﬁciency factor as a result the company
      has performed an analytical test to determine any possible impairments


      in this test it was assumed that the current regulatory framework will be continued unchanged


      the expected cash ﬂows have been discounted using a discount rate that is related to the
      expected allowance for the cost of capital for the relevant period for the years 20142017 the
      discount rate is 55 nominal posttax for the years from 2018 a discount rate of 55 nominal
      posttax has been applied


      on the basis of the information available at the time the 2013 ﬁnancial statements were
      prepared management has concluded that the recoverable amount of the gas transport
      network in germany as at yearend 2013 is not less than the carrying amount

      in the ﬁrst quarter of 2013 apx bv was split into a power part and a gas part following
      this split nv nederlandse gasunie has an interest of 209 in the gas part which has been
      transferred to ice endex holding bv in 2013 this transaction led to an additional loss of
       03 million this loss was taken to share in result of associates


      as part of the power part of the above transaction an earnout agreement has been entered
      into that will be valid until 22 may 2014 the company does not think it likely that the conditions
      of this earnout agreement will be met and has therefore not recognised this receivable nor
      provided any explanatory notes


      together with the other shareholder of ice endex holding bv nv nederlandse gasunie has
      entered into a 5year option agreement which will come into effect on 26 march 2015 on the
      grounds of this agreement the company has the right to sell its 209 interest to the other
      shareholder on the basis of the value of the shares at that time in addition it has been agreed
      that the other shareholder has the right to buy the 209 interest from nv nederlandse
      gasunie at the value of the shares at that time given the recent acquisition of the 209 share
      at fair value it is assumed that these options have little value which is why they have not been
      recognised in the balance sheet


      in 2013 cv gasexpansie ijmond was wound up resulting in a loss of  02 million this result has
      been taken to share in result of associates in 2012 the impairment of cv gasexpansie ijmond
      of  11 million has been taken to this result


      global gas networks initiative ggni bv was wound up in 2013 with no impact on result

      been based on 39 for 2012 the effect on the expected return on plan assets is  10 million

a provision for pension liabilities the netherlands
nv nederlandse gasunie and its employees in the netherlands represented by the trade
unions have agreed that as of 1 july 2013
 the old pension scheme pension regulations 2006 will be terminated
 a new pension scheme will come into force in which the company committed itself to
     pay out a ﬁxed predetermined contribution this contribution is based on a conditional
     averagesalary scheme which aims to achieve an annual accrual of 2 of the pension base
     the pensionable age is set at 67


the contribution payable by nv nederlandse gasunie will be 226 of the pensionable salary
this contribution will be ﬁxed up to and including 31 december 2017 the pension execution
agreement was entered into on 1 july 2013 with stichting pensioenfonds gasunie


in addition it was agreed that nv nederlandse gasunie will
 pay a oneoff amount of  20 million to the pension fund for the beneﬁt of an indexation
     reserve to be set up for employees in active service in order to increase the chances of
     indexation of employees pension entitlements in the coming years
 pay a oneoff amount of  5 million to the pension fund for the beneﬁt of a reserve to be set
     up for employees in active service in order to prevent pension accrual cuts


the new pension scheme qualiﬁes as a deﬁned contribution plan in ifrs terms the ﬁnancial
consequences of the transition to the new pension scheme are broadly as follows
 on 1 july 2013 the provision for pension liabilities of  1159 million that relates to the old
     pension scheme was released to the proﬁt and loss account after deduction of the related
     deferred tax receivable of  290 million
 the oneoff payments of  20 million and  5 million respectively have been taken to the
     proﬁt and loss account
 the accumulated actuarial gains and losses relating to the old pension scheme have not
     been reclassiﬁed to the proﬁt and loss account the direct effect on equity is nil


the new pension scheme also applies to the members of the executive board


for a very small group of employees born before 1950 the pension regulations 1994 with the
associated savings regulations still applies these regulations will remain in force for as long
as the pension accrual is allowed within the ﬁscal framework for this group nv nederlandse
gasunie pays a premium that covers the costs if due to the ﬁnancial situation of the pension

144


      fund the pension entitlements need to be cut back nv nederlandse gasunie will not be
      obliged to pay a supplementary premium the size of this group whose members will retire in
      the next two years as well as the balance of the related pension liabilities and plan assets is so
      insigniﬁcant that it has been decided not to recognise it in the balance sheet

all plan assets are administered by stichting pensioenfonds gasunie


pursuant to the pension execution agreement between stichting pensioenfonds gasunie and
nv nederlandse gasunie which has been in force since 1 january 2009 and which was last
changed as of 1 july 2010 the company has undertaken to pay an additional contribution to
restore the funding ratio of the fund to 105 to the extent that the funding ratio is less than
105 as at 31 december


on 31 december 2012 the pension fund had a funding ratio that was less than 105 pursuant to
the abovementioned pension execution agreement the pension fund claimed an additional
premium contribution of approximately  6 million from nv nederlandse gasunie in order
to increase its funding ratio to 105 as at the balance sheet date this additional obligatory
contribution was in accordance with the relevant ifrs standard not included in the balance
sheet at yearend 2012


the aforementioned execution agreement was terminated by nv nederlandse gasunie as of
31 december 2012 as a result the additional contribution obligation has lapsed during the
period between 1 january 2013 and 30 june 2013 an addendum to the execution agreement was
in force which was replaced on 1 july 2013 by an execution agreement that ﬁts in with the new
pension scheme in the latter two execution agreements no additional contribution obligation
for gasunie has been included which means that gasunie is not obliged to supplement any
shortages in the fund

      this provision was recognised in 2010 due to management decisions to decommission remove
      or redevelop speciﬁc assets within the foreseeable future for instance due to new legislation
      the provision relates to the redevelopment of siterelated and grouprelated bottlenecks
      obligations to disengage decommissioned branches from the grid and the decision to redevelop
      or replace certain pipeline sections

                                                                                                         151


pipelines that had already been disengaged were added to the redevelopment programme in
2011 and in 2012 pipelines were added that had been taken over from third parties in the past
the last part of the redevelopment programme is expected to be carried out in 2020


a provision for longterm general clearance costs is not recognised because it is currently
considered unlikely that the removal of transport pipelines and appurtenances will be
needed the income from alternative use in the longer term less the costs of conservation is
anticipated to offset the costs of removal including social costs

      21 financial risks
      general
      the main ﬁnancial risks to which nv nederlandse gasunie is exposed are market risk consisting
      of interest rate risk and currency risk credit risk and liquidity risk nv nederlandse gasunie uses
      ﬁnancial risk management to limit these risks by operational and ﬁnancial measures speciﬁc
      instruments are used for this purpose depending on the nature and size of the risks


      the treasury department is responsible for executing ﬁnancial risk management the use of
      speciﬁc risk instruments requires the prior approval of the executive board which receives regular
      reports on the nature and size of the risks as well as the measures taken


      nv nederlandse gasunie may use derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage currency and
      interest rate risks arising from ordinary operational activities the risk policy relating to interest
      rate risk aims to limit the shortterm effects of interest rate ﬂuctuations on the result and in the
      long term to follow the regulatory allowance for cost of debt the risk policy relating to currency
      risk aims to limit the effects of exchange rate ﬂuctuations on the result


      financial instruments are only used to hedge risks and not for trading or any other purpose


      for the disclosure of currency and interest rate risks ifrs 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show
      the ﬁnancial effects of reasonable hypothetical changes in relevant risk variables on the proﬁt and
      loss account and on equity these effects are determined by relating the hypothetical changes to
      the risk variables to the balance sheet values of the ﬁnancial instruments as at the reporting date
      assuming that the balance sheet values as at the reporting date are representative of the whole
      period


      interest rate risk
      the risk to which the company is exposed resulting from ﬂuctuations in market interest rates
      mainly relates to the longterm loans with a ﬂoating interest rate the company is also exposed
      to an interest rate risk in the period between the decision to issue longterm loans with a ﬁxed
      rate and the realisation of these loans

                                                                                                      153


for the project ﬁnancing of one of the consolidated joint ventures the interest rate risk was
managed by means of a swap transaction in the period between the decision to ﬁnance the
project and the time of actually doing so this swap transaction is also being used to manage
the interest rate risk during the total maturity of the project ﬁnancing the transaction is
designed to effectively offset changes in the cash ﬂows interestbased or otherwise caused by
changes in the market interest rate cash ﬂow hedge since there are no margin obligations on
this swap it does not constitute a liquidity risk


at yearend 2013 the share of the ﬂoating interest rate loans in the loan portfolio is 39 2012
03 a 1point increasedecrease of the interest rate will respectively increasedecrease the
annual interest expenses of the loan portfolio by  17 million 2012  01 million


the effect of a 1point interest rate increasedecrease on the valuation of the ﬁnancial
instruments that are recognised by direct movements in equity is a  4 million decrease
increase 2012  6 million decreaseincrease net of corporate income tax


currency risk
currency risks arise as deﬁned in ifrs 7 if ﬁnancial instruments are concluded in a currency
that is different from the functional currency and if the ﬁnancial instruments are of a monetary
nature


nv nederlandse gasunie seeks to limit currency risks to this end it uses forward exchange
contracts and currency swaps foreign exchange instruments are only used if underlying
positions exist currency risks are fully hedged to the extent that there is sufﬁcient certainty
about the amount and timing of the foreign currency cash ﬂows


at yearend 2013 and 2012 there were no liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that were
hedged by means of forward transactions

      the sensitivity analysis takes into account the past ﬂuctuation range of currencies the
      same ranges are used by the company for its analyses of potential risks there were no other
      signiﬁcant foreign currency positions


      credit risk
      credit risk relates to the loss that would arise if counterparties were to default entirely as at the
      balance sheet date and fail to meet their contractual obligations the company is not exposed to
      any material credit risk with regard to any individual customer or counterparty


      to reduce counterparty risk when employing derivative ﬁnancial instruments the company
      uses strict limits concerning the credit risk exposure allowed for each counterparty
      the company has drawn up criteria for selecting counterparties of ﬁnancial instrument
      transactions these criteria limit the risks associated with possible credit concentrations and
      market risks as at yearend 2013 and 2012 no collateral was placed by counterparties at nv
      nederlandse gasunie to hedge counterparty risks with respect to ﬁnancial instruments

the sureties are issued for a speciﬁc purpose and mainly relate to investment projects the
guarantees are not freely assignable


the maturity of the bank guarantees is generally short one to two years


in 2010 nv nederlandse gasunie acted as a guarantor for the payment obligations of
gasunie deutschland regarding an investment project in germany for a maximum of
 320 million during the project the guarantee is reduced by the value of the investments
made at yearend 2013 the remaining guarantee amounts to  25 million the guarantee will
end upon completion of the investment project which is currently expected for the ﬁrst half
year of 2014


the company is guarantor for gate terminal bv for leases payable to the port of rotterdam
authority to the value of  49 million at yearend 2013 and two sureties provided to shippers
totalling  30 million the remaining maturity of the guarantee for the port of rotterdam is
14 years and of the two sureties more than 20 years


the nord stream project was ﬁnanced with almost  6 billion of external debt during the
construction the investors including nv nederlandse gasunie guarantee their share in the
project to the external debt providers in 2012 construction phase 1 was completed so that
nv nederlandse gasunies completion guarantee of  350 million for this construction phase
terminated at yearend 2013 nv nederlandse gasunie was still guarantor for  220 million for
construction phase 2 this completion guarantee is expected to remain in force until mid2014


following the termination of the completion guarantee for construction phase 1 a change in
law commitment agreement towards nord stream ag came into force in 2012 for the beneﬁt
of the external debt providers this guarantee is issued to compensate possible negative
consequences of changes in laws or regulations


for construction phase 1 the guarantee resulting from the change in law commitment
agreement may be invoked due to the negative consequences arising from changes in the laws
and regulations or their interpretation during the period from 16 april 2009 to 14 may 2010


with respect to construction phase 2 the change in law commitment agreement applies to
negative consequences arising from changes in laws or regulations or their interpretation

158


      during the period from 16 april 2009 to 21 april 2011
      the change in law commitment agreement can only be invoked if as a result of changes in
      laws or regulations in the said periods nord streams customer in whole or in part will be
      exempted from its payment obligations as a consequence of which nord stream ag is no longer
      able to pay its operating costs or meet its obligations to its lenders


      if laws or regulations come into force or are changed which do not related to the
      abovementioned periods no claim can be made on the basis of the change in law
      commitment agreement furthermore this guarantee does not cover any changes in russian
      laws or regulations


      the change in law commitment agreement expires in 2026 the chance that this guarantee
      will be invoked is considered to be very small the maximum share of nv nederlandse gasunie
      in this guarantee to lenders is  570 million the guarantee reduces proportionally with the
      repayments made on the debt at yearend 2013 the remaining guarantee is for a maximum
      of  513 million of which  220 million is concurrent with the completion guarantee for
      construction phase 2 the share of nv nederlandse gasunie in this guarantee in relation to the
      operating costs of nord stream is expected to be approximately  7 million per year the above
      table includes  293 million relating to this guarantee


      in 2009 nv nederlandse gasunie issued a purchase guarantee to nv kema totalling

      to  5 million in 2019 the guarantee concerns the purchase of services to ensure the safe
      and reliable transport of gas and the development of sustainable initiatives the guarantee
      commitments were fulﬁlled for 2013 this purchase guarantee is included in note 22 to the
      consolidated balance sheet under other commitments


      fair value and carrying amount of ﬁnancial instruments
      the following methods are applied by nv nederlandse gasunie to determine the approximate
      fair values of ﬁnancial instruments
       for trade receivables tax and social security contributions other receivables cash and cash
         equivalents current ﬁnancing liabilities excluding repayment obligations on longterm
         loans trade payables tax liabilities and other liabilities accruals and deferred income the
         carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the short period to the due date for
         each of these instruments
       the other equity interests are stated at fair value which is based on the present value of the
         cash ﬂows in determining the discount rate the risk proﬁle including the credit risk of the
         other equity interests has been taken into account
       the derivative ﬁnancial instruments are stated at fair value which is calculated by
         discounting their future cash ﬂows at the appropriate rates taken from the current interest
         curve in determining the discount rate the own risk proﬁle including the credit risk has
         been taken into account and
       the interestbearing loans are bonds with a listing on the amsterdam stock exchange and
         private loans the fair value of the bonds is the market value at the yearend closing price
         the fair value of the private loans has been calculated by discounting the future cash ﬂows

other information
provisions of the articles of association governing proﬁt appropriation
the executive board does not consider it necessary to add proﬁt to reserves pursuant to article
39 paragraph 2 of the articles of association as a result the proﬁt is at the free disposal of the
general meeting of shareholders


the company may make distributions to shareholders and other persons entitled to receive part
of the distributable proﬁt only insofar as its equity exceeds the total issued share capital plus
the reserves that must be maintained by law



proposed appropriation of the result
the executive board proposes that  1393 million of the proﬁt for 2013 be added to the general
reserve and  3251 million be distributed to the shareholder


the proposed dividend payment for 2013 is signiﬁcantly higher than the dividend payment
for 2012  2152 million this is partly due to the oneoff release of the provision for pension
liabilities in the netherlands in 2013

the environment and supply chain responsibility employees and gasunie in society in the report of nv
nederlandse gasunie is free from material misstatement


an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements the procedures selected depend on the auditors
judgment including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial
statements whether due to fraud or error in making those risk assessments the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of
the ﬁnancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entitys internal control an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements


the procedures performed in order to obtain limited assurance regarding the nonﬁnancial
information aim to assess the plausibility of this information and are limited primarily to
inquiries of entitys personnel and analytical procedures applied to nonﬁnancial data and
therefore provide less assurance than assurance engagements aimed at obtaining reasonable
assurance


we believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion and for our conclusion



opinion with respect to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
in our opinion the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the ﬁnancial
position of nv nederlandse gasunie as at 31 december 2013 and of its result and its cash ﬂows
for the year then ended in accordance with international financial reporting standards as
adopted by the european union and with part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code

      annex ii reporting principles


        reporting policy
        in this report we follow as far as possible the transparency criteria of the dutch ministry of
        economic affairs agriculture and innovations the report has been drawn up in accordance
        with the criteria for 2014 the gri guidelines have been applied at level c


        we report on the most relevant performance indicators that follow from our strategy
        all aspects that directly affect the realisation of our strategy have been included in this
        report these include indicators in the ﬁelds of ﬁnance health safety the environment and
        sustainability wherever possible the data with regard to the environment have been placed
        in a multiyear perspective in order to show longterm developments


        this report is intended for all our stakeholders both internally and externally for
        environmental reasons it will only be published online on our website a printed version
        can be provided on request speciﬁc terminology used in this report is explained in annex i
        terminology


        reporting process
        in collecting the basic data for this report both internal and external sources such as
        manuals management information systems and thirdparty data were consulted all
        departments bearing ﬁnal responsibility for executing our key policy themes were also
        involved for the most part these departments were safety finance hr communications
        and public affairs both in the netherlands and germany the data they provided were
        consolidated internally while the annual accounts were audited by an external expert the
        report has been approved by the executive board


        coverage
        this report covers gasunie in the netherlands gasunie in germany gts and participations
        such as bbl company in which gasunie has in terms of capital provision a majority
        shareholding of 60 in so far as they are available ﬁgures relating to these parts of our
        company have been included in the overall ﬁgures and results with regard to matters
        relating to safety health and the environment the data recorded in the netherlands and
        germany differ somewhat whenever possible data from the netherlands and germany
        have been combined where this was not possible the data are presented separately
        participations in which we have a minority shareholding in terms of capital provision have
        not been included in the report our subsidiary gts issues its own annual report in which
        the speciﬁc results of the tso are reported in more detail


        scope
        this report gives an account of our efforts in the reporting year 2013 which runs from 1 janu
        ary 2013 up to and including 31 december 2013 we report on our role as a transporter of natu
        ral gas a supplier of related services in the gas value chain and as owner and operator of the
        dutch national gas transport grid in this report we describe our mission strategy and the
        principal outcomes of our operational management as well as sketching the most signiﬁ
        cant internal and external developments affecting that management we indicate how we
        are responding to these developments and since we take our responsibilities as part of the

                                                                                                  195


supply chain seriously we also clearly distinguish those activities that we carry out as part
of good supply chain management finally safety is a major priority for us and we encour
age safety awareness among our contractors given the importance of safety this report also
contains a summary of the safety performance of our contractors other performance data
such as those of suppliers have not been taken into account


veriﬁcation
as required by law our annual accounts have been audited by an external accountant ernst
 young accountants llp since ernst  young have not only audited our accounts but also
veriﬁed our nonﬁnancial data in the ﬁeld of corporate social responsibility the auditors
letter and the assurance report have been combined in this annual report this includes veri
ﬁcation that the report complies with the gri guidelines 31


measuring and registration systems
the environment data of gasunie in the netherlands are generally measured and recorded as
follows
 the amount of waste removed is measured by waste collectors and processors
   they register this on weighing slips bills of lading invoices quarterly reports and
   annual overviews all of which are passed on to us the processing methodology they
   use is described in those documents these annual overviews form the basis of the data
   reported by gasunie
 possible soil pollution is recorded in soil inspection reports the progress of
   investigations and any cleanup operations are registered centrally in a database from
   which we extract data for this report
 data relating to the use of energy and water are derived from the overviews provided by
   the suppliers of energy and water at our principal locations the data relating to the other
   locations are estimated based on normal usage andor thirdparty invoices
 air emissions are mainly registered by the olympus computer system developed
   for registering compressor data emissions of co2 ch4 and nox are calculated on the
   basis of the fuel consumption of the machines which is measured continuously each
   machine has its own emission characteristics which have been registered in olympus
   the registration is corrected manually before and after operation of the compressors
 data on fugitive emissions are obtained from recent measurements in accordance
   with the epa21 method and from historical research into the emissions at speciﬁc types
   of locations
 hfc emissions are calculated on the basis of amounts in kg recorded in the logbooks at
   the various locations
 all deviations from environmental standards are registered according to their cause in an
   internal database from which the reported data are derived
 speciﬁcations of raw materials are based on purchasing data with the exception of the
   usage of odorant which is calculated
 speciﬁcations of nitrogen are based on purchasing data and on the data recorded at the
   ommen and kootstertille locations

196


      environmental data relating to gasunie in germany have been collected in various ways
      these include direct measurement electricity water consumption and emissions
      indirect measurement eg calculations of co2 and nox and emissions of fuel gas and
      registration waste collection reported by external suppliers all data have been entered
      into our environment database this database is the source of all forms of environmental
      reporting this includes our emissions trading which is audited and certiﬁed each year by an
      independent third party


      management systems
      every year our performance with regard to the main key performance indicators is assessed
      including in internal and external audits on the basis of the results of these assessments
      and audits we determine whether our management systems are working properly and
      whether any adjustments are needed we also decide whether it is necessary or desirable
      to sharpen or modify the focus of our policy and targets we comply with all national and
      international legislation in so far as it applies to our company in addition we have set
      our own more stringent requirements this is because we believe it is important that our
      performance is based on clear standards and values our technical standards are speciﬁed
      in the gasunie technical standards and our safety health and environment standards
      are speciﬁed in our commitment to safety health and environment policy in our code
      of conduct we explain how we expect our employees to behave with respect to integrity
      safety and accountability we have a whistleblower policy for reporting suspicions of
      improper conduct and a counsellor has been appointed to deal with any reports we have
      also set up a complaints committee to which employees can turn with any complaints and
      counsellors are available for speciﬁc areas eg bullying and harassment finally we always
      make sure we handle with care any complaints that arise from the local communities in
      which we work our policy with regard to safety and the environment is iso 14001certiﬁed

                                                                                                 197


annex iii product and supplier information
  markets and customers
  our most important markets are the netherlands and germany in addition we serve as a
  transport hub transporting gas to and from other countries our customers consist mainly
  of shippers traders and directly connected parties industries regional network operators
  private network operators foreign network operators gas producers operators of gas
  storages and operators of lng plants more details are given in the annual report of gts


  production factors
  the most important products and services that enable us to deliver our services are the
  following
   building managing and maintaining the pipeline network and installations
   the supply of materials for the purposes of building managing and maintaining the
     pipeline network and equipment
   fuel gas electricity and nitrogen
   an it network for efﬁciently planning the transport of gas
   facility services and temporary staff


  origins of raw materials materials products and services
  most of what we buy comes from the european union broken down into countries 83 of
  our supplies come from the netherlands 10 from germany 6 from belgium and 1 from
  the uk


  selecting suppliers
  before entering into a contract with a major new supplier we investigate its integrity
  its solvency and the composition of its customer portfolio to ensure that it is not unduly
  dependent on only one or just a few customers


  in making our selection we apply the legally obligatory selfassessment form to check
  whether any circumstances exclude a supplier from accepting tenders eg membership of a
  criminal organisation bribery fraud or money laundering we regularly check suppliers on
  their safety and quality performance in the event of persistent underperformance we cease
  working with the supplier in question


  code of conduct for suppliers
  we have drawn up a code of conduct for suppliers amongst other things the code covers
  safety health and environmental matters it also forbids dealing in or buying products made
  using child labour the code of conduct is in line with the code of conduct that applies to
  our own employees and compliance with it forms part of the selection procedure for new
  suppliers

198


      supplier categories
      we divide our product and service groups into the following categories
       strategic
           suppliers of strategic products andor services are subject to stringent requirements
           this is because any interruption of supply entails a high risk for us and the cost of ﬁnding
           a new supplier is high
       critical
           suppliers of critical products andor services are subject to relatively light requirements
           this is because ﬁnding a new supplier incurs costs interruption of the orderrelated
           supply does not entail a high risk
       nonstrategic noncritical
           all other products and services are classiﬁed as noncritical and nonstrategic


      the distribution of orders issued in 2013 was as follows

      category                                                       percentage

      facility services and temporary staff                                11




      the contractors we engage mainly come from the netherlands and germany


      we have no information about indirect suppliers subcontractors or the provenance of raw
      materials

                                                                                                     199


annex iv data regarding safety supply chain responsibility
and the environment

  safety
  monitoring our safety performance
  we report on our safety performance periodically and regularly carry out analyses we believe
  that this is the best way of monitoring our performance in this ﬁeld we learn continuously
  and always seek to improve our performance for example we have set up kpis for injuries
  requiring medical treatment and for the number of pipeline incidents the results are
  included in our collective targets as we believe that all employees bear responsibility in such
  matters


  we have a safety support team which tracks our performance the team deals with the
  practical implementation of policy objectives on the work ﬂoor the team is composed of
  employees who have extensive operational experience and are close to those employed on
  the work ﬂoor


  safety in the workplace prevention is better than cure
  we take a proactive approach to preventing accidents at work with regard to both our own
  employees and employees of third parties everyone who works for us is obliged to comply
  with the applicable working conditions legislation and our own additional requirements
  moreover when accidents incidents and dangerous situations are reported we determine
  what measures need to be taken to prevent such incidents in the future


  we devote considerable attention to creating a healthy and safe working environment both
  in our ofﬁces and in the ﬁeld our hrm manual speciﬁes a number of regulations for this
  purpose from rules relating to ergonomic work stations for ofﬁce staff to procedures to be
  followed by employees working in the ﬁeld


  since we want our employees to be safe not only when they are on our premises but also
  when they are on the move we have included a blanket ban on making phone calls even
  handsfree while driving this rule may only be overridden in dire emergencies our
  employees also follow various courses on safety matters


  promoting safety awareness an ongoing effort
  golden rules of safety
  we do our best to ensure that no accidents take place during our working operations that is
  why we enforce strict rules regarding safe and responsible working we place great emphasis
  on safety awareness so that our employees apply these rules properly we have drawn up
  a top ten of the risks that occur most frequently during our operations for each of these
  risks we have indicated how they can best be avoided these are our golden rules of safety
  which have to be observed during all working activities and operations these rules which
  were introduced in 2011 are available in dutch german and english we have summarised
  them on a handy card that staff can easily refer to at work we have also launched a special
  website not only for our own employees but also for those of other ﬁrms with whom we
  work


  the rules help to increase the awareness of risk and safety and to prevent unsafe situations

200


      arising they make it clear that there are certain types of behaviour that are totally
      forbidden

      hse management code
      following the publication of our golden rules of safety it was decided that managers also
      required guidance in safety matters after all they need to take important decisions that
      require them to weigh aspects of health safety and environment hse against for instance
      questions of time and money we have therefore laid down guidelines for managers in the
      hse management code


      overview of our policy gasunie  safety brochure
      there is considerable public interest in how we deal with safety matters government
      bodies such as licensing authorities and regulators ﬁnd it helpful to gain some insight into
      our processes and our health safety  environment policy in 2013 to share our knowledge
      and experience in these areas and ensure consistency in our communications on such
      matters we published a brochure on this topic called gasunie  safety it focuses on four
      aspects of safety that are particularly relevant to our industry occupational safety process
      safety technical safety and external safety

                                                                                                  201


value chain responsibility
risks in the gas value chain
we try to keep the effect of our operations on people and the environment to a minimum
but activities within the gas value chain inevitably have an impact on people the
environment and society we therefore need to look ahead and anticipate speciﬁc
risks for example we are currently seeing new types of gas with new properties and a
different composition green gas is a case in point these new gases may impose different
requirements on the network itself and the gas equipment of consumers and industrial
users


to guarantee safety we need good research into the effects of these new gases as signiﬁcant
players in the chain we are keen to play our part that is why we have set requirements for
the composition of green gas to make sure that it can be safely injected into the national
gas transport network and can be used safely in this way we have laid down an important
basis and precondition for the development of the green gas market


another risk in the gas value chain is the fact that over time the production of gas in
europe is set to decline while the demand for natural gas will continue to rise to be able
to guarantee security of supply in the long term we need to import more gas from norway
or russia for example where there are still large reserves in addition there are increasing
opportunities for bringing liqueﬁed natural gas by ship from areas further away such as
africa or the middle east all this gas needs to be transported so gas transport networks will
need to be expanded and modiﬁed we also play a role here through active participation in
international pipeline projects by carrying out activities like these we promote the security
of supply in the future


collaboration within the chain
we participate in various vertical and horizontal collaborations to work on amongst other
things the transition to a sustainable energy supply the establishment of international
safety and environmental standards and the exchange of knowledge examples of such
collaborations are the following


 gas infrastructure europe gie
   gie is an organisation of some 70 european gas infrastructure companies its aim is to
   ﬁnd marketbased solutions to gas infrastructure problems whereby the interests of the
   network users are paramount for instance gie lobbies for a good regulatory climate
   within europe as a precondition for longterm security of supply


 entsog
   we also participate in entsog the european network for transmission system
   operators gas we are amongst other things a member of the board all tsos in the
   european union are obliged to join this organisation some of whose tasks are
   established in law these include drawing up european network codes and a tenyear
   network development plan at european level these contribute to the stable development
   of the european gas market

202


       groen gas nederland ggnl
         we also take part in groen gas nederland set up in 2011 ggnl is a foundation whose aim
         is to speed up the production and sale of green gas in the netherlands by bringing
         together knowledge in the ﬁeld of production upgrading and injection our
         participation in ggnl is in line with our sustainability strategy the foundations explicit
         target is to produce a total of 300 million m3 2930 million kwh of green gas with green
         gas projects in 2014


       other organisations
         we are members of various other european organisations such as eurogas marcogaz
         and gas transport europe gte we are also a member of the international gas union
         igu which represents the interests of the gas industry worldwide the active exchange
         of knowledge is high on the agenda of all these organisations with the aim of advancing
         safety health the environment and sustainability we are active in various workgroups


      to meet our chain responsibility in a wider sense too we participate in various horizontal
      collaborations including


       energy delta institute edi
         the energy delta institute is one of the organisations with whom we work on spreading
         knowledge of energy matters our partners in edi are gazprom the university of
         groningen gasterra and shell edis main goal is to contribute to the professional
         development of both the current managers in the energy sector and the managers of the
         future edi coordinates research projects and training programmes in the ﬁeld of energy


       energy valley
         the energy valley foundation was set up by government bodies companies and
         knowledge institutes its aim is to expand the energy economy and associated
         employment opportunities in the northern provinces of the netherlands it focuses
         on developing sustainable innovation projects the foundation supports initiators in a
         variety of ways by helping them draw up project proposals for instance or ﬁnd
         appropriate partners to work with


       energy valley top club
         gasunie is also a member of the energy valley top club among other things this group
         seeks to promote green energy among the public at large and to enthuse young
         people about sustainability and technology moreover the club aims to provide a
         meeting centre for the energy sector the energy valley top club has set up an alliance
         under the name of samen duurzaam aan de top to combine the various strengths of
         knowledge institutes organisations for highlevel sports in groningen business
         and social organisations in this way in the coming years members can work together
         on various projects to make the energy supply ever more sustainable

                                                                                                 203

environmental irregularities
we keep a careful record of environmental irregularities so that we can control them
and where possible take appropriate measures the number of reported environmental
irregularities per focus area for gasunie nederland is as follows

                                              2009   2010     2011     2012   2013

in 2013 a total of 197 environmental irregularities were reported at gasunie nederland one
deviation from laws and regulations 57 environmental incidents and 139 environmental
complaints the total number of environmental incidents and complaints reported in 2013
was approximately the same as in 2012 of the 139 environmental complaints that were
reported in the year under review 13 had not been caused by us in 35 other environmental
complaints no irregularities were found at the scene in 91 of the environmental complaints
irregularities were found and dealt with in accordance with the applicable procedures


of the 148 justiﬁed environmental irregularities 2012 156 71 were related to emissions to
the air 17 to emissions to the soil 11 noise emissions and 1 emissions to water these
values are therefore of the same order as in 2012 at gasunie deutschland one environmental
complaint relating to noise was reported in 2013


refrigerants
we use various types of refrigerant in cooling installations for industrial cooling and air
conditioning purposes in accordance with the montréal protocol we have modiﬁed our
policy and we will terminate the use of refrigerant r22 at the latest in 2015 in 2013 small
leaks of refrigerants occurred at six locations the table below gives an overview of these
refrigerant leaks

      note this table has been drawn up on the basis of purchasing ﬁgures with the exception of odorant use these may diﬀer from the

      actual use due to changes in stock

       diesel oil is used by gasunie deutschland only for the emergency power generators and is therefore bought only rarely

       methanol glycol and odorant are not used by gasunie deutschland


      nitrogen
      to make highcaloriﬁc natural gas of a quality suitable for certain market segments we
      add nitrogen to the natural gas at a number of locations in our gas transport network
      the nitrogen added at our installations at wieringermeer pernis and the maasvlakte was
      procured from third parties at our installations in ommen and kootstertille the nitrogen
      added was produced by us the following table indicates our use of nitrogen

      description                                                              2009           2010          2011           2012            2013

      remarkably the volume of nitrogen used for the quality conversion of highcaloriﬁc gas h
      gas to groningen gas g gas in 2012 and 2013 was considerably lower than in the preceding
      years this is because in 2012 and 2013 considerably more g gas was produced and there was
      therefore less need to convert h gas to pseudo groningen pseudo g gas a process that
      involves the addition of nitrogen

                                                                                                                      205


acidifying substances
in our gas turbines gas motors and heating installations we use natural gas as a fuel
during this process acidifying substances nox are emitted the nox emissions in 2013
amounted to 466 tonnes 2012 404 tonnes


to ﬁnd out whether our compressor stations meet the new requirements of the european
guideline for industrial emissions9 we have conducted talks with the dutch ministry of
infrastructure  environment im about the possible timetable for implementing this
legislation we currently have a number of gas turbines that do not yet meet the nox
requirements in the new guidelines we have therefore started the process of enabling our
gasﬁred compressors to meet the new requirements one of the measures we intend to take
is to install ﬂue gas cleaning in the exhaust gas ducts of two gas turbines at ravenstein


many of our gas turbines are only used for a very limited number of hours usually less than
500 hours per year but they are necessary in order to be able to meet the gas demand in
extreme weather conditions severe winters

the rise in nox emissions at gasunie in the netherlands was mainly caused by the harsh
winter at the start of 2013 in germany nox emissions in 2013 fell slightly from 107 to 101

      soil pollution
      gasunies soil policy aims to prevent or limit soil pollution to control risks to the soil and to
      fully rectify any soil incidents that may occur typical soilpolluting substances at gasunie
      are lubricating oil diesel oil polycyclic aromatics and odorant we perform soil inspections
      in the following cases
       at locations suspected to be contaminated onsite soil inspection in consequence
         of the duty of care imposed by article 13 of the dutch soil protection act the soil must
         be inspected at locations and installations which are suspected to be at greater risk of
         soil pollution we also perform inspections at locations such as pipeline routes ﬁlledin
         ditches and the like which are known to have been contaminated by third parties in the
         past
       at locations where groundwater is extracted
       to determine the zero situation at places where there are plans to locate or expand
         installations or buildings


      soil decontamination
      soil pollution incidents that took place after 1987 are subject to the duty of care imposed in
      article 13 of the dutch soil protection act this article requires that such cases of pollution
      often called duty of care cases must be decontaminated immediately in a number of
      different ways historical instances of soil pollution are decontaminated in the most
      efﬁcient way preferably in combination with maintenance activities or new building
      projects


      if the pollution was caused by gasunie we remove the polluted soil if the pollution was
      caused by a third party the polluted soil if possible and permissible will be preserved in
      depot and replaced later


      in 2013 we carried out soil decontaminations at 30 locations at 8 locations the
      decontamination took place in the context of the duty of care while at 4 locations
      the polluted soil was removed temporarily in 2013 we completed the compressed air
      decontamination started in 2010 at the lng maasvlakte site at 47 locations we monitored
      the quality of the groundwater at 8 locations we carried out investigations to establish the
      situation at the time


      noise emissions
      dutch law requires that noise reduction measures need to be taken in the case of newbuild
      stations in the case of major modiﬁcations to stations and in the event of complaints
      in 2013 we carried out 29 noise measurements and 12 calculations in connection with
      applications for environmental permits projects and other situations in which as a result
      of modiﬁcations noise problems could possibly arise we carried out 10 studies and 8 noise
      measurements in order to verify whether we were complying with the permit conditions we
      noticed two excesses which necessitated measures being carried out in addition we took
      another 21 measurements for internal purposes 20 of which were for the gnip programme
      and one due to a noise complaint

                                                                                                    207

number of calculations for requesting environmental permits    12      4      4       9        10




our policy in germany with regard to noise emissions is that measures will be taken if
complaints have been raised or if noise problems might occur as a consequence of an
adjustment gasunie deutschland has a noise register for all relevant systems noise
measurements will be carried out for all new buildings and in the event of signiﬁcant
changes at existing installations


financial penalties
in 2013 we were ﬁned a total of  6000 for extracting too much groundwater in connection
with newbuild projects


footprint reduction
it is our aim that our operational activities impose as small a burden on the environment
as possible we are therefore actively trying to reduce our environmental footprint ways
we are doing this include continuing to improve our energy efﬁciency and reducing the
emission of greenhouse gases during our activities our ambition is by the year 2020
to reduce emissions of co2 equivalents by 20 compared to 1990 in 2013 we took a
number of measures to meet this ambition described in more detail under environmental
performance a complete summary of measures regarding both the process approach in
improving energy efﬁciency and the reduction of methane emissions can be found in our
report entitled footprint at gasunie it describes how our ambition originated and the
principles on which our footprint strategy is based


energy efﬁciency
one aspect of our footprint reduction efforts includes increasing energy efﬁciency this not
only involves reexamining our gas transport system process to see how we can save energy
there but also looking at energy efﬁciency in other aspects of our operations such as in
our ofﬁces examples of how we may be able to save energy in our operations include the
possibility of lowering incoming pressure installing thermal insulation in heat networks
and reducing the temperature at our gas receiving stations at those stations the pressure
of the natural gas is adjusted to the pressure in the regional distribution network during
this process the gas cools so much that heating is required to bring the gas back to the
contractually agreed temperature


in the netherlands this heating requires some 30 million m³of natural gas per year which
is a considerable amount we therefore investigated whether this could be done more
efﬁciently  and it could in a pilot project carried out in the summer of 2013 at the metering
and regulation station at nederweert pressure was reduced by two bar this resulted in
savings of fuel gas and an associated reduction of co2 of about 5

208


      methane emissions
      we also took measures to reduce the emission of methane during our activities where
      possible and feasible we use a mobile recompressor or combustion unit this limits the
      venting of gas during operations in our results section we explain the savings that we
      were able to achieve using recompression and describe the speciﬁc efforts we are making to
      improve energy efﬁciency


      sustainable transport
      one of our collective objectives is to reduce the number of kilometres driven for business
      purposes we therefore encourage the use of meeting methods that do not require
      employees to be physically present in the same room we do that for example by providing
      good facilities for teleconferencing videoconferencing and working from home in 2013
      we took a big step forward in facilitating working from home by providing associated
      technological support for example most employees have been provided with a mobile
      phone or smartphone and in 2013 we installed a new it architecture and new computers
      for all employees these enable them to work independently of time and location whether
      alone or together this makes for more effective business operations and makes work more
      enjoyable having said that we do believe that for the purposes of teamwork it is good that
      employees meet regularly in person

                                                                                                                     209


hse programme 2014
on the basis of the hse management review 20112012 which serves as a basis for our hse
policy we will carry out the following hse programme in 2014

external safety

high priority for reaching an agreement with the ministry of infrastructure  environment about the calculation

methods
continuing vigilance to prevent pipeline damage especially to pipelines with little cover

technical safety

relieving bottlenecks in pressure control systems

improving the process with respect to maintenance concepts

implementing kpis with respect to technical safety and process safety

occupational safety

encouraging employees to adopt behavioural changes on the work ﬂoor that will improve occupational safety

increasing the level of knowledge about occupational safety

the environment and sustainable development

implementing the footprint strategy plan

investigating and comparing the measurement methods for fugitive emissions of natural gas

starting a programme for measuring and preventing fugitive emissions of natural gas at gas receiving stations

applying pressure reduction to a number of metering and regulating stations during the summer to reduce the use of

natural gas
starting a project for placing ﬂue gas cleaning in the exhaust duct of compressors this technology is one of the

measures to ensure that the compressors comply with the new nox emission requirements
optimising energy efﬁciency at gas receiving stations

gasunie deutschland setting up a register for recording data on natural gas emissions in various parts of the gas

transport system in order to eventually reduce methane emissions
hse culture and communication

continuing to stimulate safety awareness and safety behaviour

raising hse awareness among management and employees




awareness
both in the netherlands and in germany in 2013 we carried out a number of awareness
campaigns to make employees more aware of co2 compensation of business kilometres and
other activities in 2013 gasunie deutschland started a programme for co2 compensation of
train and air travel
