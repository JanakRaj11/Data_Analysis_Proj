spescom its fresh leadership and the restructuring
of the organisation for growth are also excellent
indications of a promising year ahead

our strategic relationship with rio tinto is of
a longterm nature and although potentially
promising we do not expect to see an earnings
impact during the ensuing year

welcome and appreciation
the board welcomes mrs yasmin masithela and
mr garth napier to our family as independent
nonexecutive directors the newest and youngest
members of our board have both excelled in
their respective fields and we are excited to be
in a position to achieve successes and overcome
challenges alongside them

                                      i see risk as key to the future of any business after all it is a flip side of a coin on the one hand you
                                      have your objectivesstrategy and on the other you have your risks and the plan on how you plan to
                                      mitigate them apart from continuing to foster the culture of risk management within afrocentric health
                                      i also hope that over and above the current focus on risks to strategy in future the risk management
                                      discipline can also play a role in clarifying and defining the risk of strategy of the business he says

                                      describing his attitude kabelo says we are all out there doing our best so in my daytoday
                                      work i try not to get caught up in the drama  instead i try to deal with issues with objectivity

             ias 17 leases amendment  classification of leases of land and buildings
             the amendment deals with leases that include both land and buildings elements where an entity assesses the
             classification of each element as a finance or an operating lease separately in accordance with paragraphs
             713 in determining whether the land element is an operating or a finance lease an important consideration
             is that land normally has an indefinite economic life

                         not been early adopted by the company continued
                         ias 12 income taxes on deferred tax currently ias 12 income taxes requires an entity to measure the
                         deferred tax relating to an asset depending on whether the entity expects to recover the carrying amount of
                         the asset through use or sale it can be difficult and subjective to assess whether recovery will be through use
                         or through sale when the asset is measured using the fair value model in ias 40 investment property hence
                         this amendment introduces an exception to the existing principle for the measurement of deferred tax assets or
                         liabilities arising on investment property measured at fair value as a result of the amendments sic 21 income
                         taxes  recovery of revalued nondepreciable assets would no longer apply to investment properties carried
                         at fair value the amendments also incorporate into ias 12 the remaining guidance previously contained in
                         sic 21 which is accordingly withdrawn effective date 1 january 2012


                         ifrs 9 financial instruments this ifrs is part of the iasbs project to replace ias 39 ifrs 9 addresses
                         classification and measurement of financial assets and replaces the multiple classification and measurement
                         models in ias 39 with a single model that has only two classification categories amortised cost and fair value

                         ifric 14 prepayments of a minimum funding requirement this amendment will have a limited impact as it
                         applies only to companies that are required to make minimum funding contributions to a defined benefit
                         pension plan it removes an unintended consequence of ifric 14 related to voluntary pension prepayments
                         when there is a minimum funding requirement effective date 1 january 2011


                         the group has assessed the significance of these new standards amendments and interpretations and
                         concluded that they will have no material financial impact on the annual financial statements

           basis of presentation
           the annual financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following


           carried at fair value
           n financial instruments held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss
           n investment property is held at fair value using independent market valuations


           the preparation of the annual financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of estimates and assumptions
           that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
           of the annual financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods
           although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions actual results may
           differ from those estimates


           basis of consolidation
           subsidiaries
           the consolidated annual financial statements incorporate the annual financial statements of the company and entities
           including special purpose entities controlled by the company it is available at the premises of the companys offices
           being 37 conrad road florida north roodepoort 1709 control is achieved where the company has the power to govern
           the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights of
           an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities


           the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when
           assessing whether the group controls another entity


           results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of
           comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate

                                                                                               afrocentric integrated annual report 2011   49

    basis of consolidation continued
    subsidiaries continued
    intercompany transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated
    unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred


    where necessary adjustments are made to the annual financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting
    policies in line with those used by other members of the group


    a listing of the companys principal subsidiaries is set out in note 13 to the group annual financial statements


    business combinations
    the purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group the cost of the
    acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given liabilities incurred
    or assumed and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree plus any costs directly
    attributable to the business combination the acquirees identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet
    the conditions for recognition under ifrs 3 are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date


    the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is
    recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the groups share of the net assets of the
    subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income


    the interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value
    of the assets liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised

    transactions with minority interests
    the group applies a policy of treating transactions with minority interests as transactions with parties external to the
    group disposals to minority interests result in gains and losses for the group that are recorded in the statement of
    comprehensive income purchases from minority interests result in goodwill being the difference between any consideration
    paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary


    associates
    associates are entities over which the company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest
    in a joint venture significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the
    investee but is not control or joint control over those policies and is generally associated with a shareholding of between
    20 and 50 of the voting rights


    the annual financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events in similar
    circumstances which have occurred within the group


    investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting under this method the companys share
    of the postacquisition profits and losses of associates is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and
    the share of postacquisition reserves is recognised in reserves the cumulative postacquisition movements are adjusted
    against the cost of the investment when the companys share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in
    the associate including any other unsecured receivables the company does not recognise further losses unless it has
    incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate


    unrealised gains on transactions between the company and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the companys
    interest in the associates unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment
    of the asset transferred

    foreign currency translation continued
    group companies
    the results and financial position of all group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy
    that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as
    follows
    n assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date
        of that statement of financial position and
    n income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates unless
        this average is not a reasonable approximate of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates
        in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions


    exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to shareholders
    equity on consolidation


    when a foreign operation is sold such exchange differences are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
    as part of the gain or loss on sale


    goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of
    the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate

    recognition of assets
    the group recognises assets when it obtains control of a resource as a result of a past event from which future economic
    benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise


    tangible assets
    property plant and equipment
    office equipment motor vehicles furniture and fittings and computer equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation and impairment historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items


    subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only
    when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the
    item can be measured reliably all other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income
    during the financial period in which they are incurred


    depreciation is charged on the straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets


    the estimated maximum useful lives are
    n office equipment and furniture and fittings              6 years
    n motor vehicles                                           5 years
    n computer equipment                                       3 to 5 years


    the residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed on an annual basis and if appropriate are adjusted accordingly


    an assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater
    than its estimated recoverable amount


    assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or
    where shorter the term of the relevant lease


    surpluses and deficits on the disposal of property plant and equipment are charged to the statement of comprehensive
    income

           initial recognition
           investment property is initially recognised at cost


           subsequent measurement
           the entity adopts the fair value model in terms of ias 40


           subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only
           when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the
           item can be measured reliably all other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income
           during the financial period in which they are incurred


           deferred tax on fair value adjustments is provided for at the capital gain tax rate of 14 due to the fact that the company
           intends to recover the value of investment property through sale and not through use


           the carrying amount of the investment property is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets
           carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount

           intangible assets
           intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment


           goodwill
           goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the net identifiable
           assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in the
           investments in associates and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance separately recognised goodwill is
           tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses impairment losses on goodwill
           are not reversed gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the
           entity sold


           goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units for the purpose of impairment testing the allocation is made to those
           cashgenerating units or groups of cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in
           which the goodwill arose the group allocates goodwill to each business segment in each country in which it operates


           contractual customer relationships
           acquired contractual customer relationships from business combinations are recognised at fair value at acquisition
           date contractual customer relationships intangible assets are amortised using the straightline method over their useful
           lives of five and ten years respectively management reviews the carrying value where objective evidence of impairment
           exists the carrying value is written down to estimated recoverable amount when a permanent decrease in value occurs
           any impairment is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when incurred


           trademarks and brands
           acquired trademarks and brands are shown at fair value trademarks and brands have a finite useful life and are initially
           measured at fair value and subsequently amortised over its useful life amortisation is calculated using the straightline
           method to allocate the cost of trademarks and brands over their estimated useful lives of ten years the carrying value
           of these intangible assets is assessed for any impairment if impairment indicators exist and any required adjustment will
           be expensed in the statement of comprehensive income

    intangible assets continued
    internally generated computer software development costs
    costs associated with developing computer software programmes are generally expensed as incurred however costs that
    are clearly associated with an identifiable and unique product which will be controlled by the group and have a profitable
    benefit exceeding the cost beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets


    the following criteria are required to be met before the related expenses can be capitalised as an intangible asset these
    criteria are
    n the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale
    n its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it
    n its ability to use or sell the intangible asset
    n how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits among other things the entity can
        demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or if it is
        to be used internally the usefulness of the intangible asset
    n the availability of adequate technical financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell
        the intangible asset and
    n its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development


    expenditure that enhances and extends the benefits of computer software programmes beyond their original specifications
    and lives is recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the software


    computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straightline method over their useful
    lives not exceeding a period of fifteen years


    directly attributable costs associated with the acquisition and installation of software are capitalised

    computer software acquired
    acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the cost incurred to acquire and bring to use the
    specific software these costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives two to seven years the carrying value of
    these intangible assets is assessed for any impairment if impairment indicators exist and any required adjustment will be
    expensed in the statement of comprehensive income


    impairment of assets
    impairment of tangible and intangible assets
    at each statement of financial position date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets
    to determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss if any such indication
    exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of
    an individual asset the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs


    the recoverable amount of an asset or a cashgenerating unit is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value
    in use value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cashgenerating
    unit fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset or cashgenerating unit in an arms
    length transaction between knowledgeable willing parties less the costs of disposal


    if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset
    is reduced to its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss under impairment
    provision against tangible and intangible assets during the current and previous years no such impairment occurred

           impairment of tangible and intangible assets continued
           an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount
           where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of
           its recoverable amount but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have
           been determined net of amortisation had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years a reversal
           of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss under impairment provision against intangible assets
           unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as
           a revaluation increase


           finance leases
           the group is the lessee
           leases of assets where the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
           leases assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of
           the leased assets and the present value of the minimum lease payments the corresponding liability to the lessor is
           included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation under borrowings minimum lease payments
           are apportioned using the effective interest method between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as
           to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability


           the finance charge element of the lease payment is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the lease
           period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period


           tangible and intangible assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated or amortised in accordance with the
           respective accounting policies management assesses the economic useful life in accordance with the accounting policies
           related to all fixed assets


           if there is no reasonable certainty that the group will obtain ownership of the asset at the end of its lease term then the
           asset is amortised over the shorter of the assets useful life and the lease term

           operating leases
           the group is the lessee
           leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases
           rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis
           over the term of the relevant lease lease incentives received are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
           as an integral part of the total lease expense


           when an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired any payment required to be made to the
           lessor by way of penalty is recognised in full as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place


           the group is the lessor
           the group has entered into sublease agreements on some of the operating leases that it has entered into as lessee
           the rental income is recognised on a straightline basis over the lease term lease incentives granted are recognised as
           an integral part of the total rental income


           direct costs incurred in concluding an operating sublease are amortised over the lease term as previously discussed
           paragraph 52 of ias 17 is not relevant as the underlying asset is leased in terms of an operating lease and is not reflected
           on the statement of financial position

    financial assets
    a financial asset is any asset that is
    a cash
    b an equity instrument of another entity
    c a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity or to exchange financial assets
          or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity or
    d a contract that will or may be settled in the entitys own equity instruments and is either a nonderivative for which
          the entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entitys own equity instruments or a derivative
          that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a
          fixed number of the entitys own equity instruments


    financial assets are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the contract


    at initial recognition management determines the appropriate classification of financial assets attributable to shareholders
    or policyholders as follows
    n financial assets at fair value through profit and loss comprise financial assets held for shortterm profit taking
       if elected financial assets may also be classified as held at fair value through profit and loss when initially recognised
       where this option has been elected the financial assets are designated as financial instruments at fair value through
       profit and loss
    n held to maturity investments are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity where
       management has both the intent and ability to hold to maturity
    n loans and receivables originated by the entity are financial assets that are created by the entity by providing money
       goods or services directly to a debtor other than those that are originated with the intention of sale immediately or
       in the short term
    n financial assets that are not classified as any of the above are classified as available for sale


    financial assets or a part of a financial asset are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial
    assets have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of
    ownership

    financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
    this category has two subcategories financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value through profit
    and loss at inception


    a financial asset is classified into the financial assets at fair value through income category at inception if acquired
    principally for the purpose of selling in the short term if it forms part of a portfolio of financial assets in which there is
    evidence of shortterm profittaking or if so designated by management


    financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are financial assets held for trading a financial asset is classified in
    this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term derivatives are also categorised as held
    for trading unless they are designated as hedges assets in this category are classified as current assets


    gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
    category are presented in the statement of comprehensive income within other lossesgains  net in the period in which
    they arise dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit and loss is recognised in the statement of
    comprehensive income when the companys right to receive payment is established the fair values of quoted instruments
    are based on current bid prices if the market for a financial asset is not active and for unlisted securities the company
    establishes fair value by using valuation techniques these include the use of recent arms length transactions reference
    to other instruments that are substantially the same discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models making
    maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entityspecific inputs

           financial assets at fair value through profit and loss continued
           financial assets designated as at fair value through profit and loss at inception are those that are
           n held in internal funds to match insurance and investment contracts liabilities that are linked to the changes in fair value
              of these assets the designation of these assets to be at fair value through profit and loss eliminates or significantly
              reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets and liabilities
              or recognising gains and losses on them on different bases or
           n managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis information about these financial assets is
               provided internally on a fair value basis to the companys key management personnel assets that are part of these
               portfolios are designated upon recognition at fair value through profit or loss


           the company assesses at each statement of financial position date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
           asset or a group of financial assets are impaired


           held to maturity financial assets
           these assets are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
           method less provision for impairment


           a provision for impairment of debt securities held to maturity is established when there is objective evidence that the
           group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to their original terms


           objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable data that comes to the
           attention of the group about the following events
           i   significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor
           ii a breach of contract such as a default or delinquency in payments
           iii it becoming probable that the issuer or debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation
           iv the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties or
           v observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flow from a group of
                 financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the
                 individual financial assets in the group including
                  adverse changes in the payment status of issuers or debtors in the group or
                  national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the group


           the group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are
           individually significant if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed
           financial asset whether significant or not it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk
           characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment assets that are individually assessed for impairment and
           for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment
           management assesses the yearly cash requirements and the fair value in determining whether or not the asset will be
           held to maturity


           if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on heldtomaturity investments carried at
           amortised cost the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present
           value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have been incurred discounted at the financial
           assets original effective interest rate the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance
           account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income if a heldtomaturity
           investment or a loan has a variable interest rate the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current
           effective interest rate determined under contract as a practical expedient the group may measure impairment on the
           basis of an instruments fair value using an observable market price

                                                                                                 afrocentric integrated annual report 2011   57

    held to maturity financial assets continued
    the group does not classify any financial assets as held to maturity if the entity has during the current financial period
    or during the two preceding financial periods sold or reclassified more than an insignificant amount of heldtomaturity
    investments before maturity more than insignificant in relation to the total amount of heldtomaturity investments other
    than sales or reclassifications that
    i   are so close to maturity or the financial assets call date for example less than three months before maturity that
          changes in the market rate of interest would not have a significant effect on the financial assets fair value
    ii occur after the entity has collected substantially all of the financial assets original principal through scheduled
          payments or prepayments or
    iii are attributable to an isolated event that is beyond the entitys control is nonrecurring and could not have been
          reasonably anticipated by the entity


    whenever sales or reclassification of more than an insignificant amount of held to maturity investments do not meet any
    of the conditions in listed above any remaining held to maturity investments shall be reclassified as available for sale
    on such reclassification the difference between their carrying amount and fair value shall be recognised directly in equity
    through the statement of changes in equity until the financial asset is derecognised at which time the cumulative gain
    or loss previously recognised in equity shall be recognised in profit or loss


    if as a result of a change in intention or ability it is no longer appropriate to classify an investment as held to maturity
    it shall be reclassified as available for sale and remeasured at fair value and the difference between its carrying amount
    and fair value shall be recognised directly in equity through the statement of changes in equity until the financial asset
    is derecognised at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity shall be recognised in profit or
    loss

    receivables from subsidiaries and group entities
    receivables from subsidiaries and group entities are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
    that are not quoted in an active market and with no intention of trading they are included in current assets and carried
    at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less required impairment


    when a financial asset or financial liability is recognised initially an entity shall measure it at its fair value plus in the
    case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs that are directly
    attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability


    trade and other receivables
    trade and other receivables comprise loans and receivables and receivables loans and receivables are recognised
    initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for
    impairment a provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence
    that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables significant
    financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default
    or delinquency in payments more than 30 days overdue are considered indicators that the receivable is impaired


    the amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present amount of estimated
    future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through
    the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
    within bad debt write off when a trade receivable is uncollectible it is written off against the allowance account for trade
    receivables subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against bad debt write off

           effective interest method less provision for impairment if they relate to financial assets the prepayments and deposits
           which relate to the receipt of goods or services are initially and subsequently measured at cost

           cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost for the purpose of the statement of cash flows cash includes cash on
           hand demand deposits and other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less
           that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value


           financial liabilities
           a financial liability is any liability that is
           a a contractual obligation
                 i   to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity or
                 ii to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially
                       unfavourable to the entity or
           b a contract that will or may be settled in the entitys own equity instruments and is
                 i   a nonderivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to deliver a variable number of the entitys own
                       equity instruments or
                 ii a derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another
                       financial asset for a fixed number of the entitys own equity instruments or

                       financial asset for a fixed number of the entitys own equity instruments


           financial liabilities or a part of a financial liability are derecognised when and only when it is extinguished ie when the
           obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires

           trade and other payables
           trade and other payables comprise payables classified as financial liabilities payables classified as financial liabilities are

           borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred borrowings are subsequently stated at
           amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amortised cost is recognised in
           the statement of comprehensive income under finance costs over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest
           method


           borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability
           for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date


           contingent liabilities
           contingent liabilities have been recognised as part of business combinations detailed in note 5 contingent liabilities are
           liabilities for which a reliable estimate can be made yet the probability of an outflow of economic benefits is remote


           the fair values of contingent liabilities recognised as part of the business combinations have been determined by
           management as the amounts that a third party would charge to assume the contingent liabilities these amounts reflect
           all expectations about possible cash flows and not the single most likely or the expected maximum or minimum cash flow

          assets and
    ii the amount initially recognised less when appropriate cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with ias 18
          revenue


    provisions
    provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events for
    which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
    can be made of the amount of the obligation


    provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation using a
    pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation
    the increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense in the statement of comprehensive
    income as finance costs

    employee costs
    pension and provident fund obligations
    the group operates a number of defined contribution plans the assets of which are held in separate trusteeadministered
    funds the pension and provident plans are funded by payments from employees and by the group taking account of

    comprehensive income in the period to which they relate the group has no further payment obligations once the
    contributions have been paid


    post employment medical obligations
    some of the retired employees are provided with post employment healthcare benefits no further post employment

    assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income under employee benefit costs interest
    costs are charged to the statement of comprehensive income as finance costs


    termination benefits
    termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or when an employee
    accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits the group recognises termination benefits when it is
    demonstrably committed to either
    n terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal
       or

    current and deferred income tax continued
    deferred income tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax basis
    of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the annual financial statements however the deferred income tax
    is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction other than a business
    combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss deferred income tax
    is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of financial
    position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability
    is settled


    deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
    against which the temporary differences can be utilised


    secondary tax on companies
    secondary tax on companies stc is provided for at a rate of 10 june 2010 10 on the amount by which

    in the event that the shares are cancelled upon reacquisition share capital and share premium are respectively reduced
    by the original issue price of the shares reacquired any difference between the original issue price and the reacquisition
    price is recognised as an increase or decrease in the retained earnings where such treasury shares are acquired and
    held by other members of the consolidated group the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity as

     2     critical accounting estimates and assumptions
           acquisition of administrators and consultants limited by medscheme holdings pty limited
           as part of the purchase price allocation of the administrators and consultants limited transaction in october 2010
           the group identified the following intangible assets


           contractual customer relationships
           the administration contracts with the medical schemes will result in the inflow of economic benefits to the group and as
           a result is considered to be an intangible asset


           the discounted cash flow technique was used to value the customer contracts at the date of acquisition operating profits
           before tax based on five year income and expenditure forecasts derived from managements strategic planning forecasts
           were used as cash flows a discount rate of 2081 was used which was considered to be appropriate for the industry
           in which administrators and consultants limited operates at the date of acquisition the useful life of this intangible asset
           has been estimated to be five years


           computer software
           administrators and consultants limited operates the following operational software systems
           n administrators and consultants limited uses the schema 6 system to assist with the administration of healthcare
             members the value of the schema 6 system was determined using the cost approach based on the costs incurred
             to replace the intellectual property the schema 6 system useful life has been assessed at 10 years


           acquisition of medscheme limited by lethimvula investments limited
           as part of the purchase price allocation of the medscheme limited transaction in september 2006 the group identified
           the following intangible assets


           contractual customer relationships
           the administration contracts with the medical schemes will result in the inflow of economic benefits to the group and as
           a result is considered to be an intangible asset

2   critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued
    acquisition of medscheme limited by lethimvula investments limited continued
    the discounted cash flow technique was used to value the customer contracts at the date of acquisition


    operating profits before tax based on five year income and expenditure forecasts derived from managements strategic
    planning forecasts were used as cash flows a discount rate of 1702 was used which was considered to be appropriate
    for the industry in which medscheme operates at the date of acquisition the useful life of this intangible asset has been
    estimated to either five or ten years


    present value of inforcebusiness pvif
    the pvif was calculated using the embedded value methodology and basis without deducting the opportunity cost of
    required statutory capital because pvif for embedded value purposes is usually calculated assuming emergence of future
    profits on a statutory liability valuation basis the pvif was modified to conform to the emergence of profits on the ifrs
    basis


    assumptions for mortality morbidity and terminations were consistent with the most recent experience investigations and
    future renewal expenses were based on the continuation of the medscheme life assurance company limited as a going
    concern combined with lethimvula investments limited


    economic assumptions future investment returns and inflation were based on market rates at the applicable date the
    rate of discount used was 1649 at date of acquisition the useful life has been assumed to be the full expected future
    duration of the policies in force allowing for expected attrition through mortality morbidity maturities and terminations

    computer software
    lethimvula investments limited operates the following operational software systems
    n lethimvula investments limited uses the ums system to assist with the management of healthcare cost and risk on
       behalf of the schemes the value of the ums system was determined using the cost approach based on the costs
       incurred to replace the intellectual property the ums system is currently being rewritten into the nexus system
       this exercise is estimated to be completed by 30 june 2013
    n the nexus administration system is used to manage the data of all clients within the lethimvula group no technology
       was therefore acquired relating to the use of this system as part of the business combination


    an assessment was performed on the medscheme data warehouse on revenue earned on sale of the information based
    on the results of the assessment and taking cognisance of the intrinsic value of this data in the valuation of the health
    risk solutions customer relationships no intangible asset was recognised


    brand
    one of the reasons for the acquisition was to acquire the medscheme brand and trademark well known in the medical
    scheme administration industry the medscheme brand was valued using the relief from royalty method which assumes the
    value of the asset to be estimated by reference to the royalty cost saving realised by not having to acquire the licence
    from a third party the royalty rate assumed after consideration of the influencing factors is a 1 pretax royalty


    it has been determined that the brand is intricately linked to the fate of the overall business and therefore the business
    wacc appropriately reflects the risks and has thus been used for the purpose of valuing the trade name the determined
    life of the brand after considering the strength of the brand and the life cycle of customers has been estimated to be
    ten years

     notes to the group financial statements
     for the year ended 30 june 2011




     2     critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued
           acquisition of medscheme limited by lethimvula investments limited continued
           contractual customer relationships
           the administration contract with spectramed medical scheme resulted in the inflow of economic benefits to the group
           and as a result was considered to be an intangible asset


           the discounted cash flow technique was used to value the customer contracts operating profits before tax based on five
           year income and expenditure forecasts derived from managements strategic planning forecasts were used as cash flows


           a discount rate of 1835 was used which is considered to be appropriate for the industry in which the group operates
           at date of acquisition the useful life of this intangible asset has been estimated to be ten years


           effective 1 january 2010 the spectramed medical aid fund is no longer administered by the group the customer
           relationship as of 1 january 2010 can no longer be substantiated and has been fully impaired as at 30 june 2010


           intellectual property
           acquired intellectual property from business combinations is recognised at fair value at acquisition date intellectual
           property intangible assets are amortised using the straightline method over their useful lives of five years management
           reviews the carrying value where objective evidence of impairment exists the carrying value is written down to estimated
           recoverable amount when a permanent decrease in value occurs any impairment is recognised in the statement of
           comprehensive income when incurred


           onerous lease provision
           the group has certain property lease obligations in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the lease
           contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it the unavoidable cost under a property lease
           contract is the aggregate value of the future lease payment to fulfil the obligations under the property leases less any
           potential future sublease payments received under sublease property contracts the onerous lease provision is measured
           at the net present value of the unavoidable costs


           the expected timing of the outflows under the onerous property lease contracts are monthly and are likely to continue
           until the lease term on the related property lease has expired the discount rate used to calculate the provision was
           based on the prevailing prime interest borrowing rate


           leases
           management assesses the substance of the lease transaction to determine whether the lease should be classified as a
           finance lease or an operating lease


           in assessing the classification of lease transactions management considers the following indicators which normally lead to
           a lease being classified as a finance lease
           i   the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term
           ii the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be sufficiently lower than the fair
                 value at the date the option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain at the inception of the lease that
                 the option will be exercised
           iii the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if title is not transferred
           iv at the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all
                 of the fair value of the leased asset and
           v the leased assets are of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use them without major modifications


           for the most part lease transactions entered into by the group relate to fixed property leases


           based on the above indicators leases are mostly assessed as being operating leases

                                                                                               afrocentric integrated annual report 2011   65




2   critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued
    income taxes
    the group is subject to direct taxation in a number of jurisdictions there may be transactions and calculations for which
    the ultimate taxation determination has an element of uncertainty during the ordinary course of business the group
    recognises liabilities based on objective estimates of the amount of taxation that may be due where the final taxation
    determination is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such difference will impact the income taxation
    and deferred taxation provisions in the period in which such determination is made the corporate tax rate applicable in
    south africa is 28


    carrying values of the group at 30 june 2011
    n deferred tax assets                  r67 million june 2010 r784 million
    n deferred tax liabilities             r373 million june 2010 r424 million
    n taxation liability                   r85 million june 2010 r32 million


    contingencies
    by their nature contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the assessment
    of such contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and estimates of the outcome of future
    events

    impairment of goodwill
    the recoverable amount of goodwill is tested annually for impairment in accordance with the stated accounting policy
    the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating units cgu has been determined based on valueinuse calculation
    being the net present value of the discounted cash flows of the cgu less the tangible net asset value of that cgu
    details of the main assumptions applied in determining the net present value of the cgu are provided in note 9 in these
    annual financial statements


    carrying value of tangible and intangible assets
    the group reviews and tests the carrying value of assets when events or changes in circumstances suggest that the
    carrying amount may not be recoverable assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are
    largely independent of cash flows of other assets if there are indications that impairment may have occurred estimates
    are prepared of expected future cash flows for each group of assets expected future cash flows used to determine the
    value in use of tangible assets are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time they are significantly
    affected by a number of factors


    the carrying amount of tangible and intangible assets at 30 june 2011 was r1112 million june 2010
    r1338 million and r6096 million june 2010 r5764 million respectively


3   financial risk management
    general
    risk management is a priority issue because it affects every part of the business it is a preemptive process that allows the
    group to assess and analyse risk in an integrated fashion identifying potential areas in advance and then to proactively
    create processes and measures for compliance


    fundamentally the boards responsibility in managing risk is to protect the groups employees its policyholders and the
    group in every facet it fully accepts overall responsibility for risk management and internal control and in so doing the
    board has deployed effective control mechanisms to prevent and mitigate the impact of risk


    primary responsibility for risk management at an operational level rests with the executive committee management and
    various specialist committees are tasked with integrating the management of risk into the daytoday activities of the group
    refer to the corporate governance statement for more detail regarding the committees involved in risk management

     notes to the group financial statements
     for the year ended 30 june 2011




     3     financial risk management continued
           general continued
           the healthcare and administration business activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks
           n market risk
           n credit risk and
           n liquidity risk


           the overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise
           potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the group


           the financial risk profile of the company remains unchanged since the prior period due to no significant changes in the
           healthcare business activities or operating environment


           market risk
           foreign exchange risk
           foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in
           a currency that is not the entitys functional currency


           the group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation
           risk currency exposure arising from the net assets of the foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings
           denominated in the relevant foreign currencies


           the group is not exposed to any foreign exchange risk in relation to its foreign operations in namibia and swaziland as
           the currencies of these countries are fixed to the south african rand


           cash flows from other foreign investments botswana and mauritius bear foreign exchange risk the most significant
           exposure is to the mauritian rupee and the botswana pula of which the value of the investments are r289 million june
           2010 r495 million and r65 million june 2010 r56 million respectively the impact of foreign exchange risk on profit
           and loss amounted to a profit of r11 million june 2010 r0093 million

           price risk
           the group is not exposed to equity securities price risk as it does not hold any equities as financial assets


           cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
           the interest rates of finance and operating leases to which the group is lessor or lessee are varying interest rates fixed
           to prime at inception of the contract these leases expose the healthcare business to fair value interest rate risk
           the cash flow interest rate risk arises from instalment sale agreements these amounts are immaterial and the financial
           risk of fluctuating prime rates is insignificant to the operations


           market risk sensitivity analysis
           the group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the statement of comprehensive
           income and equity of an instantaneous increase of 1 100 basis points in the market interest rates for each class of
           financial instrument with all other variables remaining constant the sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks
           on net post employment benefit obligations


           the group is not materially exposed to price and currency risk therefore no sensitivity analysis is deemed necessary

                                                                                                afrocentric integrated annual report 2011   67




3   financial risk management continued
    interest rate risks
    the interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions
    n changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments
    n changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed
       interest rates if these are recognised at their fair value and
    n changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging
       instruments and all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly affected


                                                                                                                          increase

    under these assumptions a 1 increase in market interest rates at 30 june 2011 would decrease profit before tax by
    approximately r16 million june 2010 r2486 million


    credit risk
    credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and other investments that is deposits with banks and financial
    institutions as well as credit exposures to clients including outstanding receivables and committed transactions for banks
    and financial institutions only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of a are accepted if clients do not have
    an independent rating risk control assesses the credit quality of the client taking into account its financial position past
    experience and other factors


    a significant portion of the client base comprises highcredit quality financial institutions the healthcare business has
    under agreement the authority to draw funds due and payable to it directly from the bank accounts of certain medical
    schemes using a collection module revenue from medical schemes is therefore settled in cash


    no credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non
    performance by these counterparties


    liquidity risk
    prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities the availability of funding
    through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet debt repayment and operating requirements


    management monitors the cash position on a daily basis due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses
    management maintains flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit facilities available management monitors rolling
    forecasts of the healthcare business liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flow

           management determines the recoverable amount of cashgenerating units as being the higher of net selling price or value
           in use in the absence of an active market value in use is used to determine the recoverable amount a traditional method
           of discounting managements best estimate of future cash flows attributable to the cashgenerating unit has been applied
           to determine the value in use a growth rate has been applied to cash flow streams to take into account the effect of
           inflation


           assumptions used in the calculation of the discount rate are as follows
           n r157 maturing in 2015 is yielding 793 as at 20 april 2009
           n a market risk premium of 7  8 is justified as the overall risk is to the downside cpi and gdp growth for 2009 is
              forecast to be 69 and 02 current account deficit is forecast to be 69 of gdp for 2009
           n beta of 11 is appropriate


           the net present value of these forecasts support the carrying value of the goodwill indicated above

                   companies with regard to closed medical schemes amounts invoiced to these clients are banked in advance before
                   invoice date and therefore the risk of nonrecovery is very low


                   provisions for impairment are raised when there is evidence that amounts are not recoverable in full or part from
                   the debtor disputed claims and long outstanding debts are usually indicators of nonrecovery the healthcare
                   business does not raise a general provision for all outstanding debtors due to the high quality of its debtors and
                   an impeccable repayment history the provision raised above relates to specific debtors

     a monthly dividend is paid to afrocentric calculated at 80 of the ruling prime interest rate on the issue price per
     preference share


     the preference shares will be redeemable at the discretion of jasco electronics holdings limited after three years but
     no later than five years from the date of issue


     afrocentric has entered into a put option agreement with jasco the put option agreement grants afrocentric the right
     to sell the preference shares to jasco for a consideration under certain circumstances

     substantially increased its ability to redeem the preference shares

            effective manner to exit from these onerous leases during july 2011 a final settlement amount has been negotiated
            with the landlord which represents a significant saving of future rental and operational costs associated with staying in
            bryanston the termination agreement is being finalised and could entail that medscheme relinquish its responsibilities with
            regard to the building from november 2011 upon which the onerous lease provision and straightline provision component
