i letter to stakeholders
                                     dear stakeholders

                                     2015 has been a very important year in the history of tnt a
                                     transitional year in which we took action to effect structural
                                     change and secure a profitable and sustainable future for our
                                     company

                                     yet the biggest event of the year was the announcement of the
                                     intended acquisition of tnt by fedex corporation fedex
                                     although not initiated by tnt the executive board fully supports
                                     this transaction as tnt and fedex share a commitment to serve
                                     customers and deliver value for stakeholders together tnt and
                                     fedex will create a leading global company providing logistics
                                     transportation and express delivery services customers will enjoy
                                     access to an enhanced integrated global network combining
                                     tnts strong european capabilities with fedexs strength in other
                                     regions globally substantial progress has been made towards
                                     finalising the intended acquisition and we continue to expect the
                                     transaction to close in the first half of 2016

2015 was also the year that we presented the outlook strategy to the capital markets outlook is a
comprehensive turnaround and transformation programme that was developed in 2014 and is now in full
execution mode we made progress on all three pillars of the strategy after years of decline we have
returned to sound and robust revenue growth this growth was realised by an increase in revenues from
small and mediumsized enterprise sme customers as well as growth with large local customers
revenue management and strict pricing discipline were implemented and resulted in good revenue
growth by customer we strongly improved our service quality measured by ontime performance which
resulted in a significant improvement in our customer experience scores orange experience score

in line with our fouryear investment programme we made significant steps to improve operational
excellence and drive productivity we opened new hubs and modernised our infrastructure we made
good progress in the automation of our hubs and depots and took steps to simplify and standardise our
core processes we opened new destinations and improved connections to further optimise our unique
european road network

with our third outlook pillar organise to win we are building a new organisation that will help us serve
our customers even better whilst realising global competencies and efficiencies in our support
functions we outsourced our existing sharedservice centres by signing a business process outsourcing
bpo contract and started the total overhaul of our it infrastructure we further strengthened our
leadership team and were able to attract strong talent in many of our core markets we were able to
lower our overheads and invested in industry leading ecommerce capabilities

we are progressing remarkably well with the wideranging transformation of tnt and even though the
full benefits of outlook will only be unlocked from 2018 onwards we are increasingly confident that we
will turn the corner and succeed in achieving yearonyear improvements in 2016

thanks to the orange spirit of our employees and our loyal customers we enter 2016 with positive
momentum and celebrate 70 years of tnt and a bright future with fedex

thank you for your confidence now and in the future

international europes revenues increased by 44 or 37 at constant foreign exchange rates growth
accelerated across the quarters in 2015 with particularly strong growth in the sme customer segment
revenue per consignment declined by 07 as a result of price pressure and the significant decline in
fuel prices partly compensated by an increased average consignment weight

adjusted operating income was impacted by increased dollardenominated air network costs
investments in road and air network connections as well as outlookrelated transition and project costs

while many operating units experienced healthy profit developments the performance of the segment
was negatively impacted by the revenue developments in certain parts of western europe

investments made in the european road network and the european air network to drive growth and
productivity positively impacted international europes service coverage and capacity service levels
improved significantly in 2015 as evidenced by the results of customer satisfaction surveys

in 2015 international amea experienced revenue growth of 106 driven by the strengthening of local
currencies against the euro at constant foreign exchange rates revenue growth within the segment
was dampened negatively impacted by the dilution of fuel surcharge revenue and a slowdown in the
chinese economy where exports declined yearonyear particularly to europe

average kilogrammes shipped per day increased yearonyear by 77 while average consignments
shipped per day decreased by 67 this was a reflection of the increase in average weight per
shipment due to the growth in the demand for economy express products which was at a faster rate
than for the lighter express products revenue decrease in china and hong kong was partly offset by
growth in india middle east and africa

adjusted operating income margin improved to 70 in 2015 from 56 in 2014 this was the result of
growth in higher margin import products and the sme customer segment which are key outlook
strategic focus areas for international amea contributing to the improvement were the indirect cost
reduction actions which included the consolidation of activities and delayering of management indirect
costs remained well controlled despite high levels of salary inflation in many markets which often run at
multiples of local cpi indices

growth in a number of european domestic markets was offset by declines in australia and brazil
adjusted operating income decreased due to lower sales in australia and brazil lower yields most
notably in france and australia and outlookrelated transition and project costs performance in france
was negatively affected by competitive pressures and higher b2c delivery costs while the performance
in australia was weaker due to competitive pressures compounded by the drop in commodity markets
and the ongoing cost of modernising the companys australian infrastructure the lower revenues in
brazil could not be fully offset by structural cost saving actions in response to the economic
environment and resulted in a decline in performance

service levels continued to improve with a retained focus on compliance further investments
equipment fleet and infrastructure and the rollout of various operational excellence programmes
such as perfect depot and perfect pud

ii health and safety
management and performance

at tnt a key part of the outlook strategy is to prioritise health and safety practices to continuously
improve health and safety performance and wellbeing of employees it is essential to have ongoing
efforts to maintain and enhance a healthy and safe workplace for and with colleagues to sustainably
reduce injuries as a consequence of incidents and accidents

in 2015 health and safety was a top priority for tnt tnt embedded a culture of safety leadership
where management systematically addresses behavioural issues to reduce incidents in 2015 tnt
changed its framework to fully align with osha occupational safety and health administration form
300 requirements refer to chapter 5 for more information

tnt manages health and safety via a systemsbased approach the health and safety policies and
management framework are based on international standards such as ohsas 18001 all operating
units are required to achieve and maintain external certification to standards like these at a minimum in
addition to national and local regulatory standards

health and safety risks associated with operational activities are identified and assessed and
subsequently managed and controlled to acceptable levels by implementing effective risk controls within
operational processes each operating unit has a documented risk assessment process in place to
control this particular risk at a local level

preventive measures
to ensure prevention of injuries tnt revamped the management safety performance review process
for risk and incident reduction in 2015 the process was tested in november and december and is
planned for further rollout in 2016 for all tnt operating units globally

health and safety risk reduction performance target levels will trigger immediate corrective action by
responsible line management for safety at tnt premises and its operations on the public roads and will
be followed up through factual checks of implementation at all levels

road safety
at tnt road safety has a high priority in its ongoing business operations tnt uses the safe vehicle
safe driver safe journey approach to identify and implement effective risk mitigation measures for road
safety tnt pursues continuous improvement in each of these areas in addition to subcontractor
management the main challenge in reducing road accidents is to ensure consistent application of this
approach particularly in lessdeveloped countries and to ensure that subcontractors adopt
corresponding standards in practice tnt promotes the improvement of the quality of public
infrastructure proactively by being involved in nongovernmental organisation initiatives where possible

health and safety performance
in 2015 tnt implemented a workrelated incident management system ims globally to improve the
accuracy of injury and causation registration the ims enables tnts management to monitor the
effectiveness of improvement actions to prevent injuries in its operations

chapter 3

in 2015 tnt had no fatal injuries within its operations five nonrecordable osha fatalities occurred
four tnt employeessubcontractors passed away due to heart attacks and one as a result of suicide

on the public road three tnt employees and 22 subcontractors were involved in incidents in which 31
people died 27 third parties and four subcontractor drivers most recorded fatal road incidents
happened in brazil germany and the united kingdom and have a close relation to the road risk
conditions in these countries

every road incident tnt is involved in has a mandatory independent external and internal investigation
process the investigation is reviewed on status and outcomes by senior management with a focus on
correct follow up causation analysis and preventive actions

taking factual road safety research into account combined with tnts own incident and road safety
investigations and expertise tnt promotes ongoing road safety programmes with an objective to
increase awareness and reduce risk factors related to speeding distracted driving seatbelts personal
protection equipment fatigue and use of medical drugs

based on the recorded losttime incident ims data of the last six months of 2015 80 of the losttime
incidents occurred at tnt premises 6 occurred on the public road and 14 occurred on other non
tnt locations

the largest part 60 of the losttime incidents occurred during loading and unloading activities as this
process is the most labour intensive and has a direct relationship to the use of human muscles and
moving heavy equipment only 4 of the losttime incidents are related to driving on the public road
and 5 are related to forklift driving and onsite driving collection delivery and visits to customers
represent 7 of the losttime incidents and the remaining 24 is related to other less significant
activities or is not specified

tnt investigates causations of injuries with the objective to develop and implement injury reduction
programmes on an ongoing basis the main causes of losttime incidents in tnt are related to manual
handling 29 fallsslips in the work floor 19 being hit by a moving object at a site 13 being hit
by a moving vehicle 8 and due to equipment tools or chemicals used 8 the remaining 23 is
related to other less significant causes or is not specified

key initiatives

the losttime injury rate ltir a more stringent health and safety kpi introduced on 1 january 2016 for
losttime injuries will be reviewed during the monthly review process the aim for this health and safety
kpi is zero harm zero blame with a maximum ltir tolerance of 10 10  1 losttime injury per
200000 working hours performance above the maximum ltir tolerance level will trigger immediate
corrective action by line management in line with tnts incident reduction programme to reduce injuries
within a foreseeable timeframe to meet the health and safety target communicated

health and safety is prioritised in tnts outlook strategy and is primarily measured on its effectiveness
to reduce injuries within its operations worldwide in order to ensure health and safety is fully embedded
in tnts culture processes and operations the following actions will be taken

focus on profitable growth
a zero harm zero blame company health and safety culture in which tnt
 knows its current health and safety performance
 prevents impact to people business and financials and
 establishes a performance based health and safety mentality

zero is the norm tnt aims for

invest in operational excellence
ensure that health and safety is managed at all levels in the organisation
 integration is done in the total quality management tqm culture
 preventive change management focus to improve behaviour and aid injury prevention
 clear and simple health and safety performance management processes
 the health and safety management loop is closed between operations with material impact




                                                                                                         23

corporate responsibility performance

organise to win
maintain a customer and people centric organisation in which tnt management has the fundamental
belief that high customer and employee satisfaction can only be achieved by good performance on
health and safety management this means in practice
 employees and management value the people network and are aware of their personal leadership
    behaviour values
 health and safety performance culture and leadership capability at all management levels
 one health and safety performance process measured on operational effectiveness

iii environment

management and performance

tnt considers energy and carbon efficiency to be a priority therefore tnt is committed to mitigating
its environmental impact with a focus on three areas
 operations improve co2e efficiency and air quality of activities including subcontractors
 customers provide co2e information to customers and help them reduce their emissions
 people encourage awareness and train employees and subcontractors in environmental
     management

tnt manages its environmental footprint via a systemsbased approach its environmental policies and
management framework are based on the international iso 14001 standard all operating units are
required to achieve and maintain external certification to this standard as a minimum in addition to
national and local regulatory standards in 2015 tnt complied with the local legislation to perform
regulatory energy audits in accordance with the directive 201227eu on energy efficiency

tnts environmental management system is used to plan implement monitor manage and improve
the environmental impact of its activities environmental performance is measured through a set of kpis
related to energy absolute co2 emission and co2 efficiency tnt includes environmental requirements
in its capital expenditure and procurement review process the environmental impact of tnts fleet and
infrastructure at each important juncture planning acquisition and operation are managed in addition
general terms and conditions for transport subcontractors include environmental requirements

tnt benchmarks its energy and carbon approach and performance against its peers via the carbon
disclosure project in 2015 tnt scored 94 out of a possible 100 in the carbon disclosure project
2014 89

in 2015 tnt continued to focus on mediumterm targets for global initiatives related to its own fleet
with the objective to improve co2 efficiency the following table highlights tnts progress in attaining
these targets where possible subcontractors are involved in initiatives to reduce tnts overall co2
footprint

progress has been made in attaining these mediumterm targets and at the end of 2015 tnt had
achieved the target set for own vehicles in the european union to possess at least the euro 4 standard
mainly driven by the large fleet renewal initiative in the united kingdom the reported percentage of own
drivers trained in safe and ecodriving is only based on the number of drivers that were trained in 2015
drivers are trained regularly however not as a standard on an annual basis

in 2014 tnt initiated a project in operational excellence to increase efficiency and productivity in its
operations and to develop a new co2e efficiency kpi to
 gain additional insight for operational management into strategic purposes and daytoday
    operations
 comply with new industry standards on reporting tnts footprint
 embed environmental considerations in all operational and network optimisation initiatives and




                                                                                                                    24

    serve all customers investors and management information needs through a unified disclosure
     system

the new kpi tracks the number of grammes of co2e that are emitted to transport one metric tonne
1000 kg of cargo over a distance of one kilometre g co2etonneskm to incorporate load factors
this kpi reflects the adoption of en 16258 by disclosing the energy and greenhouse gas ghg
emissions using the en 16258 default emissions factors overall in 2015 tnts environmental transport
performance as measured in co2e efficiency was 490 g co2etonneskm

in addition tnt launched programmes to educate operational management on the process of
effectively managing and reducing environmental emissions

the 2015 annual report shows a combination of kpis measured in previous years and discloses tnts
annual co2e footprint and co2e efficiency the co2e efficiency indicator is not comparable with the
co2e efficiency figures of air transport

in 2015 the total co2e emissions of tnts own and subcontractor operations scope 1 2 and 3 of the
ghg protocol increased by 59 to 3074 ktonnes the co2e emissions of tnts own operations
scope 1 and 2 increased in absolute terms by 93 to 1437 ktonnes as a result of higher air and road
linehaul operation activity levels to support increased competitiveness in the european market co 2e
emissions of subcontractor operations scope 3 increased by 32 to 1637 ktonnes in 2015 53 of
total co2e emissions were related to subcontractor operations

the co2e efficiency of tnts air operations in europe measured in g co2etonneskm improved by
52 in 2015 due to the transition to more fuelefficient aircraft and improved load factors the long
haul air operations efficiency deteriorated mainly due to lower volumes shipped through this network
the co2e efficiency of linehaul vehicles measured in g co2ekm improved due to the transition to
newer fuelefficient vehicles and increased focus on driver behaviour the co2e efficiency of tnts
buildings deteriorated despite the relatively warm winter in europe in the beginning of 2015

key initiatives

operations
road
in all major operating units electric and lowcarbon emitting vehicles and electricassisted tricycles
continue to be tested and deployed particularly for city deliveries amsterdam rotterdam milan and
turin fuelefficient innovations such as telematics doubledeck trailers alternative fuel vehicles multi
modal shipments and aerodynamic vehicle equipment have been further deployed to ensure maximum
impact and scalability best practices are shared and where possible replicated on a larger scale
including subcontractors

tnt is constantly optimising the configuration of its network which has an impact on its co2e efficiency
a number of projects have been rolled out including
 the road operations supply chain optimisation rosco project which aims to redesign the
   network as well as implement different loading techniques such as loose loading in order to
   optimise full capacity utilisation of its trucks and
 the infrastructure project which aims to identify the optimal local configuration of depots leading to
   the lowest overall costs and minimal co2e impact of the total supply chain in accordance with the

      breeam standard in 2015 updated depot configurations were rolled out in brisbane melbourne
      sydney eindhoven madrid swindon and warsaw

air
tnt aims to constantly improve the fuel efficiency of its air operations by applying best practices in
network and flight planning takeoff inflight procedures and ground processes

in 2015 tnt increased its capacity utilisation on its european air network resulting in a significant
reduction in g co2etonneskm through better planning load quality and daily monitoring of load factors

a key initiative focused on positioning standby aircraft in key european locations rather than the central
air hub in liège to alter efficiency performance whilst standby aircraft provide capacity to improve
service recovery in case of network issues they usually fly at lower cargo load factor by locating them
in the field however the distance flown at lower cargo loads has been reduced another initiative
focused on increasing the secondsector load factor by selling available capacity of european air
network aircraft

in 2016 tnt will continue to replace short haul aircraft by younger more fuelefficient aircraft types

air subcontractors and commercial linehaul contributed substantially to tnts 2015 co2e footprint to
improve competitiveness and increase regional growth in asia additional commercial connections were
introduced in 2015 which led to an expected reduction in efficiency at the same time as a result of
several european capability improvements an improvement occurred in the load factor for air
subcontractors

supply chain and innovation platforms
at the industry level tnt participates in some of the european unions horizon 2020 programmes
frevue citylab which aim to generate zeroemission solutions for deliveries to city centres in
the frevue programme tnt deployed 10 electric pud vehicles in the cities of amsterdam madrid
and rotterdam in order to test their technical operational and financial viability

tnt is also cofounder of the green freight europe gfe sector initiative which aims amongst others
to reduce carbon emissions of the transportation sector by supporting its members through a standard
methodology for monitoring and reporting on carbon emissions

customers
tnts co2 services enable customers to proactively address the environmental impact of their
business tnts portfolio of co2 services includes
 co2 report tracks and analyses co2 footprint
 co2 neutral mitigates the co2 impact of consignments
 co2 quote predicts future co2 emissions
 co2 scenario models and optimises co2 emissions in the transport supply chain

in 2015 tnt rolled out its co2 services in key european countries and as part of its extended offering
launched co2 neutral domestic express delivery in germany and in the benelux at no additional charge

people
driver behaviour has a major impact on fuel efficiency road safety and customer experience in 2015
25 of tnts drivers were trained in safe and ecodriving including both classroom and onroad
coaching ecodriving is included as a standard requirement in driving courses in various locations and
                                                    th
is also required for subcontractors in 2015 the 9 drive me challenge edition was held at balocco
proving ground in turin italy tnts drivers and subcontractors from operating units worldwide
competed in three different categories including pud forklift truck and linehaul vehicles the winners
obtained the best combined score in fuel efficiency safety and customer experience

in addition in june two tnt drivers were named as the winner and runnerup in the finals of the 2015
scania driver competition held in bangkok

outlook and commitments

in 2016 tnt will continue to embed carbon management into its business tnt will manage effectively
its co2e efficiency performance through one main kpi  g co2etonneskm
tnt targets a yearonyear improvement and puts all its efforts to improve efficiency in its operations
through companywide optimisation programmes

for 2016 tnt sets an ambitious target of 5 improvement in g co2etonneskm compared to the 2015
efficiency level 490 g co2etonneskm this ambition is based on planned fleet replacement load
factor improvements and overall performance management every operating unit will be challenged
during the business performance review cycles

co2e efficiency is managed with a global scope for own and subcontracted operations incorporating all
products customer and operational reporting are aligned and validated by sgs a leading inspection
verification testing and certification company providing a reasonable level of assurance against the
requirements of the norm

in 2016 the model will be enhanced to account for additional initiatives which will have a positive impact
on efficiency such as vehicle type driver behaviour and reducing emissions related to buildings in
addition to this carbon disclosure and management requirements will be included in the development of
a new transport management system as part of outlook

tnt will continue to rollout its extended co2 services to customers and work towards positive
behavioural changes of its people to decrease the environmental footprint

iv social and engagement
the people network

tnt has hardworking people in every corner of the world who take pride in what they do helping

people management in 2015 iip rolled out a new standard the iip standard focuses on three
performance headings leading supporting and improving the standard requires amongst others that
tnt identifies and communicates clear business objectives to all employees and provides performance
feedback development plans and adequate training partly as a result of the updates and changes in
the iip standard tnt did not recertify every operating unit automatically resulting in 53 of employees
currently working at iipcertified operating units 2014 81

learning and development activities are undertaken at all levels within the organisation all global
learning and development activities are centrally managed to ensure alignment with the companys
values and strategic outlook priorities implementation coordination and deployment takes place at
local level to ensure local cultures and languages are taken into account and to minimise cost of travel

tnt places particular focus on identifying recognising and developing employees with the potential to
become future leaders employees are encouraged to join local talent pools to develop their leadership
capabilities annual performance calibration and succession and talent reviews are conducted to
discuss and assess employee performance results and to guarantee succession planning for critical
positions




                                                                                                        27

law regulation the tnt business principles or any other tnt policy in good faith reported breaches
will be acted upon promptly and with strict confidentiality and tnt will not retaliate or undertake action
against employees and third parties for filing a report or assisting another person in doing so in good
faith in 2015 26 human rightsrelated whistleblower cases were received 2014 47 and by the end of
2015 a total of 10 cases were still pending

social responsibility

tnt provides expertise and capacity to a number of charitable initiatives often at local level with a close
link to the companys expertise culture employees and customers tnt uses its supply chain
knowledge and management skills to support nonprofit organisations in their logistical operations for
example after the earthquake in nepal in april tnt deployed resources to help which included co
operation with local aid organisations to provide victims with food water medicines and relief supplies

internal control
the executive board used elements of former obligations under the sarbanesoxley act in establishing
the companys governance and internal controls over financial reporting icfr furthermore the icfr
framework established by the executive board has a wider scope than would be mandatory according to
the sarbanesoxley act as it includes a number of smaller entities

in addition the approach is based on the principles outlined in auditing standards as 2 and takes into
account certain elements of as 5 as promulgated by the public companies accounting oversight board
pcaob however tnts approach to icfr does not imply an assessment of the adequacy and
effectiveness of tnts internal control and risk management processes over financial reporting under
section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act nor is there an assessment by tnts external auditor to that
effect

in 2015 tnt dedicated significant attention to the periodic financial reports pwcs reports tnts
control framework and internal audit reports tnt reviewed press releases developments on pensions
and icfr on a regular basis tnt prepared an action plan to improve internal audits and financial
control executed in close consultation with pwc

in addition throughout 2015 tnt documented and evaluated the design of its icfr and as a
consequence a standardised icfr framework was implemented across tnt tnt continued a
comprehensive programme of testing the operational effectiveness of its icfr further initiatives on
entitylevel controls were undertaken including integrity awareness and training and reinforcement of
policies and procedures the findings identified by each of the entities included in the icfr programme
including the findings raised by the external auditor were reported to the executive board and the audit
committee of the supervisory board

corporate governance code an explanation is given below for those instances in which tnt does not
fully comply with the best practice provisions of the code the full text of the code and tnts articles of

on tnts corporate website wwwtntcomcorporate

best practice provision ii28
this provision stipulates that the remuneration of a member of the board of management in the event of
dismissal may not exceed one years compensation the fixed remuneration component or if the one
years compensation would be manifestly unreasonable in case of a dismissal during the first term of
office a maximum of twice the annual compensation tnt deviates from this best practice by awarding
the current members of the executive board a severance payment in case of a change of control
equalling the sum of the last annual base compensation and pension contribution plus the average
bonus received over the last three years multiplied by a maximum of two tnt believes that such
payment is reasonable taking into account the special position of members of the executive board in a
change of control situation also in such an event the supervisory board may decide that performance
shares vest in whole or in part

best practice provision iv11
this provision stipulates that a companys general meeting may pass a resolution to set aside the
binding nature of a nomination for the appointment of a member of the board of management or of the
supervisory board andor a resolution to remove a member of the board of management or of the
supervisory board by an absolute majority of the votes cast which majority may be required to represent
a proportion of the issued capital which proportion may not exceed onethird if this proportion of the
capital is not represented at the meeting but an absolute majority is in favour of any such resolution a
new meeting may be convened at which the resolution may be passed by an absolute majority of the
votes cast regardless of the proportion of the capital represented at the meeting

tnt applies this best practice provision except for a minor deviation for a resolution to appoint a
member of the executive board or of the supervisory board other than in accordance with a nomination
by the supervisory board there is no second meeting allowed in which the requirement of onethird of
the capital can be set aside tnt deviates from this best practice provision for reasons of stability and
continuity

foundation

stichting continuïteit tnt express the foundation was established to promote the interests of tnt
the enterprise affiliated with tnt and all stakeholders involved these objects include protecting tnt as
much as possible from influences that are contrary to those interests and could jeopardise the
continuity independence or identity of those interests the foundation must endeavour to achieve these
objects by acquiring and holding preference shares and by exercising the rights attached to those
preference shares the objects of the foundation do not entail the sale or encumbrance or other
disposal of shares with the exception of the sale to tnt or to another company assigned by and
affiliated in a group with it as well as the assistance in the repayment or withdrawal of preference
shares

the foundation is an independent legal entity in the sense of section 571 paragraph 1 sub c of the
dutch financial markets supervision act

to enable the foundation to perform its duties tnt has granted it a call option when exercising the
call option the foundation is entitled to subscribe to preference shares consisting of the right to
repeatedly subscribe for preference shares up to a maximum corresponding with one hundred percent
100 of the issued share capital in the form of ordinary shares as outstanding immediately prior to the
exercise of the subscribed rights less one preference share and minus any shares already held by the
foundation the foundation has the right to exercise the call option at any time either wholly or partly

the foundation may exercise the call option for certain reasons including
 to prevent slow down or otherwise complicate an unsolicited takeover bid for and an unsolicited
    acquisition of ordinary shares by means of an acquisition at the stock market or otherwise
 to prevent and countervail concentration of voting rights in the general meeting of stakeholders and
 to resist unwanted influence by and pressure from shareholders to amend the strategy of tnt
and with respect to the foregoing to give tnt the opportunity to consider and to explore possible
alternatives and if required to work these out and to implement them in the event an actual or
threatening concentration of voting rights arises among the shareholders which according to the
provisional judgment of the executive board and the supervisory board and the board of the
foundation is considered to be unsolicited and not in the interest of tnt and its enterprise and to
enable tnt to do so by temporarily neutralising such concentration of voting rights

as from six months after the issuance of the preference shares to the foundation the foundation may
require tnt to convene a general meeting of stakeholders to propose cancellation of the preference
shares against repayment of the paid amount if preference shares are issued tnt must convene a
general meeting of stakeholders to be held no later than 12 months after the date on which the
preference shares were issued for the first time or 60 days after the foundation has demanded the
cancellation of its preference shares the agenda for that meeting of stakeholders must include a
proposal for a resolution relating to the repurchase or cancellation of the preference shares

tnt has granted the foundation the right to file an application for an inquiry into the policy and the
course of events of tnt with the enterprise chamber of the amsterdam court of appeal
ondernemingskamer tnt believes that this may be a useful option amongst others in the period
before the issuance of preference shares as it does not cause a dilution of the rights of other
shareholders to enable the foundation to function properly the executive board holds meetings with
the board of the foundation on a regular basis

the members of the board of the foundation are mr bouw chairman mr tiemstra and ms tonkens

    at index level 0 difference leads to a vesting of half of the maximum of the granted rights to
    shares

shares that vest which will be determined by the tsr performance over the threeyear vesting period
and the performance on the nonfinancial targets over three calendar years preceding the vesting date

subsidiaries associates and joint ventures
subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which tnt has control tnt controls an
entity when it is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated



                                                                                                          68

from the date on which control is transferred to tnt they are deconsolidated from the date that control
ceases
an associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture over which
commercial and financial policy decisions tnt has significant influence significant influence is the
power to participate in financial and operating policy decisions of an entity but is not control or joint
control over those policies tnts share of results of all significant associates is included in the income
statement using the equity method the carrying value of tnts share in associates includes goodwill
on acquisition and changes to reflect tnts share in net earnings of the respective companies reduced
by dividends received tnts share in nondistributed earnings of associates is included in net
investment when tnts share of any accumulated losses exceeds the acquisition value of the shares
in the associates the book value is reduced to zero and the reporting of losses ceases unless tnt is
bound by guarantees or other undertakings in relation to the associate

a joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby tnt and one or more other parties undertake an
economic activity subject to joint control joint ventures in which tnt participates with other parties are
accounted for in the same manner as associates using the equity method

business combinations
tnt applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations the consideration transferred
for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred to the
former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group the consideration
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date
the group recognises any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree on an acquisitionbyacquisition basis
either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of
the acquirees identifiable net assets
acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred

if the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date any
gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss

any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition
date subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an
asset or liability is recognised in accordance with ias 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other
comprehensive income contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and its
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity

the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of tnts share of the identifiable net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of
tnts share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in the
income statement

tnt treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners for purchases
from noncontrolling interests the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share
acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains or losses on
disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity

when tnt ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is
remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in income statement the
fair value of the investment at the date on which it ceases to be an associate or a joint venture is
regarded as its fair value on initial recognition as a financial asset in accordance with ias 39 in addition
any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are
accounted for as if tnt had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities this could lead to a
reclassification of amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income to the income
statement

losses applicable to the noncontrolling interest in excess of its share of the subsidiarys equity are
allocated against tnts interests except to the extent that the noncontrolling interest has a binding
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses subsidiaries accounting
policies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with tnts accounting policies




                                                                                                             69

functional currency and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of all tnts entities are measured using the currency of the
primary environment in which the entity operates the functional currency the consolidated financial
statements are presented in euro which is the functional and presentation currency of tnt

foreign currency transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are
translated to the functional currency using yearend exchange rates

foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency
transactions and balances and from the translation at yearend exchange rates are recognised in the
income statement except for qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges that are
directly recognised in equity

foreign operations
the results and financial position of all tnt entities none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy with a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows
 assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate
 income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and
 the resulting exchange differences based on the different ways of translation between the statement
    of financial position and the income statement are recognised as a separate component of equity
    translation reserve

foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
entities and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments
are recognised in other comprehensive income when a foreign operation is sold such exchange
differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on the sale

goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing exchange rate

intangible assets
goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the share of the
identifiable net assets acquired by tnt goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible
assets goodwill on acquisition of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of
investments in associates and joint ventures

goodwill is recognised as an asset and although it is not amortised it is reviewed for impairment
annually and whenever there is a possible indicator of impairment any impairment is recognised
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed goodwill is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses on disposal of an entity any residual amount of goodwill is included in
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal

goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to ifrs has been retained at the previous
historical values as no adjustment was required on transition these have also been subject to
impairment tests at that date and will continue to be at least annually

other intangible assets
costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical
cost and amortised using the straightline method over the estimated useful life apart from software
other intangible assets mainly include customer relationships software under construction and licences
other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date

software under construction is reclassified when it is ready for use and is subsequently amortised using
the straightline method over its estimated useful life other intangible assets are valued at historical
cost less amortisation and impairment




                                                                                                         70

property plant and equipment
property plant and equipment are valued at historical cost using a component approach less
depreciation and impairment losses in addition to the costs of acquisition the company also includes
costs of bringing the asset to its working condition handling and installation costs dismantling costs and
nonrefundable purchase taxes under the component approach each component of an item of
property plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall
be depreciated separately

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into
account any residual value the assets residual value and useful life is reviewed and adjusted if
appropriate at each balance sheet date subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount
or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably

land is not depreciated system software is capitalised and amortised as a part of the tangible asset for
which it was acquired to operate because the estimated useful life is inextricably linked to the estimated
useful life of the associated asset

leases of property plant and equipment are classified as finance leases if the company bears
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised at the leases
inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum
lease payments the corresponding rental obligations net of finance charges are included in longterm
debt property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of
the assets useful life and the lease term

impairment of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment
goodwill
goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an
indication that the asset might be impaired

for the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped by cashgenerating unit cgu the
lowest level at which there are separately identifiable cash flows for impairment testing of goodwill the
group of cgus is defined as the lowest level where goodwill is monitored for internal purposes this
level may be higher than the level used for testing other assets but is not at a higher level than an
operating segment

if the recoverable amount of the cgu is less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the
unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit the recoverable amount is the
higher of the fair value less cost of disposal and value in use in assessing the value in use the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the asset specific risks for the
purpose of assessing impairment corporate assets are allocated to specific cgus before impairment
testing the allocation of corporate assets is based on the contribution of those assets to the future cash
flows of the cgu under review goodwill following the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is not
separately recognised or tested for impairment

impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in a subsequent period

finitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment
at each balance sheet date tnt reviews the carrying amount of its finitelived intangible assets and
property plant and equipment to determine whether there is an indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss if any indication exists the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated
in order to determine the extent if any of the impairment loss an asset is impaired if the recoverable
amount is lower than the carrying amount the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an
assets fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use

if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying
amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount any impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement impairment losses recognised in prior periods shall be reversed
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount
since the last impairment loss was recognised the recoverable amount shall not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years a
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement




                                                                                                          71

financial assets and liabilities
tnt classifies financial assets and liabilities into the following categories
 financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
 loans and receivables
 heldtomaturity investments
 availableforsale financial assets and
 financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

the classification depends on the purpose for which the financial asset or liability was acquired
management determines the classification of tnts financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition

financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives and other
assets and liabilities that are designated as such upon initial recognition

measurement at fair value requires disclosure of measurement methods based on the following fair
value measurement hierarchy
 level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets
 level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly prices or indirectly
    derived from prices
 level 3 inputs not based on observable market data

financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recorded at fair
value and subsequently remeasured at fair value in the statement of financial position tnt designates
certain derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities of a firm commitment
fair value hedge hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecasted transaction cash flow hedge or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
net investment hedge

if a derivative is designated as a cash flow or net investment hedge changes in its fair value are
considered to be effective and recorded in a separate component of equity hedge reserve until the
hedged item is recorded in income any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that is
considered to be ineffective or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness is immediately
recorded in the income statement

at the inception of the transaction tnt documents the relationship between hedging instruments and
hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions the company also documents the assessment both at hedge inception and on an ongoing
basis of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are
recorded in the income statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or
liability that are attributable to the hedged risk

unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities
classified at fair value through profit or loss are directly recorded in the income statement

amounts accumulated in equity are recycled into the income statement in the periods when the hedged
item will affect the income statement for example when the forecasted sale that is hedged takes place
however when the forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a nonfinancial
asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the
initial measurement of the asset or liability

when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting any cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time remain in equity until the
forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement when a forecasted transaction
is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gains or losses that were reported in equity are
immediately transferred to the income statement

loans and receivables
loans granted and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market and for which tnt has no intention of trading loans and
receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position except for

maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date these are classified as noncurrent
assets

loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction
costs subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method

heldtomaturity investments
heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities where tnt has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity

heldtomaturity investments are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction
costs subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method

availableforsale financial assets
availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets that are either designated in this
category or not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets they are included in non
current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance
sheet date

availableforsale financial assets are carried at fair value unrealised gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of financial assets classified as available for sale are recognised in other
comprehensive income when financial assets classified as available for sale are sold or impaired the
accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as a gain or a loss

the fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices if the market for a financial asset
is not active and for unlisted securities tnt establishes fair value by using valuation techniques
these include the use of recent armslength transactions reference to other instruments that are
substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuers specific
circumstances

financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction
costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net
of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of
the financial liability using the effective interest method

impairment of financial assets
tnt assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a
group of financial assets is impaired in the case of equity securities classified as availableforsale a
significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in
determining whether the securities are impaired if any such evidence exists for availableforsale
financial assets the cumulative loss  measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the
current fair value less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income
statement  is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement impairment losses on
equity instruments recognised in the income statement are not reversed through equity

inventory
inventories of raw materials and finished goods are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable
value historical cost is based on weighted average prices

accounts receivable
accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method less allowance for doubtful debt an allowance for doubtful debt is
established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables the amount of the allowance is the difference
between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted
at the effective interest rate the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement any reversal
of the impairment loss is included in the income statement at the same line as where the original
expense has been recorded

the risk of uncollectibility of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are assessed individually based on


                                                                                                          73

factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectibility risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectibility the assumptions and estimates applied for determining the valuation
allowance are reviewed periodically

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at nominal value cash and
cash equivalents include cash at hand bank account balances bills of exchange and cheques only
those which can be cashed in the short term all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents bank overdrafts are not
netted off from cash and cash equivalents

assets or disposal groups held for disposal and discontinued operations
assets or disposal groups held for disposal are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair
value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally by means of disposal rather than
through continuing use assets held for disposal are no longer amortised or depreciated from the time
they are classified as such

assets held for disposal are available for immediate disposal in its present condition and the sale is
considered as highly probable

operations that represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or that
are part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale and either have been
disposed of or have been classified as held for disposal are presented as discontinued operations in
tnts financial statements

equity
ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares or options are presented in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds

where any group company purchases tnts equity share capital treasury shares the consideration
paid including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity
until the shares are cancelled reissued or disposed of where such shares are subsequently sold or re
issued any consideration received net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the
related income tax effects are included in equity

provisions for pension liabilities
the obligation for all pension and other postemployment benefit plans that qualify as defined benefit
plans is determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the
fair value of the plan assets tnt uses actuarial calculations projected unit credit method to measure
the obligations and the costs for the calculations actuarial assumptions are made about demographic
variables such as employee turnover mortality and disability and financial variables the discount rate
is determined by reference to highquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in
which the benefits will be paid

actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise

pastservice costs if any are recognised immediately in the income statement

gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised at the date of
the curtailment or settlement

pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the income statement when incurred or
due

other provisions
provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event it is probable
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation provisions are measured at the present
value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the
balance sheet date the discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the gross up of the

months after the end of the period profitsharing bonuses and deferred compensation the expected
costs of these benefits are recognised over the period of employment actuarial gains and losses and
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to income in the period in which such gain or
loss occurs related service costs are recognised immediately

provisions recorded for restructuring largely relate to termination benefits termination benefits are
payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits tnt recognises termination benefits
when the company has committed to terminate the employment of current employees according to a
detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or to provide termination benefits as a result of an
offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance
sheet date are discounted to their present value

provisions for onerous contracts are recorded when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation
under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to arise from that contract taking into
account impairment of tangible assets first

the provision for other obligations relates to legal and contractual obligations and received claims

trade accounts payable
trade accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method

income taxes
the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive
income

the amount of income tax included in the income statement is determined in accordance with the rules
established by the taxation authorities based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable

deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and the tax base of assets and liabilities are calculated using the substantively
enacted tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled deferred tax assets are
recognised if it is probable that they will be realised deferred tax assets and liabilities where a legally
enforceable right to offset exists and within the same tax group are presented net in the statement of
financial position

revenue
revenue is recognised when services are rendered goods are delivered or work is completed revenue
is the gross inflow of economic benefits during the current year that arise from ordinary activities and
result in an increase in equity other than increases relating to contributions from equity participants

 the company has transferred to a buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
    and services
 the company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
    with ownership nor effective control of the goods and services sold
 the amount of revenue can be measured reliably
 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company
 the costs to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and
 the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably

revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable

amounts received in advance are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are rendered to
customers or goods are delivered

in consideration for equity instruments or for amounts of cash that are based on the price of equity
instruments of the company the fair value of the equitysettled sharebased transactions is recognised
as an expense part of the employee costs and a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting
period cashsettled sharebased payments are initially recognised at the fair value of the liability and
are expensed over the vesting period the liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date with all
changes recognised in the income statement
the fair value of payments of sharebased payment plans based on market conditions is calculated
using the monte carlo model the fair value of payments of sharebased payment plans based on non
market conditions are based on the share price on the date the grant is made corrected for a dividend
yield the equity instruments granted do not vest until the employee completes a specific period of
service

interest income and expense
interest income and expense are recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest
method interest income comprises interest income on loans changes in the fair value of financial

critical accounting               estimates         and     judgments in            applying        tnts
accounting policies

the preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments estimates and
assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets
liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from these estimates estimates and
judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected
the critical accounting estimates judgments and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below

business combinations
tnt accounts for all its business combinations applying the acquisition method the assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed are recognised and measured on the basis of their fair values at the date of
acquisition to determine fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed tnt must make
estimates and use valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available any excess of the
cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired represents goodwill

for purposes of preparation of the consolidated financial statements internal reorganisations or transfer
of businesses between tnt companies are accounted for at predecessor carrying amounts these
transactions do not give rise to goodwill

segment reporting
tnt reports separate information about each operating segment or results from aggregating two or
more operating segments that meet the criteria of similar economic characteristics consistent with the
core principle of ifrs when operating segments are similar in respect of
 the nature of products and services
 the nature of the production process
 the type or class of customers for their products and services
 the method used to distribute their products or provide their services and
 if applicable the nature of the regulatory environment

operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decisionmaker function codm the codm function is performed by the management
board whom receives operational and financial information on a monthly basis for the operating
segments operating segments have been aggregated into reportable segments by a process that

impairment of assets
in determining impairments of intangible assets including goodwill property plant and equipment and
financial fixed assets management must make significant judgments and estimates to determine
whether the fair value of the cash flows generated by those assets is less than their carrying amount
determining cash flows requires the use of judgments and estimates that have been included in the
strategic plans and longrange forecasts of tnt the data necessary for executing the impairment tests
are based on management estimates of future cash flows which require estimating revenue growth
rates and profit margins refer to note 1 for applied sensitivities on intangible assets

depreciation and amortisation of property plant and equipment and intangible assets
property plant and equipment and intangible assets except for goodwill are depreciated or amortised
at historical cost using a straightline method based on the estimated useful life taking into account any
residual value the assets residual value and useful life are based on tnts best estimates and are
reviewed and adjusted if required at each balance sheet date

impairment of receivables
the risk of uncollectibility of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with
and the past due status of doubtful debtors while large accounts are individually assessed based on
factors that include ability to pay bankruptcy and payment history in addition debtors in certain
countries are subject to a higher collectibility risk which is taken into account when assessing the
overall risk of uncollectibility should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates revisions
to the estimated valuation allowances would be required

restructuring
restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring operations including combinations andor
relocations of operations changes in tnts strategic direction or managerial responses to declining
demand increasing costs or other market factors restructuring provisions reflect many estimates
including those pertaining to separation costs reduction of excess facilities contract settlements and
tangible asset impairments actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these
estimates

income taxes
the company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision and liability for income taxes there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business
tnt recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due
based on its best interpretation of the relevant tax laws and rules where the final tax outcome of these
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the income
tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made

tnt recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow
the deferred tax asset to be recovered this is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in
which the company operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable in the
event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods and depending on the tax
strategies that the company may be able to implement changes to the recognition of deferred tax
assets could be required which could impact tnts financial position and net profit

accounting for assets held for disposal
accounting for assets held for disposal requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates such
as the assumptions used in fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to dispose

pension benefits
the present value of the pension obligation depends on a number of factors that are determined on an
actuarial basis using a number of assumptions any change in these assumptions will impact the
carrying amount of pension obligations the assumptions used in determining the net pension
expenseincome include the discount rate which is based on the longterm yield of highquality
corporate bonds other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market
conditions tnt reviews the assumptions at the end of each year refer to note 10 for more information

contingent liabilities
legal proceedings covering a range of matters are pending against the company in various jurisdictions
due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters it is often difficult to predict the final outcome cases
and claims against the company often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues that are
subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to the facts and circumstances
of each particular case and claim the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law in the normal
course of business tnt consults with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters related to
litigations

tnt accrues a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated in the event an adverse outcome is possible or an estimate is not
determinable the matter is disclosed as a contingent liability

goodwill
goodwill is allocated to tnts cgus and tested for impairment the total goodwill balance at 31
december 2015 which amounted to 1006 million 2014 1007 was allocated to middle east and
africa 246 million eastern europe 224 million germany 161 million france domestic 125
million south east europe  turkey 120 million nordics 53 million chile 24 million austria
21 million the pacific 20 million portugal 10 million north east asia 1 million and asean
1 million

the annual goodwill impairment test did not result in additional impairment charges more information is
disclosed in the following sections

goodwill impairment testing
as part of its goodwill impairment test tnt performed a detailed review of the recoverable amount of
each cgu the recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost of disposal and the value in
use fair value less cost of disposal represents the best estimate of the amount tnt would receive if it
were to sell the cgu the value in use is estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash
flows the subsequent impairment test is based on the value in use

for mature markets the estimated future net cash flows are based on a fiveyear forecast and business
plan for emerging markets where no steady state has been achieved to date a tenyear forecast has
been applied to estimate the future net cash flows the cash flow projections were based on
managements latest estimates

projected gross margins are based on past performance and expectations of market development the
applied growth rates do not exceed the longterm average growth rate of the related operations and
markets and are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports the discount rates used vary
from 84 to 165 pretax to reflect specific risks relating to each cgu

key assumptions used to determine the recoverable values of all cgus are
 maturity of the underlying market market share and volume development to determine the revenue
   mix and comparable compound annual growth percentage between 2 and 10



                                                                                                                80

   level of operating income largely impacted by revenue and cost development taking into account the
    nature of the underlying costs and potential economies of scale
   discount rate applied follows the nature of the underlying cash flows and foreign currency and
    inflationrelated risks and
   terminal growth rates used take into account the current low risk free rate which is based on the 20
    year german government bonds and ranges between 0 and11 especially for emerging markets
    this is very conservative as the risk free rate for these specific cgus will be substantially higher

management has carried out an impairment test and concluded that the recoverable amount based on
value in use of the individual cgus is higher than the carrying amount as a result of which no
impairment has been recognised

a sensitivity analysis has been applied for all cgus this sensitivity analysis included the individual
impact of the following items which are considered to be the most critical when determining the
recoverable value
 increase of the discount factor by 1 and 2
 increase of capital expenditure by 5 per year and
 decrease of operating income by 5 per year

based on the sensitivity analysis management concluded that for all cgus with goodwill balances the
recoverable amount based on value in use of the individual cgus is higher than the carrying amount as
a result of which there are no cgus with limited headroom to be disclosed

in 2014 based on the impairment test management concluded that the recoverable amount based on
value in use of cgu spain was below the carrying amount as a result of which an impairment of 32
million was recognised

software and other intangible assets
at 31 december 2015 the software balance of 110 million 2014 77 included internally generated
software with a book value of 80 million 2014 57 the addition to software of 20 million is related to
purchased software of 17 million and selfproduced software of 3 million an amount of 50 million
was reclassified to software related to finalised it projects

at 31 december 2015 the other intangible assets balance of 26 million 2014 33 is related to
customer relationships of 3 million 2014 3 and software under construction of 23 million 2014 30
the addition to other intangibles of 44 million is mainly related to software development projects

the estimated amortisation expenses for software and other intangibles for the subsequent five years
are as follows 2016 37 million 2017 38 million 2018 28 million 2019 20 million 2020 11
million and thereafter 2 million besides software development tnt does not conduct significant
research and development and therefore does not incur research and development costs

in 2015 2 million 2014 2 impairment on selfproduced software was recognised relating to software
which will no longer be used of which 1 million is related to international europe and 1 million to
unallocated

in 2014 the transfers tofrom assets held for disposal relate to the reclassification of brazil from assets
held for disposal and discontinued operations to continuing operations

tnts pension expense is affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations
management reviews these and other assumptions every year measurement date for tnts post
employment benefits is 31 december changes in assumptions may occur as a result of economic and
market conditions if actual results differ from those assumed this will generate actuarial gains or
losses

ias 19 employee benefits requires an entity to determine the rates used to discount employee benefit
obligations with reference to market yields on highquality corporate bonds the first step of the process
is to identify a set of bonds that accurately reflects the relationship between yield and remaining time to
maturity for highquality corporate bonds for this tnt uses the iboxx aarated corporate bond
universe from bloomberg after standardisation by means of the par bond approach the yields to
maturity are then grouped together in clusters and then curvedfitted from this a yield curve is derived
by bootstrapping following an inclusion of a correction for the durationmismatch rounded up to the
nearest decimal the nelsonsiegel model is applied to fit the curve towards tnts 30year duration
the resulting discount rate per 31 december 2015 was 20 2014 23

the expected return on plan assets equals the used discount rate

assumptions regarding future mortality are based on advice published statistics and experience per
country the average life expectancy of men after retiring at the average age of 67 is 21 years 2014
22 the equivalent life expectancy for women is 24 years 2014 25

as published in the offer memorandum and in accordance with the applicable plan rules i all share
rights held by senior management will vest on the settlement date provided that for the 2015 share
rights vesting will occur and become payable on a time pro rata parte basis up to the settlement date
calculated on a monthly basis and ii the vesting will be settled in cash rather than in shares based
on the offer price

in case the settlement date occurs after the regular vesting date of the 2013 performance share plan
award this 2013 grant will become subject to regular vesting based on the achieved applicable
performance scores the 2013 performance shares will in such event however still be settled in cash
rather than in tnt shares based on the required steps and subject to the necessary approvals fedex
and tnt continue to anticipate that the fedex offer will close in the first half of 2016

given the likelihood of the acquisition by fedex and the cash settlement of the sharebased schemes
the plans have been accounted for using a fair value of 800 offer price as per the balance sheet

bonusmatching plan
in 2014 appointed members of a selected group of managers could on a voluntary basis participate in
the bonusmatching plan by investing a maximum of 50 of the gross payout of the shortterm incentive
of the previous year however the investment in tnt shares could not be more than the net proceeds
of the bonus after a threeyear holding period these bonus shares will be matched on a onetoone
basis and settled in shares provided continued service for each bonus share that is sold within three
years the associated right to one matching share lapses if more than 50 of the bonus shares are sold
within the threeyear vesting period the entire right to matching shares lapses with immediate effect

in both 2015 and 2013 the executive board decided not to provide for a bonusmatching share grant for
senior management

among other rights and obligations it includes liabilities allocated to tnt as part of the tnt demerger
related to the pension entitlements of beneficiaries in the pension funds who are no longer employed by

   plans up to the date of the demerger of tnt and postnl in 2011 and will comprise a liability that
   will gradually decrease over time

   funds is below a certain level the guarantee lapses if the coverage ratio rises above that level and
   remains above that level for three consecutive quarters and
 the contractual agreement replaces any rights under article 334 t of book 2 of the dutch civil code

contingent tax liabilities
tnt is exposed to varying degrees of uncertainty related to tax planning and regulatory reviews and
audits tnt accounts for its income taxes on the basis of its own internal analyses supported by
external advice tnt continually monitors its global tax position and whenever uncertainties arise tnt
assesses the potential consequences and either accrues the liability or discloses a contingent liability in
its financial statements depending on the strength of the companys position and the resulting risk of
loss

at yearend 2015 total contingent tax liabilities for uncertainties are assessed to amount to between 70
million and 80 million 2014 between 70 million and 80 million for which tnt based on its own
assessment and supported by external advice has concluded that the likelihood of an outflow of
economic benefits to settle the obligation is not probable

29 financial risk management
no corresponding financial statement number

tnts activities expose the company to a variety of financial risks such as market risks including
foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk all of these risks arise
in the normal course of business to manage market risks tnt uses a variety of financial derivatives

the tables within this note provide quantitative information regarding tnts exposure to the financial
risks mentioned above there are certain limitations and simplifications inherent in the analyses
presented primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a parallel fashion and instantaneously
while at the same time for example the impact of changes in interest on foreign exchange exposures
and vice versa is ignored in addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions
that normally would arise from the market shifts assumed

tnt uses derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging exposures the company
enters into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with its
underlying exposures and does not take positions independent of these exposures none of these
financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take speculative positions

financial risk management is carried out by the tnt treasury department under policies approved by
the executive board the tnt treasury department identifies evaluates and hedges financial risk in
close cooperation with operating units the executive board provides written principles for overall risk
management as well as written policies covering specific areas such as interest rate risk foreign
exchange risk credit risk and liquidity risk periodic reporting on financial risks has been embedded in
the overall risk framework and has been provided to the executive board in a structural way

interest rate risk
part of tnts borrowings and leases are against floating interest rates these floating interest rates may
fluctuate substantially and could have a material adverse effect on tnts financial results in any given
reporting period borrowings that are issued at variable rates expose the company to cash flow volatility
from movements in interest rates borrowings that are issued at fixed rates expose the company to fair
value interest rate risk tnts financial assets are on average of such shortterm nature that they bear
no significant fair value interest rate risk but do cause cash flow interest rate risks group policy is to
significantly limit the impact of interest fluctuations over a term of seven years as a percentage of
earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation at 31 december 2015 tnts gross
interest bearing borrowings including ﬁnance lease obligations totalled 230 million 2014 216 of
which 161 million 2014 164 was at a ﬁxed interest rate

although tnt generally enters into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives in order to
attempt to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations these measures may be inadequate or may
subject the company to increased operating or financing costs

at 31 december 2015 if interest rates on borrowings and financial assets had been 1 higher with
other variables held constant the profit before income tax would have been 4 million higher 2014 6
and equity would be impacted by 5 million 2014 8 due to the outstanding interest rate swaps with a
nominal value of us168 million refer to note 30 for more information

foreign currency exchange risk
tnt operates on an international basis generating foreign currency exchange risks arising from future
commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities investments and divestments in foreign
currencies other than the euro tnts functional and reporting currency these significant operational
foreign currency cash flow risks are mostly not hedged tnt treasury department matches and
manages the intragroup and external financial exposures although the company generally enters into
hedging arrangements and other contracts in order to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations
these measures may be inadequate or may subject the company to increased operating or financing
costs

management has set up a policy that requires group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk
against their local functional currency group companies are required to hedge material balance sheet
exposures via the use of foreign exchange derivatives with the tnt treasury department whereby a
financing company operated by the department trades these foreign exchange derivatives with external
banks tnt currently has no net investment hedges outstanding significant acquisitions and local debt
is usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets

credit risk
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if counterparties with whom tnt enters into
financial transactions are unable to fulfil the terms of the agreements credit risk arises from cash and
cash equivalents derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit
exposures relating to customers the company attempts to minimise its credit risk exposure by only
transacting with financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines and by managing its
customers portfolio tnt continually monitors the credit standing of financial counterparties and its
customers individual risk limits are set on internal and external ratings in accordance with limits set by
the executive board the utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored at balance sheet date there
were no significant concentrations of credit risk related to customers the top ten customers of tnt
account for 3 of the outstanding trade receivables at 31 december 2015

liquidity risk
prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash the availability of funding through
an adequate amount of undrawn committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions
due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses tnt attempts to maintain flexibility in funding
by keeping committed credit lines available

tnt has central availability to the following undrawn committed facilities

 a tax optimal internal and external funding focused at optimising the cost of capital for the group
     within longterm sustainable boundaries

tnts credit ratings per 31 december 2015 are bbb stable by sp and baa2 stable by moodys a
downgrade in the credit rating of tnt may negatively affect its ability to obtain funds from financial
institutions retain investors and banks and increase its financing costs by increasing the interest rates of
its outstanding debt or the interest rates at which the company is able to refinance existing debt or incur

chapter 5

we designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in
the financial statements in particular we looked at where the executive board made subjective
judgments for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions
and considering future events that are inherently uncertain as in all of our audits we also addressed
the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of
bias by the directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud

our engagement consists of a review of the halfyear interim financial statements pre yearend closing
procedures in the fourth quarter 2015 and the yearend audit given the size of the company and its
operations we are involved on a continuous basis and have ongoing discussions with the finance
functions corporate and local management the executive board and audit committee we have
attended all audit committee meetings during the year and presented our findings in the supervisory
board meeting in february 2016

                                                                                                       127

overall group materiality                 8 million 2014  10 million
how we determined it                     5 of adjusted profit before tax these adjustments consist
                                         mainly of fedex related costs restructuring related costs and
                                         transition costs which are audited in more detail
rationale for benchmark applied          we have applied this benchmark a generally accepted auditing
                                         practice based on our analysis of the common information needs
                                         of users of the financial statements on this basis we believe that
                                         profit before tax is an important metric for the financial
                                         performance of the company
component materiality                    to each component in our audit scope we based on our
                                         judgment allocate materiality that is less than our overall group
                                         materiality the range of materiality allocated across components
                                         was between  05 million and  42 million



we also take misstatements andor possible misstatements into account that in our judgment are
material for qualitative reasons

we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements in the income
statement identified during our audit exceeding  04 million 2014  05 million as well as
misstatements below that amount that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons

the scope of our group audit
tnt express nv is the holding company of a group of entities the financial information of this group is
included in the consolidated financial statements of tnt express nv

when setting the scope of our audit of the group we consider the following key factors in the control
environment
 we rely where relevant and efficient on the groups internal control on financial reporting icfr
   framework and the monitoring of this framework where relevant we test this framework at the
   companys head office and in some selected countries in order to assess whether we are able to
   rely on it
 the majority of the groups it applications is managed centrally by tnts it central services in the
   uk we test these systems and procedures centrally and provide an independent assurance report
   on the central it general controls to the component audit teams
 the system for international deliveries is centrally maintained we use the system data as a basis for
   centralised revenue assurance procedures these revenue reports are followed up at the component
   level by component audit teams
 we undertake work and provide an independent assurance report concerning the groups financial
   transfer pricing process which is centrally organised our component audit teams gain comfort from
   this report and
 we liaise with the groups internal audit department they perform financial and operational audits
   on a rotational and risk assessment basis in addition to our group audit scope we also selected 4
   smaller entities on a rotational basis as part of our unpredictability procedures these audits are
   performed by internal audit we perform procedures to ensure that we can place sufficient reliance
   on internal audit such as assessing their objectivity and competence their system of quality review
   by providing them specific instructions and reviewing their audit files

taking into account the key factors above we tailor the scope of our audit of the group

how we tailored the scope of our group audit
determining factors for the scope of our audit are the geographic structure of the group country risk
the significance andor risk profile of group entities or activities the tone at the top fraud risk the
accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the group operates on this basis we
selected group reporting entities for which an audit of financial information or specific balances was
considered necessary and included tax valuation pension and sharebased payments specialists in our
group audit team

tnt is a logistics company with activities located on numerous smaller and larger locations around the
globe no individual component is considered financially significant eg more than 15 of the groups
revenue to obtain sufficient coverage a total of 32 components are selected our scope ensures we
cover all larger components in scope and focuses on entities with significant operations or activities
which are relevant to the audit based on risk profile or supporting activities to the group



                                                                                                         128

we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items



revenue                       81
total assets                  82
profit before tax             81




none of the remaining components represented more than 2 of total group revenue or total group
assets for those remaining components we reviewed the monitoring controls performed by the head
office functions which includes the governance framework icfr procedures internal audit reports and
oversight by divisional management in addition we performed amongst others analytical procedures to
corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatements within those
components

the group audit is aligned with the divisional structure of tnt express nv we conducted audit work on
32 components in the domestics division all countries with the exception of chile have been identified
as larger components being  australia brazil france italy and the uk in addition larger components
have been identified in the international europe division for example germany and the international
amea division for example china in our view due to their significance andor risk characteristics
each of these components required a full scope audit of their financial information we also included all
significant network entities in our group audit scope by performing full scope or specified audit
procedures on european road network it central services tnt eurohub and tnt airways

we issued detailed instructions to the audit teams of the components in our audit scope these
instructions included our risk analysis materiality and global audit approach to centralised processes
and systems we determined the level of involvement in the audit work at those entities in order to be
able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our
opinion on the group financial statements as a whole we formally update our component teams three
times during the year via conference calls in which we present recent developments the scope of our
audit audit risks materiality and our global audit approach we also had individual calls with every
component team on three occasions during the year during these calls we discuss the reports of the
component team the findings of their procedures and other matters which could be of relevance for the
group financial statements in addition separate calls were held on an ongoing basis between senior
members of the group audit team and the component auditors during these calls we share local
findings and consider their follow up or the need for support or information from a central level the
group audit team annually visits a number of the component teams during these visits amongst others
we discuss the risk assessment review local audit procedures and findings and we meet local
management in the current year senior members of the group team visited the united kingdom italy
germany france china australia belgium and spain our selection is based on the relative
significance of the entities within the group or specific risks identified  for example in relation to the
organisational changes refer to key audit matter organisational changes and it transformation

the company operates three segments with centralised control in addition holding central network
and certain other activities are included in the unallocated segment this implies that significant andor
complex transactions are executed or monitored by the tnt head office therefore the group audit
team performs audit work on the following group entities tnt nederland bv tnt finance bv tnt
transport international bv tnt express nv tnt express nederland bv and tnt european road
network bv

the group consolidation financial statement disclosures and a number of items are audited by the
group audit team at the tnt head office these include goodwill impairment testing derivative
financial instruments hedge accounting segmentation aircraft valuations group tax risks certain
deferred tax assets share based payments restructuring costs claims and litigation pension
accounting disposal of group companies follow up on whistleblower allegations ethics and compliance
with laws and regulations we have also issued specified audit procedure instructions to obtain comfort
over tax positions in the belgian entities and the german and french holding entities

by performing the procedures above at components combined with additional procedures at group
level we have obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of
the group as a whole to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements

audit of the financial statements we have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory

in note 8 of the financial statement tnts explains     for the airline disposal we considered whether the

 the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with euifrs and
   with part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code and for the preparation of the executive board report
   as set out on pages 3 to 18 pages 37 to 48 and pages 55 to 60 in accordance with part 9 of book 2
   of the dutch civil code and for
 such internal control as the executive board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
   financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error

as part of the preparation of the financial statements the executive board is responsible for assessing
the companys ability to continue as a going concern based on the financial reporting frameworks
mentioned the executive board should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the executive board either intends to liquidate the company or to cease
operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so the executive board should disclose events and
circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the companys ability to continue as a going concern

the supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the companys financial reporting process

our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit
evidence to provide a basis for our opinion our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement reasonable assurance is a
high but not absolute level of assurance which makes it possible that we may not detect all
misstatements misstatements may arise due to fraud or error they are considered to be material if
individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions
of users taken on the basis of the financial statements

a more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report

appendix to our auditors report on the financial statements 2015 of
tnt express nv
in addition to what is included in our auditors report we have further set out in this appendix our
responsibilities for the audit of the accompanying financial statements and explained what an audit
involves

the auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
we have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the
audit in accordance with dutch standards on auditing ethical requirements and independence
requirements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error our audit consisted
amongst others of
 identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due
   to fraud or error designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtaining
   audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not
   detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as
   fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the intentional
   override of internal control
 obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
   procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an
   opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control
 evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
   estimates and related disclosures made by executive board
 concluding on the appropriateness of executive boards use of the going concern basis of
   accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained concluding whether a material uncertainty
   exists related to events andor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the companys ability to
   continue as a going concern if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists we are required to
   draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or if such
   disclosures are inadequate to modify our opinion our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
   obtained up to the date of our auditors report and are made in the context of our opinion on the
   financial statements as a whole however future events or conditions may cause the company to
   cease to continue as a going concern
 evaluating the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements including the
   disclosures and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions
   and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation

considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the companys consolidated financial
statements we are responsible for the direction supervision and performance of the group audit in this
context we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the group
to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a
whole determining factors are the geographic structure of the group the significance andor risk profile
of group entities or activities the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the group
operates on this basis we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information
or specific balances was considered necessary

we communicate with the supervisory board regarding among other matters the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit

we provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable related
safeguards

from the matters communicated with the supervisory board we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters we describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter or when in extremely rare circumstances not communicating the
matter is in the public interest




                                                                                                           134

the losttime injury rate ltir is a more stringent health and safety kpi which has been retroactively
calculated for 2014 and 2015 based on the losttime injuries of tnt employees in relation to their
working hours this new kpi will be used from january 2016 to manage performance the aim of this
health and safety kpi is zero harm zero blame with a maximum ltir tolerance of 10 10  1 lost
time injury per 200000 working hours

7 absenteeism
tnts approach to manage longterm absenteeism is to provide employees with a safe and timely
return to work regardless of the reason for being absent in the event of a longterm absence a return
to work interview is held in the form of an open discussion between employee and manager this also
gives management the opportunity to provide support to the employee and the possibility to improve the
situation where applicable the employees return to work is also closely monitored and managed by
human resources and a registered medical practitioner if required

notes to the environmental performance

9 co2e emissions absolute
for sector comparison purposes the co2e footprint according to the ghg protocol corporate standard
revised 2004 can be reported in three categories
 scope 1 covers all direct emissions generated by sources that are owned or controlled by the
     company such as operational vehicles aviation and heating
 scope 2 includes all emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the
     company
 scope 3 refers to indirect emissions that are a consequence of the companys activities but occur
     from sources not owned or controlled by the company

depending on data available and the transportation segment tnt reported data is used when reliable
and accurate data is captured and reported in case this information is not available default values are
applied this replaces the previous methodology using secondary indicators such as kilometres driven
and costs as a result prior year data has been restated

14 global co2e efficiency
in 2015 tnt introduced a new co2e efficiency indicator expressed in the number of grammes of co2e
that are emitted to transport one metric tonne 1000 kg of cargo over a distance of one kilometre g
co2etonneskm in order to track the benefits of both route and load factor optimisation initiatives in
2015 the global co2e efficiency kpi including both road and air for own and subcontracted activities
amounted to 490 g co2etonneskm which will be used as the baseline to track progress on a yearon
year basis the co2e efficiency indicator using the new methodology is not comparable with the co2e
efficiency figures of air transport

the co2e efficiency for tnts european air network improved due to the replacement of aircraft and
growth in volumes the new aircraft are relatively more fuelefficient the deterioration of the efficiency
of long haul flights is related to a decrease in volumes and therefore a drop in cargo load factor

as part of outlook in september 2014 tnt launched a new brand identity highlighting tnts people
and unique european road network the new tagline tnt  the people network reflects tnts
culture and drive to develop strong relationships between employees and customers within the people
network framework tnt aims to continue to nurture the orange spirit and cultivate a strong sense of
engagement with employees

in 2015 as part of the people network initiative two countries slovenia and portugal were awarded
with a tnt selfie truck which displayed the faces of more than 95 of the respective countrys
employees in addition tnt launched several internal engagement programmes such as the extra
mile the rising star and the good morning photo competition the customer campaign keep
scoring with tnt which included an online football game also featured significant employee

independent assurance report

to the executive board of tnt express nv

the executive board of tnt express nv tnt amsterdam engaged us to provide assurance on
certain information corporate responsibility information in the annual report of tnt we believe these
procedures fulfil the rational objective as disclosed by tnt in the section corporate responsibility
reporting scope on page 151

our engagement consisted of a combination of reasonable assurance leading to an opinion and
limited assurance leading to a conclusion on the corporate responsibility information in chapter 3
chapter 5 section ii and the annexes of the 2015 annual report of tnt referred to as corporate
responsibility information sections
 we performed reasonable assurance on data and tables included in the corporate responsibility
    information sections which are marked with a rhombus 
 we performed limited assurance on all other elements not marked with a rhombus  included in
    the corporate responsibility information sections

our opinion
based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained in our opinion the
data and tables marked with a rhombus  included in the corporate responsibility information sections
of the annual report of tnt for the year ended 31 december 2015 are in all material respects
presented reliably and adequately in accordance with the tnt reporting criteria

our conclusion
based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained nothing has come to
our attention that causes us to believe that the other elements not marked with a rhombus  in the
corporate responsibility information sections of the annual report of tnt for the year ended 31
december 2015 do not provide a reliable and appropriate presentation of
 the policy of tnt concerning the sustainable development as mentioned in the corporate
   responsibility information sections and
 the activities events and performance of tnt in accordance with the companys reporting criteria
this opinion and conclusion are to be read in the context of the remainder of our report

the scope of our assurance
we performed procedures and obtained evidence on the data and tables in the corporate responsibility
information sections in chapter 3 sections i till iv chapter 5 section ii and the annexes of the 2015
annual report of tnt the corporate responsibility information consists of
 the policy of tnt concerning the sustainable development for the year ended 31 december 2015
 the activities events and performance of tnt concerning the sustainable development for the year
    ended 31 december 2015 and
 the scoping of the corporate responsibility information disclosed by management in the paragraph
    corporate responsibility reporting scope on page 151

we have audited the corporate responsibility information marked with a rhombus  included in the
corporate responsibility information sections of the annual report of tnt for the year ended 31
december 2015

we have reviewed the other elements not marked with a rhombus  in the corporate responsibility
information sections included in the annual report for the year 2015 of tnt

limited assurance leading to the above mentioned conclusion is substantially less in scope than
reasonable assurance in relation to both the risk assessment procedures including an understanding of
internal control and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks

reasonable assurance leading to the abovementioned opinion is expressed on the data and tables
marked with a rhombus 




                                                                                                      153

the basis for our opinion and conclusion
professional and ethical standards applied
we conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with dutch law including standard 3810n
assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports hereafter standard 3810n our
responsibilities under this standard are further described in the our responsibilities section of this
report

we are independent of tnt in accordance with the verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van
accountants by assuranceopdrachten vio and other relevant independence requirements in the
netherlands furthermore we have complied with the verordening gedrags en beroepsregels
accountants vgba and other relevant regulations

limitations in our scope
the corporate responsibility information sections contain prospective information such as ambitions
strategy targets expectations and projections inherent to this information is that actual future results
may be different from the prospective information and therefore it may be uncertain we do not provide
any assurance on the assumptions and feasibility of this prospective information

the auditor is not expected to and cannot reduce audit risk to zero and cannot therefore obtain
absolute assurance that the corporate responsibility information is free from material misstatement due
to fraud or error this is because there are inherent limitations of an assurance engagement which
result in most of the audit evidence on which the auditor bases the auditors opinion being persuasive
rather than conclusive

reporting criteria
tnt developed its corporate responsibility reporting criteria on the basis of the g4 guidelines of the
global reporting initiative gri which are disclosed on pages 160163 together with detailed
information on the reporting scope on page 151 we consider the corporate responsibility reporting
criteria to be relevant and appropriate for our examination

understanding reporting and measurement methodologies
the information in the scope of this engagement needs to be read and understood together with the
reporting criteria for which the company is solely responsible for selecting and applying the absence
of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure nonfinancial
information allows for different but acceptable measurement techniques and can affect comparability
between entities and over time

our assurance approach
materiality
tnt developed its corporate responsibility reporting criteria on the basis of the g4 guidelines of the
global reporting initiative gri which are disclosed on pages 160163 together with detailed
information on the reporting scope on page 151 we consider the corporate responsibility reporting
criteria to be relevant and appropriate for our examination

work done
we are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of
the responsibility reporting sections

our work is carried out by an independent and multidisciplinary team which is part of the group audit
engagement team with experience in corporate responsibility reporting and assurance and was
performed at the head office in amsterdam and during conducted visits to the significant group entities

reasonable and limited assurance about whether the report is free from material misstatement

material misstatement of the corporate responsibility information sections whether due to fraud or error
in making those risk assessments the auditor considers internal control relevant for the preparation of
the corporate responsibility information sections in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys
internal control an assurance engagement aimed on providing limited and reasonable assurance also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting framework used and the reasonableness of
estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the corporate
responsibility information sections
