    managing activities related to the ibiden group charter of behavior
    the ibiden group charter of behavior was established to reflect the international movement as well as re
    quests of external stakeholders in implementing csr management in accordance with the companys
    corporate philosophy the ibiden way as an international common understanding we value and reflect the
    iso26000 guidance responsibilities required of a company by the un global compact and the code of con
    duct stipulated by eicc the electronics industry association though the company is not a member in the
    charter of behavior as part of the supply chain moreover we also assess and reflect items emphasized by
    domestic initiatives such as the charter of corporate code of the japan business federation keidanren the
    company is affiliated with in the charter of behavior
        in order to develop these ideas into specific activities we implement activities in three phases responses
    as the company individuals activities and expansion of activities to suppliers based on global standards and
    requests from and assessment items of outside organizations
        we as a company determine what we are supposed to be in the medium term translate what to imple
    ment into policies of each division and promote appropriate activities by translating what to implement into
    policies of each division we manage the progress of activities related to the ibiden group charter of behav
    ior as operations of such division

                       goals for the group


    for each employee we have created the ibiden standards for employee behavior as a standard for specific
    activities under the group charter of behavior the standards were also established by taking global stan
    dards into account such as the code of conduct or request items of the industry and ibiden group
    companies also have their unique standards for employee behavior in accordance with the ibiden standards
    for employee behavior see compliance on page 13
        to suppliers we have created the ibiden group supplier csr guidelines and give guidance through ex
    planation of the standards investigation of actual conditions and audits see csr management in the supply
    chain on page 17
        in fiscal year 2014 we will establish standards we need to work on based on the approach of global stan
    dards and request items as standards for csr management and integrate the management of such standards
    into the management system of ibiden as a whole we aim to start trial management in fiscal year 2014 and
    create a framework to manage activities in the ibiden management system in fiscal year 2015 and after

    shared understanding of global social responsibilities at home and abroad we have shared issues with em
    ployees through education and training while deepening our understanding of what an industry association is
    required to comply with and what issues we need to work on in communication with customers we have
    also shared and worked on what is required of suppliers throughout the entire supply chain through faceto
    face meetings surveys on measures taken and audits

    corporate evaluation by external organizations
    the company conducts gap analyses between what it should be and the results of external corporate evalu
    ations our csr promotion division analyzes the data obtained from important survey questions and discusses
    the course of action with departments involved to identify elements that are lacking at the company further
    more if it is possible to improve upon these elements during the next fiscal year each department develops
    strategies within its action policy
       for fiscal year 2013 our focus was on the improvement of efforts for life cycle assessment in the area of
    the environment engaged in deep discussion about the definition and meaning of measures to the parts
    where indicators are insufficient including the status of response to water risk we promoted the efforts

    csrrelated audits
    we respond to csrrelated audits conducted by thirdparty organizations based on customer requirement
        the results of audits similarly undergo the process of gap analysis to establish the difference between the
    global industryrequired standards and the companys current efforts and to identify issues that need to be
    addressed we take to heart the suggested issues put forward during these audits and strive to improve upon
    them by analyzing the causes and implementing corrective actions as well as preventative measures further
    more we are working toward creating a system that meets the global standards by improving upon these
    issues
        in fiscal year 2013 we reviewed the framework of workers human rights and underwent an external csr
    audit unfortunately findings similar to past events were reported in terms of health and safety but there
    were no significant findings for workers human rights we are also swiftly working to improve other observed
    items the environment and industrial health and safety
        as for similar findings we ensure that the system and procedures are thoroughly managed and make
    checks on a regular basis to prevent recurrence we are also improving the awareness of managers so that
    they share issues take responsibility for working on them and maintain improved situations furthermore
    sites other than those where any incident occurred also share issues to check problems the entire group is
    faced with
        from now on we will create a system to prevent recurrence by absorbing the knowhow of external audit
    ing organizations and enhancing the function where managers and internal auditors check the systems
    management we also voluntarily undertake an external csr audit sort out problems from the perspective of
    customers and industry associations and implement activities to resolve such problems to enhance the reli
    ability of our csr activities

    we consider occurrence of a largescale earthquake in the area where our plants are located as an important
    risk theme and are currently working on measures we need to take in the event of such earthquake as for
    measures to be taken when disasters such as earthquakes occur we believe that lifesaving comes first fol
    lowed by the early supply of products to customers
        as for earthquake countermeasures we formed a working group created a framework such as the stan
    dard for setting up a disaster countermeasures office and specified the roles of each organization and
    securing the needed personnelinfrastructuresstockpiles we also review disaster prevention measures and
    the status of emergency response at each plant and fix any problems in fiscal year 2013 as a disaster drill as
    suming seismic damage has occurred we developed manuals to cope with a largescale earthquake ran a
    simulation of establishing a disaster countermeasures office and conducted an emergency drill assuming that
    a disaster had occurred at some plants
        the procurement division implements activities to reduce procurement risks that might arise due to an
    earthquake specifically the division checks the current status of the company and our suppliers considers
    measures to reduce risks in descending order of risk level and promotes activities for business continuity such
    as the establishment of the standards for notification in the event of a disaster as well as implementing proce

    compliance companywide promotional committee
    in august 2003 the compliance companywide promotional committee headed by the president was formed
    in an effort to bolster compliancerelated awareness across the group the committee carries out groupwide
    procompliance activities and reviews such undertakings compliancerelated policies and plans decided by
    the committee are communicated to each plant which in turn rolls out individual actions in accordance with
    them all group companies both in japan and abroad have set up their own compliance organizations man
    dated to formulate and conduct individual actions
        the compliance companywide promotional committee is held twice a year in fiscal year 2013 the com
    mittee was held in may and november each plant of ibiden confirms the progress in its activity goals and
    plan established at the beginning of the fiscal year at the compliance promotional committee at each plant

    standards for employee behavior
    the ibiden group has established the standards for employee behavior
    based on the ibiden group charter of behavior as the standards for offi
    cers and employees to ensure compliance we are revising the standards
    for employee behavior based on the global rules expectations as well as
    request items from stakeholders and in compliance with laws and regula
    tions of countries in which we operate we are also revising them so that
    they are easier to understand for and communicate to employees revi
    sions include items each officer and employee is required to abide by in
    terms of workers human rights which we need to comply with under
    global standards
                                                                                   the ibiden standards for employee
        while we distribute a copy of the standards for employee behavior to                    behavior
    all officers and employees they are also disclosed on our homepage so             sep 2011 revised version
    everyone can access them the ibiden group companies including overseas major manufacturing sites have
    also established standards for employee behavior based on the ibiden standards for employee behavior and
    promote education for compliance in addition the booklet we distribute to employees has information on
    the division in charge and where to consult so that employees feel comfortable making an inquiry when they
    have questions
        the ibiden group is committed to becoming a corporate group and a good corporate citizen that earns
    the trust of the international community while each officer and employee faithfully implements the standards
    for employee behavior

    compliance training
    when promoting compliance activities it is crucial that employee aware
    ness is continuously maintained at a high level
        the company runs a broad array of education programs including lev
    elspecific and workplacespecific training designed to enhance employee
    awareness of the importance of compliance these programs include
    group discussions on causes of violations of the standards for employee
    behavior and actions taken in response to the violations they educate
    every single trainee in consciously deciding on the right action in a given
                                                                                          compliance training
    situation
        we also enable new employees to deepen their understanding of csr and what violation of compliance is
    through discussions based on familiar cases
        among regions where the group operates the risk of unintentionally participating in an ethical violation or
    a human rights violation seems especially high in asia we have therefore provided training on topics such as
    human rights and an ethical code of conduct that takes into account the conditions in each country we do
    this for example by distributing our employee handbook which includes the standards for employee behav
    ior at the time of hiring at major asian production companies as ibiden electronics malaysia sdn bhd
    employs many foreign workers we also provide training on the standards for employee behavior and other
    educational topics in their native language so that they can fully grasp the content of the training all the em
    ployees hired during fiscal year 2013 received this training on compliance and csr
        the entire group will continue to promote further education and training on this important subject

    sued case examples for enlightenment case book which introduces cases of violation of the standards
    and points to remember for compliance to raise employees awareness of compliance at our plants employ
    ees in small groups read through the case book during daily meetings such as morning assembly moreover
    we continuously post these case examples on the csr portal site on our intranet and work on improvement
    of employees awareness

    compliance by directors
    when establishing a compliance system it is crucial that all officers and managers be at the forefront of the
    efforts in fiscal year 2013 we provided training to officers and managers concerning bribery prevention acts
    in various countries such as foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and uk bribery act ukba which we need
    to comply with in expanding businesses globally to reacknowledge the impact and points to remember when
    doing business overseas
        other than the establishment of the standards for employee behavior the group has created a strict com
    pliance system where business entertainment is not allowed without approval from a highlevel authority such
    as the president although the overall risk of being charged with misconduct is not high according to the re
    sults of assessment of corruption risk at each site we believe it is important to appropriately develop a
    system to prevent corruption in line with the current conditions of each site we will further enhance aware
    ness and strengthen our efforts for fair business practice the standards for employee behavior include items
    officers need to comply with individually such as restrictions on competition and transactions with conflicts of
    interest directors are required to comply with this in addition to the prevention of misconduct

    whistleblowing system
    in case of learning of any suspected compliance violation in the
    group employees are generally required to report it to consult
    and to take action using the chain of command between the su
    perior and the subordinate we have however established a
    compliance consultation service for quickly solving any problem
    that cannot be reported through the usual channels
                                                                                 compliance consultation service card
       the compliance consultation service is based on protecting the                 distributed to all employees
    rights of whistleblowers in ways including securing the anonymity
    and privacy of persons who seek consultation and guaranteeing to ban giving them any disadvantageous
    treatment the service is available not only to employees of ibiden group companies but also to all those
    working for the group we endeavor to make the service known to everyone by distributing cards which de
    scribe how to use the service and putting up posters
       by having several windows for consultation we have an environment in place where employees feel com
    fortable consulting within the company with a law firm and with outside organizations in addition we have a
    consultation desk that suppliers can use this way we have created an environment where we can collect
    valuable opinions concerning compliance not only internally but also from suppliers while the consultation
    desk expects those consulting it to indicate their names in reporting to facilitate timely investigation as well as
    protection anonymous consultation is also acceptable to discover and deal with problems as early as possi
    ble we will continue our educational activities to enhance our reliability by offering a consultation service that
    can be safely used by those who seek consultation

    response to compliance deviations
    in fiscal year 2013 49 consultation cases 47 in the previous year were reported in japan as a whole of
    those five cases 10 in the previous year had the potential to lead to harassment in the relationship between
    a superior and a subordinate most of them resulted from insufficient communication such as the wording of a
    superior text of an email or insufficient followup in addition to the low level of the superiors awareness
    since the previous year the number of such cases has been decreasing due to enhanced training for superiors


                                                                  corporate social responsibility report2014 ibiden co ltd 15




53889312609indd   15                                                                                                      20140929   182933

    on harassment we work on preventive measures by making superiors aware of their positions within the
    company and providing guidance about wording etc so that they can have increased proper communication
        furthermore in fiscal year 2013 we observed cases of violation of ethical norms such as receiving exces
    sive entertainment and gifts from suppliers this occurred because relevant rules and systems were not
    properly administered creating a business environment where improper behavior was likely to occur with in
    sufficient checks by superiors we are working on establishment and thorough implementation of rules for
    receiving gifts etc within the group and are working with suppliers to enhance compliance based on the
    companys purchase policy as these cases are also relevant to suppliers the entire ibiden group works to
    prevent recurrence of such malicious violation of ethical norms

    selfcheck of activities and opinion poll
    we conduct a selfcheck on the status of compliance with the standards for employee behavior and a survey
    on compliance awareness every year covering all employees including those of domestic group companies
        in the selfcheck employees subject to the selfcheck including employees holding managerial posts diag
    nose the state of compliance with items of the standards for employee behavior and compliancerelated
    challenges at each group company or plant are clarified through summarizing the results of the diagnosis any
    problem identified in this process will be addressed through remedial activities at group companies and
    plants in the following fiscal year we link little understood topics with educational programs for instance
    case studies illustrating compliancerelated issues that many testtakers failed to answer correctly are pub
    lished to increase their understanding
        in the opinion poll the degree of satisfaction with the workplace andor superiors and risks of injustice at
    the workplace are evaluated from various aspects and features by office organization and those by group
    companyplant are analyzed we monitor changes in employee awareness and reflect the results in the com
    pliance activities and educational programs of the following fiscal year as is the case with the selfcheck

    management of trade secrets
    information concerning the operation technologies and management of the company is a valuable asset and
    for a technologydevelopmentoriented company like us proper management of such information and preven
    tion of leakage are important issues and responsibilities also leakage of customers and suppliers
    confidential information leads to loss of trust in us from customers and suppliers and can cause damage to
    the company in order to implement information security management we have established a framework for
    information security promotion and stipulated fundamental rules to comply with in utilizing and maintaining in
    formation assets we own such as trade secrets and personal information under the fundamental rules for
    information security
        as specific measures in terms of physical aspects we keep a record of entering and leaving from the main
    entrance and restrict entering and leaving in the control area in order to oversee the entrance and exit of peo
    ple as well as products in the field of it security we assess it management in terms of management and tool
    system and take countermeasures for issues each site is faced with in fiscal year 2013 we conducted an in
    ternal audit on it control over major overseas manufacturing companies and are implementing measures to
    increase the level of information security efforts in fiscal year 2013 there was no incident of information leak
    age that would significantly affect stakeholders

    system and achievement of legal compliance
    compliance with laws and regulations is a fundamental requirement for corporate activities and the latest in
    formation on laws and regulations is required all the time at the company the legal division lists laws and
    regulations that have an impact on the company and monitors the status of revision or abolition thereof the
    division also notifies divisions in charge of each law and regulation of any revision or promulgation and when
    any action is required checks the results of such action
       in particular we extract laws and regulations that have a significant impact on the ibiden group as import
    ant laws and regulations and designate those with especially considerable impact as the most important laws
    and regulations important laws and regulations include those concerning finance tax matters it control la
    bor and employment political funds import and export and others concerning compliance as for the most
    important laws and regulations we exercise management and thoroughly implement measures to prevent le
    gal violation by clarification of compliance rules training to keep everyone informed regular review of the
    status of compliance and audits as a result in fiscal year 2013 we did not observe any cases of legal viola
    tion that would have a significant impact on business activities

                                                                  corporate social responsibility report2014 ibiden co ltd 16

      csr management in the supply chain

    to earn the trust of international community while operating business globally both the group and the entire
    supply chain must responsibly take actions that respond to social demands although our major businesses
    are positioned in the midstream of the supply chain that provides parts we believe that promotion of csr ac
    tivities based on the fundamental policy of the ibiden group with suppliers that supply the group with
    materials etc and temporary help agencies as well as contractors that provide personnel and technological
    support to us leads to improvement of the corporate value and sustainable growth of the entire supply chain


    basic purchasing policy
    1 we comply with laws regulations and societal norms and strive to build relationships of trust and mutual
          cooperation with suppliers
    2 we provide suppliers opportunity at a fair deal
    3 we continue to fulfill our social responsibilities including human rights and environmental protection
          through purchasing activities


    ibiden group supplier csr guidelines
    ibiden began disclosing requests to suppliers based on its basic purchasing policies
    in fiscal year 2008 and held a briefing session for 100 suppliers in fiscal year 2009
    confirming the status of their measures this enabled us to confirm the gap in mea
    sures among the suppliers and recognize the necessity of management which has led
    to more specific improvements in the supply chain
         in fiscal year 2011 ibiden published ibiden group supplier csr guidelines fol
    lowing the changes in the ibiden group charter of behavior these guidelines
    provide our suppliers with items desired for the entire supply chain by our customers
    the industry and the international community as well as the group the items are di
    vided into subcategories according to themes such as labor health and safety
    environment protection ethics and fair business practices these guidelines also al                     ibiden group
                                                                                                          supplier csr guidelines
    low us to thoroughly understand the risks from several viewpoints such as worksite
    safety respect for and dignified treatment of employees and the consideration given to the environment
    which in turn allows us to make improvements


    communication and cooperation with supplier
                                             we also invited our major suppliers after the publication of the guidelines
                                             to our briefing session to share with them in addition to the group itself
                                             specific challenges ahead as they play an important supporting role in
                                             matters such as material supply subcontracting and procuring of tempo
                                             rary staff starting from fiscal year 2011 we began activities to verify and
                                             or remedy challenges concerning activities at suppliers by ensuring in
                                             house resources including fostering of auditors and conducting
                                             investigations into suppliers as well as making site visits and audits
       briefing session for csr guidelines      in fiscal year 2013 we carried out an investigation of material suppli
                                             ers process contractors onsite constructors and worker dispatching
    companies based on the csr guidelines in terms of labor health and safety environmental conservation and
    ethics and fair trade to confirm the status of efforts at suppliers through direct communication such as audits
    concerning labor health and safety environmental conservation and ethics and fair trade we work to improve
    suppliers understanding of our approach as a result of the investigation we conducted of suppliers in fiscal
    year 2013 the average rate of compliance of material suppliers was about 95 up 2 from the previous
    year also no case of material violation was found through csr investigations and audit visits as for other
    findings we promote activities to improve them by requesting suppliers to submit an improvement plan


                                                                     corporate social responsibility report2014 ibiden co ltd 17




53889312609indd   17                                                                                                         20140929   182934

         the ibiden group sites at home and abroad also have similar guidelines and in the philippines in particu
    lar they strengthen management of temporary help agencies as well as contractors working onsite and audit
    the status of management of wages and benefits to promote improvement in malaysia they regularly have a
    briefing session concerning the guidelines for suppliers and carry out an investigation as there are regional
    risks of exploitation of foreign workers by employment agents they conduct an audit on selection of employ
    ment agents in dispatching countries in advance and promote establishment of a healthy employment route
         we will strengthen the competitive edge of csr activities in the supply chain by promoting activities that
    respond to regional risks and keep working on various measures at home and abroad


    ibiden suppliers compliance counter
    the company promotes compliance rules and regulations ethical compliance by establishing the ibiden
    group charter of behavior and the ibiden standards for employee behavior as part of our continued efforts
    we also set up a compliance counter for our suppliers in fiscal year 2011 to which suppliers can report any
    compliance problem while dealing with the company similar to the compliance counter for our internal em
    ployees the information will be handled with the utmost care for privacy and the supplier will never suffer
    prejudicial treatment for contacting the counter in fiscal year 2013 we continued to make the compliance
    counter for business partners known to everyone but there was no report or consultation we will promote
    the compliance counter at a briefing session for business partners and pursue efforts for early detection and
    resolution of issues


    responding to the issue of conflict minerals
    illegal mining of resources in conflict areas the democratic republic of the congo and its surrounding conflict
    regions has become a major international issue as it abets human rights violations the ibiden group is very
    much concerned about the issue of conflict minerals tin tantalum tungsten and gold and is addressing the
    situation with a sense of social responsibility toward the products it offers
         our supplier csr guidelines clearly state that the suppliers should refrain from illegal mining in conflict
    areas as well as procuring resources that may support human rights violations the company tries its best to
    avoid contributing to illegal operations and human rights violations by not utilizing minerals illegally mined in
    conflict areas furthermore we will conduct reasonable investigations into the mineral supply routes and dis
    close the findings in good faith
         since fiscal year 2 0 1 1 we have been sharing with our suppliers the issues involving conflict minerals as
    well as the companys approach during a briefing session we also conduct supplier surveys to verify their
    supply routes including the identification of smelters and refiners furthermore we conduct sequential visits at
    some of our suppliers facilities and other related refining companies to explain the extent of the effort as well
    as verify the supply routes and their traceability history of materials parts and process
         some of the package substrates and printedwiring boards that we supply include tin and gold as a result
    of an investigation of traceability to suppliers conducted in fiscal year 2013 tin was mainly derived from
    smelters in southeast asia while gold was derived from ores coming from refineries of mainly japanese recy
    cling manufacturers these conflict minerals are verified to be derived from smelters that are certified or in the
    process of being certified by the conflict minerals free program of cfsi founded by eicc and gesi or to be
    made from recycling the company can say that these minerals do not include those derived from smelters
    that use raw materials from mines that play a part in conflicts in the democratic republic of the congo and its
    surrounding conflict zones
         from now on while we check the state of usage of conflict minerals and promote using certified smelters
    to suppliers that handle materials included in our products on a regular basis we will conduct an investigation
    of traceability within the entire group and facilitate establishment of a system that can aggregate the informa
    tion of the group we will continuously pay attention to avoid being a party to human rights violations within
    our supply chain by updating information of the supply chain on a regular basis and promoting the use of cer
    tified smelters

                                                                   corporate social responsibility report2014 ibiden co ltd 18

      respect for human rights

    in expanding businesses globally we sometimes encounter differences in awareness of human rights and in
    support based on laws and regulations for human rights protection even in such cases a role to avoid being
    a party to human rights violations and promoterespect human rights is required of us as one of our important
    corporate social responsibilities

    respect for worker rights
    the ibiden group clearly defines its basic policy to support and respect the protection of human rights as
    well as to avoid involvement in any violation of human rights the ibiden standards for employee behavior
    spells out such policy stipulating that officers and employees respect the basic principles and rights of labor
    and take actions that follow the common sense and rules of society while complying with the employmentre
    lated laws of each country such as the labor standards law and labor regulations

    human rights education
    to ensure respect for human rights the group offers education on fair employment and human rights particu
    larly to labor relations managers as well as managers and staff members in charge of recruitment interviews
    calling their attention to the prevention of humanrights violations ibiden also distributes the ibiden stan
    dards for employee behavior and example booklets a collection of violation examples to all employees at
    the time of hiring in our new employee training or education programs offered at the time of hiring we edu
    cate our employees to promote the understanding of the ibiden standards for employee behavior including
    dealing with human rights issues as well as to ensure that the standards are reflected in their actions

    known to everyone at group companies in particular approach to human rights varies in the asian region
    and we focus on educational activities in major manufacturing companies driving our policies home to all em
    ployees at the time of hiring and implementing annual programs

    assessment
    being a party to human rights violations is an issue not just for the ibiden group we believe it is important to
    work on the issue of human rights with the entire supply chain and thus cooperate with our direct suppliers in
    dealing with such issues in ibiden group supplier csr guidelines we specifically request that laborrelated hu
    man rights be observed including bans of child labor and forced labor activities for compliance with the csr
    guidelines are being promoted within the group and we confirm the state of compliance by suppliers by send
    ing out periodic questionnaires
       in fiscal year 2013 we continued to conduct an investigation on major suppliers and as a result conducted
    an audit on some suppliers and provided guidance to contractors and temporary staffing agencies this investi
    gation covers approximately 80 of our suppliers we stipulate minimum items we require our suppliers to
    comply with and as a result of the investigation and audit in fiscal year 2013 no serious violation was found
    that might lead to violation of workers human rights the rate of compliance with the guidelines for material
    supplies was about 98 average conformance rate for compliance items designated by the company for
    cases that may violate the guidelines we require them to submit a plan for improvement working to revise the
    practice as well as a text representation that might lead to discrimination of workers we also conducted an
    investigation into the group companies in japan and overseas based on the csr guidelines to confirm there
    was no significant problem concerning human rights and provided guidance toward further improvement of un
    derstanding
       in malaysia one of the major manufacturing sites of electronic parts charging excessive hiring costs for
    workers in countries that dispatch such workers has become a human rights issue although we have per
    formed interviews and prior training to prevent such practice we started carrying out stricter checks of hiring
    practices from fiscal year 2013 and conducted an audit on prior selection of employment agents as well as an
    internal audit based on the industry standard according to the results of the employee interviews there were
    no workers in forced labor conditions due to excessive charging we will continue to maintain compliance by
    regularly conducting an audit on employment agents and an internal audit

      labor and management cooperation to create a workerfriendly workplace

    through a relationship of mutual trust both the management and workers of ibiden work together to create
    a workplace that is friendly for all employees
       in fiscal year 2013 in the meeting between the management and employees we listed specific themes to
    work on together such as thorough and accurate time management reduction of overwork promotion of tak
    ing leave facilitation of communication facilitation and consideration of mental and physical health in the
    areas of time management creation of a workplace that is easy to work in and expansion of the personnel
    system the central labor council the labor and management gathering and the labor and management
    committee are held every month to review the status of progress in discussion themes and deliberate on
    ways to improve the working environment so that employees can safely work toward the goals of their work
    place

    working hour management
    an increase in workload due to extremely long hours of working is one of the causes of workrelated health
    hazards in an effort to raise employees awareness of workinghour management we have them use the at
    tendance system to check their data which is designed to ensure accurate working hours and promote the
    reduction of overtime work our goal is to cut the amount of overtime work by boosting operational efficien
    cy which can be achieved by making employees aware of the accurate working hours and through better
    communication between superiors and subordinates allowing them to review and rethink the work process
    and system
        the company focuses on efforts for workinghour management including initiatives for promoting the ac
    quisition of annual paid leave and activities aimed at reducing overtime work this includes sending a warning
    to workers who are found to possibly violate rules on overtime work by monitoring through the system or to
    their managers also in fiscal year 2013 mainly our overseas manufacturing sites started working hour man
    agement of employees transferred overseas by entering working hours in the working hour management
    system similar to the one in japan we understand and check working hours in real time and promote activi
    ties so that employees can work more effectively

    creating a workerfriendly workplace
    we conducted educational activities such as thorough implementation of the greeting campaign by the man
    agement and workers to facilitate communication and organization of ideas establishment of guidelines
    concerning instructions to subordinates including behavior considered as power harassment for smooth com
    munication between a superior and a subordinate to promote mental and physical health we assessed and
    analyzed the diagnosis of mental health by an industry physician and made recommendations we also con
    ducted training and educational activities for managers using case examples of mental health and a followup
    interview with transferees we will aim to provide more indepth individual training

    expansion of personnel system
    as global business deployment is accelerating opportunities to play an active role as specialist personnel
    rather than managers are increasing in the japanese business environment accordingly we newly created a
    job grade that handles midlevel employees with a high degree of professionalism to develop an environment
    where such employees can work effectively

    communication between labor and management
    in the company management policies items related to production plans and items concerning hiring policies
    are explained to labor unions and items that seriously affect employees are deliberated through the central
    labor council mentioned above in addition the company provides opportunities for dialogue at various lev
    els between the management and workers including the labor and management committee which is held at
    each plant with a view to facilitating a good labormanagement relationship and corporate business activities



      thoroughgoing compliance with laborrelated laws

    the ibiden group takes actions in line with common sense and the rules of society while complying with the
    employmentrelated laws of each country such as the labor standards law and labor regulations the group
    monitors the state of revision or abolition of laws and regulations that should be observed and promotes
    compliance with laborrelated laws and regulations at its affiliated companies in each country and region
    also the human resource and labor sections periodically monitor domestic group companies to verify the
    status of compliance
        in fiscal year 2013 problems concerning workinghour management at the time of clocking out at domes
    tic group companies were verified based on investigations by the labor bureau and other authorities and we
    quickly took corrective actions we had no record of legal violations related to labor laws such as those per
    taining to minimum wage

      environment and occupational health and safetyrelated laws and regulations
    the ibiden group deals with chemicals at many of its plants some of which are adjacent to residential areas
    issues such as air pollution wastewater and noise pollution therefore require our special attention
       the group sets its own standards above and beyond what is required by national regional or municipal
    regulations for activities and operations that may have a significant environmental impact and regularly mea
    sures and monitors compliance furthermore to reassure the residents of surrounding areas the group
    communicates with regional representatives about its business activities at its plants regularly conducts a risk
    communication activity see page 6 and publishes the monitoring results for each plant in environmental
    measurement data by work site see pages 42 to 46 an accidental leak of diluted chemicals occurred dur
    ing fiscal year 2013 due to an operational error made by an operator at a plant of our group company in the
    ogaki region although no significant damage was caused we are renewing our effort to thoroughly train and
    educate our employees to prevent a recurrence of this type of incident
       furthermore we believe that respecting laws and regulations related to the environment as well as occu
    pational health and safety is one of our most basic responsibilities as a corporation although we promoted
    zero violations as our target throughout fiscal year 2013 one health and safety correction in reporting practic
    es was issued by the authority in japan we addressed the issue immediately including the implementation
    of a measure to prevent future errors no penalties or sanctions related to violations of environmental and oc
    cupational health and safety laws and regulations were issued against ibiden we at ibiden will continue to
    promote compliance with laws and regulations specifically during fiscal year 2014 we will strive to strength
    en and improve our environmentalhealth and safety management system by auditing and patrolling while
    promoting activities to enhance compliance with laws and regulations to achieve zero violations and zero resi
    dent complaints

      guidelines for environmental activities
    in fiscal year 2013 we made improvement of energy consumption per unit effective use of resources and
    reduction of environment risks the pillars of our activities working on a groupwide basis to achieve environ
    mental protection in fiscal year 2014 we will promote the following activities with the aim of strengthening
    competitiveness in environmental protection
    1 we will cut energy costs and resource losses waterchemicalswastewater by reducing our environmen
        tal costs through organizational activities such as training camps
    2 we will reduce energy loss through energy management in conjunction with load curtailment
    3 working with the quality management system we will conduct a design review to manage our environ
        mental costs and risks accurately and efficiently
    4 we will enhance the level of disaster prevention management to prevent irreparable environmental dam
        age from occurring during a largescale disaster
    5 we will achieve zero violations with global management system in compliance with chemical substance
        related laws and regulations
    6 we will secure a stable supply of electricitysteamcold water through risk management
    as energy consumption has a significant impact on business improving it will strengthen the ibiden groups
    competitive edge to establish complete control over our energy from supply to consumption we are setting
    up working groups on energy within the framework of our training camp to enhance competitiveness



      coping with climate change issues
    issues related to climate change are receiving increasing attention worldwide and tighter laws and regula
    tions on emissions are expected in the near future these issues have the potential to become risk factors
    such as increased energyresource costs affecting the groups business activities however if we develop
    products that are compatible with regulations worldwide these same issues can also serve as an opportunity
    for us to become part of the solution while expanding our business at the same time
        we have already set in motion our plan to comply and adapt to laws and regulations such as japans act
    for countermeasures against global warming and laws related to rationalization of energy usage the energy
    conservation act through private power generation initiatives to supply clean energy as well as energy con
    servation efforts in our manufacturing activities we are working to cut direct greenhouse gas emissions

    measures to supply clean energy
    the ibiden group can trace its history back to a scheme aimed at building a hydroelectric power plant up
    stream on the ibigawa river to supply power and attract industry and thereby help revitalize the nearby city
    of ogaki the group was established under the name ibigawa electric company in 1912 but over time began
    to utilize electricity to evolve into an electrochemical company we have continued to expand our business
    since then including areas such as carbides carbon building materials ceramic products and electronic prod
    ucts as we have grown and developed hand in hand with local communities
       ibiden owns three hydroelectric power plants in the upstream section of ibigawa river in gifu prefecture
    hydraulic power generation uses the potential energy of water to create clean energy without greenhouse
    gas emissions

    repair work on hydroelectric facilities and electric power supply for demanders
    to maintain its power output ibiden has systematically completed repair work which included repair work
    on the water supply tunnels and a generator upgrade to the latest model at its three hydroelectric power
    plants higashi yokoyama hirose and kawakami while the repair work at the higashi yokoyama plant and
    the upgrade at the hirose plant had already been completed the kawakami plant was updated during fiscal
    year 2013 which boosted its power generation capacity by 300 kw from 4100 kw
       the hirose and kawakami hydroelectric power plants which have undergone a facility upgrade satisfy the
    standard for the renewable energy buyback program in march 2013 we also established a facility within the
    ogakikita plant to connect our power grid to that of electric companies to supply them with surplus power
       beginning in 2013 electricity generated at first the hirose plant and then the kawakami plant was ear
    marked specifically for sale to be provided to our regional electric demanders improving co2 emission factor
    based on the amount of power generated by the two hydroelectric power plants their co2 emission contri
    bution in fiscal year 2013 was 23900 tons

        our co2 emissions rose during fiscal year 2013 as our overseas production volume increased however
    our co2 emission unit load rate based on the results analysis of fiscal year 2012 decreased due to factors
    such as our energy conservation activities and improved production efficiency although we did not reach the
    target due to an increase in the co2 emission factor of an electric power company our target is considered
    as reached when calculating based on the co2 emission factor at the time when the target was established

      environmental contribution through business and products
    product life cycle assessment
    ibiden is promoting a design that takes into consideration safetyenvironmental rules and regulations energy
    conservation and resource conservation from the initial stage of product development in design reviews to
    examine product developmentdesign we have added environmentally conscious design guidelines for prod
    uct and process safety environmental regulationssafety of materials used and energy conservation con
    sciousness reflected in the production process as examination items we are building a system to confirm
    whether products developed and produced by ibiden are environmentally friendly
       in fiscal year 2013 ibiden ratified the design guidelines for environmental considerations and began con
    ducting information examinations of chemical substances in novel materials during the technical development
    phase if any regulated chemical substances are found by the examination then potential replacements will
    be explored

    projects to promote renewable energy
    ibiden engineering co ltd a member of the ibiden group has initiated
    projects in the field of energy solution by making optimal use of the com
    panys technologies to maintain hydroelectric power plants as well as
    manage cogeneration systems it has established a system in which de
    sign proposal construction and maintenance can be handled consistently
    and has seen many successes ever since particularly in hydroelectric fa
    cilities as well as in other power generation projects such as substations
    it also handles projects involving facilities and equipment that contribute
    to the environment and energy conservation such as cogeneration sys
    tems emergency generators and solar power generators                                solar power generation equipment
        as environmental issues have grown increasingly serious and the de                           rendering
    mand for renewable energy is on the rise ibiden engineering co ltd                    ibiden ogaki central plant
    has built a largescale solar power plant and began supplying electricity in
    fiscal year 2013 our goal is to promote business activities that contribute
    to solutions to energyrelated issues not limited to within the group

    projects that contribute to both disaster prevention and environmental protection
    japans mountainous terrain has seen numerous incidents of destruction
    such as the collapse of slopes due to natural disasters and the spread of
    development there is thus a frequent need to create artificial slopes to
    boost protection of the slope and ultimately prevent loss of life from land
    slides practices for securing artificial slopes in difficult weather and soil
    conditions have undergone many changes over the years through trial
    anderror experimentation with methods and technologies traditionally
    the most common construction method has been concretebased cen
    tered on the ability to prevent disasters today however in addition to
    disaster prevention consideration of the environment needs to be incor            slope constructed using the gt frame
    porated to establish a greener construction method
        ibiden greentec co ltd a member of ibiden group has succeeded
    in developing technologies that respond to the needs of the time and
    help create a better society we will continue to develop new construc
    tion methods such as our totally green method to achieve both disaster
    prevention and environmental protection which will lead to an environ
    ment where everyone can live safely and peacefully

      environmental accounting

    1environmental accounting in support of environmental management
    in promoting environmental management ibiden performs calculations and analyses to develop a quantita
    tive understanding of investment and costs seeking to understand the management resources spent on re
    ducing the environmental burden and the results we use environmental accounting to reflect the effects of
    investment and cost in the decisionmaking process at the management level

    3main environmental protection costs
    the investment in fiscal year 2013 decreased about 28 billion down 67 compared to the previous fiscal
    year a major factor behind this decline in overall investment was the completion of power plant repair work
    that had begun in fiscal year 20122 global environmental protection costswhich signaled the end of
    our largescale environmental investment however investment in 6 research  development costs in
    creased 92 compared with fiscal year 2012 as we focused on rd with the goal of reducing the environ

    the economic effects of energy conservation for fiscal year 2013 increased about 03 billion a rise of 18 com
    pared to fiscal year 2012 this result was due mainly to efforts to reduce the loss of energy including through the
    introduction of highefficiency airconditioning equipment as well as thorough maintenance and operational effi
    ciency at production facilities
        the economic effects of resource recycling for fiscal year 2013 fell approximately 04 billion a decrease of
    19 compared to fiscal year 2012 the decline mainly reflected a drop in the gain on sale of valuable materials
    such as printed wiring boards with precious metals liquid waste containing precious metals sludge containing
    copper and waste plastics accompanying a decrease in manufacturing output
