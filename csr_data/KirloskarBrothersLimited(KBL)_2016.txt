to reduce energy consumption in ced coating and water
treatment plant in sanand plant
we have the process of washing components for ced coating using
washing machine and waste water treatment plant initial installation
of pumps used for these processes were of higher capacity and the
units consumed higher energy we took the initiative of changing
these pumps to optimum level of capacity to fulfill process need
the first stage of project involved studying the existing system and
process require to check the required pressure  headdischarge
we selected most appropriate pump model of kirloskar make to suit
the process requirement after finalizing the pump model we
replaced the existing pumps with selected kirloskar pumps final
testing was carried out for process requirement and voltage current temperature pressure discharge were
monitored it was checked and validated that all the process requirement and objective have been met using new
pumps all parameters were checked confirmed and new system was started for regular operation after this project
we have saved about 35400 kwhyear of energy and saving in cost rs 283200  year

reduction in air consumption at kondhapuri plant
various initiatives were taken to minimize the compressed air usage in the production process survey was
conducted to identify the leakage points during the survey air leakage was found in the old underground pipeline
between air receiver tank and shop no1 modification in the piping layout carried out and new pipeline connection
provided from shop no3 to shop no1 to meet the process requirement saving from this project is 43944 kwhyear

reduction in wood consumption for packaging material
we have taken various initiatives to reduce the consumption of wood used for
packaging of products following are the actions implemented to reduce the
consumption
 reuse of corrugated  wooden boxes of actuators for dispatch of
  material parts
 conversion of wooden boxes received with incoming material to
  make in suitable sizes for dispatch of material  parts
 use of corrugated boxes for 50 mm to 800 mm bfv packing instead
 of wooden boxes
 result of above initiatives 
 reduction of yearly wood consumption by 30
