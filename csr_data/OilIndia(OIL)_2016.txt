              step 1                                   we began the materiality analysis by first dividing our
                                                       stakeholders into two broad categories internal and external
                                                       one interesting outcome was the fact that one of the important
           identification                              stakeholder government is both an external stakeholder in its
                                                       role as a regulator since we are a public sector undertaking
                                                       psu the government is also an internal stakeholder

our existence has provided a boost to the local economy as an oil and gas company we have geographically
dispersed operation with our sites spread across the length and breadth of india focusing on states in northeast
india we have hired majority of our supervised workers from communities in and around our operational areas
this has resulted in significant indirect economic impacts in the nearby areas

being a psu and having operations across the country we procure materials and supply to the various locations
on a competitive basis we do not have any preference for any locally based suppliers and follows the basic
principle of technically acceptable goods  services while adhering to principles of quality and cost efficiency

emissions
the implications and adverse effects of greenhouse gases ghg emissions and other air emissions can now be
evidently seen in the form global warming rise in sea level melting of glaciers etc we are aware of the
environmental impacts due to our operations that can lead to release of greenhouse gases emissions and are
determined to act responsibly to reduce the same


                                                                                                                   g4en15

our main ghg emissions are from operation due to consumption of crude oil natural gas diesel petrol and grid
electricity we believe in transparency on disclosing ghg emissions to show our commitment towards
responsible business and this year we chose to report our direct and indirect ghg emissions our direct ghg
emissions scope 1 for fy 201516 are 568872 tco2e while our indirect ghg emissions scope 2 are 77906

    oils adaptation and mitigation measures in response to intended nationally determined
    contributions

    as per the directives of mopng and moefcc we have to declare our future adaption and mitigation action
    on reduction of ghg emissions by year 2030 as a part of preparation of intended nationally determined
    contributions indcs for india mitigation measures refers to efforts to reduce ghg by using new
    technologies and renewable energies making older equipment more energy efﬁcient or changing
    management practices or consumer behavior adaptation to climate change refers to reducing vulnerabilities
    and building resilience to the impacts of climate change for the company and the community though certain
    preliminary information was submitted to moefcc along with certain emission reduction and climate
    change adaption measures which will bring down the carbon emission in a sequential manner over a period
    of 15 years from 2015 to 2030 the emission reduction er measures are aligned with indias indc pledge to
    improve emissions intensity of its gdp by 3335 by 2030 below 2005 levels our draft report on adaptation
    and mitigation measures in response to indc shall be put to the board of directors and after obtaining there
    due approval the said er and cca measures shall be implemented in a phased manner

        water management
       global availability for freshwater is depleting at a rapid pace and the requirement of freshwater is increasing
       exponentially water is an essential natural resource used for various activities related to our operations we
       prioritize the efficient use of water through water reuse and recycling

       we use freshwater for drilling hydraulic fracturing upstream production and biofuel operations we strive to use
       minimal amount of freshwater by reusing the water in our production to achieve this we have also taken several
       initiatives to keep a strict vigil on our water consumption water meters are being installed at every appropriate
       water inlet and outlet to effectively monitor our consumption

g4en10 total volume of water withdrawal from source

       our primary water sources are surface water and ground water in fy 201516 total amount of water withdrawn
       was 12525008 kl from our duliajan manubham and moran operations the water withdrawn was 15 more
       than fy 201415 of the total water withdrawn 64 was surface water and the remaining 36  was groundwater
       the table shows our water withdrawal from different sources for fy 201516 at different locations of our
       operations

       we believe that conservation of water and minimization of water use through water recycling and reuse is a key
       factor in achieving sustainable development in fy 201516 we have reused 3683413 kl of water which was
       294 of the total water consumption

effluents and waste management
effective waste management is an important aspect for every organization our operations result in various types
of waste like oil sludge drill mud drill cutting and waste oil we ensure that the waste is handled stored and     g4en22
disposed in compliance with regulations set by the government in fy 201516 we disposed 14543 numbers of           g4en23
solid hazardous waste and 454 kl of liquid hazardous waste from our drilling and work over rig operations we
have also disposed 2663 mt of solid nonhazardous waste from our machinery operation our focus has always
been on adopting sound waste management practices by efficient recycling and disposal methods

ewaste management
electronic waste or ewaste that consists of electrical and electronic equipment needs to be disposed in safe and
proper way due to its hazardous nature if discarded in an improper manner may lead to health and
environmental hazards we disposed our ewaste in an environmental friendly way and awarded contract to a
third party to provide end to end solutions for collecting and recycling the ewaste they collect our ewaste from
six location viz fhq duilijan pipelines kolkata office corporate office noida rajasthan project and bep after
every six months and transport them to ewaste management facility in roorkee uttrakhand during the
reporting year more than 38 tonnes of ewaste have been collected and disposed recycled as per regulatory
requirement

          oil spills

          zero or minimizing spills is one of the top priorities for oil we take adequate measures to prevent spills and
          improve our ability to measure spills we make diligent efforts to achieve zero spills but this year we recorded
          total of 9904 kl oil spill in our production installation

g4en24
          spills management

          there is spillage of crude oil on the surface due to our operational activities like backwashing of wells pigging
          of crude oil line leaking of crude oil line etc and also due to miscreant activities the spillage become hazardous
          to environment by contaminating surface and ground water they also degrade the quality of top soil we have
          outsourced to pick up such spilled crude from fields the present contract is for a period of two years in fy
          201516 2321 kl spilled oil has been picked up and been used or disposed in an environmentally safe manner


          bio remediation treatment

          bioremediation is a treatment by the application of oilzapper on oil spill sites oil contaminated soil oil soaked
          soil oily sludge etp oily sludge oil soaked sobm synthetic oil based mud soaked drill cuttings tank bottom
          oily sludge oilcontaminated water to restore the site to conform with statutory norms it is carried out by both
          insitu  exsitu process

          the process by which treatment is being carried out at the same place where sludge is presently lying is known
          as insitu bioremediation the process by which sludge is lifted to a central location and treatment is carried out
          is known as exsitu bioremediation

          we took an initiative to apply this technique at the production installation in fy 201516 we were able to bio
          remediate 9000 cubic meter oily sludge through insitu technique and 8500 cubic meter through exsitu
          technique we have set a target to treat a total of 30000 cubic meter oily sludge through this technique over next
          two years




                                                                    53

flaring is the gas produced when oil is extracted to the surface this can also be produced by uncontrolled
burning of natural gas in an oil  gas reservoir although the flaring gas from the extraction of oil is a waste it is
still a valuable resource this also contributes to climate change through emissions and thus needs to be
controlled since the infrastructure available to reuse this valuable energy sources are not available these
gases pose a significant safety risk to the community and contribute extensively to ghgs and pollutants at oil
we are committed to minimize flaring in our process although it is very challenging to reduce flaring and venting
to zero in fy 201516 we are disclosing our volume of gas flared from or arunachal pradesh and assam

volume and disposal of produced water

our operations produces signiﬁcant volumes of formation or produced water produced water has substantial
adverse effect on environment since they contain process chemical and contaminants that are naturally occurring
in oil and gas reservoirs these reservoirs also contain hydrocarbons salts and heavy metals

this water is treated and then released back into process for further usage in fy 201516 our operations
produced 3070449240 kl of water from arunachal pradesh and assam region and 100 of water was re
injected in the process

         biodiversity
         we have our operations in diverse environmental regions near biodiversity hotspots thus some of them are
         located in biodiversity rich zones especially our sites in assam and arunachal pradesh at oil we understand
         the importance of natural and cultural resources and their benefit to communities as a responsible producer we
         take proactive and forward looking steps for the management of biodiversity in protected and sensitive areas

         biodiversity conservation

         moving forward on the footprints of our belief we have launched a conservation program to protect the habitat of
         endangered hoolock gibbon this specie is also listed in iucn red list and is found in few sites in and around our
         operational areas the project is a step towards our long term commitment for the steadfast protection of the rich
         rainforests in and around our operational areas in assam and arunachal pradesh which in turn ensures the
         future conservation of the hoolock gibbon and many such endangered species in their natural habitats we plan
         to further expand our program to the site that may be affected by our operations in critical habitats

         awareness campaigns were carried out in many villages situated on the fringes of the hoolock gibbon habitats
         these included many villages in the dibrugarh tinsukia golaghat and jorhat districts of assam the followings
         are the main focus areas

            dibrugarh district joypur upper dihing dirak and fringe areas of dihingpatkai wildlife sanctuary
            tinsukia district barekuri area fringes of dibrusaikhowa national park dhola area
            golaghat district fringe areas of nambor doigrong wildlife sanctuary
            jorhat district fringes of holongapar gibbon wildlife sanctuary


         we are committed towards preservation of the biodiversity in the areas we operate we have conducted and
         assess the risk impact from our operations on surrounding biodiversity we have carried out environmental
         impact assessment eia to assess identify and monitor sites where biodiversity risk are prevalent we have
         conducted assessment at jairampur pel block changlang district arunachal pradesh teok block district 
         jorhat assam and khajorijan block dibrugarhtinsukia district assam


         biodiversity action plan methodology of oil

         during the year 201516 we carried out two eia studies in its upcoming fields in assam and arunachal pradesh
         for each of our operational sites post 2011 we have assessed the biodiversity risk and have environmental
         management plans in compliance to the environmental regulations which includes forest wildlife and
         biodiversity conservation however we have not assessed and monitored the biodiversity risk across all the
         operational areas

         the eia reports are prepared based on baseline data collected over a span of 34 month in each operational
         block the study includes baseline environmental conditions and eia is carried out on parameters like
         physiography and topography soils quality water resources and water quality climatology and meteorology
         ambient air quality noise land use etc based on the results environment management plan and environment
         monitoring programme is made additionally risk assessment is carried out and disaster management plan is
         made

          grievance mechanism that can be easily accessible by our community we believe that effective communication
          can help in avoiding and alleviating the grievances and therefore our safety environmental public relations and
          corporate communications are always open to receive complaints and ensure that communities are able to
          express their views in different ways the concerned departments address these complaints diligently and swiftly
          so that there is no pending grievance however we have not formulated a separate mechanism for social and
