     dear stakeholder

          it is a great pleasure to write
           to you introducing our 2011
            integrated report our first
     report as an independent entity
              2011 was without doubt a
        landmark year for us with the
         highlight being our transition
        from being a subsidiary of the
     mondi group to our listing as an
      independent entity on the main
                                                                        tony phillips
                        board of the jse                               chairman




     the enormity of the task of establishing mpact as an               our business is geared to the performance of the countrys
     independent company should not be underestimated                  gross domestic product and so the success of the business
     looking back on this process and all that this entailed           depends on how the economy is growing this in turn
     one is struck by how it occupied so many people so very           depends on a host of other factors not least of which is the
     intensely for a substantial period of time advisors lawyers    global macroeconomic outlook
     investment bankers and corporate financiers were involved
     as well as many of the management team and employees              other taxing concerns which affect our performance include
     it entailed the setting up of the processes and systems and        increased administered costs such as those for fuel and
     the acquisition of particular skills in order to comply with       electricity and over which we have little or no control we
     the listing requirements of the jse and the companies act         are working hard to reduce our consumption of energy per
     among others and to ensure that the business is in good           unit of production compounding our costs is the fact that
     order and conducted in line with best practice it also involved
                                                                        wage increases have exceeded the rate of inflation in both
     an entirely new paradigm on debt since this now had to be
                                                                        the public and the private sectors and there are doubts
     raised in mpacts own right rather than under the auspices
                                                                        as to whether this is sustainable in the long term without
     of mondi
                                                                        corresponding increases in productivity the incidence of
     in particular and rather significantly it necessitated the        strikes too is cause for concern
     creation and setting up of an mpact board of directors
     having the privilege of being appointed chairman i was            we have nevertheless done remarkably well particularly in the
     closely involved in the interviewing and selection process of      last quarter of the year the weaker rand stimulated exports
     my fellow board members a most rewarding and exciting             both on our part and for south african manufacturers which
     opportunity and one which seldom comes along once the             in turn increased their packaging requirements
     board had been selected the board was then involved in
     the actual listing of mpact followed by the reporting of          we are well positioned in the market in those sectors in
     our maiden set of interim financial results in august the         which we operate we are not overly burdened by debt and
     current report too represents a challenge in that mpact has        are positioned for expansion and growth we are conscious
     not officially existed for more than half of the financial year    of our cost structure and the sustainability of our business is
     being reviewed                                                    determined by having the necessary building blocks in place

                       integrated report 2011  year in review     15




regarding the board and its performance it is still too soon to
judge but the mechanisms to assess this are being put in place
from a public perspective we have a balanced representative
board with impressive industry experience it is a small board
but it has the necessary strategic skills  in business and
human resources  and is committed to transformation
the audit and risk committee has an effective experienced
chairperson as well as a potential successor to this position
all the required subcommittees have been set up and their
charters have been compiled and formalised the benefits of
all this ground work will become apparent in coming years

while we may not comply with king iii in every respect we are
aware of our shortcomings and can certainly explain where
and why we do not comply these are being addressed

management has faced many challenges in the past year  it
has had to take on increased responsibility by going it alone
and our team has risen to this people who a year ago would
have been involved only peripherally in events are now at the
forefront it has been a steep learning curve for many who
now find themselves involved in risk mapping funding and
investor relations among other activities

despite the separation from mondi one of our largest
shareholders remains our black economic empowerment
partner shanduka packaging and we continue to draw
strength from this association currently their investment in
mpact is at approximately 105

in conclusion i would like to formally welcome my fellow
members of the board and thank them too for their dedication
and commitment in this period of transition i look forward to
working with them in the coming year as we bed down the
group and our strategy

i also extend my gratitude to the executive management
team lead by ceo bruce strong and to all our employees for
their commitment hard work and loyalty during the year

     chief executive officers review


           2011 was a momentous year
            for us and it gives me much
         pleasure to report for the first
          time to our shareholders and
          stakeholders in our inaugural
                     integrated report


     the highlight of the year was undoubtedly our listing on the
     jse on 11 july 2011 in tandem with the demerger of mondi
     packaging south africa mpsa as it was previously known
     from the mondi group effective 18 july 2011 this resulted
     in the rebranding as mpact a leading independent and
     focused paper and plastics packaging company
                                                                      bruce strong
     as an autonomous entity we are able to focus more fully on      chief executive officer
     the implementation of our strategy to

     	develop and selectively grow our leading market positions

     	further develop our manufacturing and service footprint to    extend our thanks for all his efforts in the previous six months
        enable us to consistently deliver superior solutions to our
                                                                      in terms of reporting we have adopted an integrated

     	apply effective business excellence programmes and            report on our operational financial as well as our nonfinancial
        sound asset management to deliver good consistent            socioeconomic and environmental performance this is in
        performance                                                  compliance with jse listings requirements and certain aspects

     our principal objective is to deliver good and sustainable
                                                                      financial performance the guidelines of the global reporting
     returns to our shareholders by providing innovative quality

     products and services to our customers that are worth the

     governance accountability                                       the past year was challenging with demand being under

     there were obviously risks involved in mpacts demerger and      we attribute this mainly to the continued uncertain economic
     listing we have established the necessary systems processes    conditions prevailing both globally and locally in the first half
     and governance structures including board committees to        of the year local demand for packaging was also negatively

our reception by the investor community on our listing on
11 july 2011 and subsequently has been most gratifying the
process of demerging from mondi and listing on the jse was
virtually seamless largely due to the hard work and dedication

   other than pet such as bottles jars and closures with
   inmould labelling capability
 styrene trays fast food containers and clear plastic films

sales volumes for the year increased by 5 versus the
comparable prior year period attributable to sector growth and
some market share gains

during the year significant progress was made to improve
efficiencies and customer services the compression moulding
plant was moved from robertville to wadeville to benefit from
customer synergies while the restructuring of the atlantis and
robertville fmcg plants was initiated to achieve improved
customer service and productivity

plastics omnium brits was acquired in the bin and crate division
to increase flexibility and reduce transport costs from our cape
town operation

we will continue to optimise and grow the business in 2012 in
pursuit of our goal of being the leading rigid plactic supplier in
southern africa

             engagement as well as via business processes including strategic
                 and business planning risk management and the analysis of
                                                    regulatory requirements


     on analysis the following issues are considered material in terms of the sustainability of the business

         sustainability issue                   status and management response

         environmental concerns                 ever more stringent environmental regulations and standards have the potential to increase
         include compliance with ever           our regulated costs such legislation includes
         more stringent legislation              national environmental management act
                                                 air quality control act

                                                in addition planned legislation which could negatively impact our cost base includes the
                                                imposition of a carbon tax

                                                we will engage with the authorities through the relevant industry bodies and other forums
                                                to provide meaningful inputs into discussions around this legislation

         reliability of energy supply and       we require significant energy particularly at the mills and the threat of electricity supply
         the cost of energy electricity        interruptions is a concern
         and coal
                                                allied to this is the increasing price of energy which has risen substantially over the past
                                                few years this presents a problem where competitors costs particularly those of overseas
                                                paper suppliers have not increased commensurately

                                                approaches have been made to the south african national energy regulator nersa by the
                                                manufacturing circle to contain and possibly reduce the cost of electricity in south africa
                                                internally we have taken action to reduce our energy consumption and future initiatives may
                                                involve investment in capital equipment to become selfsufficient at some major operations

         management of talent and               attracting and retaining the skills relevant to the business are essential to our success for
         development and retention of           several years we have invested in the development of skills through learnership programmes

preferential procurement
we strive to support the south african economy through
the procurement of locally produced goods and services as
much as is possible we are also focused on increasing our
support for small to medium enterprises smes and black
womanowned suppliers the success of these initiatives was
reflected in our achievement of a 1992 score out of 20 points
for preferential procurement on our bbbee certificate

bbbee scorecard
our current bbbee rating as determined by empowerdex
on the basis of our 2011 results and ownership structure is
level 3 and is valid until july 2012 this is partly a function
of the holding by shanduka packaging pty ltd of 25 in
mondi packaging south africa mpsa prior to the demerger
as well as an effective 402 holding by black employees in
the employee share ownership plan which was terminated
in december 2010 and our employees were paid out in the
first quarter of 2011 since december 2010 shandukas share
holding has declined to 1045 initiatives are under way to
maintain a competitive rating that is in line with government
regulations and requirements

mondi employee share
ownership plan esop
our employees previously participated in the mondi
employee share ownership plan esop in terms of the plan
which commenced on 1 january 2006 each eligible mondi
group employee was allocated shares in the employee share
plan investment company mondi employee investment
limited at no cost to the employee during the time the plan
operated any employee had the option of subscribing for
more shares subject to conditions this plan terminated on 31
december 2010 and our employees were paid a total amount
of r25 million in the first quarter of 2011

equity ownership
as at 31 december 2010 the ownership of the company by
black individuals was at 30 including ownership of 6 by black
women this translates into 182 points out of the bbbee target
of 20 for black ownership due to the demerger from mondi as
well as the winding up of esop during 2011 we expect a lower
score for 2011 the calculation of this effect on the ownership
score will only be available in the second quarter of 2012 when
the next bbbee audit takes place

      1   the calculation of basic eps heps and underlying eps has been based on the profit for the reported period as shown above and on
          164046476 ordinary shares which represents the aggregate number of shares that were listed on 11 july 2011 the group was not a
          standalone entity prior to the demerger date the number of shares in issue has therefore been retrospectively applied to the comparative
          period so that meaningful comparison can be made
      2   diluted eps is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all
          potentially dilutive ordinary shares
