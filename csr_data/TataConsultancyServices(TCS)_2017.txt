demand sustainability
the global market for outsourced it services is estimated at 12 tn² this is a highly fragmented market in which
tcs  despite being one of the top 10 service providers  has a very small market share of under 2
tcs continues to grow significantly faster than the broader market on account of deeper capabilities in new
technologies and a superior execution model and we dont expect this trend to change

with technology getting increasingly embedded into core products and services and thereby becoming a basis
of competitive differentiation the technology intensity of businesses is going up at the same time the
propensity to outsource is increasing on account of the shortening shelflives of new technologies reducing the
enterprises ability to predict the longevity of any new technology in which it invests in building inhouse
capability tcs expects these trends to serve as a structural tailwind to longerterm growth


strategy for business sustainability
tcs customercentric strategy is built on continually investing in building newer capabilities to expand our
participation in our customers spend and to stay relevant to them at every point in their business cycle while
being technologyagnostic and while broadening our addressable market details of this strategy are provided
on pages 6263 of the fy 201617 annual report

technologies are provided on pages 6364 of the annual report

the strategic risks faced by tcs and the companys approach to mitigating them are summarized on pages 70
and 71 of the fy 201617 annual report


structured for agility
a common concern is whether tcs can retain the same agility and responsiveness that have come to define the
organization as it gains greater scale our customercentric modular organizational structure addresses both
these concerns tcs is organized into over two dozen business units each aligned to an industry vertical each
marketfacing business unit is responsible endtoend to an exclusive set of customers in its designated domain
owns its resources and pursues growth in that domain armed with all the agility and focus of a smaller company

environmental sustainability
we believe that environmental stewardship is not just the right thing to do but also something that enhances
longer term shareholder value guided by our environmental policy⁴ we have built environmental sustainability
into our daily operations and have been relentlessly driving efficiency through resource optimization and waste
reduction and thereby reducing our ecological footprint this has allowed us to decouple our business growth
from the environmental impact and reduce costs

tcs environmental stewardship can be seen through four dimensions

n carbon footprint reduction  energy efficiency and use of renewable energy
n water management efficient use recycling and rainwater harvesting
n waste management reduction reuse and recycling
n supply chain sustainability

all these initiatives are implemented through our environment management system framework in accordance
with the international standard iso 140012004 tcs key delivery centers at 113 locations around the world are
certified to this standard

environmental expenditure

at tcs environmental initiatives are seen as part of the overall operational and infrastructure improvement and
therefore the expenditure is not tracked separately green building project costs are included in our capital
expenditure while monitoring and measurement and small energy efficiency project costs and compliance fees
are included as a part of operational budgets for the respective facilities

some of the best practices deployed at the data centers include redesigning air flow by proper placement of
supply grill tiles blocking cold air leakages and optimizing cooling and uninterruptible power supply ups
devices by switching off extra units with the integration of 23 key data centers on an online monitoring and
control platform we are now able to track our power usage on a realtime basis to drive efficiency measures
accordingly consequently we have improved the power usage effectiveness pue at our data centers from an
average of 22 to 173 with six centers having a pue of 165 or less

other emissions
tcs is committed to using zeroozone depleting potential odp refrigerants in its operations new facilities
coming up at tcs have hvac systems based on zeroodp refrigerants all odp refrigerant gases shall be phased
out and replaced with zeroodp refrigerants in line with countryspecific timelines agreed to as per the montreal
protocol and local regulations ozone depleting substance emissions are primarily in the form of system losses or
fugitive emissions during maintenance and repair the odp of the total refrigerant emissions to the atmosphere

outages emit oxides of sulphur sox and nitrogen nox total emissions for which were 29 ton and 359 ton
respectively


water sustainability
recognizing the limited supply of fresh water and the importance of water conservation for sustaining our
operations tcs has set itself an ambitious goal of achieving water neutrality by 2020 towards this we have put in
place waterefficient design at new offices and campuses ensuring 100 treatment and recycling of sewage
and rainwater harvesting employee engagement also plays a big role in our water sustainability strategy
exhibit 22 summarizes our water management initiatives and performance

of the 39 million kl of fresh water consumed by tcs in fy 201617 46 came from municipal sources 38 from
tankers 15 from borewells and 1 was bottled water consistent water efficiency measures have helped us
reduce fresh water consumption by 15 over baseline year fy 200708 however our reported consumption
figures increased marginally over the past year due to the inclusion of new sites through ma activity

recycling

to reduce the load on fresh water sources all new tcs campuses are equipped with sewage treatment plants
designed for 100 recycling of the treated sewage sewage is treated using stateoftheart technologies and
recycled for use in hvac cooling towers flush tanks and irrigation in that order of preference newer tcs
facilities are designed for zero water discharge and have significantly boosted overall recycling levels hence
total treated sewage recycled as a percentage of the total fresh water consumed has gone up from 44 in
fy 201516 to 53 in fy 201617

                                          we intend to return to nature the water we draw from it using rainwater harvesting within our campuses
                                          accordingly our premises feature rainwater harvesting infrastructure including rooftop collection systems
                                          collection and storage tanks mechanism for recharging of bore wells trenches and pits and in some cases
                                          water bodies for storing rainwater there was a 25 increase in the rainwater harvesting potential at tcs sites in
                                          fy 201617 over the previous year our current rainwater harvesting potential offsets 100 of the total
                                          groundwater used across tcs facilities

                                          exhibit 23 this notice board put up at a canteen at tcs bangalore very effectively drove home the message to
                                          employees the image itself went viral on social media and introduced the issue of food wastage into the national
                                          discourse

                                          biodegradable waste is subjected to onsite treatment for biogas recovery through biodigesters or compost pits
                                          or disposed of as feed to piggeries or to the municipal waste collection system the choice is based on the space
                                          available and the estimated food waste generated in fy 201617 274 of the total wet waste generated was
                                          treated through onsite composting approximately 1856 ton of compost was generated from garden waste the
                                          same fiscal this compost serves as an excellent biofertilizer that helps avoid the use of chemical fertilizers and
                                          resultant soil and groundwater pollution

                                          continuous efforts to reduce paper usage at source has translated into a specific paper consumption of 38

                                          attributed to the awareness created among employees and the enforcement of printing discipline through
                                          automated and manual administrative means paper waste is carefully segregated shredded recycled in some

ewaste management

in fy 201617 26428 scrapped it assets were disposed of through government authorized handlers or recyclers
in accordance with the regulations of each country¹² to ensure that electronic waste is recycled appropriately
our ewaste recycling service providers undergo a stringent duediligence audit process to ensure compliance
with health safety and environment hserelated regulations and follow good onsite handling practices a
desktop review is followed by a detailed site audit to verify adherence to hse practices thereby extending duty
of care to the supply chain the ewaste management processes followed are in line with the waste electrical and
electronic equipment weee directive government of indias ewaste management and handling rules 2011
and other countrylevel regulations

hazardous and other waste management and transboundary movement rules 2016 only through
governmentauthorized vendors all used printer cartridges and photocopier toner bottles are sent back to the
manufacturers for proper disposal in fy 201617 30177 liters of lube oil from diesel generator sets and

employee engagement
our employees play a critical role in helping us achieve our sustainability objectives we engage them through
different channels and during campaigns spread out across the year as part of tcs step up the earth hour
campaign launched in may 2016 all nonessential and noncritical lights and electrical equipment were turned
off on the last saturday of each month without compromising business operations this initiative was a huge
success and helped us avoid generation of more than 185 ton of co2 equivalent

since its inception in 2014 the tata group campaign tata sustainability month has grown in terms of both
outreach and impact in june 2016 the theme for this initiative was the sustainability development goals over
160000 employees participated in both online and onsite activities


supply chain sustainability
in keeping with the tata group philosophy we expect our key suppliers and supply chain partners to incorporate
socially and environmentally responsible practices in their businesses we strive to integrate sustainability
considerations in our vendor selection and engagement process see exhibit 24




¹²data for all geographies
  g4en24 there were no reported spills in fy 201617
¹³in all geographies we follow local regulations since most of the facilities outside india are typically smaller and leased and operated by landlords the generation of such waste is
  marginal and is appropriately handled through the landlords or facility managers
