                                    i believe that corporate sustainability is essential to our long term success

                                    firstly it is about operating with integrity  respecting our longterm responsibilities in areas such as human rights safety
                                    environment and anticorruption for us it is about far more than compliance it is about doing business in line with our
                                    core values

                                    secondly it is about supporting our clients by providing increasingly innovative solutions that are aligned with their
                                    growing ambition to be part of an ever more responsible energy sector it is also about supporting the societies around
                                    us and making a positive longterm impact on the communities where we live and operate

                                    reporting quality nonfinancial information in the spirit of transparency is essential to measure our impact and conti
                                    nuously improve it is also crucial to gain and maintain the trust of our stakeholders this year our efforts and commitment
                                    have been reflected again in our recognition as a 2017 sustainability leader in our industry by robecosam

                                    i would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my ongoing support for a socially environmentally and economically
                                    sustainable industry and am pleased to share through our society and environment report our key 2016 actions and

several undertakings are still under development
whereas the following activities are now in place

    technip has been selected to provide pilot test

in 2016 fuel consumption on construction sites increased significantly as the yards and spoolbases activities
represented a relevant part of the project developments

energy intensity
technips energy intensity factors are calculated using both direct and indirect energy consumptions as a nume
rator and the total ekpi manhours worked that correspond to sites which contributed to ekpis reporting as
a denominator manhours worked have been acknowledged as being the information the most representative
of the groups overall activity




 in 2016 energy intensity per category was as follows




vessels have the highest energy intensity factor across technips operations as they consume large quantities
of fuel mainly diesel when they travel from one country to another and when they operate offshore for the
subsea installation of rigid or flexible pipes on projects

      water and waste management
      a water consumption
      gri g4dma g4en8


      technips business operations and locations give rise to a wide range of resource consumption requirements
      such as the requirements for water including drinking water industrial water used for hydraulic tests and dust
      suppression and cleaning and the implementation of local initiatives for water treatment and water reuse
      or recycling as a consequence water consumption fluctuates depending on a particular sites operations
      production cycle or construction phase




      in 2016 the distribution of total water consumption per activity was as follows




      projects are responsible for the greatest consumption of water due to activities during the construction phases
      on the construction sites water is usually extracted from local water networks rivers or bores and is treated
      onsite and then reused internally to the maximum depending on the country and the type of project large
      volumes of water may be used for dust suppression on roads or hydrotesting of tanks pipelines and piping
      in 2016 the consumption of construction sites represented over 55 of the water consumed at group level
      technip is well aware of the need to conserve water and strives to reduce water consumption by monitoring
      consumption and reusing and recycling water at wastewater facilities where practical and possible in terms of
      geographic breakdown the water consumption is broken down as set out below these figures exclude water
      consumed by the fleet as vessels do not provide environmental data based on their geographic location

gri g4dma g4en23


waste generated by technips operations are managed by each site in accordance with the applicable local and
international regulations applying best practices and taking into account existing waste management facilities
in the country in 2016 technip experienced a decrease in waste generation from previous years primarily due
to the large quantity of nonhazardous waste produced in 2015 in one specific construction site however
hazardous waste production remained more or less stable




in 2016 the distribution of waste by type of operation was as follows




as far as construction sites are concerned the largest portion of nonhazardous waste generated was made of
soil rock concrete and scrap metal two sites in eastern europe generated large quantities of nonhazardous
waste due to the excavation of large quantities of clean soil representing nearly 59 of total nonhazardous
waste part of the soil has been reused for backfilling out of the site and for an environmental restoration
project in accordance with local regulations

in 2014 six new indicators on waste disposal were added to the groups reporting requirements with the
following results

 2 coverage rate is equal to 50 of hazardous waste produced in 2016


in 2016 recycling was secondary method of disposal for nonhazardous waste as regards hazardous waste
there were fewer recycling possibilities in particular for projects

initiatives to reduce waste volume were launched in technip entities for example since may 2016 flexi france
le trait france uses a roll packer in order to maximize the compacting of wastes on dumpster to reduce co2
emissions from transportation nonhazardous wastes wood cards polyane are differentiated and compacted
in 2015 when wastes were not so compacted the average tonnage per dumpster for the year was 403 in 2016
with the roll packer the average between may and october was of 65 60 more for an objective of 20
more
