            onthejob training makes up the largest part of all development activities up to 70 for example tmobile
            encourages employees to accept tasks that will enable them to acquire or use a new skill this will allow them
            not only to learn from their successes but also to learn from their mistakes with this approach tmobile invites
            employees to consider their mistakes as lessons that will help them in the future rather than looking upon
            them as failures employees can also learn by teaching others such as by sharing their experience with their
            colleagues and newstarts or by supervising a thesis our ttank talent programme also works on the basis
            of onthejob training offering employees the opportunity to try to resolve strategic issues discover how the
            business works learn to think outside the box present the outcomes of their management projects and use all
            of this to gain experience that they can put to use in their work

               tmobiles approach to environmental protection is based on the
               fundamental document within ems iso 14001  environmental
                  policy which was approved by the top management and is
              available at wwwtmobilecz the areas of the companys primary
               focus are based on important environmental aspects ea which
               were identified and are defined within the ems that is in place at
              the company the ea register these include power and material
                  consumption waste generation and emissions into the air

            in relation to power consumption tmobile focuses especially on its mobile network operation gsmlte
            technologies air conditioning  transmitters nodes and exchanges data centres technologies and air
            conditioning administrative buildings lighting ventilation and it tmobile shops lighting and ventilation
            and to a lesser extent power consumption for central heating and natural gas and propanebutane heating of
            administrative buildings and at tmobile shops


            as regards material consumption materials consumed within administrative and business activities include
            paper and toners and fuel for company cars in relation to waste management tmobile monitors mixed
            municipal waste plastics paper discarded electrical and electronic equipment and batteries and in relation
            to emissions into the air emissions generated by the operation of company cars and alternative energy sources


            in accordance with the internal policy the csr unit in cooperation with the technology department defines
            environmental objectives target values and programmes with respect to important eas the programme
            objectives are control and maintain improve and study or investigate


            the control and maintain objective is suitable for those important environmental aspects which are subject to
            statutory environmental requirements as the company undertakes to observe them in its policy the company is
            committed to maintain compliance with the operational conditions stipulated in the operating instructions the
            target value is always set as permanent


            the improve objective is used for those important aspects where an improvement can be reached such as
            reduction of emissions waste and waste water and consumption of the resources and which are not mandatory
            according to environmental legislation the target values are if possible measurable

            the study or investigate objective is applied to those important aspects where an improvement is being
            considered but where it is first necessary to do a feasibility study in order to identify the necessary resources
            if the necessary resources are found to be acceptable the study or investigate objective is followed by an
            objective to improve a study or investigate objective can be cancelled if the study reveals that changes leading
            to an improvement are unacceptable for the company from the financial technological or logistic perspective
            all the important eas are monitored and measured


            environmental programmes can be primarily designed as purely environmental or as programmes where the economic
            or technological objective of the project or change also has an impact on the environment eg these include
            in particular projects involving the gsmlte network technologies the second category includes for example
