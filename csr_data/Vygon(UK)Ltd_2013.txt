               listening to the needs of our
               customers and being the best



our first report served to identify areas in which we could concentrate our attention on business
responsibility it established material sustainability issues on which vygon uk ltd may focus i          les davies
am delighted to say that this has progressed despite the distractions of moving premises and the            managing director
recession which impacts on public spending moving premises is a one off albeit an all embracing one
off and hopefully the recession will not go on indefinitely sustainable development most certainly will
and vygon should be part of it

about vygon uk ltd

impact of business responsibility at vygon uk ltd

as a sales and distribution organisation the impact upon sustainability is not as great as it would be if
we were a manufacturing organisation similar to other units within the vygon group later sections of
the report illustrate risks and opportunities arising through this and through involvement in the highly
regulated medical and surgical supply market vygon uk ltd has established processes through
which identified key stakeholder interest areas are addressed

for example
 product packaging is an issue in most organisations the subject was covered extensively in our
    first report and we continue to address it here

   vehicle emissions targets were established a year ago progress against these targets and
    additional issues are addressed later in the report

   the use of pvc polyethylene polyurethane polycarbonate or silicone within our products while
    not raised as a specific issue by stakeholders is one which employees must be prepared to
    address the materials are necessary in the medical and surgical process any attempt to use
    alternatives has a detrimental effect on patient care vygon is able to illustrate further benefits in
    product development and innovation to counter use of these materials the subject is addressed
