face to face talk creating a global company that can
achieve sustainable growth




the brother group has 17 manufacturing facilities and 52 sales facilities as of march 2013 in more
than 40 countries and regions with over 31000 employees of many nationalities how can a global
company that is needed by society achieve sustainable growth while addressing the everchanging
global situation brother industries president toshikazu koike invited takejiro sueyoshi a leading ﬁgure
in international ﬁnance and an active commentator on corporate social responsibility and environmental
issues in his capacity as special advisor to the united nations environment programme finance
initiative unep fi1 to discuss models of global companies and brothers csr management
1 unep fi was established in 1992 so that ﬁnancial institutions around the world including banks and insurancesecurities companies
    work together to create and spread ideal business models for the environment and sustainability


continuing to help disaster victims  a more important mission than ever

sueyoshi  todays interview coincides with march 11 the second
anniversary of the great east japan earthquake how has the
brother group helped the reconstruction

koiketwo years ago today nagoya was shaken considerably by
the earthquake too and i heard about the disaster through news
reports as an immediate donation it was quickly decided to
contribute 100 million yen we also received successive oﬀers of
donations and relief supplies from group companies around the
world i have visited the disasterstricken area twice and it seems that awareness about assistance is
decreasing throughout japan when i visited last it was shocking to see that the reconstruction had
only just begun a reconstruction plan has ﬁnally been drawn up two years after the disaster and the
reconstruction process will take at least ﬁve to ten years so there is still a very long way to go the
brother group employees have been assisting as much as possible in various ways in august 2011 i
launched the kizuna project to gather donations from employees speciﬁcally i made 2600 tshirts

featuring my handwriting of kizuna a chinese character that literally means ties at my own expense
and gave them away to employees who donated this enabled me to collect about 53 million yen which
was donated to shichigahamamachi a town in miyagi prefecture through a nonproﬁt organization
based in nagoya city the donations will be used to partly ﬁnance a project to build a new park near
temporary homes in the town the park will be a playground for children and a recreational space for
residents
in fy2012 the kizuna fund was established so that employees can voluntarily make donations about
18 million yen had been donated by march 2013 and like the kizuna project group companies in and
outside japan have helped the initiative also bags ﬁlled with donations were received from employees
at a factory in the philippines that has just begun operations i have also donated my speaking fees and
so forth to this fund at any rate i think its important to continue giving because a stickingplaster
approach wont work

sueyoshi i agree ongoing eﬀorts matter more than the amount of donations brothers commitment to
regularly save funds through the kizuna fund conﬁrms the ties between the employees and people in the
aﬀected areas the philippines was seriously damaged by a huge typhoon and received international
assistance from countries including japan now people from the philippines are lending a helping hand to
those in trouble in other countries this is a great example of mutual assistance across national borders

koike the message please do not forget us in thankyou letters and new year cards received from
victims will motivate me to help for as long as i live because many people lost jobs in the disaster areas we
donated ﬁve computercontrolled sewing machines to kizuna kobo literally a workshop of ties which is
assisting the reconstruction in shichigahamamachi we asked them to create handmade fabric products
which were then sold at inhouse events we heard that local people wanted to start small businesses with
handmade products so we are now looking for ways to support them we also invited victims taking refuge
in aichi prefecture to a karaoke venue which is directly run by xing a brother group company involved in
the online karaoke business and held a christmas party for them last summer brother employees joined
the executive committee which was organizing a charity musical to be performed by a theatrical group of
people from shichigahamamachi at the auditorium of nagoya university brother invited them to brother
earth a planetarium dome at the nagoya city science museum whose naming rights were acquired by
brother two years ago i have encouraged our employees to identify problems and think about ways to help


two key roles for companies
                            sueyoshi terrysan koikes nickname you worked in the us for many years so i
                            guess thats why you feel strongly about the socially vulnerable and want to help
                            companies are expected to fulﬁll two main roles one is to contribute to social
                            development through their main business and the other is to contribute to employees
                            and local communities as members of society it is important to do both in a
                            wellbalanced manner
                            i am particularly concerned about the divide in the disasterstricken areas some
districts were hit by the tsunami while others were not some people decided to move out after the
disaster while others are waiting for the opportunity to return to their towns and still others are
hesitating to make a decision

amid this divide its important to know how to help people who are in vulnerable situations these
people can be divided into three generations senior citizens people of working age and youngsters
and infants in particular those who will play a key role in future should be given opportunities to make
a fresh start obviously senior citizens need to be looked after but in the long run it is the younger
people who most need help to rebuild communities

koike i totally agree recently i often think about business in terms of how we can preserve the beautiful
natural environment and create promising jobs for children but i dont have any speciﬁc ideas yet

sueyoshi among brothers messages i greatly like the motto of at your side this friendly attitude is
crucial in helping the disaster areas in east japan incidentally what is the basis of brothers csr activities

koike all of our activities are founded on the brother group global charter global charter all our
employees must base their decisions and actions on the global charters basic policies and codes of
practice for example the global charter deﬁnes a basic policy for group management to place our
customers ﬁrst everywhere every time and provide them with superior value by quickly creating and
delivering highquality products and services one of the codes of practice for employees focuses on a
challenging spirit and speed to carry out csr activities with a sense of unity throughout the group it is
important to share and understand the global charter thats why the global charter has been translated
into 27 languages and all employees are encouraged to understand and remember it at all times

sueyoshi i read the global charter and found it speciﬁc and easy to understand whereas many
companies have abstract concepts in particular i was impressed by trust and respect and ethics and
morality in the codes of practice which are essential for a global company


considering the global environment

koike the environment is central to our csr activities our environmental
slogan is brother earth with the key message of working with you for a
better environment the brother group has long been working to reduce
the environmental impact throughout the life cycle of products and to
ensure environmental conservation as part of its social contribution
recently we have greatly improved our energysaving technologies such
as the low energy standby technology which almost eliminates the
standby power consumed by printers a lowtemperature toner fusing
technology and low power and air consumption technologies for machine
tools we have also been working to cut co2 emissions by 1 in terms of
total emissions in japan and per unit of sales for manufacturing facilities
outside japan per year by 2020 last year the brother group was
recognized as the ﬁrst eco first company2 in the printer industry by the ministry of the environment of
japan meanwhile employees are contributing in various ways such as planting seedlings in mangrove
forests in thailand and planting other seedlings in china and japan

2 under the eco first program companies promise the minister of the environment of japan to work on environmental conservation
    by taking measures for preventing global warming reducing waste and recycling resources etc and to work as industryleading
    environmental companies

face to face talk creating a global company that can
achieve sustainable growth
sueyoshi as the brother earth slogan says people must take an interest in our planet many
people today are worried that the planet will be ruined if we dont act environmental pollution is
spreading across national borders so the point is how to protect the environment for the global
community not just speciﬁc countries or regions another major challenge is reducing co2
emissions i think that solving these challenges to protect the planet requires complete
collaboration i believe thats why brother established the global charter and environmental slogan
showing its future insight and awareness of the changing times

koike extreme weather phenomena have clearly increased since i was a child i think humans
have had too much impact on the planet

sueyoshi the atmospheric temperature of the earth started to rise 100 years ago but has
increased sharply in the last ten years and the cause is co2 half of all countries where brother
group does business are emerging countries that will grow in the future so its important to ﬁnd
ways to expand the business while reducing the environmental impact the key is a
resourcesaving energysaving and recyclingoriented production process expanding business
with products that consume no standby power as you mentioned earlier helps fulﬁll social
responsibility in a broad sense resourcesaving energysaving and recyclingoriented production
helps cut costs and expenses while reducing co2 emissions helps to identify sources of waste
operations that generate large amounts of co2 emissions are the real clue to reducing waste
protecting the planet may sound like a lofty goal but our daytoday work is closely linked with the
global environment i think many people need to realize the importance of their eﬀorts and our
relationship with the planet

koike exactly some of our factories recycle toner cartridges for laser printers and allinones
customers used toner cartridges are collected recycled and resold with the same quality
assurance as for new products in europe where people are highly ecoconscious the collection
rate of toner cartridges has been increasing dramatically

sueyoshi thats a resourcerecycling business model i think more and more people will buy
printers from environmentally responsible companies and stop buying from companies which are
not if brother wants to win over these ecoconscious smart consumers it is important to actively
appeal to society to expand brother must show its stance to consumers regulatory authorities
and ﬁnancial institutions i am involved with the unep fi because i want to help change consumer
behavior and establish a social system that evaluates environmental performance in the market
even if the cost is a little higher and whereby the pricing mechanism works properly and
consumers accept slightly more expensive products brothers environmental eﬀorts are the way
to go and i think its business will grow as it applies worldclass values and standards globally

koike customers values have changed in the last decade or so it used to be common practice
to use new parts in products recycled resin materials and parts were not acceptable but today
the use of recycled parts is recognized as a corporate eﬀort and as a mark of engineering skill

globalization of mindset matters most
sueyoshijapanese companies face the challenge of developing global human resources what about
brother

koike we started producing typewriters and printers in the us uk and elsewhere in the 1980s we started
shifting our manufacturing operations outside japan when we launched operations in malaysia in 1989 and
set up manufacturing facilities in china in the 1990s and weve since expanded to vietnam and the
philippines throughout this process we have strived to share the spirit of manufacturing for example in
china we have shared our technologies and expertise with local employees in the course of nearly 20 years
of manufacturing meanwhile young japanese employees now have fewer opportunities to gain experience
at manufacturing sites so at factories in vietnam vietnamese employees japanese engineers and chinese
employees serve as instructors the situation is similar at a factory in the philippines brothers global
manufacturing framework will not work unless we continue to recruit employees of various nationalities as
global human resources and ensure collaboration
                               four years ago brother industries ltd in japan started to recruit about ten foreign
                               students each year they are taught japanese language and culture and acquire
                               brothers dna in the development division it is very valuable for young people
                               graduating from schools in china and vietnam to work toward the same mission with
                               senior employees and colleagues in japan in the same workplace as they will soon be
                               assigned to brother group facilities in their own countries by improving their
                               communication skills the drive to share the spirit of manufacturing will be accelerated
                               brother industries ltd now has about 100 foreign staﬀ including those who studied in
japan and were recruited here and this ratio needs to be increased i hope that younger staﬀ in japan will
work with these people sometimes through friendly rivalry demonstrate their challenging spirit and unleash
their potential as global human resources

sueyoshi thats an interesting point globalization usually refers to doing global business but actually
the key is globalization of mindset for example you work in nagoya with africa in mind attitudes can
become globalized by ignoring corporate nationalities such as japaneseaﬃliated companies and
abandoning the concept of launching operations outside japan of the japanese people by the
japanese people for the japanese people in european and american companies individuals of various
races and nationalities hold important positions as a matter of course as businesses extend their range
across national borders operations with multinational human resources are more likely to succeed such
personnel policies will in turn help let the world know about the virtues of japan

koike at our sales companies outside japan many of the top executives are local people and yet few
of the executives at brother industries ltd have worked for a long time outside japan we need to
increase the number of managers who really understand the local mentality by working outside japan
for ﬁve to ten years such people should be identiﬁed in the group and assigned to appropriate
positions at an early stage

sueyoshi the brother group has more than 30000 employees so im sure you can identify appropriate
human resources i hope that brother will actively seek and develop such staﬀ and continue to globalize
the organization in line with its operations

social contribution activities  more than 14700 employees just under 50 of brothers global
   workforce have joined the brother eco point program to reduce environmental impact on a
   daytoday basis brother employees are also involved in education at your side in kenya repaying
   hometowns in china giving explanations at a planetarium dome by using air scouter in japan and
   embroidery and printing on tshirts to support areas aﬀected by the great east japan earthquake
   these eﬀorts which reﬂect brothers spirit and involve its business operations are highly evaluated
   brother should continue to systematically promote these activities as part of social investment under
   a global vision



eﬀorts that have shown progress but require more commitment

reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  in japan total greenhouse gas emissions have been cut by
  16 from the previous year outside japan greenhouse gas emissions per unit of sales have been
  cut by 87 from the previous year these worthy accomplishments are the result of i the
  introduction of cuttingedge equipment and technologies from the startup of new factories and ii
  sales companies eﬀorts to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 1 annually among others the targets
  of activities should be further deﬁned and quantiﬁed
user and ecofriendly product development  the low energy standby technology  which is designed to
  reduce standby power consumption to about 004 w and coatless surface have been developed which
  are good brother should encourage the use of universal design fonts and ship printers with toner saving
  2in1 printing etc set as defaults thereby further reducing environmental impact during use
commitment and response to biological diversity and water resource issues  brother started to
  monitor consumption at manufacturing facilities outside japan manufacturing facilities in china use
  drainage water from air conditioning systems for ﬂush toilets which deserves recognition brother
  should increase its understanding and raise awareness about the impact of producing paper
  indispensable for printing and textiles indispensable for sewing with machines on the ecosystem
  and enhance its conservation eﬀorts
creation of workplaces where employees can easily continue to work  a questionnaire survey was
  conducted on all employees aged 40 or older about nursing care a nursing care seminar was held for
  managers which is particularly noteworthy respective workplaces should identify and resolve issues
  to increase the rate of taking leave andor parttime shifts for child care family care and nursing care
  459 at brother industries in terms of improving mental health and bcp activities brother should
  upgrade the general consultation desk to help employees cope with family issues

a framework for quickly and comprehensively reflecting customer feedback in our products


conducting various surveys to identify potential needs
and embodying them in products

all of the brother groups business activities are driven by
feedback from customers opinions and requests are solicited at
various times and compiled into a database

in the planning phase for a new product in particular those in
charge of planning and development visit customers organize
group interviews and conduct webbased surveys
these extensive indepth surveys are designed to identify the
environments in which products are used and to analyze
impressions and requests so that potential needs  which even
customers are not aware of  are identiﬁed and reﬂected when
                                                                                              framework for reﬂecting customer feedback

for printing a4 paper in everyday use and
a3 paper when needed

business inkjet allinones neo series1 with small depth can
print both a4 and a3 paper thanks to its a4 longedge feed
lef concept thus minimizing space on the desk and increasing
work eﬃciency

paper tends to curl along the ﬁber orientation particularly when
it absorbs ink if paper with ﬁber oriented lengthways is printed                        prints a3 paper with the smallest depth in its class

in lef the print head will contact the paper due to curling
resulting in poor print quality and paper jams

brother decided to solve this intractable problem and came up
with the corrugation method in which paper is corrugated and
                                                                                         the corrugation method prevents curling by
stiﬀened just like the corrugated layer in corrugated ﬁberboard                        corrugating the paper and thereby achieves
by pinching paper with upper and lower combshaped                                       a4 lef right the new a4 lef concept also enables
                                                                                         a3 shortedge feed sef printing

highspeed about twice as fast as conventional
models and highquality printing on corrugated paper

to achieve highspeed printing it is necessary to jet a large
amount of ink with a print head that is long in the paper feed
direction and minimize the number of times the print head
travels back and forth

first brother doubled the print head size to 14 inches and the
number of nozzles while halving the number of times the print
head travels back and forth per sheet of paper

however the larger the print head the heavier it becomes
which disrupts stable traveling moreover in the corrugation
method the print quality is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by subtle
diﬀerences in ink droplet landing positions unlike printing on a
smooth paper surface these challenges were solved by
developing a unique feed mechanism and a new ink discharge                          the print speed has been doubled by employing
                                                                                     print head twice as large as conventional models

printing is impressively quick 18 sheetsminute for a4 color
and 20 sheetsminute for a4 blackandwhite

minimizing product returns and servicing

based on brothers unique concept from the viewpoint of customers


eﬀorts to minimize the number of returns after shipment

at the brother group the percentage of products returned from customers for repair or return is
deﬁned as product returns and servicing rate we believe that the time and eﬀort suﬀered by
customers due to trouble with the products no matter how small is an inconvenience for them the
brother group believes that reducing the number of returned products close to zero should be placed
above all others to achieve greater customer satisfaction and together with all departments from
development design manufacture logistics sales to services we promote the acrosstheboard activity
to pursue improvement of products quality

minimizing product returns and servicing

working on quality improvement activities from the viewpoint of customers considering
the types of paper available in diﬀerent markets


the business inkjet allinone neo series released in the
autumn of 2012 has revolutionized the concept of inkjet
printers these products have embodied the commitment
of brothers engineers as exempliﬁed by the a4 longedge
feed mechanism it is also of interest to note that after
absorbing ink paper is subject to rapid deformation due to
ﬁber orientation in a longedge feed mechanism such
deformation is likely to make paper contact with the printer
head in the printing process among others which could
aﬀect the printing quality brother took up this challenge
and developed proprietary technology to control the
swelling and expansion of paper the a4 longedge feed
mechanism has helped develop epochmaking products
characterized by a compact body with depth of 290 mm
and a3 printing capability

customers use our products in various environments in
development evaluation process as we learned from
printing on paper that we obtained in diﬀerent countries
paper deformed more than we expected impacting on the
printing quality in our conventional evaluations we had                             business inkjet allinone neo series featuring an a4
                                                                                      longedge feed which was considered diﬃcult to achieve
mainly used regular paper typically available in markets in
                                                                                      a3 printing capability and a compact body
the americas europe and japan however we learned that
the characteristics of paper are signiﬁcantly uneven in some regions in terms of the thickness the
moisture absorbency etc to solve this problem we ﬁrst conducted a survey regarding paper available
in the markets in respective countries then we identiﬁed the types of paper that are available in large
amounts in respective regions and adjusted our products to these types of paper this process enabled
us to recognize that diﬀerent types of paper are on the market in diﬀerent regions and that printing
quality is aﬀected by the environment such as temperature or humidity levels we evaluated the
printing quality utilizing paper used by a greater number of customers and adjusted the products
accordingly and we succeeded in further stabilizing printing quality

as brother operates and sells products globally it is no wonder that brothers products are used in
various environments and the paper used by customers is used in these same environments thus
brother remains committed to ensuring product development and services from the viewpoint of
customers and to reducing product returns and the servicing rate

proactively collecting information and visiting customers to ensure quality assurance for new customers

in 2012 brother industries ltd released a4 blackandwhite
printers up to 100 ppm to help customers increase eﬃciency in
largevolume printing and launched into the highspeed inkjet
printer segment for the ﬁrst time in line with this development we
considered it necessary to expand the quality assurance
standards thus we started to proactively collect information
about the environments and applications of our products in the
new segment speciﬁcally our servicing staﬀ visited customers                a visit to a university in new zealand
and collected printing counter data based on customer consent                the software product installed in the universitys
                                                                              computers was modiﬁed based on the customers
the staﬀ in charge of relevant departments including the                     comments and requests the improvement met
development department also visited customers to perform                     the customers expectations

onsite investigations these activities were conducted in japan
new zealand and seven european countries

we were able to discover an actual status of use that we had not anticipated and we received many
requests regarding usability the counter data revealed that customers use our products at
temperatures lower than we expected and we thus revised the assurance temperature range based on
the actual status of use and on requests identiﬁed through these activities we added 18 new customer
quality standards in fy2012 april 1 2012march 31 2013 when we visited a university in new
zealand we improved the software in about two weeks to meet the actual status of use we were highly
evaluated by both the local sales company and the customer for our quick response the improved
software has been applied in newly manufactured products thus the visits to customers have helped
us deliver better products

given below are comments from staﬀ in charge after visiting customers


  staﬀ in charge of development
  i learned a lot by directly listening to what customers have to say my statements were regarded as
  brothers oﬃcial statements so i recognized that i need to have a greater sense of responsibility

  manager at a sales company outside japan
  staﬀ in charge travelled all the way from japan this was a good opportunity for our customers to
  learn that they are considered important customers of brother

further speeding up repair services

mie brother precision industries ltd mie brother is a servicing center that focuses on the repair of
fax machines printers and home sewing machines among other services to increase customer
satisfaction mie brother has been working to enhance the quality and speed of its repair services by
increasing the eﬃciency of line operations mie brother has successfully attained high target rates of
returning repaired products to customers within three days two nights after delivery to mie brother

to further improve customer satisfaction mie brother analyzed questionnaire feedback from
customers the analysis revealed that customer satisfaction would be
enhanced by returning repaired products to customers as quickly as
possible thereby minimizing the time when products are unavailable
thus eﬀorts were made to further speed up repair services the speciﬁc
goal was to return repaired products within two days one night one
day shorter than the conventional target of three days two nights

the ﬁrst measure taken was at 1200 pm to identify the remaining
                                                                                                                         identifying the remaining number of
number of products to be repaired each day and to coordinate human                                                       products to be repaired and making
resources and operations to increase eﬃciency so that repair services                                                    adjustments on a daily basis
                                                                                                                         including allocation of human resources
could be completed within the day the second measure was to
carefully observe respective operation processes speciﬁcally analyses
were made on processes that caused delays eg tasks carried over
from the previous day a ﬂexible human resources framework was
established by changing the line layout among others with a view to
increasing speed proactive measures were taken to develop multiple
skills so that employees could repair not only sewing machines but
also fax machines and printers and process repair acceptance and                                                         attainment rates of twoday onenight

these activities helped prevent the backlog of products subject to repair from growing and facilitate
eﬃcient line operations the target index of twoday onenight repair attainment rate was achieved
in fy2009 april 1 2009march 31 2010 the attainment rate was constantly kept at over 90 percent
in fy2012 april 1 2012march 31 2013 arrangements were also made with the brother group call
center to inform customers upon acceptance of their repair applications that a framework was in
place to return products in a few days due to quicker repair services than before products lent to
customers when their brother products were returned for repair were reduced by about 60 percent
which has led to signiﬁcant cost reductions

mie brother remains committed to analyzing feedback from customers and improving services in an

preparing seaweed farming tools to support the fishing industry in the earthquakeaffected areas

providing support in line with local needs

a volunteer team of brother industries ltd bils
employees has been making sandbags which are used
to farm wakame seaweed undaria pinnatiﬁda to
support the ﬁshing industry in shichigahama miyagi
prefecture which was hit by the great east japan
earthquake the sandbags are used as weights to sink
seaweed farming shelves in the sea

shichigahama used to have a thriving ﬁshing industry
thanks to its fertile ﬁshing grounds but the tsunami                         production of sandbags by volunteer employees
washed away ﬁshing nets and other essential tools
there has been growing momentum to start wakame
seaweed farming as a ﬁrst step to raising capital for
resuming the ﬁshing industry seaweed farming is
easy to start with small investment and the seaweed
can be harvested just three to four months after
planting seeds in cultivation ropes

upon learning about this situation bil employees
submitted an inhouse proposal to make the sandbags
for seaweed farming making sandbags to support the
                                                                              fishermen holding sandbags
ﬁshing industry have been active mainly in
minamisanriku town in northeastern miyagi prefecture
much advice was obtained from brother group employees who had volunteered prior to bils
involvement and was reﬂected in inhouse activities to make sandbags

speciﬁcally employees were invited to participate as volunteers in early august and they prepared
materials and sewed bags with sewing machines at the company and at home in late august 200 bags
were sent to shichigahama for testing the local ﬁshermen were so happy with the bags that they
decided to move up the next years seaweed farming plan and requested additional bags in response to
their request employees volunteered to make an additional 150 bags and sent them at the end of
september in time for the ﬁshing season which starts in october

seaweed farming in shichigahama requires more than 1500 sandbags each year so more employees
will be encouraged to volunteer to enable a fullscale ongoing project to be launched
the brother group remains committed to encouraging employees active participation and ensuring
longlasting support with priority on giving support in line with local needs

thus increases their motivation

bmx will continue with this activity while promoting skills training for vocational school teachers to
reduce the maintenance required for the donated sewing machines
