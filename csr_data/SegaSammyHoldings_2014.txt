        comment
                           an innovative care support tool that lets children watch and understand
          dentists like me are used to talking to preschool and lower elementary school patients in ways they can understand without
       feeling afraid i might say for example im going to work some magic on your teeth so they go to sleep but ive never been
       able to say for sure if the kids really understand this the recently developed smiletouch dental is a truly unprecedented tool
       that uses animation to ease childrens anxieties and fears at one time a dentist might have felt it is enough to make the par
       ent understand but we now talk directly with the child likewise smiletouch dental is a preparation support tool that really
       puts children first they say that a visit to the dentist is more frightening than to any other doctor even so i was surprised at
       how using this tool could ease childrens anxiety and fear the animated explanations are even effective for patients with mild
       mental disabilities such as developmental disorders smiletouch has the potential to serve a new function as a hearttoheart
       bridge between dentist and child
          to see a child smile and feel calm while undergoing treatment is a great joy to us i hope tms entertainment will continue                                                 shigeru watanabe

goods and dispatched employee volunteers to the affected areas
we continue to support people in these areas in a number of
ways including hosting moraleraising events

took part in morale boosters sat down with chairman satomi for
his csr report interview together they talked about the current
state of support activities and plans and outlooks for these activi
ties in the future

feedback from company employee participants in volunteer activities
   the group activities ive been part of lately are digging up farm fields and re                    more than 90 of the farmland was damaged in shichigahama town miyagi
moving rubble in most cases the property owners are elderly and i could tell there                prefecture a field takes two to three years to recover and involves a lot of work
is no way these farmlands are going to recover without volunteer work i realized                   some of which cannot be done by machines before the salt can be fully removed
that while one person has only so much strength by joining our efforts we can be a                 from the soil this means a lot of volunteers are needed the locals have asked sin
                     powerful force for recovery i hope to take part again                                              cerely for this help because they know how necessary it is i

   the rice paddies where we worked were littered with lots of glass fragments                        i was on the bus heading to the volunteer site when a look out the window re
plastic trash and so on they say it will be years before they can be planted again               vealed a landscape still very much damaged huge piles of rubble guardrails twist
when i came here for myself i understood how bad things really are in the affected                 ed far out of shape and so on at first glance the fields looked peaceful enough
areas i sensed that going forward the region will need new kinds of volunteerism                  but then i picked up the smell of salt water and saw all the seashells i could sense
                      the volunteer activities of the sega sammy group are truly                                          the seriousness of the tsunami damage there was a strong
                      meaningful because you get to hear directly from the local                                          sense of solidarity among the group company employees so

a good partner with whom we can share our wishes
   our business with sega started when we were considering a major overhaul of our facility which we did in february 2012 we were thinking about what we
would have to do to satisfy our customers and get them to like golf more thats when i met mr niiyama i was completely surprised that sega had anything
to do with golf but i realized that they like us had a passion for promoting golf and sports so it was just natural to share our wishes with them as our partner
sometimes the situation was tough but mr niiyamas attitude was fantastic as he tried to come up with the best solution without compromising it was great to
work with him there are still some issues we need to deal with and so much more we would like to do so im hopeful that we will continue to be partners who
work hard together

tance of speaking sincerely as a partner and seeing things from the customers point of view when
it comes to customer satisfaction there is no finish line looking ahead i hope we can continue to
combine forces to meet each others expectations and keep our customers happy

aiming for a highly communicative office
  in fiscal 2013 the head office changed location we took this as an opportunity to improve the workplace en
vironment in terms of systems aiming to innovate working styles
  the thing we stressed in this reform was stimulating more communication which is the bedrock of work we
greatly expanded the scope of communication possibilities by introducing realtime communication systems that
enable voice with video calling and instant messaging on pcs confirmation of presence and desktop sharing in
addition to creating a wireless lan network the shift to wireless lan also backed up the introduction of an of
fice system where employees are free to change desks in some departments and led to the realization of paper
less meetings
  the value of systems increases not merely with their introduction but with their effective use we will continue
communicating with employees and pushing ahead with the creation of workplaces that are userfriendlier and
translate into increased motivation

our stance
as a good corporate citizen the group recognizes the need to tackle environmental issues in 2006 the group
commissioned an external environmental research firm to assess the potential environmental impacts of its
manufacturing processes products and services while it did not identify any serious environmental risks we
nonetheless decided to undertake a range of measures to step up compliance with environmental laws and use
resources and energy more efficiently we have taken steps to enlighten all employees about environmental issues so
they can act accordingly in their private lives global environmental issues manifested as climate change and other
chronic issues require an urgent response and it is critical for enterprises to keep voluntarily and proactively working to
protect the environment the sega sammy group code of conduct mandates three things from our employees to
ensure that business activities are conducted appropriately in consideration of the global environment we make sure
each group employee understands how to help out as an individual as we work to protect the global environment
