the road to sustainability is fraught with obstacles  some have to be overcome with innovation some with determination and some simply by
perseverance but as we overcome each obstacle we come across doors of opportunities with multiple outcomes that take us to the next level this
thought is graphically represented in this design theme the upward moving transverse lines represent the groups ambitions the pillars of myriad colours
are the roadmaps of individual businesses while the ones in red are symbolic of mahindras rise for good philosophy that continues to guide them all

businesswise is the next phase in our sustainability
journey in it every individual business is driving the sustainability
agenda on issues material to their stakeholders and aiming to set
new benchmarks within their sector and geographies it is like
pursuing the sustainability agenda with independent teams who
are not only committed but capable and experienced this
enlarged team new vigour focus and greater ownership has
created a multiplier effect that aims to transcend incremental
growth and give rise to a transformational change and it has
begun to yield accelerated results in the very rst year

sustainability and us




                overview
                alternative thinking has been the driving force of our sustainability journey it is
                directing us to think big but act lean get ahead but give back market globally but
                manufacture locally and target high proﬁts but in harmony with a higher purpose

                over the years we have travelled a signiﬁcant distance we have been taking the
                lead and big leaps in sunshine areas traversing alternative routes ﬁnding rooms for
                improvement in seemingly perfect solutions and adding sustainable possibilities in
                our bouquet of offerings

stakeholder engagement
if sustainability is about ensuring value addition and longterm
proﬁtability while simultaneously managing and minimising
negative social and environmental impacts of business then
stakeholder engagement is one of the key activities that enables
this to happen successfully and effectively

at mahindra we believe that forging strong and dynamic channels of
communication with our stakeholders is mutually beneﬁcial at
multiple levels it helps us plan our short and longterm
strategies better identify scope for a new product or service
and enhance the performance of existing products at
the same time our stakeholders become part of
our overall growth vision understand our
decisions much better and support
our endeavours more fervently

                                           supplier an employee or a local community we make it a
                                           point to address and listen to every stakeholder

economic performance




                                                                overview
                                            fy 2015 was a year that began with a lot of hope in india a new government
                                       had just come into power and was expected to shake policies and
                                decisionmaking processes out of limbo but it takes time for hope to turn into reality
                           and till that time one needs to continue having faith in it although indias economy grew
                      by 73 percent during fy 2015 growth hastened slowly constrained by weak demand at
                  home and abroad

         against the backdrop of such an economic condition and subdued consumer interest mahindra group saw a
    minor blip in its ﬁnancial performance in fy 2015 the consolidated gross revenues and other income for the group
    was inr 76015 billion as against inr 78736 billion in the previous year the consolidated proﬁt after tax after
    deducting minority interests stood at inr 3137 billion as compared to inr 4667 billion in the previous year similar
    performance was seen in auto and farm sectors as well which is usually our biggest revenue contributor

    automotive division saw degrowth in sales across all major segments passenger vehicles including uvs mpvs and
    cars saw an 119 decrease in volumes due to the increasing preference for new launches petrol engines and
                    compact uvs yet we continued leadership of the domestic uv market by posting a market share of
                                374 bolero retained the title of being indias largest selling suv for the 9th
                                consecutive year and became the 5th highest selling passenger vehicle in india
                                sales of commercial vehicles also came down by 48 due to slowdown in agricultural
                                income and ﬁnance availability

                                   similarly farm division including swaraj division recorded sales of 234766 tractors a
                                   decrease of 126 over last year this mirrors the overall decline of 13 in sales for
                                   the indian tractor industry in fy 2015 that said we still command a leadership
                                   position with a market share of 40 the business performance did not dampen our
                                   efforts of promoting technology and innovation in our products




                                   we introduced arjun novo the rst

                                   meanwhile our group companies continued to forge ahead on the road to
                                   prosperity mahindra lifespace developers ltd posted a consolidated total income
                                   and pat preminority interest of inr 1148 billion and inr 283 billion respectively 
                                   an increase of 52 in the former and a highly satisfying 157 increase in the latter
                                   mahindra  mahindra financial services ltd also reported a 14 increase in its

our ﬁnancial performance in fy 2015 however had no bearing on the general

local supply
in recent years we have been steadfast towards achieving our global ambitions but while we have trained our vision to foreign
shores our intention to localise our production and operation remains strong as ever although the boundaries of india remain
the de facto deﬁnition of local supply some businesses have their own deﬁnition and boundary of what constitutes as local
this is based on its industry requirements and other onground realities like access to technology and knowhow tax and duty
regimes and supply of skilled manpower but the objective remains to promote local talent and give it an opportunity to ﬂourish
on a larger scale

that said we have exacting quality standards and stringent processes to identify and empanel our suppliers some of the factors
inﬂuencing supplier selection include




     costs            performance and              compliance on environment                  commitment to reduce             statutory

environmental performance




                                      overview
                          during the reporting period we progressed well on our environmental
                    agenda notable milestones include turning water positive as a group and
               mahindra lifespaces conducting a natural capital proﬁling  a ﬁrst in the group

               while we marched ahead to achieve our big goals faster and sooner we kept a
               sharp focus on introspective small steps that eliminated roadblocks and helped
               lay the foundation for big impacts this resulted in enhanced environmental
               performance in areas of energy conservation water reduction and waste
               management across the group



               we embarked on new initiatives across our value chain to
               ensure that we created better value for our customers
               and our stakeholders while growing our business



              management approach
               our approach to environment management stems from our core purpose to drive
               positive change in the lives of our stakeholders and enable them to rise it is rooted

               we are committed to make a positive difference across our entire product lifecycle
               from green manufacturing facilities to imbibing green consciousness in our people
               our approach to environmental sustainability covers all the highimpact material
               issues across our businesses




               we consistently raise the bar and set ourselves ambitious
               targets and goals we leverage alternative thinking to
               unleash new ideas to achieve these goals


                                                                                                        83

green it guidelines                       green supply chain management policy
to ensure that we use information         we recognise that integrated management approach works best when one
technology it more efﬁciently we       wants to achieve sustainability throughout the value chain we therefore
formulated the green it guidelines        proactively engage with our suppliers and vendors to incorporate environment

environmental management
our environment management approach aims to achieve continuous improvement in environmental performance in all our
activities we follow a wellstructured process to manage waste water and energy resources across the group operations
environment parameters are now aspects of roadmap employees at all levels are responsible for companys environmental
performance robust monitoring practices stringent feedback measures continuous introspection along with a welldeﬁned
reporting structure enables us to be ahead of the industry curve on environment kpis



sustainability reporting contributes to our sustainability agenda in more ways
than one while we report we also reect disclosures result in deliberations and gures
transform into ground level initiatives and strategic interventions

                                                                                                                                84

calculating specific consumption
we measure our environmental performance on absolute as well as speciﬁc basis the speciﬁc consumption is calculated by
dividing absolute consumption by a denominator based on the nature of business for eg in case of manufacturing
business units it is the number of units produced whereas for services it is the number of employees or units of services
offered etc the denominators for the group companies are delineated in the following table

in june 2013 mahindra group and spains cie automotive sa signed a global alliance agreement that resulted in creation
of mahindra cie automotive as part of the agreement the automotive component businesses of the group under mahindra
forgings ltd mahindra composites ltd mahindra hinoday industries ltd mahindra gears and transmissions pvt ltd were
merged with cie automotive

air quality
breath is the most signiﬁcant
representation of life and the quality of
the air we breathe directly determines
the health and longevity of our life
good air quality is vital and we have an
important role to play we not only
adhere to all statutory norms but also
effectively use an efﬁcient monitoring
mechanism to keep a check on various
pollutants

the particulate matter pm10
size less than 10 µm  pm25 size less
than 25 µm sulphur oxides sox and
nitrogen oxides nox are commonly
monitored at all our manufacturing 
service locations in line with the
revised national ambient air quality
standards naaqs 2009 some
manufacturing plants also monitor
more speciﬁc pollutants related to their
processes like respirable suspended            ambient air quality 201415                                   microgramm3

 tech mahindra employee commutation survey

 at tech mahindra we continuously strive towards a sustainable culture within the organisation and connecting
 business growth with responsibility business growth is coupled with employee growth which in turn leads to a growth
 in the number of vehicles deployed for their commute leading to an increase in the carbon footprint as well as
 pollution

 as an it ﬁrm business travel including employee commute is a signiﬁcant issue and one of the biggest contributors to
 scope 3 emissions hence we continuously monitor it as well as take initiatives to reduce it

 an employee commute survey was conducted in march 2015 with an easy to ﬁll questionnaire which captured the
 travel mode vehicle type fuel type and the distance travelled in a period of one and a half months about 2500
 employees took the survey it was encouraging to see that over and above participation in the survey a host of
 employees were enthusiastically sharing ideas on how to reduce scope 3 emissions this led to cocreation of ideas and
 greater ownership

 results of the interventions will be seen in the next reporting period

                                       in consultation with the adivasi community our ngo the naandi foundation
                                       evolved a horticultural development project on marginal degraded community
                                       lands to enrich their local nutrition their ecosystem and augment the
                                       communitys income


                                       outcome
                                       the adivasi farmers who became part of this horticulture project started
                                       growing arabica coffee through organic agriculture they use only biofertilisers
                                       biopesticides and encourage natural predators such as spiders and ladybirds to
                                       keep pests under control

the adivasi community in               today these farmers harvest process and export this organic coffee to different
araku already had a                    countries across the world the coffee has received an international organic and
                                       fairtrade certiﬁcation they also grow food fruits such as papaya mangoes mud
robust centuriesold food              apples chikoo and oranges to provide a nutritionally rich food basket to their
cropping pattern that is               own families
subsistent by nature but a
traditional production
system was inadequate
without technological
improvements and
resource planning to feed
an increasing population
modern life mandated
sufcient cash income for
health educational and
other aspirational needs




  impact
  fair trade coffee grown organically and mostly exported overseas is now a viable
  livelihood option for these adivasi farmers and brings the coffeegrowers annual
  income of inr 100000 plus

  naandi foundation also encouraged the adivasi farmer community to form the largest organic coffee cooperative in
  the world  the small and marginal farmers mutually aided cooperative society samtfmacs this coffee
  cooperative ploughs its proﬁts into village development projects like healthcare ambulances and drinking water

  naandi foundations work in the araku region began over 15 years ago and embraces the adivasi values of caring for
  the community and the forests this makes the programme a success and it continues to positively impact over 100000
  adivasi lives

mahindra lifespace developers ltd can be considered a front runner in
sustainability as per the assessment the company focuses on green design of
                                                                                       with this mldl became

and water management within the cities it develops                                    featured in this report
the companys performance on sustainability is considered to be a strong
brand differentiator this can be further reinforced by enhancing stakeholder
understanding of the companys potential contributions to the wider
ecological system

the company may be able to create an interesting usp for new developments by
showing how the companys long term presence in an area contributes to the
creation and preservation of ecosystem services available to local stakeholders
moreover communicating within the cities about the steps taken by mahindra on
natural capital management will strengthen the support for mahindras
approach and will contribute to a sense of pride among employees companies
and residents

through its role within the integrated business cities mahindra may also wish to
explore the opportunities to involve companies within the city in the conservation
and sustainable use of biodiversity such an initiative could focus on biodiversity
not only within the city but also on biodiversity policies within the companies
where companies exchange experiences and best practices

the next step in this journey should be to integrate natural capital considerations
in the companys supplier requirements thereby further improving the
companys sustainability performance in the design and construction of
residential homes

water
turning negatives into positives needs
courage commitment and vision

in fy 2012 13 we launched an ambitious project h20 to h2inﬁnity
to change the then existing water equation and transform a
fastdepleting reserve back to tomorrows inﬁnite resource
the aim is to ensure that there is enough water
available for a growing india

in pursuance of this goal in fy 2013 14     but this is
we crossed an important milestone as      just a milestone
the mahindra group achieved
water positive status              we continue on our
                               journey recharged and all our
                        businesses and divisions continue
                  to contribute in their own way to
            conserve every drop of water through
       innovations and initiatives
                                                                                                                               105

the group marked the start of a focused and accelerated effort to conserve water in 2011
12 with a 360o water management programme h2innity this programme brought
about a massive change in the consumption and conservation of water  not just within
our operations but also by local communities our vendors as well as our customers

waste
we follow a two pronged strategy on waste  reduction and reuse less waste means less
disposal cost plus conservation of natural resources and energy reuse of waste helps cut
raw material costs and decreases the burden on the environment

this focus on reduction or reuse of waste is pervasive right from the design
stage to the manufacturing process and distribution of ﬁnished
goods at every step we are looking for opportunities for waste
minimisation and reuse

whatever waste we generate is responsibly
disposed keeping the compliances rules
and regulations of the land in mind




                                            hazardous waste is handed over to authorised hazardous waste collection vendors
                                            equipped with the requisite treatment storage and disposal facilities while a major
                                            portion of nonhazardous waste is disposed through contractors who hand it over
                                            to largescale recycling units or reuse it

                                                                                                                                    115

     initiatives


     going ahead
     plans are afoot to introduce innovative              utilisation of paint sludge          solar sludge drying bed
     methods for waste management including               for primer making                    for paint sludge




     turning waste to wealth
     miq and group sustainability teamed up to conduct  waste to wealth a programme that focuses on management of
     solid waste and wastewater and familiarising participants with the newly introduced laws pertaining to hazardous
     ewaste and biomedical waste management innovative and proven approaches to waste segregation removal
     generation of useful byproducts like biogas cng briquettes as fuel recycling of furniture and disposal of solid waste
     were also discussed the programme attracted a record 50 participants from various group companies including
     auto farm two wheelers cie spares business unit mil mhril and the icing on the cake was the participation
     of suppliers




     reduction in emissions
     scope 3 emissions were reduced through packaging improvements
     due to which the estimated wood usage reduction for the year fy 2015 is
     128 tonnes  annum




                                                                                                                                 119
