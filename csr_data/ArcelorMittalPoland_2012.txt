investments have always been
a foundation for building
a business strategy of
arcelormittal group we are
firmly convinced that they
have contributed to our
competitive advantage which
in poland is reflected through
our actual market share
among others currently 70

capacity stays in our hands
the fact that we did not
abandon investments even in
the crisis period proves our
strength pln 300 million
spent on revamping and
innovation in crisis years of
2009 and 2010 let us resist
the market collapse today in
the recessive scenario we are

years but also more flexible
