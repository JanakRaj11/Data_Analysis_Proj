                           tippy taps
              one example of our sanitation solutions



           in an impoverished rural area where waterborne diseases
     like diarrhea proliferate tippy taps present a safe alternative to

     recommend a simple handwash solution in any developmental
     setting  these are safe easy to build and use minimal amounts
     of water indeed theyre tried and tested around the world by
     organizations like unicef and water aid in countries including
     india mozambique tanzania zambia and uganda
