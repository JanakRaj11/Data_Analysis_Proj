has been installed for collection of storm water
passing it through filtration process and using it in
activities like horticulture
as a result of these efforts the ground water table
condition in the vicinity of our presence has generally
improved however at present we dont have any
quantification available with us to ascertain the
exact impact of these efforts on ground water table

reused recycled and only then drainedfacility
like herp varanasi is a zero waste water discharge
unit as the water used as coolant is recycled and
finally exhausted within the process at trichy

irrigation purpose within the complex to maintain
zero discharge hence avoiding contamination

bhel is not a water intensive manufacturing
organization and hence there is no water source

such none of the bhel units is surrounded by any               the organization has planted more than 30 lakh
biodiversity  protected area and thus there is                trees across its premises the plantation of trees has
