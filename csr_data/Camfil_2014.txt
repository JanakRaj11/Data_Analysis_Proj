a helping hand
across the globe
during one week every year for six years the whole camfil group has
celebrated and manifested its will to contribute to a more sustainable
world we call this internal event camfilcairing week for five days
we carry out various sustainability and corporate social responsibility
activities at camfil facilities around the globe these activities which
vary from company to company range from donating blood to planting
trees and collecting clothes and food for the needy here are a few
recent examples
