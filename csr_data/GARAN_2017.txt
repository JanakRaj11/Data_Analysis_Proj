energy
conservation
as part of our effort to reduce ghg
emissions we must also focus on
energy consumption what are we
powering how much energy is
consumed to power what we do how
can we be more efficient with the
power were using these are questions we are consistently measuring
analyzing and addressing

in 2016 garans energy consumption per dozen was the lowest on record this
year garan installed 17500 led bulbs into our manufacturing facilities these
will reduce our ghg emissions while being more energy efficient and eco
friendly

since our 2008 base year of reporting garan has continually improved energy
efficiency and consumption we are committed to reducing energy
consumption and will continue to seek ways to use efficient clean energy
throughout our company

solid wasterecycling
garans goal is to have zero waste go to a landfill we recognize the
effects excessive waste has on the environment and are committed to
pursuing a zerowastetolandfill status to do this we must be efficient
with what we bring in and resourceful with what we send out

since 2008 garan has significantly increased the dozens we produce
annually during the same time we were increasing our dozens
produced we were able to decrease our pounds of waste per dozen by
over 17 this has led to a reduction of over 560000 lbs of waste

to help reach our goal of achieving zerowastetolandfill status we are
also very focused on companywide recycling efforts since our base
year in 2008 we have increased our average pounds per year of recycled
materials by over 15 this has led to over 175 million pounds of
material being recycled

we see the inverse relationship between waste and recycling and are
committed to focusing on both as our production processes become
more efficient and environmentally friendly we will continue to reduce
our waste increase what we recycle and ultimately reach our goal of
being a zerowastetolandfill company

                   175 million
                     pounds
                    recycled

                                                                                       8

     water conservation efforts
there are few if any natural resources as essential to the future of our
planet as water garan sees the importance of this resource and is
committed to applying sustainable clean water practices throughout
every facet of our company


 in the past 8 years garan has reduced our total
      water usage by over 6 million gallons

  this is a 39 decrease in gallons of water used per
              dozen garments produced

garan is committed to continuing our pursuit of sustainable water
practices within each of our manufacturing facilities corporate offices
distribution centers and qualitycontrol offices measurable analysis of
our water usage is regularly done throughout garans global company
footprint allowing us to quantify our progress and identify areas for
continued improvement




                                                                                      9

carbon footprint
garan is committed to a companywide effort to reduce
our greenhouse gas emissions we acknowledge the
effects that the evergrowing amount of co2 entering our
atmosphere can and has had on our planet we strive as a
company to pursue sustainable practices to minimize
co2 emissions

since our base year of reporting we have continually seen our co2 emissions
decrease while our annual production of dozens increased our intensity of
emissions per dozen is 28 lower than in our base year weve recently
completed a project installing led bulbs in all our manufacturing facilities we
anticipate this led bulb project to result in the reduction of over 181 tonnes of
co2


we know there is significant work to be done in our sustainability journey but
garans approach to reducing our carbon footprint will be sciencebased and goal
oriented providing motivation to get through our challenges we will continually
measure and analyze where we are as a company and how we can work with our
suppliers and contractors to reduce ghg emissions throughout our value chain



                 28 decrease                     1812 tonnes
                 in emissions                     reduction of
                                                  co2

supply chain sustainability
as a company garan incorporates sustainable practices and policies throughout
our entire value chain we recognize the harm a company can have on the planet
by being environmentally irresponsible and are committed to continual analysis
and progress this starts within our walls with everything from our corporate
offices to our manufacturing facilities and extends into our supply chain
we are committed to engaging our suppliers customers and end use consumers
in efforts to reduce andor eliminate waste in supply chains as well as reduce
overall environmental impact for instance by shipping full containers of fabric
or finished goods we reduce the number of containers shipped which in turn
reduces use of fuel additionally being able to wash our clothing in cold water
the consumer can reduce their environmental impact
                                         we expect our supply chain partners to
                                         actively engage in their own
                                         sustainability efforts in their facilities we
                                         have recently increased our supply chain
                                         sustainability efforts by requiring our
                                         large volume fabric suppliers to commit
                                         to reporting their sustainability efforts
                                         using the higg index we will continue
                                         working with our supply chain partners
                                         taking one step at a time into a more
                                         sustainable future

chemical policy

                   garan takes restricted chemcicals very seriously our goal is to
                   continually produce safe garments for children that meet or
                   exceed all us government individual us state and our
customers restricted chemical requirements for each specific garment style
produced through rigorous testing procedures we are constantly monitoring
related sources for chemicals to be avoided and updating our procedures
accordingly


product efficiency

at garan we strive to use as high a percentage of the
fabric we purchase as possible this ensures less waste
goes into our recycling program and less waste goes into
landfills our goal is to be at least 90 efficient in the
utilization of all fabric however our experience tells us due to the complexity of
some styles we will not always achieve this goal to work toward continuous
improvement all styles are audited to double check that they are as efficient as
possible for each specific style


you can see by the related information on waste that we are good at it as we
have significantly increased our annual dozens produced and reduced our
amount of waste generated




                                                                                               18

                                           garan sustainability report 20172018




our goals for the next year

  continue to reduce our waste to landfills

  reduce our carbon footprint another 35

  work within our supply chains to better understand any
   opportunities we may be missing in further reducing our
   collective ghg emissions

  find more ways to involve our employees at all levels of our
   company in our sustainability effort
