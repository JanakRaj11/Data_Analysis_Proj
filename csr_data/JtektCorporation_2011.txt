     effective use of resources

                                basic concept                                                         reduction of secondary material usage amounts

     the responsibilities of an environmentally friendly manufacturer                            ing their durability also we strove to promote recycling by
     through making improvements and coming up with ideas for                                     reusing oil grinding wheels cutting tools and jigs
     the production processes of each product we strive to reduce                                however due to the rise in the cost of oil etc our base unit is

     representative of the workers club for ecoharmonic renewable society npo   global scale however i have to say that this report is lacking in
     tamio yamaguchi                                                               reference to such global response i believe this may be due to the
                                                                                   way in jtekt has set a boundary of only looking at all jtekt
     for a report to receive high social appraisal it must address the            corporation independent activities and thus could be resolved by
     concerns and interests of readers in particular those of readers             broadening the scope to include subsidiaries and affiliated compa
     with strong interest in the relevant companys trends and                    nies taking sales turnover share by location and number of
     continuously improve information disclosure and accountability               employees by location into consideration and including all this
     i was interested in seeing how jtekts 2011 csr report                        various information in the report
     addressed three issues in particular the earthquaketsunami                  regarding information disclosure the fact that the door opens
     disaster that devastated northern japan in march csr advance                each year is evidence of jtekts willingness to be transparent in
     ments and global response president ikawa makes several                      line with their principle of promoting the improvement of condi
     mentions of the earthquake disaster in his message he also                   tions through information disclosure i hope they will increase
     touches upon purchasing and risk countermeasures in particular              efforts to this end even further in the future currently the
     the commitment to concentrating strengths on the numerous                     information disclosed in the making of healthy minds and bodies
     issues exposed by the disaster conveys jtekts determination                 section is of excellent quality but i hope to see more proactive and
     a disaster of such scale has heightened expectations towards the              quantitative disclosure in all areas of csr
     conception and construction of a sustainable future giving rise to           finally i would like to see jtekt concentrate on incorporating the
     a paradigm shift and corporations must aim to meet this expec              following items into next years report these are specific mention
     tation when addressing the various issues                                    of efforts for foreign worker employment and promoting the
     regarding csr advancements examples of jtekt csr taking a                   awareness of human rights both of these are of great importance
     new step forward can be seen in activities such as creating and             in todays society and while this report lists them as main
     distributing the csr handbook pocketsize version for the                 activities items they are not elaborated on regarding foreign
     2010 edition these kinds of activities i believe have come to              worker employment i would like to see information across a broad
     fruition in the form of the 2011 policy of taking another look at            perspective on strategies to secure global human resources
     tasks that have become second nature from a csr perspective                  localization and so forth based on a principle of true globaliza
     and the my csr section of this years report csr can be                    tion for the human rights aspect currently great importance is
     maximized through the aggregation of individual employees social             being placed on the violation of human rights relating to corpo
     responsibility esr employee social responsibility therefore we            rate activities in the iso26000 the revised oecd guidelines for
     can expect programs will be conceived through the daily investi              multinational enterprises and the gri global reporting initiative
     gation of topics raised in this section regarding the environmen            g31 guidelines therefore in the future i hope to see jtekt act
     tal aspect i look forward to seeing concrete policies and action             and report on matters exceeding mere performance awareness
     take shape now that a directive on biodiversity conservation has
     been instituted and an environmental vision has been created                                                  ivbdnvbvjxçhegdaz
