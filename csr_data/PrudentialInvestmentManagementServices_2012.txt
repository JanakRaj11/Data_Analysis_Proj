                                   desire to be good corporate citizens late in 2011 we took an extra step by formally adopting a new socially responsible
                                   investment sri policy which codified our thinking and approach to investing

                                   we started this process several years ago with simple improvements specific to our environmental commitment  such as
                                   installing more efficient light bulbs  that combined make a substantial difference we worked with our partners to develop
                                   standards that would be beneficial to our investors tenants and the environment and we focused staff on the goal of
                                   improving our sustainability effort each year

                                   but small successes create larger aspirations for example a year ago we challenged ourselves to demonstrate 50 million

                                   be to show marginal improvement that is why our most important achievement to date might be hard to see or quantify

efficient use of resources such as energy and water and reducing                 after giving careful thought to sustainabilitys potential to add value
waste is a key component of sustainability these efficiencies drive cost        to our portfolios in the fall of 2010 we implemented the 50 million
reductions that improve net operating income thereby adding value to            challenge in 2011 we added value through all three strategies of
business and real estate alike this is particularly true within some property   efficiency solar roof leases and tenant retention the following chart
types in the us as demonstrated by the chart on this page however in         provides a breakdown of our valueadd proposition
many markets outside the us market conditions may make it difficult to
capitalize on efficiency see case study page 23

stability
by producing lower energy costs for tenants solar leases provide
incentives for tenants to remain in those buildings in addition to reduced
operating costs many tenants are inclined to lease space within a green
building green buildings tend to be more efficient provide a higher level
of indoor environmental quality and align with many tenants corporate
missions repositioning a standard building to a green building can
add value in the right situation see case study page 22


resiliency
we have identified markets in which we can lease unused space such
as empty rooftops to developers who install solar photovoltaic panels
the panels produce electricity that can be sold to the electrical grid
the buildings tenants or to prei for common area energy use the leases
create new incremental rent for the asset a means to produce energy
for the solar developer discounted energy costs for some of our tenants

solar roof leases  united states
2011 was a tumultuous year in the fledgling solar photovoltaic sector as a re
sult of price volatility and uncertainty about the direction of regulations and
government policy whats more the direction and future value of solar
renewable energy credits srecs in the us remains unclear

because our roof leases typically have a 20year term we worked with our
solar developers where possible to extend our roof warranties andor nego
tiated with them to provide the necessary capital to install new roofs add
ing significant value to the asset in all cases tenants benefit from reduced
energy costs helping to retain tenants and further stabilize our assets

evaluating global application of a multitier approach in which risks
are evaluated before an asset is acquired and then on an ongoing
basis as we manage the asset

the preacquisition criteria include the evaluation of risks we have
regularly investigated for years such as floods and severe weather
the criteria for ongoing evaluation will include regulatory risk and
a review of risk trends together the ownership cycle of real es
tate and the evaluation of risks related to climate change will run
parallel courses

tools we have used to date include the us environmental protection
agencys energy star portfolio manager the uli greenprint center for

industrial bioclimatic study mexico
sustainability principles can be applied to all buildings types including in
dustrial properties in 2011 we closely examined one such development
project through the use of a bioclimatic study the aim of the study was to
identify sustainable design decisions and recommendations to make the
project as energy efficient and cost effective as possible while reducing
the buildings environmental impact

a bioclimatic study identifies a buildings characteristics and attributes such
as solar exposure control of natural daylight and percentages of applied
materials to create a lighting and thermal balance within the building the
data from the study allowed the design team to intelligently respond to the
local climate conditions in this case conditions in ramos arizpe mexico

translucent wall panels were recommended to provide more natural light
into the building reducing the lighting demand by up to 80 by thought
fully locating the translucent panels impact on the cooling load was mini
mized in contrast had conventional design practices been used lighting
alone was estimated to consume more than half of the total energy in
fact the bioclimatic study identified opportunities to create an energy
savings of up to 43 the equivalent of us35000 per year in this case
co2 emissions were also calculated to be reduced by 43 a year through
the use of bioclimatic design principles

although many industrial buildings may be similar in nature certain vari
ables may differ such as local climate architectural characteristics and                                           solar analysis

energy savings and carbon reductions  europe
in 2009 we created a pilot portfolio of 25 properties in 13 european coun
tries to initiate a series of sustainability initiatives designed to reduce en
ergy consumption operating costs and carbon emissions after collecting
energy consumption data we created a benchmark of existing perfor
mance for each building followed by a multiyear sustainability road map
for each property starting with lowcost quick payback opportunities

typical building improvements included
   improvements by implementation of green audit initiatives at the
		 property level resulting in improved building performance
   consistent application of the ssogs led to more efficient
		 building operations

the energy consumption data from 2009 2010 and 2011 demonstrat
ed strong progress in energy savings and carbon emission reductions
surpassing our original expectations

vative example of sustainability completed in 2010 the building has
earned many awards including a 6star green star office design
and as built rating from the green building council of australia it
also has earned the highest possible 5star rating from the national
australian built environment rating system nabers

signed to bring in 100 of its nonpotable water from innovative
sources such as
    rainwater recycling for cooling towers
    graywater harvesting for use in toilets
    stormwater collection for irrigating the landscape

energy is also addressed in an innovative manner a trigeneration
energy plant using a gasfired generating system produces much of
the buildings power supply waste heat from the power generation
provides energy to the mechanical system this integrated system is
designed to produce greenhouse gas ghg emissions of only 40 kg
co2m2 more than 80 less than the 2010 greenprint average for
air conditioned buildings see the related story on page 14

energy efficiency and low water use reduce operating costs which
helps to keep tenant costs low but tenants are not the only stake

agency in a market which due to the economic crisis had a very high

sions were a critical issue to the tenant prior to the start of lease renewal
negotiations providing a low carbon solution was essential to retain the
tenant and keep the property stabilized

cost of refurbishment vs cost of a new tenant
after reviewing the costbenefit analysis of several scenarios the decision
was made to move forward on a us11 million energy efficiency upgrade

low carbon upgrades to the building included
   installing new boilers                                                                                                    den haag

nearing the end of their useful life in 2011 our asia retail mall
fund which has owned the mall since 2002 hired a consultant to
audit the propertys systems and recommend measures to improve
energy efficiency


areas addressed by the consultant include energy calculation systems
operations air conditioning indoor air quality temperature humidity
and ventillation all in relation to meeting the singapore building and
construction authoritys bca green mark standards
                                                                            atrium tiong bahru plaza

bhp tower krakow poland
as a result of its commitment to sustainability and green building
operations the local property management team in krakow
poland implemented the ssogs to guide the following measures to
lower the energy consumption operating costs and environmental
footprint of the bhp tower

   procured power through a third party
   replaced less efficient system components to reduce costs and
		 energy consumption
   reduced operating hours of the mechanical system by
		 leveraging technology of the building management system
		 bms to minimize the energy intensity
   installed daylight sensors and a link to tenants work schedules
		 to reduce exterior lighting hours
   improved lighting efficiency by installing led light fixtures in
		 common areas
   installed environmentally friendly refrigerants by replacing freon
		 22 with an hfc refrigerant
   introduced bins for sorting waste to improve waste separation
		 along with tenant education to divert 80 of waste from landfills

these combined measures have produced an estimated annual
savings of more than us26600 in the operating and maintenance
costs the sustainability investment of us26200 resulted in a simple
payback in one year the sustainability measures deployed at the bhp                               bhp tower
