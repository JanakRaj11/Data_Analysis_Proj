lynas corporation limited  2015 annual report                                  1

letter from the chairman

             i am pleased to be addressing you our shareholders in the
             first annual report since i was appointed as nonexecutive
             chairman of the lynas board in january
             in the last year lynas has achieved significant milestones greatly improved business
             performance and created exciting opportunities for growth within the rare earths market
             in lynas second full year of production 8799 tonnes of rare earth oxides was
             produced up from 3965 tonnes last financial year q1 fy16 production output is
             expected to exceed 3000 tonnes this result is testament to the strong leadership of
             our ceo amanda lacaze and the hard work of each member of the lynas team the
             team resolved issues associated with the cracking and leaching and solvent extraction
             processes earlier this year and we are now producing at a stable and consistent rate
             lynas has a strong continuous improvement culture in the past year we have created
             a stable operating platform and reinforced the balance sheet the current dynamics of
             the global rare earths market are our next challenge market prices decreased during
             fy15 and the continuing uncertainty of chinese government policy meant many
             customers were satisfied to consume inventories rather than purchase fresh product
             growing demand in target segments is our current focus
             rare earths are an important functional material crucial to the delivery of key product
             benefits that we all value as consumers we are developing and strengthening lynas
             relationships with customers in key sectors such as the global automotive market
             and energy efficient consumer products these relationships are important as we see
             engineers and designers respond to consumer demand and look to ways to create
             functionality in products that can best be achieved using rare earths
             one of the difficulties with the rare earths market is that it is marked by speculative
             activity in all stages of the value chain whilst we expect a level of uncertainty in the
             market to continue in the near term we remain focused on becoming the strongest
             performing company within the rare earths sector our full year results reflect lynas
             determination to build a company whose valuation is based on performance rather
             than speculation
             in the last year the rare earths industry has also experienced a number of changes
             the chinese tax regime is now relatively clear and export taxes are gone which should
             improve the competitiveness of the magnet supply chains outside of china and
             ultimately that should be good for lynas
             ideally the healthiest markets are ones where there are many suppliers who are healthy
             and capable as many of you would have seen molycorp the only rare earth miner and
             producer outside of china apart from lynas recently filed for chapter 11 in the usa
             and announced the closure of its mountain pass mining and processing facility

it is our                                    the presence of lynas as a competitor in the rare earths market is important to the
                                                 health of the global rare earths industry the current volatility in the market has the
commitment that                                  effect of limiting demand as end users respond to a perception of uncertainty regarding
                                                 both supply and pricing lynas competitive presence is good for every participant in
lynas will continue                              the rare earths industry particularly end users who can be confident in formulating rare
                                                 earths into their products knowing that lynas will continue to offer an environmentally

and efficiently for                              in june this year lynas also welcomed the report by the international atomic energy
                                                 agency iaea which confirmed that the radiological risks to the public and envi
its staff and the                                ronment at the lynas advanced materials plant lamp are intrinsically low it is our

communities and                                  the communities and environments in which we operate
                                                 one of our most significant announcements was made in august this year when lynas
environments in                                  reached a new longterm debt structure agreement with our strategic debt providers
                                                 jare and the mt kellett led group of bondholders the new structure strengthens the

                                                 recent initiatives to position lynas as a sustainable and financially viable business
                                                 i would like to thank each member of the lynas team for their efforts this last year

             transitioned from project status to a fully operational
             business delivering improved and improving results on all
             key business measures production capability has improved
             and stabilised sales revenue has grown costs have been
             reduced and new debt agreements have been reached
             which underpin ongoing operations

             the business with careful and disciplined management this included underperformance in
             production efficiency revenue market share and cost structure i am pleased to say that
             in the last year lynas has successfully completed change programs in all of these areas
             a number of notable achievements include
                 positive free cashflow for the june quarter a first in the history of lynas
                 much improved production output which is now stable and at target rates
                 healthy revenue growth achieved by building strong relationships with key
                   customers particularly in the japanese market
                 resetting the companys cost base with annualised savings in excess of

                 new improved contracts with many of our key suppliers one important
                   example of this is the agreement with our major chemical supplier which has

factors and business risks that affect future performance
lynas operates in a changing environment and is therefore subject to factors and business risks that will affect future performance
the following factors and business risks could have a material effect on lynas future results from an operations and financial position

rare earth prices
lynas sales performance is affected by market fluctuations in rare earth prices this is because the product prices used in the majority of
lynas sales are calculated by a pricing formula that is tied to average rare earth market prices in the previous calendar quarter the market
price has been volatile in the past because it is influenced by numerous factors and events that are beyond the control of lynas

directors report




these include
     i       production capacity
               for most rare earth products global capacity for rare earth production including illegal operations in china currently exceeds
               global demand
     ii      fluctuations in demand
               a key factor influencing rare earth demand is automotive market demand both in terms of production quantity and technology
               incorporated in the vehicles manufactured energyefficient hybridelectrical green emission controlled and luxury vehicles
               require significantly more rare earth materials during the manufacturing process than basic motor vehicles the market price of
               rare earth is influenced by rare earth market traders expectations of the demand for energyefficient green and luxury vehicles as
               opposed to actual daily demand for those vehicles
     iii     chinese government regulations
               china currently supplies around 90 of the global rare earths and china represents around 60 of the global demand that has
               enabled china to encourage many downstream activities to relocate into china as an example chinese regulators previously
               enforced quotas and taxes on rare earth exports in fy15 chinese regulators removed regulations on export quotas and export
               taxes and introduced new resource and production taxes the net effect has been a reduction in taxes on rare earths produced in
               china and a reduction in realised prices outside of china

the table below includes the published rare earth market price over a 3year period and illustrates its volatility it also calculates the possible
impact on lynas aggregate market price

lynas approach to reduce pricing volatility for its customers includes
      promoting fixed pricing to its direct customers set for periods relevant to customer operations
      developing long term contracts that include clauses that aim to reduce price variations for end users such as car makers and wind
        turbine manufacturers

exchange rates
lynas is exposed to fluctuations in the us dollar as all sales are denominated in us dollars the company borrows money and holds a portion
of cash in us dollars which provides a partial natural hedge
accordingly lynas income from and the value of its business will be affected by fluctuations in the rates by which the us dollar is
exchanged with australian dollars

b our remuneration philosophy
the groups objective is to provide maximum stakeholder benefit by attracting retaining and motivating a high quality board of directors
and executive management team remunerating directors and executives fairly and appropriately consistent with relevant employment
market conditions is an important part of achieving this goal we align rewards to sustainable value through creating links between the
achievement of organisational goals both long and short term in nature with the nonfixed elements of individual remuneration
to help the group achieve this objective the committee links the nature and amount of the remuneration paid to the executives to the
groups financial and operational performance
total remuneration that is fixed remuneration plus sti and lti is paid at market rates except in exceptional cases where skills are scarce or
particularly valuable in which case we pay as necessary our market is defined by location and function ie malaysia wa resources and the
global rare earths market
sti awards which create an at risk component are equal to approximately 50 of total fixed remuneration for senior executives with 25
paid in cash and 25 paid in performance rights
lti awards for senior executives with tsr and operating milestone performance hurdles equal to approximately 25 of total fixed remunera
tion for senior executives and 50 of total fixed remuneration for the chief executive officer

external advisors and remuneration advice
the committee engages external advisors to provide advice and market related information as required
    during the year the committee did not receive any remuneration recommendations as defined in the corporations act 2001



c role of the nomination remuneration and community committee
the board is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for directors and executives the committee assesses
on a regular basis the appropriateness of the nature and amount of kmp remuneration in fulfilling these duties and to support effective
governance processes the committee
    consists of a majority of independent nonexecutive directors and is chaired by an independent chair
    has unrestricted access to management and any relevant documents and
    engages external advisers for assistance to the extent appropriate and necessary eg detailing market levels of remuneration

d      our executive remuneration framework
objective
the group aims to remunerate its executives at a level commensurate with their position and responsibilities within the group so as to
    reward them for the group business unit and individual performance against agreed targets set by reference to appropriate
      benchmarks
    align their interests with those of our shareholders
    link their reward with the groups strategic goals and performance and
    provide total remuneration that is competitive by market standards

structure
executive remuneration consists of the following key elements
    fixed pay base salary and superannuation and
    variable remuneration being
       sti and
        lti

the group provides no retirement benefits other than statutory superannuation

fixed pay
fixed pay consists of base salary and superannuation it is determined on an individual basis taking into account external market benchmarks
and individual factors such as capability experience responsibility and accountability fixed pay is targeted at market rates in the geographic
and functional markets in which we operate

variable remuneration
notwithstanding the introduction of a formal sti plan the board retains ultimate discretion in relation to the payment of bonuses options
performance rights and other incentive payments based on the overall performance of the group and of the individual during the year
in summary


                 fixed pay                              variable remuneration
                  base  super                          sti cash and deferred  lti



stis
prior to june 30 2012 the board had a discretionary sti policy used to reward exceptional performance however with effect from july
1 2012 the board decided that a move towards a formalised sti policy was appropriate the introduction of a formal sti plan resulted
in an adjustment of remuneration mix of fixed pay and variable remuneration rather than an increase in total remuneration received by
executives
our target sti for executives is 50 of fixed pay
the goals and measures of the sti programme including individual team and company performance goals and measures the relative
weightings of those measures and goals and sti target amounts are determined and approved at the commencement of each review period by
the remuneration committee during the financial year ended june 30 2015 the measures were drafted with reference to the following goals
    corporate operating cashflow operating margin
    team health  safety of employees raw water consumption yield smp and recovery
    individual performance rating

the payment of any award under the sti programme is subject to the group achieving operating cashflow that is at or better than budgeted
operating cashflow sti gateway the sti gateway was not satisfied during the financial year ended june 30 2015 the below table shows
which of the individual sti goals were achieved during the financial year ended june 30 2015

ex gratia award at the end of fy15
notwithstanding that the sti gateway for fy15 was not satisfied the board concluded after the end of fy15 that it was appropriate to make
an ex gratia award to selected senior executives in recognition of recent achievements and as part of the groups retention policies
in approving the awards the executives contributions to the following key performance areas were assessed
     a improved production rates
     b decreased costs
     c cash performance
     d the debt rescheduling

recognizing the importance of cash conservation the award to senior executives was approved as an award of performance rights the award
is in an amount equal to approximately 15 of total fixed remuneration
the performance rights will vest after 1 year of service with no other vesting conditions the performance rights will be valued based on the
5 day vwap at the date of the boards decision to approve the award being july 28 2015

ltis

f       linking remuneration and group performance
prior to the financial year ended june 30 2011 kmp remuneration including any component that consisted of securities in the group was
not formally linked to group performance the reason behind this approach was that as the group was in a development phase it was not
appropriate to link remuneration to factors such as profitability or share price this approach has changed now that the group is transitioning
into its operational phase
      in the financial year ended june 30 2011 50 of the lti grant was subject to the achievement of a net positive operating cash flow
        hurdle for the six months ending december 31 2012 that hurdle was not satisfied
      in the financial year ended june 30 2012 lti grants were subject to a tsr hurdle and to project milestone hurdles related to reo
        capacity those hurdles were not satisfied
      in the financial year ended june 30 2013 lti grants were also subject to a tsr hurdle and to project milestone hurdles related to reo
        capacity the project milestone hurdles were not satisfied the reference period for the tsr hurdle has not yet expired
      in the financial year ended june 30 2014 lti grants were also subject to a tsr hurdle and to project milestone hurdles related to
        consistency of production  right first time the reference period for these hurdles has not yet expired
      in the financial year ended june 30 2015 lti grants were also subject to a tsr hurdle and to project milestone hurdles related to
        consistency of production  right first time as detailed in section d above the reference period for these hurdles has not yet expired

individual performance reviews link total remuneration to individual and business unit performance from july 1 2012 the mix of fixed pay
and variable remuneration has been adjusted by the introduction of a formal sti plan the introduction of the sti plan reflects the transition
of the group from a development phase to an operational phase and it recognises that we have important short term goals based on

no dividends have been paid in the past and so it is not appropriate to estimate future possible dividends in arriving at the fair values the

necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur

c    heldtomaturity investments
heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the
group has the positive intention to hold to maturity subsequent to initial recognition heldtomaturity investments are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses
the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and allocating the interest over the
relevant years the effective interest method results in an interest rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts over
the expected life of the financial instrument or where appropriate a shorter period to the net amount of the financial instrument

d availableforsale financial assets
availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the
other categories they are included in noncurrent assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the
reporting date
availableforsale financial assets are measured at fair value on initial recognition plus transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition
the assets are measured at fair value and changes therein other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on availa
bleforsale monetary items are recognised directly in equity when an investment is derecognised the cumulative gain or loss in equity is
transferred to the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss

e other liabilities
other liabilities comprise all nonderivative financial liabilities that are not disclosed as liabilities at fair value through profit or loss other
liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12
months after the reporting date the groups other liabilities comprise trade and other payables and interest bearing borrowings including
compound instruments and those with related parties the groups other liabilities are measured as follows

i    trade and other payables
       subsequent to initial recognition trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method

ii   interest bearing borrowings including related party borrowings
	subsequent to initial recognition interest bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
  method

f    compound financial instruments
compound financial instruments issued by the group comprise convertible notes that can be converted to share capital at the option of the
holder with the number of shares to be issued being fixed
the liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar financial liability that does not
have the equity conversion option the equity component is recognised initially as the difference between the fair value of the compound
financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the financial liability component any directly attributable transaction costs are then
allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts
subsequent to the initial recognition the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method the equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition
interest related to the financial liability is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss on
conversion the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income


34 derivative financial instruments
a derivative financial instrument is recognised if the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of an instrument at the trade date
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value which includes where applicable consideration of credit risk with
transaction costs being expensed as incurred subsequent to initial recognition derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value
the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit
or loss unless the derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting where a derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge
accounting recognition of any resulting gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship see further
derivative financial instruments are recognised on a gross basis unless a current and legally enforceable right to offset exists
derivative financial assets are derecognised if the groups contractual right to the cash flows from the instrument expire or if the group
transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset
derivative financial liabilities are derecognised if the groups obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled

a cash flow hedges
changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly in equity as a compo
nent of other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective to the extent that the hedge is ineffective changes in fair
value are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss for the year

3 summary of significant accounting policies continued

if a hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or it expires is sold terminated or exercised then hedge
accounting is discontinued prospectively at this point in time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until
the forecast transaction occurs when the hedged item is a nonfinancial asset the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying
amount of the asset when it is recognised in all other cases the amount recognised in equity is transferred within the statement of compre
hensive income in the same year that the hedged item affects this statement and is recognised as part of financial income or expenses if the
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred within
the statement of comprehensive income and is recognised as part of financial income or expenses in the profit or loss

b fair value hedges
changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument designated as a fair value hedge are recognised in the statement of comprehen
sive income as a component of the profit or loss in financial income or expenses together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged
assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk

c     embedded derivatives
embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the following conditions are met
      the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related
      a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative and
      the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss

at the time of initial recognition of the embedded derivative an equal adjustment is also recognised against the host contract the adjust
ment against the host contract is amortised over the remaining life of the host contract using the effective interest method
any embedded derivatives that are separated are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised through net financial expense
in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss


35 inventories
a raw materials work in progress and finished goods
inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value the cost of inventories is based either on the first in first out fifo
or weighted average principles and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location
and condition in the case of manufactured or refined inventories and work in progress cost includes an appropriate share of production
overheads based on normal operating capacity net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses inventory expected to be sold or consumed within the next 12 months is classified as
current with amounts expected to be consumed or sold after this time being classified as noncurrent

b engineering and maintenance materials
engineering and maintenance materials representing either critical or long order components but excluding rotable spares are measured at
the lower of cost and net realisable value the cost of these inventories is based on the weighted average principle and includes expenditure
incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition net realisable value is determined with
reference to the cost of replacement of such items in the ordinary course of business compared to the current market prices


36 property plant and equipment
a recognition and measurement
items of property plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any
cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset the cost of property plant and equipment acquired in
a business combination is determined by reference to its fair value at the date of acquisition the cost of selfconstructed assets includes the
cost of materials and direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use
cost may also include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property
plant and equipment purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of the cost of
that equipment

b assets under construction
assets under construction are transferred to the appropriate asset category when they are ready for their intended use assets under
construction are not depreciated but tested for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication of impairment




54                                                                                                                                wwwlynascorpcom

c    borrowing costs
borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an item of property plant and equipment are capitalised until such
time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use the interest rate used equates to the effective interest on debt where general
borrowings are used or the relevant interest rate where specific borrowings are used to finance the construction

d subsequent costs
the cost of replacing part of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that
the future economic benefits embodied within that part will flow to the group and its cost can be measured reliably the carrying amount of
the replaced part is derecognised the costs of the daytoday servicing of property plant and equipment are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss as incurred

e depreciation
depreciation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss or capitalised as a component
of inventory in the statement of financial position which is subsequently released to the profit or loss through the cost of goods sold on
the sale of the underlying product using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits embodied within the asset are
consumed generally this is on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of each part or component of an item of property plant and
equipment
the estimated useful lives for the material classes of property plant and equipment are as follows
leasehold land                       30 to 99 years                     buildings                    5 to 30 years
plant and equipment                  2 to 30 years                      fixtures and fittings        2 to 15 years
leasehold improvements               15 to 30 years                     motor vehicles               8 years
depreciation methods useful lives and residual values are reassessed on an annual basis
gains and losses on the disposal of items of property plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds if any at the time of
disposal with the net carrying amount of the asset


37 mineral exploration evaluation and development expenditure
a exploration and evaluation expenditure
exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of interest exploration and evaluation
expenditure includes
    researching and analysing historical exploration data
    gathering exploration data through topographical geochemical and geophysical studies
    exploratory drilling trenching and sampling
    determining and examining the volume and grade of the mineral resource
    surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements
    conducting market and finance studies
    administration costs that are directly attributable to a specific exploration area and
    licensing costs

these costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area of
interest or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of
economically recoverable reserves
a regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to
that area of interest accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area of interest are written off in full in the statement of comprehensive
income as a component of the profit or loss in the period in which the decision to abandon the area is made

b development expenditure
once an area of interest has been established as commercially viable and technically feasible expenditure other than that relating to land build
ings and plant and equipment is capitalised as development expenditure development expenditure includes previously capitalised exploration
and evaluation expenditure preproduction development expenditure and other subsurface expenditure pertaining to that area of interest costs
related to surface plant and equipment and any associated land and buildings are accounted for as property plant and equipment
development costs are accumulated in respect of each separate area of interest costs associated with commissioning new assets in the
period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management are capitalised development costs incurred after the
commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit
when an area of interest is abandoned or the directors decide that it is not commercially viable or technically feasible any accumulated
costs in respect of that area are written off in full in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss in the
period in which the decision to abandon the area is made to the extent that they will not be recoverable in the future

3 summary of significant accounting policies continued

development assets are assessed for impairment if the facts and circumstance suggest that the carrying amount exceed the recoverable
amount for the purpose of impairment testing development assets are allocated to the cashgenerating units cgus to which the
development activity relates

c    deferred stripping
overburden and other mine waste materials are often removed during the initial development of a mine in order to access the mineral
deposit this activity is referred to as development or preproduction stripping the directly attributable costs associated with these activities
are capitalised as a component of development costs capitalisation of development stripping ceases and amortisation of those capitalised
costs commences upon extraction of ore amortisation of capitalised development stripping costs occurs on a straight line basis with
reference to the life of mine of the relevant area of interest
removal of waste material normally continues through the life of a mine this activity is referred to as production stripping and commences
upon the extraction of ore

d amortisation of development
amortisation of development is recognised either in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss or
capitalised as a component of inventory in the statement of financial position which is subsequently released to the profit or loss through
the cost of goods sold on the sale of the underlying product on a units of production basis which aims to recognise cost proportionally to
the depletion of the economically recoverable mineral resources costs are amortised from the commencement of commercial production


38 intangible assets
a research and development
expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technological knowledge and understanding
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss as incurred
development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes development
expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably the product or process is technologically and commercially
feasible future economic benefits are probable and the group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use
or sell the asset the expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials direct labour and overhead costs that are directly attributable
to preparing the asset for its intended use other development expenditure is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of the profit or loss as incurred
intangible assets arising from development activities are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses if any

b other intangible assets
other intangible assets comprise internally developed software which is capitalised in accordance with the groups policy in respect of
research and development as outlined at note 38a other intangible assets have finite useful lives and are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses if any

c    subsequent expenditure
subsequent expenditure in respect of intangible assets is capitalised only when the expenditure increases the future economic benefits
embodied in the specific asset to which the expenditure relates and it can be reliably measured all other expenditure including expenditure
on internally generated goodwill and other intangibles is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit
or loss as incurred

d amortisation
amortisation is recognised in either the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss or capitalised as a
component of inventory in the statement of financial position which is subsequently released to the profit or loss through the cost of goods
sold on the sale of the underlying product on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill
and indefinite life trademarks from the date that the intangible assets are available for use the estimated useful lives for the material classes
of intangible assets are as follows
softwaretechnology  4 to 5 years


39 impairment
the carrying amounts of the groups assets are reviewed regularly and at least annually to determine whether there is any objective
evidence of impairment an impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount
impairment losses directly reduce the carrying amount of assets and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of the profit or loss


56                                                                                                                                wwwlynascorpcom

a impairment of loans and receivables and heldtomaturity financial assets
the recoverable amount of the groups loans and receivables and heldtomaturity financial assets carried at amortised cost is calculated
with reference to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate ie the effective
interest rate computed at the date of initial recognition of these financial assets receivables with a short duration are not discounted
impairment losses on individual instruments that are considered significant are determined on an individual basis through an evaluation
of the specific instruments exposures for trade receivables which are not significant on an individual basis impairment is assessed on a
portfolio basis taking into consideration the number of days overdue and the historical loss experiences on a portfolio with a similar number
of days overdue
the criteria that the group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include
    significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor
    a breach of contract such as default or delinquency in respect of interest or principal repayment or
    observable data indicating that there is a measureable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio

b nonfinancial assets
the carrying amounts of the groups nonfinancial assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment if any such indicators exist then the asset or cgus recoverable amount is estimated for goodwill and intangible assets that
have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use recoverable amounts are estimated at least annually and whenever there is an
indication that they may be impaired
an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cgu exceeds its recoverable amount a cgu is the smallest iden
tifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups impairment losses are recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss impairment losses recognised in respect of a cgu are allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cgu and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other nonfinancial
assets in the cgu on a prorata basis
the recoverable amount of an asset or cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell in assessing the value in use
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu in assessing the fair value less cost to sell the company uses a variety
of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date the methods used to determine
fair value include a discounted future cash flow analysis and adjusted ebitda forecasted multiplied by a relevant market indexed multiple
in respect of assets other than goodwill impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed at each reporting date for any indications
that the loss has decreased or no longer exists an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine
the recoverable amount an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets revised carrying amount will not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised


310	  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale
assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through
continuing use are classified as held for sale immediately before classification as held for sale the assets or components of a disposal
group are remeasured in accordance with the groups accounting policies thereafter the assets or disposal groups are measured at the
lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell upon reclassification the group ceases to depreciate or amortise noncurrent
assets classified as held for sale any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill and then to the remaining assets on a
prorata basis except that no loss is allocated to inventories financial assets deferred tax assets or employee benefit assets which continue
to be measured in accordance with the groups accounting policies impairment losses incurred on the initial classification as being held for
sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the
profit or loss gains are not recognised in excess of any prior cumulative impairment loss


311      employee benefits
a pension and superannuation obligations
a defined contribution pension and superannuation plan is a plan under which the employee and the group pay fixed contributions to a
separate entity the group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions in relation to an employees service in the
current and prior years the contributions are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss as
and when they fall due

b shortterm employee benefits
shortterm employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of the profit or loss as the related services are provided a provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under
shortterm cash bonus plans and outstanding annual leave balances if the group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past services provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably




lynas corporation limited  2015 annual report                                                                                                   57

3 summary of significant accounting policies continued

c    other longterm employee benefits
the liability for long service leave for which settlement can be deferred beyond 12 months from the balance date is measured as the present
value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees consideration is given to expected future wage
and salary levels experience of employee departures and periods of service expected future payments are discounted using market yields
at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match as closely as possible the estimated
future cash outflows

d termination benefits
termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the group is demonstrably committed without realistic possibility of withdrawal
to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are
recognised if the group has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy it is probable that the offer will be accepted and the number of
acceptances can be estimated reliably

e incentive compensation plans
the group recognises a liability and associated expense for incentive compensation plans based on a formula that takes into consideration
certain threshold targets and the associated measures of profitability the group recognises a provision when it is contractually obligated or
when there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation to its employees


312       provisions
a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
liability where discounting is used the increase in the provision for the passage of time is recognised as a financial expense in the statement
of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss

a warranties
a provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold the provision is based on historical warranty data
and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities

b business closure and rationalisation
a provision for business closure and rationalisation is recognised when the group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and
the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced future operating costs are not provided for

c    rehabilitation
the miningextraction and refiningprocessing activities of the group give rise to obligations for asset and site rehabilitation rehabilitation
obligations can include facility decommissioning and dismantling removal or treatment of waste materials land rehabilitation and site
restoration the extent of work required and the associated costs are estimated based on feasibility and engineering studies using current
restoration standards and techniques provisions for the cost of each rehabilitation programme are recognised at the time that the environ
mental disturbance occurs
rehabilitation provisions are initially measured at the expected value of future cash flows required to rehabilitate the relevant site
discounted to their present value the value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds when
provisions for rehabilitation are initially recognised the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset representing part of the cost of acquiring
the future economic benefits of the operation the capitalised cost of rehabilitation activities for the groups mining operations is recognised
as a component of development expenditure whereas those relating to its refining operations are recognised as a component of either
buildings or plant and equipment amounts capitalised are depreciated or amortised accordingly
where rehabilitation is expected to be conducted systematically over the life of the operation rather than at the time of closure a provision
is made for the present obligation or estimated outstanding continuous rehabilitation work at each balance sheet date with the costs
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss in line with the remaining future cash flows
at each reporting date the rehabilitation liability is remeasured to account for any new disturbance updated cost estimates changes to
the estimated lives of the associated operations new regulatory requirements and revisions to discount rates changes to the rehabilitation
liability are added or deducted from the related rehabilitation asset and amortised accordingly

d onerous contracts
present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions an onerous contract is considered to exist
where the group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic
benefits expected to be received from the contract




58                                                                                                                                 wwwlynascorpcom

313      royalties
royalties are treated as taxation arrangements when they have the characteristics of a tax this is considered to be the case when they are
imposed under government authority and the amount payable is calculated by reference to revenue derived net of any allowable deduc
tions after adjustment for temporary differences for such arrangements current and deferred tax is provided on the same basis as described
in note 320a for other forms of taxation obligations arising from royalty arrangements that do not satisfy these criteria are recognised as
current provisions as outlined in note 312 and included as part of the cost of goods sold in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of profit or loss


314      dividends
dividends to the groups shareholders are recognised as a liability in the groups statement of financial position in the period in which the
dividends are declared


315      share capital
ordinary shares are classified as equity costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the
proceeds
where equity instruments are reacquired by the group for example as a result of a share buyback those instruments are deducted from
equity and the associated shares are cancelled no gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and the considera
tion paid including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is directly recognised in equity


316      sharebased payment
sharebased remuneration benefits are provided to employees via a variety of schemes which are further set out in note 31
the fair values of the options granted under these various schemes are recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding
increase in equity the fair value is measured at the grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become
unconditionally entitled to the options
the fair value at grant date is independently determined using an option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price the term of
the option the impact of dilution the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share the expected dividend
yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option
the fair value of the options granted is measured to reflect the expected market vesting conditions but excludes the impact of any
nonmarket vesting conditions for example profitability and production targets nonmarket vesting conditions are included in assumptions
about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable at the end of each reporting period the group revises its estimates of
the number of options that are expected to become exercisable the employee benefits expense recognised each period takes into account
the most recent estimate the impact of the revision to original estimates if any is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as
a component of profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity


317      revenue
a sale of goods
revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of sales commissions returns and
allowances trade discounts volume rebates and other customer incentives revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of
ownership have been substantially transferred to the buyer recovery of the consideration is probable the associated costs and possible return
of goods can be estimated reliably and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods
transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale

b government grants
government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the group will comply with the
conditions associated with the grant grants that compensate the group for an item which is to be expensed are recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income on a systematic basis in the same years in which the expenses are recognised or for expenses already incurred
the grants are recognised in the year in which they become receivable grants that compensate the group for the cost of purchasing
constructing or otherwise acquiring a longterm asset are recognised as a reduction in the cost of that asset and included in the statement
of comprehensive income as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with the groups depreciation policy

c    dividend income
dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established

d royalties
royalty revenue is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement provided that it is probable
that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably royalties determined on a time
basis are recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the agreement royalty arrangements that are based on production sales and
other measures are recognised by reference to the underlying arrangement

318       lease payments
minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the outstanding
liability the finance charges which are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss are
allocated to each year during the lease term so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability contingent
lease payments are accounted for in the years in which the payments are incurred
payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss on
a straightline basis over the term of the lease except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which
economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed contingent lease payments arising under operating leases are recognised as an
expense in the year in which the payments are incurred
in the event that lease incentives are received to enter into an operating lease such incentives are deferred and recognised as a liability the
aggregated benefits of the lease incentives are recognised as a reduction to the lease expenses on a straightline basis except where another
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed


319       financial income and expenses
financial income comprises interest income foreign currency gains and gains on derivative financial instruments in respect of financing
activities that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss interest income is recognised
as it accrues using the effective interest method
financial expenses comprise interest expense foreign currency losses impairment losses recognised on financial assets except for trade
receivables and losses in respect of financing activities on derivative instruments that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income as a component of the profit or loss all borrowing costs not qualifying for capitalisation are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss using the effective interest method


320       income tax
a income tax
income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax income tax expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of the profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income in
which case it is recognised with the associated items on a net basis
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting
date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years
deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method of providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the carrying amounts for taxation purposes deferred tax is not recognised for the
following temporary differences the initial recognition of goodwill the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not
a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and
jointly controlled entities to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future and the group is in a position to control
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the
temporary differences when they reverse based on the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date
a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised
additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time the liability to pay the related dividend
is recognised deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the same jurisdiction are offset in the statement of financial position only to the
extent that there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred balances relate to taxes
levied by the same taxing authority and are expected either to be settled on a net basis or realised simultaneously

b tax consolidation
the company and its whollyowned australian resident entities have formed a taxconsolidated group with effect from july 1 2002 and are
therefore taxed as a single entity from that date the head entity within the taxconsolidated group is lynas corporation limited current tax
liabilities and assets and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and relevant tax credits of the members of the taxconsolidated
group are recognised by the company as head entity in the taxconsolidated group
entities within the taxconsolidated group have entered into a tax sharing agreement with the company the tax sharing agreement entered
into between members of the taxconsolidated group provides for the determination of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the
entities should the company default on its tax payment obligations or if an entity should leave the taxconsolidated group
the effect of the tax sharing agreement is that each members liability for tax payable by the taxconsolidated group is limited to the
amount payable to the head entity under the tax funding arrangement

321       sales tax value added tax and goods and services tax
all amounts including cash flows are shown exclusive of sales tax value added tax vat and goods and services tax gst to the extent
the taxes are reclaimable except for receivables and payables that are stated inclusive of sales tax vat and gst


322       leases
leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee all other leases are classified as operating leases

a the group as lessor  finance leases
amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the groups net investment in the leases

b the group as lessee  finance leases
upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum
lease payments the corresponding liability to the lessor is included within loans and borrowings as a finance lease obligation subsequent to
initial recognition the liability is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy described at note 33f and the asset is accounted
for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset


323       earnings per share
a basic earnings per share
basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the company excluding any costs of
servicing equity other than ordinary shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial period
adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial period

b diluted earnings per share
diluted earnings per share adjusts the amount used in the determination of the basic earnings per share to take into account the after
income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number
of additional shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares potential ordinary
shares are treated as dilutive when and only when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share from continuing
operations


324       segment reporting
the groups operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that are regularly reviewed by
the chief operating decision makers codm in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance

being deducted from the carrying amount of these investments

b effect of tax consolidation

4 critical accounting estimates and assumptions
in the process of applying the groups accounting policies management has made certain estimates and assumptions about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities income and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management has not made any
significant judgements apart from those involving estimations as discussed further the key assumptions concerning the future and other
key sources of uncertainty in respect of estimates at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial reporting period are as listed below




62                                                                                                                                wwwlynascorpcom

41 reserve estimates and mine life
reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the groups mining tenements in order
to calculate reserves estimates and assumptions are required to be formulated about a range of geological technical and economic factors
including quantities grades production techniques recovery rates production costs transportation costs refining costs commodity demand
commodity prices and exchange rates estimating the quantity andor grade of reserves requires the size shape and depth of the ore bodies
or field to be determined by analysing geological data such as drilling samples this process may require complex and difficult geological
judgement and calculation to interpret the data
as the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period and because additional geological data is generated
during the course of operations estimates of reserves may change from period to period changes in reported reserves may affect the
groups financial results and financial position in a number of ways including
    asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in the estimated future cash flows and
    depreciation and amortisation charges in the statement of comprehensive income may change as result of the change in the useful
       economic lives of assets


42 income taxes
the group is subject to income taxes in multiple jurisdictions which require significant judgement to be exercised in determining the groups
provision for income taxes there are a number of transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during
the ordinary course of business current tax liabilities and assets are recognised at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the
taxation authorities


43 realisation of deferred tax assets
the group assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets with reference to estimates of future taxable income to the extent that actual
taxable income differs from managements estimate of future taxable income the value of recognised deferred tax assets may be affected
deferred tax assets have been recognised to offset deferred tax liabilities to the extent that the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected
to be realised in the same jurisdiction and reporting period deferred tax assets have also been recognised based on managements best
estimate of the recoverability of these assets against future taxable income deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the same jurisdiction
are offset in the statement of financial position only to the extent that there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and
current tax liabilities and the deferred balances relate to taxes levied by the same taxing authority and are expected either to be settled on a
net basis or realised simultaneously


44 impairment of nonfinancial assets
impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of its fair
value less costs of disposal and its value in use the fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales
transactions conducted at arms length for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset the value
in use calculation is based on a 25 year discounted cash flow dcf model the cash flows are derived from the three year budget and forecast
model that is extrapolated over 25 years and do not include restructuring activities that the group is not yet committed to or significant future
investments that will enhance the assets performance of the cgu being tested the recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used
for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes
assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable


45 exploration evaluation and development expenditure
the groups accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items of expenditure being capitalised for an area
of interest where it is considered likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or sale or where the activities have not reached a stage which
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves this policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions
as to future events and circumstances in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established any such
estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available if after having capitalised the expenditure under the policy
a judgement is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to the statement of
comprehensive income
development activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management and the board judgement is applied by
management in determining when a project is economically viable in exercising this judgement management is required to make certain
estimates and assumptions similar to those described above for capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure any such estimates and
assumptions may change as new information becomes available if after having commenced the development activity a judgement is made
that a development asset is impaired the appropriate amount will be written off to the statement of comprehensive income


46 restoration and rehabilitation expenditure
the groups accounting policy for its restoration and rehabilitation closure provisions requires significant estimates and assumptions such as
requirements of the relevant legal and regulatory framework the magnitude of possible contamination and the timing extent and costs of



lynas corporation limited  2015 annual report                                                                                                   63

notes to the financial statements continued




4 critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued

required closure and rehabilitation activity these uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently
provided the provision recognised is periodically reviewed and updated based on the facts and circumstances available at the time changes
to the estimated future costs for operating sites are recognised in the statement of financial position by adjusting both the closure and
rehabilitation asset and the provision



5 determination of fair values
a number of the groups accounting policies and associated disclosures require the determination of fair values for both financial and
nonfinancial assets and liabilities fair values have been determined for measurement andor disclosure purposes based on the following
methods where applicable further information regarding the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific
to that asset or liability


51 trade and other receivables
the fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest
at the reporting date given the shortterm nature of trade receivables the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value


52 investments in equity securities
the fair value of investments in listed equity securities is determined by reference to their quoted bid price at the reporting date


53 derivatives
the fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price if available if a listed market price is not available then fair
value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity
of the contract using a riskfree interest rate based on government bonds
the fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes these quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future
cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date
the fair value of commodity and other price derivatives is based on a valuation model the valuation model which includes where relevant
the consideration of credit risk discounts the estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract using forward
curves and market interest rates at the reporting date


54 nonderivative financial liabilities
the fair value of nonderivative financial liabilities which is determined for disclosure purposes is calculated by discounting the future
contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates that are available for similar financial instruments we consider these inputs to be
level 2 fair value measurements as described in note 286



6 segment reporting
aasb 8 operating segments aasb 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of
the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision makers codm in order to allocate resources to the segment and
to assess its performance
at year end the groups codm are the board of directors of the company the chief executive officer the chief financial officer the vp
production and the vp sales  marketing information reported to the groups codm for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment
of performance currently focuses on the operation of the groups integrated rare earth extraction and process facilities
the group has only one reportable segment under aasb 8 being its rare earth operations the codm do not review the business activities
of the group based on geography
the accounting policies applied by this segment are the same as the groups accounting policies results from operating activities represent
the profit earned by this segment without allocation of interest income and expense and income tax benefit expense the codm assess the
performance of the operating segment based on adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is defined as net profit before income tax expense net of
financial expenses depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude certain significant items including but not limited to such items as
employee remuneration settled through sharebased payments restructuring costs unrealised gains or losses on derivatives gains or losses
on the sale of nonstrategic assets asset impairments and write downs

an initial provision of 163 million was established during 2013 in respect of the groups future costs to decommission restore and
rehabilitate the lamp in malaysia these costs arise from the ongoing construction and operation of phase 1 of the lamp the provision was
recognised following the successful commissioning of the phase 1 operations at the lamp during june 2013 subsequent to the commence
ment of commissioning of phase 2 of the lamp in malaysia in the 2014 financial year an independent assessment of site rehabilitation
and restoration was performed which resulted in the group increasing this provision to 275 million upon cessation of operations the site
including the processing assets ancillary facilities utilities and the onsite storage facility will be decommissioned and any materials removed
from the location the group has used third party specialists to assist in estimating these costs and will review these estimates periodically
over time as the operations continue to develop

282       market risk
market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices will affect the
groups cash flows or the fair value of its holdings of financial instruments the objective of market risk management is to manage and
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters

a foreign exchange risk
as a result of the groups international operations foreign exchange risk exposures exist on purchases assets and borrowings that are
denominated in foreign currencies ie currencies other than the functional currency of each of the groups operating entities the currencies
in which these transactions are primarily denominated are the aud usd and the malaysian ringgit myr
the group takes advantage of natural offsets to the extent possible therefore when commercially feasible the group borrows in the same
currencies in which cash flows from operations are generated generally the group does not use forward exchange contracts to hedge
residual foreign exchange risk arising from receipts and payments denominated in foreign currencies however when considered appropriate
the group may enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk arising from specific transactions
the groups primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is on the translation of net assets of group entities which are denominated in
currencies other than aud which is the groups presentation currency the impact of movements in exchange rates is recognised primarily in
the other comprehensive income component of the groups statement of comprehensive income
certain subsidiaries within the group are exposed to foreign exchange risk on purchases denominated in currencies that are not the
functional currency of that subsidiary in these circumstances a change in exchange rates would impact the net operating profit recognised in
the profit or loss component of the groups statement of comprehensive income
effective from january 24 2012 the functional currency of lynas corporation limited the parent changed from aud to usd following the
issue of the usd225 million mt kellett convertible bonds

exposure to foreign exchange risk
the groups members are exposed to foreign exchange risk on financial assets and financial liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
ie currencies other than the functional currency of each member of the group whilst a member of the group with myr as its functional currency
is exposed to usd and aud another member with usd as its functional currency is exposed to aud this exposure on financial assets and
liabilities by currency which has potential impact on the profit or loss component of the statement of comprehensive income is detailed below

the groups sensitivity to interest rate risk can be expressed in two ways

fair value sensitivity analysis
a change in interest rates impacts the fair value of the groups fixed rate borrowings given all debt instruments are carried at amortised
cost a change in interest rates would not impact the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss or the
statement of financial position

cash flow sensitivity analysis
a change in interest rates would have an impact on future interest payments and receipts on the groups floating rate assets and liabilities
an increase or decrease in interest rates of 50 basis points at the reporting date would negatively or positively impact both the statement
of financial position and profit or loss through the statement of comprehensive income by the amounts shown based on the assets and
liabilities held at the reporting date and a one year time frame this analysis assumes that all other variables in particular foreign currency
rates remain constant the analysis is performed on the same basis for comparative periods

c     commodity and other price risk
commodity and other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the
individual financial instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market


283       credit risk
credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations and arises principally from the groups receivables from customers and related entities
the groups exposure to credit risk is primarily in its trade and other receivables and is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of
each customer demographically there are no material concentrations of credit risk


284       liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not meet its contractual obligations as they fall due the groups approach to managing liquidity
risk is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due and comply with covenants under
both normal and stressed conditions
the group evaluates its liquidity requirements on an ongoing basis and ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected
operating expenses including the servicing of financial obligations this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot
reasonably be predicted such as natural disasters
the following table sets out contractual cash flows for all financial liabilities including derivatives

from those applied in prior studies given the mt weld project is in operation and historical empirical data exists for the mining operation
the confidence of the modifying factors applied is high considering the number of changes to the modifying factors there has been little
change to the ore reserves from 2014 to 2015 depletion of the stockpiles has reduced the ore reserves by approximately 30 kt of total reo
and the new unmined ore reserves has reduced by a further 30 kt total reo compared to the 2014 ore reserves the main change in the
unmined ore reserves compared to 2014 was an increase in tonnes and a reduction in reo grade resulting in similar total reo
the 2015 ore reserves and mineral resource estimations were estimated on august 31 2015 to match the availability of personnel to carry
out the work there have been no material changes to the ore reserves and mineral resources between the end of the financial year and
august 31 2015

   confirms that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimated mineral resources continue to apply and have
   not materially changed figures in the table may not sum due to rounding
there have been changes to the mineral resource estimations for the duncan deposit and central lanthanide deposit compared to the
2014 mineral resource estimations reinterpretations of the mineral resource model have been carried out in 2015 to better reflect the
current knowledge of the orebody the reinterpretations changed a number of parameters including the way the categories were assigned the
reinterpretations resulted in some changes to the total tonnes grade and the quantities in each category for each deposit the overall result
for the central lanthanide deposit was similar tonnes and a lower grade resulting in a reduction of approximately 110000 tonnes total reo
compared to 2014 approximately 30000 tonnes of this was depletion of stockpiles the overall result for the duncan deposit was less tonnes at
a similar grade resulting in a reduction of approximately 45000 tonnes of total reo compared to 2014
there have been no changes to the niobium rich rare metals prospect mineral resources since 2014
