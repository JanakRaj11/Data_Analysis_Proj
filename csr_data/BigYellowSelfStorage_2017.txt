   our csr policy sets out how we manage the impact of our business on society and the local environment to control our risks and
   manage our opportunities in a sustainable manner we participated in the ftse4good annual index series survey and achieved a low
   environmental impact we also use the detail in this csr report to participate in other benchmarks such as the annual carbon disclosure
   project cdp and global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb to engage with our other ethical investors notwithstanding this
   and in order to maintain an efficient and sustainable business for our stakeholders we have continued to commit significant resources to
   the environmental and social aspects of our storage operations property portfolio new store developments and site acquisitions
   in this report we state our energy use and carbon emissions in compliance with the companies act and the climate change regulation on
   reporting greenhouse gas ghg emissions for listed companies for more details on our applications for the above benchmarks please
   go to the basis of reporting section of the csr section of our investor relations website
   in this report we have provided a summary of our scope 1 onsite gas use solar electricity generation and refrigerant use and scope 2

   guidelines 2013 version 10 standard set 2016 expiring 30 june 2017 conversion factors for our annual ghg emission calculations and
   reporting also we are reporting using the uk government ghg conversion factors for company reporting expiring 30 june 2017
   finally we also report on our environmental key performance indicators and identify them using the codes from the global reporting

   between 2008 and 2010 we installed motion sensor lighting in many of our stores and renewable energy initiatives were included in our
   new store openings such as solar panels on 10 stores wind turbines on two stores and ground source heat pumps in five stores
   and these achieved both electricity use reduction and sustainable electricity generation across our store portfolio
   from 2010 to 2013 there was an increase in our total electricity use as a result of our new store openings and increases in our customer
   occupancy customers increase electricity use by more regular activation of our motion sensor lighting and the increased use of electrical
   socket supply in our stores 2011 was our peak year benchmarking year for electricity use
   from 2013 our investment in energy efficiency programmes such as internal and external led relamping across the store portfolio and
   the installation of larger capacity 50kwp solar panels at seven of our stores reduced our electricity use and increased our own electricity
   generation to 2016

 our portfolio of stores with roofmounted solar pv installations generate low carbon electricity that is monitored for performance and receives
 financial payments from the energy companies that we export to there are 17 stores with pv installations and the feedin tariff payments
 for generation and deemed export of electricity apply to all these installations
 solar generation performance in the first quarter of 2017 reduced due to our pv systems at fulham and merton requiring inverter replacement
 and maintenance respectively in june 2016 solar generation also underperformed due to unseasonal cloud cover in the second and third
 quarters of 2017 our sheen and bromley solar installations lost generation data communication these were repaired during annual
 maintenance visits and payments then continued to be received

 our nonstore portfolio consists of two business administration centres our head office at bagshot surrey and our warehouse depot for the
 storage and distribution of our packing materials at maidenhead berkshire they both provide services to the store portfolio the head office
 electricity use is more intense due to higher staff occupancy electricity is mainly used for lighting heating or cooling and computer equipment
 in the office areas the total electricity reductions for both the head office and maidenhead from the benchmark year 2011 was 142 the
 reductions were mainly due to energy efficient led relamping and more efficient air conditioning and it equipment investment programmes

   the kyoto protocol reduction target 2008 to 2012
   from 2008 to 2010 we achieved store electricity use reductions by investment in our motion sensor lighting and low carbon renewable energy
   self supply from 2010 to 2013 we had an increase in electricity use as a result of our new store openings and increased customer occupancy
   this increase in our emissions delayed the achievement of our 2008 to 2012 kyoto protocol reduction target of 125 until 2014

   the uk climate change act 2008
   the climate change act was made legally binding in the 2009 budget it has an interim target of ghg emission reduction of 34 by 2020
   the longerterm target is to reduce ghg emission by 80 by 2050 or by approximately 35 per year

 our target is to reduce scope 1  scope 2 ghg emissions by 34 by 2020
 our annual ghg emission since peak energy use in 2011 has reduced by 352 or approximately 5 per year on average
 in order to commit to longterm climate change sciencebased targets we will commit to investing in improved led technology as they
 become more efficient and renewable solar energy on new build stores this year we acquired two stores at nine elms and twickenham 2
 and these stores will be part of our internal and external led relamping programmes in the future these technologies will achieve levels
 of decarbonisation required to keep global temperatures on a pathway to 2oc above global preindustrial levels by 2100

 managing the nonphysical physical and financial risks of ghg emission and climate change for our
 customers investors and other stakeholders

 managing the nonphysical risks and opportunities
 over the long term big yellows nonphysical risks and opportunities have been governed by eu and uk regulation and best practice within
 the real estate investment sector the significance of ghg emission and climate change have been reviewed since 2008 within board
 reports and csr meetings building certifications such as energy performance certificates epcs the building research establishment
 assessment methodology breeam and the considerate constructors scheme ccs are all used in annual investor benchmarks such
 as the ftse4good the carbon disclosure project cdp the global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb

 financial risks and opportunities of climate change
 the financial risks and opportunities of climate change are within the cost of sustainable planning designing and constructing of our new
 store developments which can be more sustainable and resilient in the longer term the financial risks involve reviewing the existing and
 acquired stores against extreme weather events such as seasonal storms and flooding our investors also appreciate disclosures and
 performance benchmarks of our portfolio set against sustainable development and energy efficiency benchmarks to assess our annual
 reduction in carbon emissions and taxes internal regulatory briefs on compliance and high standards within real estate benchmarks makes
 big yellow an efficient and low risk investment

 physical risks and opportunities
 the physical risks from increased ghg emission is climate change global warming and the consequences of higher risk weather systems
 that can increase temperatures storm frequency flooding andor droughts
 big yellow has physically invested in energy efficiency in order to reduce electricity use and ghg emission our solar stores have customer
 facing electronic screens displaying real time solar generation kwh and carbon emissions tco2 saved in customer reception areas
 big yellow has also trialled and invested in green roofs and green walls on several of our stores barking chiswick fulham high wycombe
 and sutton in the urban areas of our towns and cities these investments provide shade to our stores in the summer that are susceptible
 to the urban heat island effect green roofs can store moisture after rainfall that evaporates in the spring and summer seasons and cools
 the upper floor levels rainwater harvesting systems are also installed barking chiswick liverpool merton sheffield and sutton in order
 to provide landscape irrigation in the summer months several stores have sustainable urban drainage systems that provide permeable
 car park surfaces or peripheral soft landscaping that can regulate surface water to ground waters and local rivers

   scope 3 store waste supply chain recycling  emissions

   waste sources and segregation
   our main source of waste is from the operational activities of our stores mainly retail and office activities that have a relatively low
   environmental impact our store staff apply best practice waste segregation for general and mixed dry recyclable materials

   waste recycling contractor
   our recycling contractor provides further segregation and recycling of our waste since our total waste benchmark of 2011 244 t our
   store portfolio has increased from 62 to 73 stores and total waste has increased to 3251 t in 2017 an increase of 33 from 2011 the
   percentage of waste recycled has reduced from 73 in 2013 to 59 in 2017 this reduction in our contractors recycling is an increasing trend
   due to a reduction in the supply price of some mixed dry recycled materials such as paper and cardboard

   waste to landfill and landfill tax
   an increasing amount of general waste 130 tonnes 41 of general waste went to landfill in 2017 as compared to 69 tonnes 28 of
   general waste in 2011 an increase of 53 over six years landfill tax is an environmental tax paid in addition to normal landfill costs
   reducing reusing and recycling waste can reduce the landfill tax rate to 265 per ton for more inert waste if no segregation or recycling
   occurs an increase in the tax to 8440 per ton can apply to more active waste these changes have increased our landfill tax by 32
   mainly due to the reduction in the market value of our recyclate that is now sent to landfill due to its low price

   government legislation and standards

   eu energy efficiency directive the uk energy savings opportunities scheme esos
   we appointed an accredited esos assessor who measured all of our energy consumption and determined significant areas of use esos
   was enforced by the environment agency and involved the audit of four representative stores from our portfolio we assessed future potential
   energy savings from the report other than the technologies that we had already programmed and invested in we completed the audits in
   november 2015 before the december 2015 deadline and have considered changes to our future budget for investing in viable energy saving
   technologies as a result
