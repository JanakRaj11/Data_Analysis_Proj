   hazard data and basic exposure information together to
   identify issues of potential concern followed by practical
   risk evaluations that analyze chemicals in a tiered fashion to
   resolve such issues
2 risk management decision making that combines
   information on a chemicals risks beneﬁts and costs with
   an understanding of societal concerns the risks beneﬁts
   and costs of alternatives and the use of appropriate
   precautionary measures

the future of distribution
a pg global engineering project is focusing on designing
and constructing sustainable manufacturing and distribution
centers and transporting ﬁnished product in a sustainable way

a critical pilot this year was development of the big box
distribution center in amiens france this is the biggest
conventional distribution center in western europe about
600000 square feet able to store 70000 pallets of
pg products

the amiens distribution center incorporates the best thinking
on sustainable design from within pg and outside




examples of sustainable solutions adopted at the distribution
center are
 solar panels for hot water supply and photovoltaic cells for
  energy production
 windmill turbine to produce up to 10 percent of the energy
  needed on site
 natural light via translucent roof panels energy savings up to
  30 percent
 energyefﬁcient ﬂuorescent lighting daylight dimming and
  motion detection energy savings up to 70 percent
 forklift trucks with ac regenerative motors the battery is
  recharged when the forklifts mast comes down yielding
  energy savings up to 30 percent
 recyclable wall and roof cladding panels
 carpet with 80percent recyclable yarn
 wood from sustainable tree plantations
 local vegetation

another example is use of low embodied energy material
designed to reduce a buildings energy footprint the amiens
distribution center uses wood frames glulaminated from eco
certiﬁed forests for the roof trusses docks doors and other
structures instead of concrete or steel frames

childrens safe drinking water program methodology
working with population services international and aquaya             the speciﬁc assumptions are
institute we have developed the following methodology to              each pur sachet treats 10 liters of water
estimate the days of disease and lives saved as a direct result of     an average of 15 liters of drinking water is used per child
pur usage                                                              per day and 2 liters of drinking water per adult per day

the number of pur sachets that are provided are tracked on a          diarrhea
monthly basis by country                                              60 of pur is consumed by children
                                                                       the number of episodes of diarrhea per child per year is
from this we calculate the liters of safe drinking water provided       5 episodes in subsaharan africa
and estimate the impact on reduction in days of diarrhea and             22 episodes in latin america
estimated lives saved the illness and fatality rates by region are    40 of pur is used by adults
derived from the world health organization global burden of            the number of episodes of diarrhea per adult per year is

the reduction in diarrheal illness from the use of the pur
sachets is based on the average reduction measured in ﬁve             lives saved
randomized controlled health intervention studies involving           the fatality rate per case of childhood diarrhea is
more than 25000 subjects these independently conducted                 0001 in subsaharan africa

  update on hse data systems
  after 10 years of operating our current global hse data               time the analysis tools have been expanded to ﬁnd root

advertising policy and sustainable development
if sustainable development is about ensuring a better quality       spreading awareness of how other people live is one of the
of life for everyone now and for generations to come              inevitable consequences of the global media revolution we
then advertising plays a key role advertising helps inform         do not accept that people in developing countries should be
consumers about products and services and facilitates               denied a better quality of life the ﬁrst priority of sustainable
consumer choice after all it is consumers themselves who are      consumption must be to provide access to adequate
best placed to choose how best to improve their own quality         consumption opportunities for everyone nearly half the
of life                                                            worlds population lives on less than 2 per day they need
                                                                    access to adequate products and services that can improve
we believe advertising contributes to sustainable development       their daily lives
in a variety of general and speciﬁc ways achieving
sustainability in the marketplace requires effective competition    in developed countries the idea that advertising fuels over
to drive innovation and increased efﬁciency competition            consumption overplays the importance of advertising since
thrives on advertising and advertising thrives on competition     it cannot make people buy things they do not want or need
innovation leads to better products and services and more          advertising can inform and inﬂuence and help consumers
variety and choice for consumers                                   make more informed decisions but it is consumers who
                                                                    choose how best to improve the quality of their own lives
there are also many speciﬁc businessbuilding opportunities in      advertisers alone are unable to regulate the overall demand for
which advertising contributes to sustainable development by         goods and services
improving lives around the world advertising
 often involves health education and awareness raising in          however there are clear responsibilities as well as
  developing countries such as in pgs healthy smiles dental      opportunities for advertisers such as pg there is a
  health campaign in china                                         responsibility to ensure truth in advertising and to ensure that
 provides social or environmental messages as part of public       messages are legal decent and honest we also assume our
  service or corporate campaigns pgs open minds campaign         responsibility to ensure the sensitive portrayal of all groups in
  in india for example raised public awareness of the plight of   society including women children the elderly and minorities
  indias working street children while collecting money to fund    for this reason pg actively supports truthinadvertising
  their education                                                  mechanisms and conforms to relevant national codes and
 promotes innovative products that have environmental or           guidelines wherever we operate
  social beneﬁts
 promotes more sustainable use of existing products to
  maximize environmental or social beneﬁts for example
  the washright campaign run in europe by pg and other
  members of the european detergents association promotes
  correct usage of laundry products and efﬁcient use of water
  and energy
 communicates the sustainability attributes and performance
  of companies and other organizations offering products
  and services as the public increasingly wants to know more
  about them

despite contributions to sustainable development advertisings
role and effects have been questioned advertising has been
blamed for spreading western lifestyles around the world and
for promoting excessive consumption in developed countries
