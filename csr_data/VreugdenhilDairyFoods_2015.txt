our special relationship
with water
this csr report considers in detail our results and our latest ambitions
as well as some great examples of how we and our partners can grow
responsibly together  the name we have given our csr policy water
receives particular attention the evaporation of water from milk being one
of our most important activities as a milk powder producer our customers
and consumers many of them in equatorial regions where conditions are
unfavourable for milk production add water to our milk powders yet clean
water cannot be taken for granted in these countries and that is why in
2014 we started up a project with world vision and made blue for producing
175 million litres of clean drinking water in the horn of africa by 2020 we
aim to be producing one litre of clean drinking water in waterstressed
countries where we sell our milk powders for every litre we extract from
our milk in the netherlands

great csr results in 2014
water also plays an important role in our transport activities in 2014
95 of the containers from our factory in gorinchem were transported by
water as a result co2 emissions were lower than in those cases where
we used road transport in addition our newlybuilt factory will allow us
to considerably reduce our water consumption during production energy
consumption will drop as well other great results achieved in 2014 were
that 81 of our dairy farmers participated in our extensive sustainability
programme that the palm oil we purchased was 100 sustainable and
that absenteeism was reduced from 65 to 5 due to our efforts in that
direction also in 2014 we started using the wind energy generated by
our own dairy farmers who in return received a financial incentive for
their efforts

staff involvement is a priority for 2015
our priority for 2015 is to involve all staff members in sustainability this
is an essential basis for achieving our csr goals we would also like to
make gains in other areas such as in making our gas consumption more
sustainable recycling our packaging and developing products which are
even better tailored to the nutritional requirements of consumers

sustainable dairy farming is a prerequisite
we keep working hard at making dairy farming more sustainable the
netherlands ranks first in the world when it comes to great results and
ambitious 2020 goals in this respect and it makes sense because dairy
farming has such an enormous environmental impact with the increase
in the world population and living standards sustainable food production
is becoming an even more important factor in keeping our planet habitable
sustainable dairy farming is therefore a prerequisite especially because
milk through its high nutritional value makes an important contribution
to feeding the growing world population

we continue to grow
we see the abolition of the milk quota in 2015 as an opportunity and
we now expect even further growth in the coming years this will
require much from our staff who will have to cope with many changes
however sustainability must be central to our growth and further
process of professionalisation and this represents our strongest personal
motivation to what we are doing in terms of csr csr is therefore a top
priority in our newly formulated mission and vision and also a subject
that we constantly address in conversations with our staff members and
external stakeholders there is still so much to be improved do you have
any questions or suggestions after reading this csr report we would
love to hear from you at mvovreugdenhilnl

    more than 80 of our dairy farmers are participating
    in our sustainability programme
    the most significant environmental impact of our
    milk powder production takes place at the dairy farms
    themselves our 875 dairy farmers in the netherlands
    who supply more than twothirds of the raw materials
    for our milk are therefore given a sustainability results
    incentive in 2014 more than 700 dairy farmers participated
    in our sustainability programme one of the things that they
    receive points for is allowing their animals to graze 88
    of all our dairy farmers use some form of outdoor grazing
    and at 78 of the farms the milkgiving cows graze in the
    field for at least six hours per day on at least 120 days per
    year also at least ten percent of the dairy farmers young
    cattle graze for at least 120 days per year dairy farmers
    furthermore receive points for having a sustainable barn
    10 of the total number of dairy farmers had a sustainable
    barn in 2014 nature conservation 53 participating
    in the koe kompas animal welfare programme 53
    participating in the energiescan energy scan 49 or
    for participating in one of the 75 workshops we organised
    once they have earned six points these dairy farmers receive
    a financial incentive over and above the milk price for their
    milk as of 2015 the reward will be structured differently
    they will get an incentive premium once they reach eight
    points and the more sustainable measures that dairy
    farmers take the higher this incentive will be this will help
    us achieve our ambitious and concrete climate and energy
    animal health and animal welfare grazing and biodiversity
    and environmental goals wwwduurzamezuivelketennl

    dilemma keeping grazing up to standard
    while we are well on our way to achieving our 2020 goals
    our outdoor grazing goal in particular remains a challenge
    it dictates that 91 must have some form of grazing by
    2020 despite stimulating measures to the contrary we are
    unfortunately seeing that dairy farmers still keep building
    new barns with much room and light for the cows and as
    a result will therefore prefer to keep them inside more
    frequently this remains a key point of attention that we
    bring up with the dairy farmers in the sounding board
    group in 2015 grazing will receive additional rewards in
    our sustainability programme

    100 responsible soy in cattle feed
    a great result from 2014 is that all dairy farmers have
    now moved over to the purchasing of responsible soy
    for use in cattle feed in 2015 we furthermore started
    an energy project together with stichting blauwzaam
    bel leerdammer and deltamilk we expect that this will            i feel that our workshops will have
    result in the ten participating dairy farmers substantially       been successful if dairy farmers can
    reducing their energy consumption and potentially                 eventually apply the knowledge that they
    becoming net energy suppliers                                    have obtained in their actual daily work
                                                                      activities and when it starts to influence
                                                                      their business results positively i also
                                                                      think it is fantastic to see that dairy

                                                                      initiatives apart from the sustainability

apart from the milk that we get from our dairy farmers we
also look at our other purchases we enter into conversations
with our suppliers where we look at each others csr
initiatives and ask them to sign our suppliers code with
requirements around human rights and the environment
97 of the dairy and ingredients suppliers in particular milk
powder from the eu and 99 of the packaging suppliers
in particular tin and plastic have now signed the code as
a result we are now looking at ways in which we can become
more sustainable in terms of purchases that carry large
environmental and social risks our focus for the coming
year will be on packaging and soy lecithin by the end of 2014
50 of the soy lecithin had already been certified by proterra

dilemma reducing the environmental impact of
our packaging
over the past few years we have made our packaging
thinner and more easily recyclable naturally we will remain
committed to food safety and quality in addition we also want
to make sure that our products reach our customers without
any dents and other damage the environmental impact of
our packaging would fall substantially if it could be reused
or recycled given the various links in the supply chain and
the physical distance between us and the end consumer
many of whom live in countries around the equator we have
limited influence on this in 2015 we want tot obtain more
insight in what role we can possibly play in this

sustainable palm oil
as of the end of 2014 we only buy sustainable palm oil
in round table on sustainable palm oil mass balance
certified this means that our palm oil suppliers comply with
criteria such as no deforestation limited use of pesticides
and good staff relations we process the palm oil into our
affordable milk concepts which are then mainly sold to
customers in africa cheese and yoghurt producers but also
consumers the milk fat in these milk powders is replaced
with vegetable fat in order to preserve the nutritional value

water transport
in 2013 container transport activities arranged by vreugdenhil
from the gorinchem factory to the ports of rotterdam and
antwerpen took place over water 95 of the time before
2012 the transporting of containers was done exclusively by
trucks which resulted in high co2 emissions because of
this and other reasons the co2 emission for 2013 the final
numbers for 2014 will be made available in the summer
of 2015 was 133 lower than in the reference year of
2011 we are also investing much effort into transport
from the dairy farms to the production sites as well as the      two years ago i was asked to optimise
outward transport activities from our production sites to our     the shipment planning of our factory
customers this involves driver training new environmentally     we had a clear goal of transporting
friendly trucks as well as the further optimisation of           90 of the containers loaded via water
transport planning                                               in the meantime we have achieved
                                                                  this goal and at the same time we also
              fair and environmentally                            improved our customer satisfaction
                 friendly purchasing                              as well as our environmental impact

                                                                  arie troost is responsible for the
                                                                  transportation of our products
                                                                  in gorinchem




                                                                                                            5

    substantial reduction in absenteeism rate
    in 2014 we invested a lot of effort into reducing the
    absenteeism rate especially at our gorinchem
    production site this resulted in a reduction from 8
    for 2013 to 55 for 2014 the absenteeism rate up to
    two years for the whole of vreugdenhil fell from 64
    for 2013 to 50 for 2014 our next goal is to reduce
    the absenteeism rate to below 4 for 2020 in 2014 we
    furthermore developed a number of initiatives aimed
    at the development of our staff members we created
    a training programme for the new factory in gorinchem
    which will be launched in the second half of 2015
    we designed a special development programme for
    talented young staff members at senior vocational
    university hbowo level groups of staff members
    from a number of different sites and disciplines
    started this in 2015 apart from personal development
    we feel this can also contribute to the improved
    cooperation between the various sites in order to
    concretise this last goal in 2015 we introduced new
    mediums of communication including a fresh and
    appealing staff magazine in 2014 we started an
    introduction programme for new staff from all sites
    apart from a general familiarisation with vreugdenhil
    as a company csr topics are also addressed

    involving staff members in sustainability is the
    key challenge for 2015
    increasing the knowledge and enthusiasm for
    sustainability among staff members is an important
    and ongoing challenge the lack of staff involvement
    in sustainability is a risk in terms of achieving our
    goals and so methods we are therefore using in
    2015 include workshops a competition soapbox
    presentations and new communication media




                                                             i want to produce first class milk
                                                             powder using as little energy and water
                                                             as possible and so i discovered over
                                                             the past year that we can cut 50 seconds
                                                             from the cleaning time of some of the
                                                             pipes this may not sound like much but
                                                             by doing this we actually hope to save
         healthy and engaged staff members                   2500 m3 of water per year

our dairy farmers supply us with wind energy
in the battle against climate change we are reducing the
energy consumption in our factories and offices in 2014 we
used 18 less energy per tonne of product compared to 2005
this percentage applies to the gorinchem and scharsterbrug
sites which are together responsible for 99 of our energy
consumption in 2020 we want to use 30 less energy
per tonne of product compared to 2005 next we want to
purchase the energy that we do use in a sustainable fashion
in 2014 30 of our energy was green energy some of this
energy was purchased from three of our dairy farmers wind
turbines via the purchasing of their socalled carbon credits
by means of a green certificates incentive we also want to try
and get other dairy farmers to supply us with wind energy in
2015 100 of our energy will be green energy via wind from
both our own dairy farmers more than 20 and denmark

making gas consumption sustainable
making gas consumption sustainable is another challenge
gas consumption is high as a result of the evaporation of
the water out of milk dependance of gas supply becomes
a risk because of the eventual drying up of gas reserves
as well as the geopolitical issues around conventional gas
but green gas is scarce and that is why we are researching
the possibility of reducing our dependence on gas and
making our consumption of gas more sustainable

opening of sustainable factory in gorinchem in 2015
we are further expanding our production capacity in order
to be able to satisfy the growing demand for our milk
powders as of the summer of 2015 we will be receiving
additional milk from our dairy farmers and gradually start
using the new factory in gorinchem both our water as well
as our energy consumption per tonne of product will go
down as a result of efficiency measures this is for example
thanks to the reuse of heat and cold heat that is released
from production is directly used somewhere else in the
process or stored in wellinsulated tanks the cooling is
done with water from the merwede river the electric motors
in the new towers are furthermore the most energy efficient
in their class lastly we use energy efficient led lighting
and motion sensors

opening of sustainable headquarters in nijkerk in 2015
in 2015 we are moving to our new headquarters by using
solar panels charging poles for electricity supply heat
and cold storage use of rainwater for toilets ergonomic
office equipment manufactured in the netherlands and
natural ventilation our office is among the most sustainable
office buildings in all of the netherlands in other words       because of building our new factory
environmentally friendly and with a pleasant working              in 2014 we started with the expansion
atmosphere as a prove of this we expect to receive the 5         of our own water purification plant which
star breeamnl new construction completion certificate           discharges water into the merwede river
this is the highest sustainability rating of this quality mark   we chose the best available techniques
                                                                  ensuring that the water purification
               environmentally friendly                           complies with stricter future discharge
                 factories and offices                            requirements i think it is wonderful

    vitamins and minerals for consumers around
    the equator
    our products supply important nutrients protein
    calcium zinc vitamins a b and d through our
    innovative affordable and tasty milk concepts we are
    making our products more accessible for everyone
    in 2015 we want to start investigating the nutritional
    requirements of consumers so that we can increase
    our health contribution by for example fortifying our
    products with vitamins and minerals

    working on quality every single day
    safe products are a precondition for making a
    contribution to the health of consumers this sounds
    obvious but it means that quality is prioritised every
    single day our product sites are certified according
    to internationally recognised food safety standards
    fssc22000 in scharsterbrug and barneveld
    iso22000 in gorinchem as of 2014 dairy farmers
    who comply with increasingly strict additional quality
    standards get an incentive premium for their milk
    our staff members also play a crucial role in 2015
    they will get additional training on hygiene and safety
    an indicator of our success is the number of quality
    complaints we receive from customers which we
    would like to decrease by ten percent annually
    in 2014 we had 30 percent more complaints than in
    the previous year in 2015 we instituted measures
    to substantially reduce the level of complaints




                                                               here in our laboratory in barneveld
                                                               we test all the milk powder we buy
                                                               and produce to ensure that it complies
                                                               with our quality requirements in these
                                                               tests we try to exert as little impact
                                                               as possible on the environment we
                                                               therefore replace chemical analyses
              nutritious and tasty products                    with infrared analyses which use less

we have to extract water out of milk in order to make
our milk powders consumers in turn add water back to
our products but clean drinking water is not necessarily
always freely available in africa which is where many
of our customers live we would like to change this
for every litre of water that we extract out of the milk in
the netherlands we therefore want to ensure one litre
of clean drinking water in africa in this manner we at the
same time contribute to maintaining the quality of the
dairy they make of our milk powders in 2014 we started
a collaboration with world vision and made blue from
a practical perspective this means that we will produce
175 million litres of clean drinking water in the horn of
africa an area with a permanent shortage of this key
resource this is equivalent to approximately one third
of the water that we extract out of milk every year as
of 2020 we want to replace every litre of water that we
extract in the netherlands with a litre of clean drinking
water in those countries where our milk powder is sold
and water crises are being experienced

sponsoring
we also sponsor other health projects in developing
countries including those of woord en daad poverty
reduction zoa refugee assistance and doctors
without borders emergency medical assistance

it is just unbelievable that this collaboration has now
been established clean drinking water is so important
for children it obviously ensures good health and in
our projects in africa i saw with my own eyes how many
diseases are actually caused by polluted drinking water
but clean drinking water also helps to ensure that
children can actually go to school that is because in
africa it is often the childrens job to fetch water and
the further they have to walk for clean drinking water
the less time is left over for going to school together
with vreugdenhil and made blue we are really making
a difference in ensuring that children dont get sick from
polluted water and can actually go to school i am so
thankful for the opportunity to combine the expertise that
world vision brings to the table with the responsibility
that these companies feel when it comes to this topic
ruud van eijle is the director of world vision




                                                              i get a wonderful feeling of connection
                                                              when we mobilise ourselves for the sake
                                                              of social and ecological justice together
                                                              we can stand strong and have a big

management of csr
in an effort to make our csr achievements and goals both transparent

growing responsibly together is made up of three pillars our suppliers
our organisation and our customers the csr policy is coordinated by
our sustainability officer it is the management teams responsibility
to meet the goals every quarter progress is discussed with the board
the csr policy is also tested and refined at least once a year during
a meeting between the board and the management team this is done
based on among other things the results of the stakeholder conversations
in 2014 there were around 20 conversations about csr between our
board management personnel and our most important stakeholders
dairy farmers staff members suppliers and customers important
topics appear to be improved environmental impact of our production
and packaging reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases good
working conditions and community involvement and development

our effective csr management system where stakeholder expectations
are managed based on goals and results
