case  our search for new reuse applications for foundry sand

    componentas finnish units generate a total of 25000 tonnes of excess foundry sand annually according to the law
    foundry sand can be reused at a landﬁll site if this is mentioned in the environmental permit for the site or at an earth
    construction site if a separate environmental permit is applied for otherwise foundry sand has to be dumped at a
    landﬁll site

    in 2013 only a few per cent of excess foundry sand was reused outside of landﬁll sites however reuse applications
    could be increased due to the excellent composition of foundry sand most foundry sand types contain around 10 per
    cent of bentonite which is added to mixtures used in earth construction among other things in addition the
    concentrations of harmful ingredients in foundry sand are either below or very close to the limits of inert waste
    expanding reuse applications would also bring signiﬁcant environmental beneﬁts

    at the moment the environmental permit process required for foundry sand is in eﬀect preventing its ﬂexible reuse
      erefore we have initiated a project in finland that produces information for the authorities on the environmental
    impact and reuse opportunities of foundry sand e project aims to change the current legislation government
    decree concerning the recovery of certain wastes in earth construction so that foundry sand could be reused in
    diﬀerent projects with a less burdensome notiﬁcation procedure than in the environmental permit process in the
    context of the project we are participating in a finnish programme called uuma2 which examines the reuse of waste
    and an eu life funded project at the hitura nickel mine in finland
