        establishment of fair trade relations

        corporate principles is to lead fair transparent and free            therefore we have opened a portal site of our legal team on

        customers or purchasing and receiving services from others           explanations about subcontract act questions and answers
        we lead fair transparent and free trade by firmly standing            and simple check lists to judge whether the act is violated
        against any unhealthy or corrupt business practices
        we believe that all staﬀ thoroughly recognizing these principles
        of behavior is the foundation for realizing fair business practices
        in conjunction with our own quality control standards through
        compliance education and training we aim to ensure that all
        trades formed between countries and regions are always a
        healthy relationship

smart house is completed
in cooperation with the research office of messrs noshiro kawazoe and magori at tokyo
university s production technology research center and housing makers we have completed
a new smart house on our premises in an effort to create a place for various experiments and
inspections almost all electric consumption of this futuretype house is provided by natural
energies such as solar and wind powers

airconditioning in hot and cold water circulating in the building
the smart house is a onestory hybridstructured house which is built of steels
combined with wood the comfortable inner room environment of this house is
created not by airconditioners but by panel heating and a cooling system that
utilizes cold and hot water running in metallic panels this system is also used for
structure body of the building

 visualization of basic functionalities
putting importance on residents comfort of life besides the visualization of electric
energy produced by solar and wind powers we have visualized basic functionalities
needed for a house

veriﬁcation of comfort of life
various future energies such as solar and wind powers have been experimented
among them magnetic force generation is an epochmaking invention although
still on an experimental stage magnetic force generation is a system that turns a
generator using the suction power and repulsive force of a strong permanent magnet
which is really a future energy that is totally clean and semipermanently usable




designing of the smart hotel has started
a new project challenged by huis ten bosch that seeks to become a 1000 year town is a smart
hotel scheduled to open in april 2015 the hotel is a nextgeneration hotel that restrains
its running cost to minimal and at the same time aims at
obtaining the worldbest productivity by using automation
and robotization

a room unit that utilizes local technologies and materials
local technologies and materials are actively used for its room interiors we
aim at designing the room that has regional characteristics unique to huis
ten bosch by actively utilizing lumber produced mainly in japan and steel
structure technology developed in conjunction with sasebo s shipbuilding
industry we also will build a system that is used as a basic measure for a
room and also applicable to hotels on a global basis

use of renewable energies
we intend to use various future energies in the hotel including solar power generation and solar heat panels based on
experiment results obtained from the smart house the kind of usable natural energies and its efficiency will change
according to construction locations we aim at a highefficiency hotel suitable to the location in accordance with its
conditions

new omotenashi using robotics
we will actively introduce services by robots which makes it possible to substantially reduce personnel cost that
accounts for a major part in hotel management the objective of this trial is not just cost cutting but also to seek the
way how the nextgeneration robot services should be
