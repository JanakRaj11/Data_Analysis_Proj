commerce the growing power of consumers the period of slow economic growth in europe and the challenging situation in
russia


the overall economic situation remained weak in finland and the exchange rate of the ruble declined substantially
furthermore there was intense competition in scandinavia the volumes of addressed letter items continued to decline and
newspaper and magazine volumes decreased as well


the market situation in logistics and retail is weak transport volumes in groupage logistics declined and the volume of heavy
traffic has continued to decrease in finland for nearly three consecutive years


on the other hand the increase in the overall demand for parcels and in ecommerce as well as the growth of the cloud
services offered by opuscapita offer new opportunities for us


the finnish government issued a postal delivery license to three of postis competitors the postal delivery licenses that have
been issued allow for competition in addressed deliveries but competition did not yet have an impact on us in 2014 in our
view issuing the postal licenses with oneday delivery obligation reduces postis opportunities to profitably provide services
that fall under the universal service obligation in accordance with the finnish postal act for this reason the decision increases
the need for efficiency measures

risks
risk management serves to safeguard and improve business performance and the achievement of strategic goals by
reducing the probability and effects of materialized risks and supporting the utilization of business opportunities


we update our corporate responsibility risks twice a year as part of our comprehensive risk management process and they
are reported as a separate item in the groups risk report starting from the risk reporting conducted towards the end of the
year compliance risks have been separated from other risks related to corporate responsibility and both are reported as
separate items the risk report is processed by our corporate responsibility steering group board of directors audit
committee and executive board


for us corporate responsibility risks include for example outsourcing measures related to financial responsibility in particular
they can have a negative effect on our reputation and consequently cause us to lose customers another key risk is the risk of
potential information leaks particularly those related to sensitive personal information


compliance risks include for example corruption as well as risks related supplier management and the failure of internal
control these are particularly important in russia poland and the baltic countries in addition investments in russia may be
considered to be unethical because of the social and legal development related to the business environment a key
environmental responsibility risk is accidents that cause extensive damage to the environment


our cooperation with postnl the national postal service of the netherlands launched in 2013 attracted negative attention
during the pilot phase the coding service related to postal items with illegible address markings was purchased from a
subsidiary of postnl in the philippines despite positive experiences we decided not to continue the cooperation after the pilot
project by keeping work in finland we wanted to support finnish employment and skills in the transformation of the postal
industry in the spring delivery route changes mail delivery disruptions and personnel reductions also attracted negative
media publicity

stakeholder survey
during the fall 2013 we examined extensively which corporate responsibility issues our stakeholders consider to be important
and how they think posti has performed in terms of corporate responsibility we received more than 2000 responses to our
survey from all of our stakeholder groups including consumers business customers personnel subcontractors the authorities
the parliament and the media in 2014 we did not conduct a similar survey


we asked our stakeholders how significant they considered various aspects of corporate responsibility to be all of our
stakeholder groups agreed on the importance of corporate responsibility issues employees considered all aspects to be more
important than did the other stakeholder groups


our tax footprint was a new aspect included in the survey and all of the stakeholder groups regarded it as being significant
we began reporting our tax footprint already in the summer of 2013 and developed the reporting further during 2014 supply
chain responsibility was clearly regarded as being more important than it was in our previous survey which was carried out
three years ago in terms of supply chains the need to ensure ethically sound operations in subcontracting has increased


the issues that our stakeholders found to be most important included information security responsible management and
supervision and transparent operations ensuring longterm profitability providing and developing basic postal services for
citizens in finland and making a commitment to ethical principles were considered to be very significant


compared to earlier surveys stakeholders expectations had increased in terms of transparent operations and financial
responsibility but their expectations had decreased slightly in terms of environmental issues for example however
environmental issues were still considered to be very important


for the first time respondents also included our customers in russia their expectations were similar to those of our finnish
customers


based on the results of the stakeholder survey we updated our materiality assessment and also determined key measures in
terms of corporate responsibility

customer satisfaction surveys that are conducted regularly once or twice a year in 2014 information was collected and
reported twice in finland and russia and once in other countries


business customers are mainly interviewed over the telephone but also partly with online surveys the surveys are targeted to
those who decide on or participate in the decisionmaking on the purchase of services offered by posti in 2014 our customer
satisfaction studies were based on the taloustutkimus corporate 360 content model


each year we also measure the satisfaction of consumer customers with posti and the key operational processes receiving
sending and customer service taloustutkimus collected information in may receiving more than 1000 responses


the consumers overall rating of posti as a whole declined from the previous year the customer service ratings as well as
ratings given by consumers for sending and receiving transactions remained at the same level as in the previous year the
ratings for parcel points continued to be very good


there were only minor changes in the ratings for sending and receiving transactions so they do not explain the decline in
overall ratings indeed declining overall ratings are more closely linked with the negative media publicity attracted by postis
delivery route changes mail delivery disruptions and personnel reductions during the first half of the year it seems that the
overall ratings also reflect peoples assessment of posti as a company in society


according to the business customer satisfaction study our customers were less satisfied with us than they were in the previous
year in postal services the results were poorer for all services in logistics services the results improved in the spring of 2014
but took a downward turn again in the fall


the highest customer satisfaction was achieved in parcel services and contract logistics of the geographical regions the
most significant yearonyear result improvement was achieved in the baltic countries in russia customer satisfaction did not
change substantially compared to the previous year


when processing customer details we comply with the legislation in force and protect our customers privacy this includes
among other things confidentiality safe storage of customer details and their usage only for the purpose for which they were
originally provided


in customer marketing communications we adhere to generally accepted ethical and cultural standards respect the privacy
of consumers and protect vulnerable consumer groups such as children in addition we comply with the icc international
code of advertising practice and the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises

tax footprint 2014
in its tax footprint reporting posti adheres to the countryspecific tax reporting guidelines for companies of which the state is
the majority shareholder provided by the ownership steering department on october 1 2014


tax strategy
all companies in the group have committed to operating responsibly and to meeting all obligations and requirements
defined by the valid legislation of each country all taxes are to be paid on time without delay the groups longterm target is
to ensure that the groups effective tax rate is at the same level as the corporate income tax rate valid in finland at each
particular time


posti does not practice tax planning that would aim at artificially decreasing the groups taxable income in taxrelated issues
the group operates within the framework of legislation and legal practice in planning the taxable profit of group companies
this can include the utilization of tax losses accrued in a subsidiary or the granting of group contributions for example to
clarify taxation practices some situations may involve contacting the tax authorities for either verbal guidance or a written
decision on the taxation treatment of the planned action tax risk management is part of the groups risk management
process


management of taxrelated issues
the management of taxrelated issues is centralized to the group finance unit which is responsible for managing and
monitoring taxrelated issues at the group level decisions related to taxation are made at the group level significant matters
of principle are presented to the parent companys board of directors for decisionmaking the groups cfo reports regularly
on taxationrelated issues to the groups audit committee the key task of the management of taxrelated issues is to ensure
that all group companies comply with the regulations of tax legislation in all countries of operation


principles observed in tax reporting
the information presented in this report is based on information collected from the groups accounting systems taxes refer to
taxes or taxlike fees paid to public sector entities whether they are paid or remitted by the company the nature and amount
of taxes vary significantly from country to country taxes paid refer to taxes paid by the group companies which are as a rule
expensed in the companys financial statements taxes remitted refer to taxes or fees collected by the companies which are
remitted to tax collectors often on behalf of parties other than the company itself


groups tax footprint reporting concerns only relevant countries and based on that countryspecific numbers are only
reported for finland and russia more than 82 of the groups net sales comes from these countries according to the groups
strategy these countries are its main markets other operating countries are grouped under scandinavia and other countries
posti also uses the same geographical categorization in its consolidated financial statements


for other countries than finland and russia information is presented on a country groupspecific basis as the information
reported is not of material importance and on the other hand its presentation by country might jeopardize the nondisclosure
of confidential information such as customer or pricing details from the groups perspective the amount of information
reported is not of material importance when the taxes payable for an individual country do not exceed eur 5 million


the group operates in 11 countries in addition posti has several companies in countries where the group no longer has

participated in safety tours at different workplaces during the tour the management representative learned more about the
occupational safety situation in the area and the everyday operations at the workplace the idea is to listen to the employees
views about both good experiences related to occupational safety and safety challenges


in order to ensure occupational safety we started gas measurements in all imported containers arriving at postis warehouses
before the containers are opened and goods unloaded if the measuring equipment detects gas in the container the
container will be aired properly before unloading the fumigation of containers prevents damage to cargo caused by insects
rodents and other unwanted organisms as well as their spreading from one country or continent to another

the employee satisfaction survey
the content of postis annual employee satisfaction survey was revised in 2014 at the same time the name voice selected as
a result of a name poll was adopted


the aim of the revised survey was to find out how dedicated to their work and their employer employees are and how well the
employer facilitates good performance the main themes of the voice survey were the employees dedication to work and
performance facilitation other themes included teamwork and cooperation future and leadership performance
management wellbeing safety and cultural transformation


the survey was conducted in finland and russia in septemberoctober this year the survey was taken by more than 12000
posti employees or 59 of the personnel


on the basis of the results the employee dedication index was 48 this means that slightly under half of employees
expressed a positive attitude towards the four aspects measuring dedication when compared to the norm in the postal and
logistics industry on a global scale the result can be considered low


however the performance facilitation index was higher this index measures the extent of an organizations commitment to
producing excellent customer service and highquality products or services and to basing its operations on the practices of
continuous improvement especially cooperation with ones closest colleagues was at a good level

sales decreased by 17 in 2007 the international post corporation ipc set a common goal for its members to reduce the
carbondioxide emissions of the postal industry by 20 by 2020


the amount of energy purchased during the review period decreased by 6 in the overall group and by 7 in finnish
operations compared to 2013


however at the same time the overall emissions of the group increased by 1 when compared to the overall emissions of
2013 particularly due to the increase of fuel usage in the real estate properties in russia in russia the growth of fuel
consumption was affected by the cold spring and autumn of 2014 and the changes in the heating and refrigeration systems
carried out in some storage targets


we are committed to continually improving our operational quality and environmental responsibility through certification
we can prove to our stakeholders that our operations meet specific requirements at the end of 2014 our certified

posti green
all of the letters publications parcels and direct marketing items delivered by us are completely carbon neutral posti green
services for our customers by using posti green products our customers can reduce co2 emissions in their supply chain
processes


we primarily reduce emissions through projects that are directly related to our operations the carbondioxide emissions
generated by our services are calculated as part of our annual environmental calculations we neutralize the remaining
carbondioxide emissions related to the transport and delivery of posti green products by funding climate projects in
practice if transporting one letter produces 20 grams of carbon dioxide we use certified climate projects to ensure that an
equal amount of emissions is reduced somewhere else


we carry out climate projects in countries that have no emission ceilings we do not implement climate projects in finland or
other kyoto protocol countries that have binding targets


in 2015 we will expand posti green so that in addition to postal items it covers all operations in finland

habit monitoring devices help to reduce fuel consumption and drive down carbondioxide emissions whats more it will be
possible to set and monitor regional targets for both consumption and emissions this will also cut down vehicle costs with
the devices we can also invest in the improvement of occupational safety


we also deliver mail by foot and by bicycle a total of 1200 delivery routes are handled by bicycles every day in addition to
bicycles we also use environmentally friendly electric carts mopeds scooters and cars up until now increasing the number of
electric cars in delivery has been challenging as electric cars suitable for winter conditions in finland are not available about
half of the mopeds we use are electric


ipc has organized the international drivers challenge competition twice in france and in ireland in march 2015 we hosted
the event in ivalo the driving habit index by the driving habit monitoring device played a decisive role in the selection of the
finnish competitors the index must be at least 95 for a period of several months the competition involved driving efficiency
and safety tests as well as customer serviceoriented tasks in addition to vehicle handling skills points were awarded on the
extent of the postal companies commitment to environmental objectives and sustainable development

property maintenance services
as of the beginning of october we centralized cleaning property maintenance waste management and technical building
services in finland to one partner the contract covers the production management and development of these services


by centralizing the services to one operator we could adopt a single steering model and reduce administrative workload the
contract ensures energy and cost efficiency energy consumption can be kept in control through good property maintenance
and constant monitoring of technical building systems

responsible sourcing
the aim of sourcing is to provide postis business operations with the highquality products and services it needs we are
committed to responsibility in all of our sourcing too


increasing the efficiency of sourcing was an integral part of the twoyear eur 100 million performance improvement program
launched in 2013 the program was completed ahead of schedule in the third quarter of 2014 and a significant portion of
the savings were achieved by improving sourcing efficiency in august 2014 we launched a new performance improvement
program for 20152016 aiming at eur 75 million in cost savings in addition to achieving savings in sourcing operational
efficiency is sought by achieving synergy benefits through the consolidation of production improving the efficiency of the ict

supplier audits
we have defined a supplier code of conduct and require all of our service providers and suppliers to adhere to it in addition
to legality the supplier code of conduct includes principles related to corruption human rights child labor discrimination
working conditions and environmental concerns


during the year we carried out a selfassessment covering all approved key suppliers of our countries of operation the
assessment applied to finland sweden estonia latvia and lithuania other countries of operation were excluded from the
scope of the assessment we contacted a total of 740 suppliers and the aim was that at least 75 of the suppliers would
complete the assessment the target was exceeded by the end of the year the response rate was 84


we also started supplier audits and completed 10 audits during the year the auditing process was planned in cooperation
with sourcing and risk management all audits were conducted onsite at the suppliers premises and they contained the
inspection of the following aspects the supplier code of conduct contract compliance operational compliance quality
management environmental management and risk management


the supplier assessment was included in the new supplier criteria to enable us to ensure that all of the groups suppliers meet

sourcing policy
in the fall we revised our sourcing policy that defines how sourcing and supplier cooperation are managed and handled in
posti group the policy is divided into two parts the first defines the general sourcing framework and the second describes
sourcingrelated guidelines and processes in more detail


during the year more than 90 of postis sourcing in finland originated from domestic suppliers in other countries of
operation too we favored local suppliers


we acquired 840 vehicles and 211 trailers dollies and swap bodies during the year we also started using new double deck
trailers which increase the transport capacity on our main routes one double deck trailer can accommodate one third more
goods than an ordinary trailer and consequently two trailers can transport the same amount of cargo as three ordinary
trailers in this way we can save fuel and reduce co2 emissions nearly all trailers dollies and swap bodies were acquired from
a finnish supplier after tendering


purchases related to the brand reform were sourced from finnish marketing agencies and material providers


of the suppliers approved during the year 84 were within the scope of selfassessment corresponding to a nearly eur 400
million purchase volume

sometimes it is necessary the treatment provided by the
doctors is very important but it is equally important to offer
the patient a cozy and attractive environment says estonian

campaigns spokesperson


people could take part in the campaign by sending toys
through smartpost parcel points to the aarete laegas
organization which sorted the toys and delivered them to
the tallinn childrens hospital in the campaign thousands of
toys were delivered to equip the hospitals playing rooms

a smartpost parcel point with the collected fees
smartpost gave the hospital a toy post office as an
additional gift

made the sending of parcels with a parcel point familiar to the participants in previous years we have utilized the smartpost
