managing emissions
ck hutchison summarises its efforts in managing emissions of air and ghg as well as waste below

air and ghg emissions
the group has taken steps to manage its air and ghg emissions among other environmental priorities

at its infrastructure division innovative technologies are applied to reduce pollutants such as nitrogen oxides nox from power generation
to meet or exceed industry emission standards for example this year hk electric installed a gasfired generating unit which is equipped with



                                                                                                                                    2016 annual report   97

     environmental social and governance report


     an improved selective catalytic reduction scr system the new scr system enables a 90 reduction in nox removal as compared to a
     conventional one hk electric also built one of the citys largest commercialscale solar and wind power systems the solar power system has a
     generating capacity of one mw and is expected to generate 1100000 units of electricity annually the use of solar energy in lieu of coalfired
     generation will help reduce 915 tonnes of carbon dioxide co2 emission every year the lamma wind power station generates electricity when
     wind speed is in the range of three to 25ms it has been producing about one million units of green electricity and offsetting 800 tonnes of co2
     emission every year on average

     outrams jinwan power plant is among the first few coalfired generation units in mainland china to achieve close to zero emission levels for air
     pollutants including sulphur dioxide so2 nox and particulates an extra tariff subsidy from the government has subsequently been granted to
     this plant in recognition to its outstanding performance in air emission management

     the day to day operations of the energy division may involve unintentional releases of hydrocarbon emissions from facility equipment and
     components to curb these fugitive emissions husky energy utilises specialised infrared cameras ultrasonic devices and vapour analysers to
     detect identify and quantify leaks so that effective repairs and corrective actions can be taken on a timely basis

     the ghg emission reduction measures include minimising fugitive emissions managing flaring and venting activities and capturing carbon for
     enhanced oil recovery for example husky energy captures co2 at its lloydminster ethanol plant and pikes peak south thermal plant with more
     than 300000 tonnes injected for enhanced oil recovery in heavy oil fields since 2012 additional technologies for carbon capture and injection
     are being evaluated

     waste and pollutants
     the group endeavours to reduce waste by encouraging reuse and recycling for example superdrug under asw has adopted a zero waste to
     landfill programme where all waste generated in store is transported back to the distribution centres for recycling asws commitment to waste
     management is demonstrated by including waste and recycling compliance in its store audit programmes ck hutchison is proud to report that
     superdrug has achieved zero waste to landfill since 2010

     the retail division and its suppliers play an active and critical role in making its products sustainable microplastics commonly found in rinseoff
     scrub products pose a threat to the marine ecosystem and the food chain in addition to implementing a ban on the use of microplastic in its
     ownbrand rinseoff scrub products in 2014 asw has completely removed all of its microplasticcontaining ownbrand rinseoff scrub products
     from the shelves worldwide in early 2017

     technology plays a key role in driving sustainability development in the groups businesses in particular in the infrastructure division
     northumbrian water in the uk for example generates energy from the sewage sludge created from its water treatment processes it is the first
     and only wastewater company in the uk that has achieved 100 sewage recycling

     another example is the landfillgastopower initiative pioneered by environz by applying advanced technology environz is the first operator in
     new zealand to generate electricity from methane produced by waste decomposition in landfills the amount of electricity generated is sufficient
     to power 5000 households

     avr of the netherlands generates steam via the incineration of residual waste and this enormous quantity of heat enough to warm 160000
     households find its way to many houses offices hospitals and swimming pools by using this heat avr each year prevents the emission of more
     than 324000 tonnes of co2 due to gas consumption in households if one solar panel saves around 100 kg of co2 per year the amount avr is
     saving by supplying heat is equivalent to three million solar panels

     optimising resource use
     the group recognises the importance of using resources responsibly from energy water to packaging materials it adopts resourceefficient
     technologies and measures in its key operations

     energy
     hit of the ports division is the first hong kong terminal operator that has reconfigured its dieselpowered rubbertyred gantry cranes rtgcs to
     run on electric or hybrid power not only did it result in a 50 saving in fuel consumption the new rtgcs emit significantly less noise and exhaust
     fumes than their dieselpowered counterparts

makes treated water fit for reuse or direct discharge to the environment

green island cement in hong kong collects stores and recycles rainwater for evaporation cooling at conditioning tower to improve the
performance of electrostatic precipitators to date its water consumption has been reduced from 1800 to 800 tonnes per day

packaging materials
to meet un sustainable development goal no 12 which advocates sustainable consumption and production patterns ck hutchison has
established a set of sustainable guidelines for its employees and suppliers of its retail division the guidelines are set out to minimise material
use from greener packaging design in terms of size thickness and use of space to the application of recycled materials

safeguarding environmental and natural resources
as a global citizen the group strives to play a positive role in safeguarding the environment and the ecosystems group policies help and ensure
colleagues apply caution and discipline in actions that will impact natural resources across the groups businesses

northumbrian water for example has been managing its land holdings for water storage responsibly its abberton reservoir is designated as a
wetland site of international importance both as a site of special scientific interest 1 and a ramsar site 2

timely management of the environmental impacts from the groups operations is key to protecting the values it creates for its stakeholders
northern gas networks takes ownership of the quality of land on which it operates under its land contamination management programme the
company assesses and controls quality of the land and evaluates risks from land conditions both caused by its own operations and from historical
preexisting conditions land quality is measured and reported annually to the uk regulator

taking timely actions to manage environmental impacts
in july 2016 husky energy responded to a pipeline release in saskatchewan in western canada it took full responsibility and worked closely with
the communities first nations and regulatory authorities to complete the cleanup a full and thorough investigation was undertaken and husky
energy will apply lessons learned from this to further improve its operations and response

regulatory compliance
the group is not aware of any noncompliance of laws and regulations that have a significant impact on the group relating to air and ghg
emissions discharges into water and land and generation of hazardous and nonhazardous waste during the reporting period
