take the first steps
what can you do begin with the easy things take these starting 5 steps

                       1 take control of your thermostat for every degree of change
                       for eight hours you can reduce energy use and save on your heat
                       ing and cooling costs by 1 save even more with greater or longer
                       temperature changes

                            annual savings  all customers
                            35 million pounds of co2 power for 2400 homes

                       2 switch to compact fluorescent bulbs switching five frequently
                       used lights from standard incandescent bulbs to compact fluorescent
                       bulbs saves twothirds or more of the electricity needed to power
                       these lights if they are used at least four hours each day this is a
                       savings of about 40 in the first year

                            annual savings  all customers
                            130 million pounds of co2 power for 8800 homes



                 the power of working together

                     3 wash your laundry in cold water using cold water for washing
                     eliminates the energy used to heat the 7 to 10 gallons of hot water
                     needed per load and saves you money  between 10 and 20 cents
                     per load on average customers launder about 75 loads per week

                          annual savings  all customers
                          123 million pounds of co2 power for 3300 homes

                     4 turn off the juice when not in use one of the easiest ways
                     to reduce energy consumption is to get in the habit of turning
                     things off when you finish using them if no one is watching that
                     tv turn it off if no one is in a room shut off the lights unplug
                     that second refrigerator or freezer when not needed and save
                     5 to 15 per month

                          annual savings  all customers
                          39 million pounds of co2 power for 2600 homes

                     5 look for the energy star label when shopping for new appli
                     ances and equipment choose those with an energy star label
                     depending on the type of equipment energy star models can save
                     10 to 50 of the power used by a standard model if over the next
                     few years you replace all your appliances with energy star appliances
                     your individual savings could be about 320 in annual energy costs

                          annual savings  all customers
                          550 million pounds of co2 power for 30800 homes
