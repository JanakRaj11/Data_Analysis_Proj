  waste generation in absolute terms and a 23 decrease indexed to revenue compared to 2005



energy the companys lean energy program and the use of
innovative technologies such as cogeneration and highefficiency
lighting are central to baxters approach since 2005 the
companys energy conservation efforts have achieved cumulative
savings of approximately 39 million on an annualized basis

water due to the strong link between energy usage and water
processing conserving water remains a key focus of facility
energy assessments baxter also integrates lean manufacturing
principles and tools such as value stream mapping with water
management to help sites identify areas for additional savings

waste baxter identifies its leading opportunities to decrease
waste based on factors including the highest volume waste
streams companywide facilities that produce the most waste
and sites with particularly strong potential to improve

packaging baxter works to decrease the environmental impact
of packaging by developing innovative packaging designs
that reduce the amount of materials used and substituting
environmentally preferable materials when feasible total
annualized packaging savings since 2007 equals 4300 metric
tons 86 of the 5000 metric ton reduction goal

          product stewardship 1

     baxter is dedicated to creating products that save and
     sustain peoples lives worldwide in a way that minimizes
     environmental impacts this requires a holistic approach
     from the early stages of design and materials selection through
     product manufacture transport and ultimately endoflife

     baxters sustainable design program begins with product
     sustainability review psr an assessment applied during
     the early stages of product development on all medical
     devices from intravenous solution containers to dialysis
     machines baxter uses results to confirm product feasibility
     establish product requirements and minimize potential
     health and environmental impacts

     in 2011 baxters xenium dialyzers received certification
     from the carbon trust footprinting certification company the
     second medical product to receive this certification baxters
     flexbumin albumin human  the first and only albumin
     in a flexible plastic container  was the first in 2009
     recertified in early 2012 the companys new family of
     xenium dialyzers is 1322 lighter than earlier versions
     which offers the potential for reduced fuel consumption in
     shipping and decreased biohazardous waste generation
     xenium dialyzers also use approximately onethird less
     cardboard in their packaging reducing natural resource
     use and waste removal requirements also all materials
     used in xenium are free of bisphenola

     baxter is committed to enhancing animal welfare through

           baxter will strengthen access to
           healthcare through product development
           and strategic product donations

    many factors prevent people from obtaining healthcare including
    poor infrastructure political instability lack of education poverty
    restrictive regulatory frameworks and inadequate availability
    and affordability of medical products baxter is committed to
    expanding access to healthcare globally

    during 2011 baxter continued to work with americares and
    direct relief international dri to preposition product to be
    available for emergencies as well as to meet ongoing needs in
    underserved communities for example baxter donated more
                                                than 4000 units
                                                of intravenous iv

                                                iv solutions in response
                                                to the earthquake
                                                and tsunami that
                                                struck the east coast
                                                of japan in 2011

baxters longstanding relationships with      partly funded through
americares and dri helped facilitate timely   a twoyear 85000

                                               grant from the
tsunami that struck the east coast of japan in 2011

    foundation the philanthropic arm of baxter americares india
    launched a pilot project in 2011 to provide critical onsite
    medical services and free medicines in mumbais andheri
    slums since the program began it has conducted more than
    25000 patient visits using two fully equipped mobile medical
    vans each staffed with a doctor and pharmacy assistant baxter
    employees have also volunteered to support this effort in
    october 2011 approximately 25 baxter employees joined the
    staff of americares to distribute medicines and collect data
    from more than 150 households about dietary and sanitation
    habits and medication and vaccine needs

    in 2011 combined giving from baxter and the baxter international
    foundation totaled more than 80 million the majority of
    which was focused on increasing access to healthcare

    another key aspect of baxters approach to expanding
    access to healthcare is developing product and business
    model innovations targeted at those at the base of the pyramid
    the approximately 4 billion people worldwide who each live
    on less than 1500 annually and have limited access to the
    healthcare market
