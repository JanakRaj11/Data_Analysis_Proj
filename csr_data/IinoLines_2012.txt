deteriorating tanker and dry bulk market conditions in addition a                    special traits of each and the merits of being engaged in
strong yen and rising fuel oil prices made conditions even more                        these two businesses
difficult for our oceangoing ship operations our real estate

thailand and the great east japan earthquake as a responsible           help solve important social issues the introduction of this system
corporation and also as a supportive member of the community          was in response to the strong desire expressed by our employees
because both our shipping and our real estate business generally        to provide help for reconstruction efforts and our recognition of

example among the petrochemical products we transport the             that the recovery efforts will need our continued support for some
one of our largest shipment volume last year was ethylene glycol       time we therefore plan to continue the special supporting

     in an aim to avoid the impact of volatile market the oil tanker

     many people are of the opinion that a full recovery in oil tanker

     and product tanker market will probably be after 2013 the main               we operate oil tankers and product tankers to transport oil
     reasons for the delay are the european debt crisis on top of the              and clean petroleum products etc
     global economic downturn precipitated by the lehman brothers
     bankruptcy in 2008 and the excessive tonnage supply due to a lot
     of the deliveries of newbuildings
     amid this environment the iino group will continue to strive to
     secure stable profits by maintaining existing longterm contracts
     and will actively enhance the fleet ahead of higher petroleum
     demand from emerging market economies especially in asia and
     india where economic growth is expected

the editors notes

                                          message from the editorial office
        the iino group believes that according to our the management philosophy and action charter
        business activities and philanthropy activities are not contradictory but rather interact in mutually
        beneficial ways to increase corporate value
        nowadays integrated reporting is being proposed worldwide as necessary for providing a clear and
        concise representation of how an organization demonstrates stewardship and how it creates and
        sustains value and the editing of the iino report offered an excellent opportunity to reconsider what
        sort of report would make it easy for stakeholders to obtain the overview of the iino group
        in the preparation of this report we focused on the concept that people support growth and
        evolution the theme of the companys mediumterm management plan in line with this concept in
        editing we made a point of focusing on the people of the iino group showing the faces of employees
        as well as their activities and outcomes we also attempted to utilize ecofriendly paper to print the
        report to express the companys posture of protecting the global environment moreover in designing
        this report we have considered the universal friendliness of readers affected by weakening eyesight
        and impaired color vision in order to be available to more people to the greatest extend possible
