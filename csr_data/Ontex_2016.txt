disposal of used products
we are conscious that the disposal of
absorbent hygiene products after use
is a key challenge to becoming more
sustainable in the future
used absorbent hygiene products ahp are typically collected
with municipal solid waste and treated as such within the
eu approximately 37 of municipal waste is landfilled 23
incinerated 25 recycled and 15 composted source edana
fact sheet waste management sept2014 these percentages
differ from country to country currently there is no specific
regulation for ahp waste and its management within the
eu is regulated under the waste framework directive
200898ec

within this directive the following waste hierarchy can
be found

1    prevention
2    preparing for reuse
3    recycling
4    recovery eg energy recovery
5    disposal
