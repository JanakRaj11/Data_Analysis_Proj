           entered the second phase of development to become the market leader with the best customer experience the
           core of this new phase is based on setting up a three year simplification programme 20162018 which completely
           redefines the processes that have a greater impact on the relationship with clients and agents the simplification
           plan was presented to 4500 agents and consultants gathered in rome for the first time together after completion
           of the integration on a day that also launched a new way of organising conventions

           their habits and on offering more innovative and accessible postsales and assistance services a simpler smarter
           faster approach is based on the codesign with clients and agents it envisages a new way of working inside the
           company with the active involvement of both clients and agents during all stages through focus groups tests and
           simulations




                       european legislation has provided for greater transparency with regard to remuneration the
                       transparency of information provided to customers relationships with distributors and the
                       management and monitoring of both new and existing products

                       in order to respond to the new challenges from the legislation we launched the lisa listen

                       approach as to interpret the clients needs and take their perspective this approach is also
                       a response to the markets delicate situation especially as regards unitlinked and protection
