reflecting on our past

our 2014 sustainability report marks a significant point in the history of the doe run company doe run
in 2014 we celebrated our 150th anniversary by recognizing the efforts of the past as we prepare for the
future in reviewing the records of our predecessor st joseph lead company it was both fascinating and
somewhat humbling to see the early challenges the company overcame in order to reach this landmark
anniversary from fires and floods to wars and the great depression the leaders and employees of st
joseph lead company and doe run persevered today our challenges are different but in some ways
just as daunting

we celebrated our past by sharing our history broadly with employees our communities and other key
stakeholders perhaps one of the most lasting efforts is a microsite that hosts historical photos a timeline
of 50 key events and interviews with retirees and employees that enabled us to capture our history for
generations to come

our company today

2014 was a historic
year for reasons other
than our anniversary as
it also marked the first
year of operation
following the closure of
our primary smelter in
herculaneum missouri
the closure of our
primary smelter  the
last such facility in the
us  meant our
business transitioned
dramatically today the
lead concentrates we
                                                               supporting mining on capitol hill
produce must be                   jerry pyatt testified on the critical risks facing the minerals industry before a us house of
exported in order to be                                      representatives subcommittee in 2014
converted into primary
lead metal this was a significant change for our organization as well as for the domestic industry that
depended on primary lead metal read more about how we worked with customers to prepare for the
transition

the decreased production of lead metal in the us placed north america in a deficit of 63000 metric
tonnes this deficit was made up by record imports in 2014 imports of lead metal to the us reached an
alltime high of 464000 metric tonnes and as a nation we became even more dependent on foreign metal
production

our smelter closure also meant a transition for our operational organization we created a metals division

in 2014 which combines all operations and personnel from our resource recycling secondary smelter
facility with our continuing refinery and alloying operations at the herculaneum property

remediation of the smelter property in herculaneum is underway and is expected to take until at least
2020 a portion of that property was leased to riverview commerce park llc and converted to a shipping
port along the mississippi river two companies use the port to transport fracking sand and total shipping
increased from around 100000 tons in 2013 to approximately 600000 tons in 2014

our secondary smelter in boss missouri now represents our sole producer of lead metal for the company
this smelter receives lead scrap and recycles it for future use the companys earliest miners likely never
conceived that the metal they produced more than 100 years ago would continue to be in circulation today
nor could they have envisioned that today more than 80 percent of all lead is used in batteries to power 1
billion passenger vehicles globally the 99 percent recyclability of leadacid batteries is a modern
sustainability story

in 2014 doe run and the north american lead recycling industry as a whole faced limited lead scrap
availability which increased costs for feed materials in addition we continue to finetune our processes to
meet the increased domestic demand for secondary lead and alloys as well as to address environmental
requirements specialty lead alloys are critical to our future as they help power advanced battery
chemistries in hybrid vehicles including a prototype nghv natural gas hybrid vehicle dodge ram 1500
truck doe run showcased the truck at missouri university of science and technology in fall 2014 other
auto manufacturers also are exploring advanced leadcarbon batteries for stopstart hybrid vehicles that
combine traditional gasolinepowered engines with electric motors to reduce carbon emissions and
improve mileage we are proud to be a part of efforts like this that contribute to a more sustainable world

as part of the overall lead industry doe run continues to take on leadership roles with trade organizations
such as the international lead association  association of battery recyclers and battery council
international these organizations champion innovative new uses for lead and proactively establish
programs to promote safety in 2013 lead manufacturing and mining companies industrywide introduced
voluntary targets to reduce workforce bloodlead levels for all employees to below 30 micrograms per
deciliter µgdl by the end of 2016 bloodlead levels are the trace amount of lead the body absorbs
through occupational exposure the us occupational safety and health administration requires that
employees of lead industry companies be removed from their jobs if their bloodlead levels exceed 53
μgdl on a six month average

doe run has taken an even more protective approach by proactively monitoring employees bloodlead
levels on a monthly basis if they exceed 19 μgdl at the southeast missouri mining and milling division or
15 μgdl at the metals division we remove employees from exposed areas if they exceed 30 μgdl

a commitment to safe work conditions is our number one priority and doe run achieved a number of
safety milestones and awards this year including a perfect safety record for 15 years at our fabricated
products inc fpi subsidiary in arizona in addition our mine rescue teams achieved top honors
including the title of national champions read more about both here

other challenges for the year included some land depressions and sinkholes that appeared in april on our
west fork mine property used as an entry point for our other mines the depressions and the subsequent
additional inflow of water into the west fork mine required us to close the site we continued to address
the situation throughout the year working with all appropriate agencies more information can be found
here

looking forward

overall 2014 was an eventful year for doe run as we adjusted to the changing nature of regulatory and
market forces the loss of americas ability to turn an important mineral into metal for domestic
manufacturers must be underscored such a loss jeopardizes the future of battery producers and also
means the us has lost the opportunity to capture the valueadded economic benefit of the full supply
chain for that reason i was honored to be called to testify before the us house committee on natural
resources subcommittee on energy and mineral resources in july 2014 to share how regulations
impacting mining and metal production such as those that impacted our primary smelter put our country
on a dangerous path of foreign dependence

doe run supports continuous improvement and sound sciencebased policymaking however we believe
that in some areas regulatory agencies are overreaching and creating burdensome regulations that are
not based on health risks the result for our company is record environmental spending the last two years
at the price of research and innovation opportunities

our industry must explore innovations in mineral recovery increased energy density and revolutionary
technologies like our proposed lead electrowinning process however competing resource allocations
such as those to address new regulations impede our ability to bring new technologies to fruition we
must continue to pressure our regulators to take a right and responsible approach backed by sound
science we invite interested parties to visit our new website wwwwearedoeruncom to learn more and
show their support

if you are reading this report you are important to us we work hard to obtain the opinions of our
stakeholders through qualitative and quantitative surveys according to our 2014 survey we know safety
and jobs are a primary concern wed like to know more please consider answering a few questions on
our online survey or email me at the below address

finally it is an honor to preside over a company at this historic juncture in our history despite our
challenges we are optimistic that the intrinsic importance of minerals and metals and the need of society
to recycle and reuse products in a sustainable fashion bode well for doe run and the lead industry  the
most recycled metal on the planet

celebrating 150 years of missouri mining and metal
production
   sustainability2014doeruncom 150thanniversary

march 2014 marked the 150th anniversary of the doe run company doe run and its predecessor st
joseph lead company which traces its roots to an 1864 land purchase of 946 acres in bonne terre
missouri the company honored its anniversary with a yearlong celebration of its past and current
employees its local communities and minings contribution to missouris history and economy

a crossfunctional team of 10 employees from the companys mines mills recycling facility and corporate
headquarters planned the anniversary activities the committee focused on community events and public
education through local media coverage and a regional advertising campaign titled mined here produced
here recycled here employed here

our goal was to educate our communities about our role in missouris history and to commemorate how
mining and metal production shaped the states economy in the past and continues to contribute to society
today said senior communications liaison and campaign manager tammy stankey

the 150th anniversary education campaign included

    the doeruncelebrates150com interactive timeline documenting 50 key events in the companys
    history
    a brochure highlighting historical facts shared with 3000 employees and retirees and distributed at
    community events
    a video documentary utilizing historical film and employee interviews recorded at the missouri
    historical mine museum
    a series of miners moments in which employees shared their favorite company memory with the
    community on local radio stations
    a historical photography slide show presented during old miners days in viburnum missouri
    participation in nine community parades and events
    appreciation gifts and celebrations for employees and retirees
    a print radio and billboard advertising campaign to highlight the number of people employed and
    the volume of ore mined and leadacid batteries recycled by doe run

we spent months uncovering documents and photos that captured doe runs rich and resilient history
and we are proud to share that history with community members  many of whom have a direct
connection to doe run and our predecessors said jim husman doe run senior resource geologist for
more than 30 years throughout its early history the company persevered through floods wars
rudimentary mining and smelting techniques and the great depression when ore at the original location
was nearly depleted company geologists discovered the viburnum trend which is today a worldclass
ore body and an operation renown as an innovator for safe hightonnage underground mining throughout
the world im proud to be a part of this history and help preserve it for decades to come

to highlight some of the companys rich tradition of innovation doe run showcased a refurbished st joe
shovel the worlds first electric shovel for mining that was designed by company engineers originally built

in 1922 the shovel was one of only 52 that were built to replace hand shoveling in the companys missouri
mining operations a typical handshoveling employee loaded about 21 tons of rock in one day with the st
joe shovel an operator could load nearly 300 tons each day by comparison today doe run operates
frontend loaders underground that weigh 34 tons with a capacity of 9 tons in each bucket load the
restored shovel traveled to seven missouri parades in 2014

innovation within the industry continues today and in 2014 doe run in partnership with the advanced
lead acid battery consortium showcased a prototype dodge ram 1500 powered by natural gas and
advanced leadbased batteries at the missouri university of science and technology as part of educating
future engineers about technologies that can reduce carbon emissions improve fuel efficiency and utilize
natural resources to power affordable hybrid vehicles

doe run has a proud history as both a great employer and an innovator said jerry pyatt doe run
president and ceo few companies today have thrived as long as we have weve done so as a result of
the efforts of our employees our commitment to safety and our desire to find new and better ways to do
things as proud as i am of our history im even more pleased with the opportunities we are working on
today to make missouri mining and metal production more sustainable for generations to come

doe run continues to operate the secondlargest lead mining district in the world and one of the largest
singlesite lead recycling smelters global demand for lead is expected to grow 5 to 6 percent annually to
16 million metric tons per year by 2025 whether by researching the recovery of valuable metal from
legacy mine waste products diversifying metal products from its secondary plant or by exploring potential
uses for the companys proprietary lead electrowinning process doe run continues to innovate to meet
the demands of the future

listening to our community
   sustainability2014doeruncom communityresearchresults

mark coomes vice president  human resources and community relations for doe run believes that
gathering community feedback helps doe run better learn how to meet the communitys needs the best
way to ensure we are acting as good neighbors is to ask our communities what we are doing well and
where there is room for improvement said coomes our 2014 community survey revealed that nearly 80
percent of respondents believe doe run has a good relationship with our communities while this is an
improvement of nearly 20 percentage points since 2012 it also shows we still have progress to make
gathering this feedback helps us be an even better neighbor

since the company was founded doe run and the communities in which it operates have grown together
the company thrived thanks to the hard working employees driving its operations and the company giving
back to these communities by helping to build infrastructure schools and more doe run continues to keep
its local communities in mind when making business decisions thats why in 2014 doe run again
surveyed its communities to learn what matters most to them

more than 300 residents from the areas where doe run operates  including boss herculaneum
viburnum and the area known as the old lead belt in st francois county missouri  completed
surveys for the study conducted by the survey institute of st louis

community notes jobs and economy are key concerns

nearly 60 percent of respondents said their most important concern is economic issues such as jobs
unemployment and the high cost of living

we know good jobs and a strong local economy are a major concern for our neighbors said steve batts
general manager southeast missouri mining and milling division semo we strive to employ people in
the areas where we operate in 2014 we employed more than 1400 people from 22 missouri counties
and hope to continue providing goodpaying jobs for our communities

jobs are important to communities and important to us in fact we face an interesting challenge in the
near future  like many industries the mining industry has a large portion of its workforce nearing
retirement age we are in great need of young students to pursue degrees and careers that support
mining and metal production

the mining industry is expected to grow by 5 to 6 percent annually through 2025 in addition the society
for mining metallurgy and exploration estimates the industry will need 78000 new workers by 2019 to
replace retiring workers and support industry growth

in missouri alone mining operations indirectly support more than 33380 jobs in a highly skilled high
paying profession according to the national mining associations 2014 study compensation for
employees in doe runs metals and semo divisions averages 75934 excluding benefits which is 54
percent higher than missouris average wage of 49215

we know that many of our positions are very technical and require specific education said batts
because of this we support minerals education for elementaryage students and other programs that we
hope spark an interest in a mining or engineering career among our local students so they can pursue the
needed education and return to be our future workforce

doe run employees visit schools and youth organizations to teach students about mining and the uses of
minerals in everyday life with fun activities

activities like chocolate chip cookie mining teach children what goes into running a mining operation in a
fun handson way said batts we enjoy visiting classrooms or youth organizations anytime were invited
weve also made minerals education teaching tools available on our website

the company annually provides more than 10000 in scholarships for students in doe runs
communities studying chemistry engineering mining and geology students can apply for the scholarships
by contacting financial aid departments at mineral area college and missouri university of science and
technology

again this year community members told us they want to know that their family members friends and
neighbors are safe while working at doe run facilities said coomes we agree thats why were
committed to training all of our employees about job safety working safely is essential to ensure the well
being of our employees and keep our operations running smoothly

the company continues to implement safety programs like job safety analysis and behavior based
safety these programs encourage employees to think through a job before they begin and offer
guidelines to supervisors on providing immediate feedback about safety practices continuous
improvement keeps safety top of mind employees companywide completed nearly 19000 health and
safety training hours in 2014

scenarios read more about doe runs safety achievements at awards and achievements 

operating responsibly

doe run and its neighbors share a rich environment in southeast missouri

in the 2014 survey our community members said doe run improved in minimizing its environmental
impact said coomes weve been working diligently over the years to improve processes at our
operations and invested 719 million in total environmental spending in 2014 as good stewards in our
communities read more at optimizing environmental investments

in 2014 doe run and its employees focused on conservation efforts to preserve the regions natural
beauty employees joined the nature conservancy to clear overgrown trails and repair portions of
boundary fences at grasshopper hollow the largest fen in north america doe run volunteers also

doe run continues to strive to accurately measure its environmental economic and social data due to
rounding some percentage totals may not always equal 100 percent but are accurate

optimizing environmental investments
   sustainability2014doeruncom optimizingenvironmentalinvestments

water is essential to life on earth covering roughly 71 percent of the planet in southeast missouri where
doe run operates water sustains diverse plant and animal life and supports fun activities such as
fishing swimming and floating doe run continually explores ways to manage the water present in its
operations as part of its commitment to being a good steward of this important natural resource

in 2014 doe run invested approximately 7 million on water treatment research and construction costs at
its southeast missouri mining and milling division semo

maximum capacity

an estimated 38 million gallons of water flow naturally into doe runs six mines and other facilities daily as
part of addressing significantly more stringent water quality standards an advanced water treatment plant
similar to a municipal water treatment plant began operating at brushy creek mine and mill it collects
and treats the water to meet discharge standards before its returned to nearby streams

we are diligent with our water treatment and complete tests to confirm that the water meets water quality
standards said kevin james doe run environmental engineering supervisor one way we qualitytest
treated water is to make sure that even very sensitive species can thrive in it while this may seem
unimportant to humans it is an important part of the water ecosystem

throughout its first year of operation it became apparent that the brushy creek water treatment plant had
potential to treat an even greater volume of water than originally anticipated doe run worked with the
plant designers to carefully analyze the flow of water through the treatment process and identified
opportunities for processing improvements in the system the plant designers proposed alternative
equipment such as larger water pumps that could accommodate higher volumes

the brushy creek plant originally cost approximately 8 million to build but by investing an additional
500000 in modifying the plants design we almost doubled its capacity to accommodate additional water
volume said dan buxton project manager at semo this helps us to meet our responsibilities to the
environment and our communities as well as support the financial health of our business

because the water at each mine is unique different technologies may be deployed to meet the needs of a
particular mine for example the brushy creek water treatment plant runs a flocculation process in which
chemicals encourage metal particles to cluster together to settle out of the water before it is released a
similar water treatment plant is being constructed at buick mine and mill and will begin operating in 2015

doe runs water treatment efforts resulted in improvement at all divisions in 2014 the total amount of
lead and zinc in discharged water from all doe run facilities decreased by approximately 25 percent and
22 percent respectively

a pilot plant tested a different water treatment process in 2014 for use at other locations including no 29
mine the process called electrocoagulation removes metal particles from water using electrical currents
in 2015 the glover and herculaneum facilities will test electrocoagulation for the treatment of water at the
site

doe run also is exploring ways to manage surface water at its mine and mill sites in 2014 the company

built a retention pond at no 29 mine that collects storm water runoff the water is then pumped to a series
of collection basins where metals and impurities settle out

enhanced storage

protecting minerals in our care especially concentrates is another component of doe runs
environmental programs the company invested approximately 23 million on construction of concentrate
enclosures and baghouses at its mills since 2011 in 2014 doe run spent approximately 68 million to
add a concentrate enclosure and baghouse at sweetwater mill like those installed at brushy creek mill in
2012 and buick mill in 2013 the enclosure and baghouse reduce the potential for emissions from
concentrate handling the enclosures also help maintain the quality of milling concentrates by protecting
them from wind rain and snow plans are underway to construct the final concentrate enclosure and
baghouse at fletcher mill in 2015


brushy creek enclosure

an enclosed storage building similar to this one at
brushy creek mine and mill was constructed in 2014
to house concentrates at sweetwater mine and mill

brushy creek baghouse

employees regularly examine doe runs baghouses
like this one at brushy creek mine and mill to replace
air filters and monitor that equipment is working
properly

resource recycling baghouse

employees check monitoring data on baghouse
operations baghouses capture potential fugitive
emissions

maximum efficiency

innovation by semos environmental team and doe
runs information technology team also improved
efficiency and accuracy for collecting water sample
data together the teams created a customized
laboratory information management system lims
that improved data tracking

previously a lab technician manually entered the water sample data into a spreadsheet said amy
sanders environmental compliance supervisor now that data from the water samples is automatically
transferred from lab machines to the new lims database reducing time and the chance of human error as
a result we can analyze the water sample data earlier and respond quicker to make any necessary
adjustments to our treatment process

the company plans to launch the water sample tracking system at its herculaneum and glover facilities in
2015


remediation restoration and recreation
   sustainability2014doeruncom remediation

when mining companies plan for the future theyre focused on more than exploration and development
they are just as active in planning the future remediation of current mines that will eventually close
preparing for mine closure and remediation is all a vital part of the life of the mine planning process
explains mark yingling vice president  environmental health and safety at doe run our commitment to
operating responsibly includes planning for the future of the site once it closes our goal is to make closed
sites a benefit to the local area

st joe state park in park hills missouri provides a great example of how a closed site can be converted
to a new purpose in 1976 st joseph lead company a doe run predecessor company donated land to
the state of missouri that previously housed both st joe company mining and milling operations as well
as the operations of an asarco inc subsidiary at the time the site was vegetated over the years the
site became one of missouris most popular and profitable state parks with offroad atv riding swimming
beaches bike and equestrian trails campsites and a museum

decades of atv use destroyed vegetation in portions of st joe state park in 2011 doe run remediation
crews began working at the site under an agreement with the us epa and in cooperation with missouri
department of natural resources mdnr  state parks department to remediate the site in a different
manner completed in 2014 efforts included covering and stabilizing tailings sandsized rock left over
from the milling process covering 325 acres of trails with gravel building drainage swales to control water
runoff and erosion and building water retention ponds previous work included replacing sand at a
swimming beach and replacing mine chat with gravel at camping sites the parks continued maintenance
will be handled by mdnr nearby doe run remediation crews also addressed and improved storm water
controls at a number of former mine sites including leadwood rivermines and elvins all located in the
old lead belt area

tristate area

mining also took place by various companies in an area known as the tristate area of kansas oklahoma
and southwest missouri production began in the 1850s and 1860s in the joplingranby area of jasper
and newton counties of southwest missouri and continued until the closure of the picher mines in 1967
today doe run contractors are addressing some chat and tailings sites in the area remediation efforts
began in 2014 at a former mine site in jasper county those efforts which include removing chat and
tailings regrading the site and reseeding plants and vegetation will be complete in 2015

herculaneum

in herculaneum missouri residential yard sampling and soil remediation efforts are nearing completion as
a result of the closure of the herculaneum smelter in 2013 remediation crews continued to sample yards
within a 15 mile radius of the former smelter in 2014 and yards identified with elevated levels of lead in
the soil will be remediated by the end of 2015 final yard sampling and remediation if needed will take
place following completion of reclamation at the smelter site

after ending smelting operations doe run quickly turned to identifying future uses for the site to ensure
the land continues as an economic driver for the herculaneum community said chris neaville doe runs
asset development director and herculaneum native riverview commerce park llc rcp has

successfully transitioned existing river and rail infrastructure into a growing shipping operation

in november 2014 mdnrs voluntary cleanup program approved the remedial plan for areas of the
former smelter site now utilized by rcp the plan includes adding an approximately threefoot deep layer
of soil across portions of the property which will prepare the area for further development of expanded port
operations as a part of this effort the company had to remove trees from its property doe run will donate
trees to the city over the next few years to support the city of herculaneums tree city usa designation

from smelting to shipping

in herculaneum about 18 acres of doe runs property along the mississippi river now operates as a
vibrant shipping port

building on a successful first year of operation in 2013 rcp partnered with the jefferson county port
authority to add a new barge fleeting area on the mississippi river near the rcp port the barge fleeting
area allows barges to park closer to the port which makes loading and unloading more efficient the
construction of the fleet area began in 2014 and was completed in early 2015

the shipping operations surpassed our expectations during its first two years said mark denton project
manager for rcp what began at around 100000 tons of sand increased to approximately 600000 tons in
2014 with the staging area and an upcoming second dock we anticipate handling more than 1 million
tons of material and maintaining a 12person workforce at the site by the end of 2015

supporting daily operations

in addition to remediating closed sites remediation crews regularly support daily doe run operations in
2014 crews assisted with repairs of land depressions and sinkholes that appeared on or near company
property at the west fork mine site part of a depression occurred in a portion of the west fork stream
bed that crosses doe run property after inspecting the site and obtaining permission from the us army
corps of engineers and mdnr crews rerouted a portion of the stream in order to help it maintain its
normal flow as part of the process doe run staff collected fish from the old channel and relocated them
into the new channel so there was minimal loss of fish the new channel has since shown normal aquatic
biology and water flow

separately in october 2014 a tailings pipe at the companys sweetwater mine and mill broke allowing
mostly water and tailings to spill onto the ground on doe run property and eventually making its way onto
private property a small amount entered adair creek with a very small amount reaching logan creek
remediation crews worked with impacted property owners to remove tailings in a safe effective manner
the tailings have been removed and impacted areas have been graded where necessary seeded and
covered with straw

missouri lead supplies a global market
   sustainability2014doeruncom missourileadsuppliesaglobalmarket

as technology advances and developing countries evolve our global economy becomes even more
closely connected thats why lead a natural resource in abundance in missouri plays a vital role in
meeting growing market demands around the world as stewards of this valued resource doe run
continues to adjust its business strategy to meet the needs of its us and international customers

over the past several years our business model has evolved in order to best serve our customers said
jerry pyatt doe run president and ceo in 2014 we reorganized our business structure by merging two
divisions to create a single metals division these efforts enable us to meet metals customers needs
efficiently through a single business center the metals division combined with our mining and fabrication
divisions enable us to continue to generate more than 1 billion annually to missouris economy and
sustain our part of the vital missouri mining industry well into the future

meeting lead metal demands

years before the closure of its primary smelting operations at the end of 2013 doe run proactively
identified opportunities to adapt its lead metal business to continue providing its unique services to
customers

in 2014 we combined our alloying refining casting and strip production in herculaneum with the
secondary smelting and recycling operations at our resource recycling facility said gary hughes
general manager doe run metals division together this new metals division meets the lead metal
production refining and alloying needs of our customers

doe run understands the specific requirements of our customers and meets those needs through
secondary production and refining said lou magdits director of raw materials metals division we
continue to serve the majority of our customers with secondary or highpurity lead

as a result of herculaneum smelters closure the us market now imports approximately 125000 more
metric tonnes of lead to replace the lead previously produced at the herculaneum smelter in total the us
imported more than 460000 metric tonnes of lead in 2014 an increase of approximately 40 percent over
2013

in preparation to continue serving the us market our resource recycling facility also has developed an
innovative technique to deliver recycled lead at the higher purity level some customers require said
magdits

through the new metals division doe run continues to supply lead alloys and secondary lead used to
manufacture leadacid batteries for vehicles backup power cell towers data centers and heavy
machinery like the baggage handling equipment used in airports

transportation in developing countries is evolving from electric bicycles and tricycles to conventional and
hybrid cars this will continue to drive the demand for leadacid batteries to power vehicles said magdits
manufacturers rely on recycled secondary lead for batteries so our resource recycling facility plays an
important role in returning recycled lead metal to use in the battery market in fact leadacid batteries are
recycled at a rate of 99 percent and our facility has the capacity to recycle more than 135 million leadacid
batteries annually

unearthing opportunities

while metal production and recycling are important
parts of our operations mining has been the
foundation of our business for 150 years said steve
batts general manager southeast missouri mining
and milling division semo we operate the second
largest lead mining district in the world and the lead
concentrates we extract near viburnum missouri are
some of the most pure concentrates available

on average lead concentrates contain approximately
45 to 50 percent lead doe runs lead concentrates far
surpass the industry average containing more than 75
percent lead prior to january 2014 a majority of doe
runs lead concentrates were transported to
herculaneum to be smelted into primary lead metal in 2014 doe run expanded its global concentrate
sales and now exports all concentrates for processing overseas including copper and zinc concentrates

over the course of the last four years we have identified and visited with smelting operations throughout
the world to establish direct relationships said john likarish doe run marketing manager

in order to supply highquality lead concentrates to the global market well into the future doe run
explores for new ore bodies in the viburnum trend as well as other sites in missouri said ross conner
vice president  exploration at doe run each year we use exploration to identify mineral reserves that will
replace the ore we mine and sustain our mining business

successful companies continuously evolve their operations said pyatt for more than 150 years our
company and its predecessors have thrived by looking toward and innovating for the future weve
sustained our company which allows us to support our local economy and meet the growing demand for
lead

the uses of lead

lead has many applications including underwater cabling for petroleum and communications industries
use in more than 1 billion vehicles worldwide protection from radiation in both medical and military
applications backup power for telecommunications roof flashing ammunition and for radiation detection
applications fabricated products inc a wholly owned doe run subsidiary manufactures many lead
materials used in these applications

roofing materials

because lead is durable and flexible lead sheets are
used in roofing to closely fit roof pitches and to
prevent leaks in fact lead roofs will outlast any other
traditional building material sometimes by hundreds
of years

scouting supply chain improvements
   sustainability2014doeruncom scoutingsupplychainimprovements

equipment powers much of doe runs mining and metal production operations can stall if equipment
requires unplanned maintenance or replacement doe run launched a supplier scouting program in 2014
to improve how efficiently and reliably it could source critical equipment parts and supplies

we asked our maintenance and production employees what challenges they face when it comes to
having the right supplies on hand when they need them said stephen ritchie doe run supply chain
manager they noted that worn hydraulic cylinders which help mechanical equipment like haul trucks
function could take up to three months to repair this can be a major setback for our operations so we
wanted to find a local business partner to work with us to repair cylinders which potentially reduces the
need to buy costly new replacement cylinders

the new scouting program identified a reliable partner in parts tek a local salem missouri company
which also helps doe run make a greater economic impact in missouri

the scouting process

doe run hired missouri enterprise which provides business consulting services for manufacturing
businesses to help identify missouri companies to support its supply chain doe run previously partnered
with missouri enterprise through its supplier development program and in 2014 missouri enterprise
awarded doe run the missouri impact award read more in awards and achievements 

the process of selecting a supplier was comprehensive

 1 missouri enterprise compiled a list of potential missouri suppliers that could meet doe runs needs
 2 the top candidates were audited by missouri enterprise on criteria such as

    can the supplier provide the materials needed within the time required
    do they meet doe runs quality standards
    will they be open to working together to identify solutions

 1 finally doe run visited companies that met the criteria to evaluate if the suppliers aligned with doe
    runs standards for safety sustainability and partnership

doe run will continue to use the supplier scouting program to identify gaps in the supply chain that
missouri suppliers can fill

reporting process
   sustainability2014doeruncom governancereportparameters

based on the global reporting initiative gri definition of materiality the doe run company doe run
determines what information to include in its sustainability report based on a variety of methods including
thirdparty quantitative and qualitative research oneonone conversations community meetings tours
and special events we include progress we have made on projects processes or challenges that have
significant economic environmental and social impact both positive and negative on our company our
stakeholders and the industries that depend on leadbased products

several steps have helped doe run senior management and functional managers determine and improve
materiality for our sustainability reports

    doe run initially adopted the gri framework in 2009 as a response to research that indicated
    audiences wanted to know more about the company its efforts to operate safely and investments to
    minimize its environmental impact positive response from the first gri report led doe run to
    expand the report in 2010 doe run added seven additional material indicators reporting above
    and beyond the minimum required for level c reporting
    a sustainability governance committee established in 2012 is charged with implementing
    programs and processes to further integrate sustainability into doe runs work including the
    indicators and processes reported in the sustainability report the committee chair also approves
    the material topics content and indicators chosen for the reports
    in 2012 doe run conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative research within the missouri
    communities in which it operates to improve how it communicates with stakeholders including
    through this report the research identified the major issues facing citizens in the community to be
    the local economy job opportunities environmental responsibility and community involvement
    in 2014 doe run again conducted research within the missouri communities surrounding its
    operations to determine any changes to the major issues facing the communities the research
    indicated that the local economy job opportunities and environmental responsibility continue to be
    top concerns to community stakeholders as well as the safety of doe run operations and the
    companys involvement in the community in addition the company has received nonsolicited
    phone calls from across the us from citizens expressing concerns about the closure of the last
    primary lead smelter in the us and its potential impact on access to lead material for security and
    outdoor activities
    in addition the sustainability governance committee and doe runs general managers identified
    the main challenges accomplishments and progress within the company in 2014 including the
    business restructure and progress on environmental projects
