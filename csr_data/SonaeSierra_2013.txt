      our business strategy continued
      our medium to longterm strategy
      research into social consumer and technological trends suggests that we are likely to see a rapid transformation in the global retail
      industry over the next decade brought about by the fastgrowing use of mobile internet devices demographic changes shifting
      consumer behaviour and preferences and growing segmentation between different customer groups to succeed in this new era of retail
      we will need to continue focusing on the ultimate experience of retail customers and we aim to improve this by offering premium space
      and unique shopping centre concepts which remain a destination of choice for visitors
      our business strategy to achieve this is very clear we focus our attention on the four strategic axes that we have identified as priorities




                                                                         shopping

      shopping centre specialist we aim to maximise the value captured along the complete value chain of the business for this we will
      keep an integrated approach covering development investment and management of shopping centres
      we define ourselves by our sector focus and not by the amount of capital committed to properties that means in some properties
      b we may hold a controlling position by ourselves or with partners
      b we may hold minority positions associated with management services
      b we may render services to third party owners without any capital invested by the company
      in all cases we will strive for the creation of innovative shopping concepts that will adjust and evolve in order to be the preferred choice of
      the customer

      our business strategy continued
      our medium to longterm strategy continued
      capital allocation we aim to increase our exposure to developments this will be achieved through a combination of acquiring exposure
      to new development opportunities and reducing our exposure to investment properties
      we will also shift from a mature market concentration to a greater weight of emerging markets our market priorities will be
      b brazil
      b emerging markets with significant shopping centre potential that can deliver high returns in the long term and where we may enter
        via services and
      b germany italy and romania where the objective is to reduce capital employed and adopt a developer approach
      portugal and spain will continue to be core stable markets for the company but with no prospects for new developments
      for greece the objective is to realize value in an orderly way
      services we will continue to reinforce a thirdparty service component focused on development and property management services
      this will aim to optimise the resources of the company under market fluctuations and improve knowhow on markets partners and projects
      capital intelligence we will reinforce a capitallight approach in the use of equity for this we will use partnerships with the purpose of
      minimising the capital invested in a given operation allowing us to share risk maximise returns through service delivery and improving
      knowhow
      market dominance is one of the more relevant variables when assessing shopping centre strength and mediumterm potential we will
      aim to maintain the financial capacity to commit to ambitious and relevant shopping centre projects namely in terms of accessing funds
      in debt markets for this we will aim to keep a relevant balance sheet size associated with prudent financial ratios
      underpinning all our strategic priorities our mission at sonae sierra is to provide ultimate shopping experiences to customers and to
      create outstanding value to shareholders investors tenants communities and staff while contributing to sustainable development our
      longterm strategy is to integrate sustainability within business plans and our approach aims to generate value for both our bottom line
      and society at large

      risk management
      we operate a risk management working group to serve as facilitator and promoter of risk management best practices in all parts of the
      company the working group gathers information and reports on the risks that the company is facing or may face in the future and
      reports via the cfo to the audit and compliance committee of the company
      in 2012 we reviewed our risk matrix and added two new risks  euro area break up and ecommerce  whilst the emphasis on some
      individual risks has changed due to the wider economic context in addition the working group concluded the best12 training programme
      for sonae sierra employees on the anticorruption policy our risk management targets for 2013 are to detail and quantify three risks
      included in the sonae sierra risk matrix and conduct three debates with business teams about relevant risk topics

      during the new business phase of our projects environmental due diligence and an environmental impact study are developed so that
      we can understand the potential environmental liabilities that sites may contain such as contaminated land or materials and therefore
      guarantee sufficient budget in our investment plans to adequately deal with these issues environmental due diligence is also
      implemented upon the acquisition of existing shopping centres it is reinforced by the execution of sh due diligence which
      complements the technical due diligence recommendations and provides sonae sierra with information on the capability of the existing
      shopping centres systems to perform according to sonae sierras expectations
      during the design stage we have introduced a sustainable shopping centre concept which is achieved through the implementation of
      our safety health and environment development standards sheds the sheds has historically consisted of around 179 standards
      based on our experience best available techniques and certification schemes such as leed and breeam as well as international safety
      standards nfpa  national fire protection association the sheds are revised periodically to ensure that they are kept up to date

      our business strategy continued
      safety health and environmental management system continued
      all new development projects major expansions and refurbishments15 where we have direct control have historically been required to
      achieve 100 compliance with the critical sheds standards however we have introduced an important change to the way we apply
      our safety health and environment development standards which will take effect from 2013 onwards up until 2012 whilst effectively
      we were using international certification standards such as breeam and leed as the basis for the best practice guidelines
      recommended within our safety health and environment development standards certification against these recognised schemes was
      not mandatory however we recognise that delivering buildings that are certified to internationally recognised standards is increasingly
      expected from our stakeholders and it can protect the value of our assets in the long term this is why from 2013 onwards all our new
      developments will target as a minimum breeam good leed silver or dgnb bronze our shems procedures and sheds will only retain
      critical aspects necessary to risk management and to guarantee good shopping centre performance whilst our development teams will
      be able to select the credits that will best help them achieve their certification goals
      as our business strategy evolves we are adapting our safety health and environment strategy to reflect the degree of control that we
      have over the assets that we manage in particular when we have no direct control it is important that we discuss with our partners and
      clients the best approach and strategy to meet their needs and the local market standards we have developed some guidelines to
      ensure that we apply a consistent approach across all our activities to address all possible situations the most common of which are
      described below
      for shopping centres where we provide third party development and management services we do not systematically apply our certified
      shems because this falls outside the boundaries of our responsibility however we make sure that we comply with legislation to protect
      contractors safety onsite our employees tenants and visitors through regular safety and health audits with our longterm experience
      in managing safety health and environmental impacts we are also very well placed to provide additional services such as building
      certification or alignment with iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 when these services are specifically requested by our clients
      on developments managed through a joint venture agreement without our direct control we engage with our partners to decide whether
      to implement our full shems system beyond the minimum legal requirements and compliance audits that we implement in the event
      that our partner does not wish for us to implement our full certified shems we still make sure that we comply with legislation in relation
      to both construction work onsite and building regulations of the relevant country we run data reports and data audits in relation to
      safety health and environmental issues
      the certified shems covers our business activities development investment and property management for the assets which we own or
      occupy shopping centres in development and in operation and our corporate offices each of our projects under development are
      required to ensure that risks and characteristics unique to each site are managed adequately16
      as of 31 december 2012 iso 14001 certifications had been achieved in 87 of our shopping centres in operation and ohsas 18001
      certification had been achieved in 596 with regards to the development of new shopping centres since 2004 22 sonae sierra
      construction sites have achieved iso 14001 certification and five have achieved ohsas 18001 certification the most recent is
      boulevard londrina shopping in brazil which became the third shopping centre in the world and second shopping centre in the americas
      to achieve joint iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certifications for the shems of its construction works the first to achieve both was le
      terrazze in italy which we inaugurated in march 2012 the first to achieve both in the americas was uberl√¢ndia shopping also
      inaugurated in march 2012
      we recognise that creating sustainable buildings does not end once the development has been completed we monitor the performance
      of new shopping centres with respect to energy water waste and safety and identify further improvements that need to be made to
      optimise the buildings environmental performance and reduce sh risks across our operational portfolio we have been measuring
      monitoring and targeting energy use and waste management since the year 2000 water use since 2003 and sh since 2004




      15    sonae sierra specifies three types of construction works interventions that may occur 1 new shopping centres which are managed by a development manager 2 expansion or refurbishment
            of existing centres which may be managed by a development manager or asset manager and 3 small works which may be managed by any person belonging to sierra developments
            sierra asset or sierra property management since each of these varies considerably in terms of environmental impact sh risks and intervention costs criteria have been set to establish
            the most appropriate scheme for each case all new shopping centres and expansions refurbishments and other works with a construction cost over 10 million or a construction cost of more
            than 10 of the centres open market value omv must apply the standard sheds procedure expansions refurbishments and other works with a construction cost of over 25 million but
            under 10 million or with a construction cost of less than 10 of the centres omv should apply a simplified sheds procedure finally expansions refurbishments and other works with a
            construction cost of less than 25 million should instead apply the small works procedure defined within our shems
      16    with reference to the three types of construction interventions described in the note above all new shopping centres must apply the construction works shems all expansions refurbishments
            and other works with a construction cost of more than 25 million must apply a safety health and environment management plan shemp finally expansions refurbishments and other
            works with a construction cost of less than 25 million should instead apply the small works procedure defined within our shems

      our business strategy continued
      safety health and environmental management system continued
      our energy and water metering strategy is designed to ensure effective submetering with connection to each centres bms which
      allows us to have a better control of these utilities use in 2012 we launched a new online management system called the she portal
      this tool allows us to streamline our she management processes and improve the accuracy of data and information reported by holding
      all data in one central platform which is accessible to all our staff data collection and monitoring for energy water waste and safety and
      health is managed through this database which allows each of our shopping centre management teams to input she performance data
      and generate reports that can be used to compare performance across sonae sierras portfolio and to set annual targets to improve
      performance and increase staff and tenant awareness of all issues we also monitor and evaluate safety and health performance on a
      regular basis using tools such as she preventive observations spo emergency drills and she inspections covering safetyrelated
      equipment and installations in tenant units and warehouses furthermore the annual capital expenditure budget allocated to each of
      our shopping centres includes investments to improve the centres she performance we deliver she training to our staff and other key
      stakeholders on an ongoing basis and in 2012 we delivered a total of 31680 man hours of training including meetings on she to staff
      suppliers and tenants across our shopping centres development projects and in our corporate offices

      corporate responsibility governance and management system
      at sonae sierra corporate responsibility has always meant more to us than effective safety health and environmental management
      albeit such management topics must be the foundation of our approach to being a responsible business indeed our approach to
      corporate responsibility has until now been driven by our responsibilities towards key stakeholder groups as well as the environment
      during 2012 sonae sierra continued to operate six cr working groups which between them governed all cr impact areas the heads of
      each working group were represented on our cr steering committee which was chaired by the ceo fernando guedes oliveira the cr
      steering committee was responsible for overseeing the organisations identification and management of material cr issues and
      ensuring that performance in these critical areas was monitored and improved

      cr objectives and targets
      as described above during 2012 our cr strategy was still driven by the nine material cr impact areas identified through our various risk
      management processes for each of these impact areas therefore sonae sierra had previously identified longterm objectives to drive
      continuous improvement in performance and annual targets to achieve these
      in 2013 following a strategic review of our risks and priorities going forwards as part of the development of our revised sustainability
      strategy we have concluded that our approach to managing four of these impact areas suppliers tenants communities and visitors
      and employees be fully embedded within existing business procedures as they will bring recognised value to our company and our
      stakeholders by this analysis we have set the following shortterm targets for implementation in 2013
       organise a community day
       invest a proportion of the promotional variable marketing fund of every operational shopping centre and project under development
        in communityrelated initiatives at least 2 for sites in europe and 1 for sites in brazil
      in respect to the remaining five impact areas energy and climate water waste biodiversity and habitats and safety and health we
      will maintain the defined longterm objectives but will included them under the umbrella of safe people and ecoefficiency more details

      our business strategy continued
      future sustainability strategy
      recent years have been characterised by a stark contrast in the market conditions of different regions where sonae sierra operates the
      global financial crisis in 200809 and more recently the culture of austerity that we have inherited in southern europe have both led us
      on a relentless campaign for value  be it economic social or environmental value separate from this trend we have also been conscious
      of the need to simplify and refresh our approach to corporate responsibility much of our activity that was previously branded cr is now
      sufficiently embedded in the business to make it unnecessary to govern under a cr umbrella
      as a consequence we undertook a substantive strategic review in 2012 which will result in a revised sustainability strategy for sonae
      sierra from 2013 onwards firstly we have taken a decision to change our terminology  from corporate responsibility to sustainability
      we have always viewed the latter as the business communitys contribution towards sustainable development so to us this change in
      terminology does not reflect a change in sentiment of which issues are at stake we absolutely remain committed to an agenda that
      brings together our economic social and environmental responsibilities hence our continued efforts towards more integrated reporting
      indeed we are extremely proud of the significant achievements we can claim since we introduced our cr strategy in 2006 structured
      around nine material impact areas not only have we consistently exceeded requirements placed upon us by regulators and local
      authorities but we have generated substantial cost savings and strengthened our brand and reputation amongst key opinionformers
      we are consistently being recognised for our bestinclass approach to safety health and environment which will always remain a
      foundation of our culture
      our revised sustainability strategy will therefore build heavily on previous commitments while also sharpening our focus on actions
      that can create longterm shareholder value by solving some of our societys key challenges the aim is to provide greater alignment
      between our sustainability and business goals as we adopt a creating shared value csv17 approach over and above targeting
      continuous improvements in environmental safety and health
      as we sought to apply the concept of shared value we identified a number of longerterm priorities that deliver tangible value for our
      business society and the environment addressing such issues is intended to address the principle sustainability risks facing our
      operations and safeguard our continued capacity to do business in a world where
      b natural resources are becoming increasingly scarce and costly
      b retailers are having to respond to rapid technological advances and demographic changes by adapting their business models and finding
        innovative solutions
      b evolving workplace practices and economic development mean people need access to skills and education to either gain or remain in
        employment and
      b consumers are becoming more environmentally and socially conscious and shifting towards ethical green and healthy alternatives

      conditions remain challenging

      challenging growth environment


      lack of consumer confidence in southern europe offset by continued growth in brazil
      in brazil we have continued to benefit from one of the fastest growing economies in the past few years gdp grew by 3 in 2012 and the
      retail industry continues to show strong performance as falling interest rates support consumer spending our portfolio echoed this
      trend we enjoyed double digit sales growth in all of our shopping centres and we presented one of the highest ebitda and funds from
      operations margins in the listed sector
      by contrast in portugal and spain which together represent 74 of the open market value of our european
      portfolio gdp contracted by 34 and 18 respectively measures taken to reduce public budget deficits
      contributed to reductions in family income which in turn had a knockon effect on tenant sales scarcity of debt
      remained a fundamental constraint to our development pipeline much of which continues to be on hold in these
      markets however even within europe our business benefits from its geographic spread so we achieved better
      results in european markets less affected by the crisis in fact we successfully inaugurated uberl√¢ndia shopping
      in brazil and le terrazze in italy
      as a consequence of these macroeconomic trends in the two regions the net asset value nav of our portfolios
      also fluctuated significantly over the year in brazil our nav in reais increased due to the strong operational
      performance of the portfolio while in europe this result was offset by the yields expansion
      however to counter and mitigate such adverse results we continued to focus our attention on generating
      operational efficiencies and introduced even tighter asset management controls to reduce our direct costs
      we continue to strive for high levels of service quality at lower costs wherever feasible thereby contributing
      to overall asset performance

      further growth in direct results
      in light of these external influences it is especially pleasing to note that sonae sierra succeeded in growing its direct results by 2 in
      comparison with 2011 this performance reflects a number of key strengths in our management strategy namely our strong operational
      performance our rigorous approach to cost control and our efforts to support tenants through difficult trading times indeed maintaining
      high occupancy rates is a key priority for us and given the tough market conditions for retailers in southern europe in 2012 we are
      especially proud to have maintained occupancy rates above 97 in portugal 93 in spain and 96 in italy one of the principal
      contributions we can make to our tenants resilience is to further reduce service charges through ongoing efficiencies and to work
      closely with those whom we believe have the most viable business models
      in 2012 we succeeded in decreasing our direct corporate costs this was achieved through our ongoing focus on reducing variable costs
      on rationalising our supply chain and on transferring staff from one business or geography to another this allows us to retain key skills
      within the firm and reallocate resources to growth areas where they are needed as we expand our third party services into eastern europe
      south america north africa and asia

      the economic context continued
      extracting value from capital recycling
      during 2012 the availability of appropriately priced debt remained relatively scarce we continued to employ a capitallight approach and
      to focus on opportunities to recycle capital within our business portfolio we are particularly proud to have reduced our exposure to debt
      in europe mainly through selling our interest in m√ºnster arkaden in germany in romania we entered a joint venture agreement to
      develop parklake which will further extend our presence in the region
      in brazil a successful bonds issue and the selling of our stake in three nonstrategic shopping centres has enabled us to satisfy the
      financing needs of our development pipeline over the coming years we now have two developments due for inauguration in 2013 and we
      continue to look out for opportunistic investment propositions as we aim to further strengthen our portfolio in brazil

      short to medium term economic outlook and opportunities for growth
      from an operational point of view we expect 2013 to continue to be a challenging year in europe the immediate outlook for portugal
      and spain remains weak and we expect gdp to contract further in 2013 with government austerity measures and rising unemployment
      hitting consumer spending within these markets we are witnessing a growing differentiation between valuations of primary and secondary
      retail properties while this represents an investment opportunity we expect limited prospects to recycle capital which restricts our
      ability to reinvest in italy we expect a small decrease in likeforlike tenant sales as negative gdp forecasts are likely to hit consumer
      confidence incipient investor demand for real estate assets should however improve pending the outcome of elections early in the year
      we remain more optimistic about growth prospects elsewhere in europe including germany and romania in germany we expect to see
      continuing investor interest in retail assets and gdp growth will remain close to 1 although the wider impact of austerity measures
      across the eurozone has the potential to hit consumer spending in romania we expect to see an uptake in consumer spending with
      gdp forecast to grow by 3 in 2013
      in brazil we expect inflation to remain under control so consumer spending should remain vigorous on the other hand we are
      experiencing upward pressure on land and construction costs due to the 2014 world cup and the 2016 olympic and paralympic games
      this has made it more difficult to ensure that risk returns reach the standards we would like as such we expect to see a slowdown in the
      pace of new development opportunities and will increase our focus on target acquisitions with development potential by recycling capital
      from the sale of assets we consider noncore
      having long since decided to do business in a capitallight mode it has been pleasing to see our continued success in becoming the az service
      provider to third party property players in emergent markets in northern africa and asia as well as other eu countries like croatia indeed we
      have been very successful in morocco and our recent joint venture in algeria will result in revenue growth during 2013 we also hope to expand
      our capability into china where we started operations in december and other new emerging markets in the months ahead

      operational performance
      two new centres opened their doors
      the impact of austerity measures and financial instability across the eurozone for much of the year meant that access to capital and
      debt structured at sensible commercial rates continued to be adversely affected in 2012 this inevitably constrained the scale of our
      development pipeline and a number of projects remain on hold until economic conditions improve nevertheless despite such
      constraints we inaugurated two new shopping centres in 2012 representing a total investment value of 229 million
      b le terrazze in la spezia italy was inaugurated in march and brings our total number of shopping centres in the country to five the
        shopping centre was developed as a 5050 joint venture between sonae sierra and ing real estate its 38455m2 gla hosts 102
        shops offering a high quality tenant mix including 37 local businesses as well as a fitness club and free covered parking for 2000 cars
        le terrazze was the worlds first shopping centre to achieve joint iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certification during its construction
      b also in march we inaugurated uberl√¢ndia shopping in brazil our 11th shopping centre in the country at that time the centres
        45300m2 gla features 218 shops six of which are large dimension shops 21 local tenants 21 restaurants a walmart hypermarket
        and cinema it also features a large parking lot with 2400 parking spaces and a bicycle park connected to the citys urban bicycle
        path uberl√¢ndia shopping was the first shopping centre in the americas to achieve both iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certification
        during construction

      a healthy development pipeline ahead
      we continued with our development pipeline in markets that displayed strong growth throughout 2012 and where we believe such
      conditions will continue we are completing construction on a further three shopping centres due to be inaugurated in 2013 two of which
      have been developed as joint venture agreements as part of our capital light strategy
      b in germany construction continued on hofgarten solingen in solingen a 120 million joint venture agreement with mab
        development by the end of 2012 over 70 of its 29000m2 gla was let although the site is small it will serve a catchment area of
        270000 inhabitants in a city which is presently underserved providing much needed retail space inauguration is due in october 2013
      b in brazil boulevard londrina shopping a joint development with marco zero group will have a total of 47800m2 gla  74 of which
        was already let by the end of 2012 it will serve a catchment area of more than 800000 inhabitants and will feature 236 stores
        including many brands new to the city in addition to a strong proportion of local tenants it is estimated that the new shopping centre
        will create over 3000 direct jobs and represents an investment of 88 million inauguration is due in may 2013
      b also in brazil passeio das √°guas shopping in goi√¢nia state capital of goi√°s will have 78100m2 gla serving a catchment area of
        more than 16 million inhabitants this centre represents an investment of about 167 million which will make passeio das √°guas
        shopping the largest and most modern shopping centre of the region inauguration is due in october 2013
      during 2012 we also announced a joint venture agreement with caelum development to develop parklake in bucharest romania
      construction is due to begin in 2014 and the centre will offer a high quality retail environment of around 200 shops only ten minutes from
      the city centre serving a catchment area of more than half a million people the project which represents an investment of 185 million
      has already signed contracts for 52 of its 67000m2 gla with a further 13 of the gla in advanced negotiations by the end of 2012
      we believe sustainable real estate will deliver above average returns and outperform nonsustainable real estate over the medium to
      long term from our experience investors are increasingly aware of the importance that sustainability features represent when making
      investment decisions while the translation of such features into a value premium has yet to be seen what is becoming more evident is
      that investors will tend to penalise properties lacking such features because they are at greater risk of obsolescence this places added
      emphasis on ensuring that we integrate safety health and environmental management standards into our design and construction
      processes right from the inception of a project

      operational performance continued
      upgrading the quality of existing assets
      despite the lack of investor appetite in europe we remain focused on maintaining and improving the quality of our existing assets
      through refurbishment and expansion works in 2012 we completed or commenced such works at several assets in our portfolio
      b we completed the first stage of an entire refurbishment of centro comercial continente de portim√£o a 35 million investment that
        will modernise and revitalise the interior of this important centre in the city of portim√£o
      b we finished a 1 million expansion project at guimar√£eshopping that will add over 1200m2 of gla

      grow new income streams and increase knowhow and experience
      in new and emerging markets in 2012 we continued to make real

      our property management business continued to display
      exceptional resilience in 2012 maintaining strong performance
      in both tenant sales and rental income despite falling consumer

      introduction of sunday trading and the opening of le terrazze                 resilience to retail market declines
      while in germany tenant sales were up by 01
      across our european portfolio occupancy rates remained strong at 96 thanks in part to the concrete steps we have taken to support
      our tenants mainly in portugal and spain here despite the economic conditions hitting retailers hard we saw drops of less than 1 in
      the occupancy rate per country which highlights the excellent quality of property management provided as well as the successful tenant
      mix in our shopping centres despite such downward trends in our european sales figures we are very proud to have maintained
      relatively stable income streams from our rent roll with the greatest falls being a 4 drop in spain and portugal overall we experienced
      a year on year drop in rents across our european portfolio of 04
      in brazil we are operating in a market that continues to display strong consumer sentiment on the back of rapid economic growth in
      recent years double digit increases in retail sales translated into a 14 sales growth across our portfolio thanks to low interest rates and
      sustained increases in the average net income of the population we also saw a corresponding increase in rents of 103 for the second
      year running manauara shopping  located in the northern city of manaus  once again performed exceptionally well ranking as one of
      the best shopping centre in terms of sales another highlight was shopping metr√≥pole that expanded in 2012 and rents per m2 are some
      of the best in our portfolio
      the rapid growth in retail space in brazil has meant that some smaller tenants lack the capacity and funding to take advantage of
      expansion opportunities despite this in 2012 our occupancy rates remained relatively stable at 97 moreover we managed to maintain
      high levels of tenant satisfaction which helped us secure space for our new developments we believe our high quality portfolio will
      continue to ensure we stand out from our competitors and we have focused on strengthening the quality of our assets further by offering
      new entertainment and shopping experiences

      we were also able to commence our capital recycling strategy in brazil following our successful public offering in 2011 in 2012 we issued
      bonds raising 300 million reais and sold minority stakes in tivoli shopping and p√°tio brasil shopping as well as our ownership stake in
      shopping penha the three shopping centres represented about 81000m2 of owned gla around 20 of sonae sierra brasils total
      owned gla and all three properties were classified as noncore following the strategic assessment we conducted of our assets based on
      their longterm ability to generate value sonae sierra will continue to provide management and leasing services for shopping penha and
      for tivoli shopping
      we also strengthened our portfolio in brazil following the acquisition of an additional 95 share of franca shopping and the acquisition
      of an additional 30 of share of shopping plaza sul sonae sierra brasil now owns 769 of franca shopping located in the city of
      franca s√£o paulo state with 18500m2 of gla and 105 shops this transaction coupled with the bonds issue and the sale of interests in

      we coown many others through investment funds launched in

      sierra funds performance mirrored that of our wider portfolio in
      portugal spain italy and germany where its assets are based                    in germany we took advantage of
      although its performance was boosted in 2012 as it was able to                    strong sentiment and completed the
      capitalise on high investor demand through the sale of m√ºnster                    sale of m√ºnster arkaden in germany
      arkaden by contrast the sierra portugal fund fared slightly worse               for approximately 14 above its
      given that on the one hand it focuses solely on the portuguese                  current omv following a concerted
      market and on the other it has a higher concentration of secondary              effort to improve the tenant mix and
      assets 2013 will mark a decision on the exit strategy for the sierra             achieve full occupancy
      fund and we are currently in discussions with fund investors over
      different outcomes
      we will continue to target investment opportunities in european markets that have remained more resilient to the economic downturn
      including germany where growth prospects for the shopping centre industry are likely to be more robust than in other eurozone
      countries however in 2012 we decided to postpone the launch of the sierra fund iii due to the diverging risk profile of its two target
      markets  germany and italy  and the impact this had on investor appetite for a single fund focused on both markets

      the following financial statements consolidate all the companies by the proportional method

      profit  loss accounts
      the direct net profit reached 626 million which compares with 611 million in 2011 an increase of 2 the direct income from
      investments is in line with last year the higher rental discounts and lower turnover rents in europe are compensated by higher income in
      the brazilian portfolio and the opening of le terrazze and uberl√¢ndia shopping sonae sierra was successful in the implementation of its
      costs cutting efforts in all countries where the company operates thus maintaining its ebitda higher than previous year 3
      there is an increase in the net financial costs mainly due to le terrazze and uberl√¢ndia shopping openings in 2012 and the consequent
      non capitalisation of costs in the investment and higher corporate debt in brazil  debentures issued in early 2012
      gains on sales of properties in 2012 are related with the net gain on sale of m√ºnster arkaden and the gain on sales in the brazilian
      portfolio
      impairment and development funds at risk provision are higher than last year due to the writeoff of pantheon plaza property and the
      change in the policyprovision of 100 of the assets at risk mainly in greece and romania
      the value created on investment properties is lower than in the same period of last year due to additional increases in yields in europe
      portugal spain and italy partially compensated by the small decrease in yields in brazil

      balance sheet
      the total assets of the company reached 24bn of which 2bn correspond to investment properties and 219mn are properties under
      development and concessions
      the decrease in investment properties compared with 31 december 2011 is mainly explained by the sales of m√ºnster arkaden shopping
      penha tivoli shopping p√°tio brasil and the adverse foreign exchange fx fluctuation in the brazilian portfolio partially compensated
      by the openings of le terrazze and uberl√¢ndia shopping
      properties under development are below 31 december 2011 mostly due to the openings of le terrazze and uberl√¢ndia shopping
      these were partially compensated by the ongoing investment in hofgarten solingen boulevard londrina shopping and passeio das
      √°guas shopping
      the net worth as at 31 december 2012 is lower than that at 31 december 2011 due to the negative current year result the dividends
      distributed in 2012 and the adverse variance in translation reserves namely due to depreciation of the brazilian real
      bank loans are lower when compared with 31 december 2011 mainly due to the m√ºnster arkaden sale partially compensated by the new
      bond loan in brazil and the normal increase in debt in the properties under development

      indirect net profits
      indirect net profits arise either from the change in value of the investment properties or the realisation of capital gains on the sale of
      assets andor shareholding positions
      the indirect result is 225 million below last year due to a high decrease in the value of the existing portfolio value created in investment
      properties in 2012 was heavy penalised by the yield expansion in portugal spain and italy as a consequence of the economic crisis in
      europe and due to the writeoff of pantheon plaza property despite the gain in 2012 on the m√ºnster arkaden sale

      balance sheet
      the investment properties decreased its balance by 139 million when compared with 31 december 2011 this decrease is explained
      by the sales of m√ºnster arkaden and the value decrease of the portfolio in 2012 partially compensated by the opening of le terrazze
      bank loans are below those at december 2011 mainly due to the sale of m√ºnster arkaden

      environmental performance
      as early as 1998 we had developed and approved our ambitious environmental policy
      defined environmental requirements for inclusion in shopping centres design
      specifications and developed our environmental management system ems
                                   our shopping centres were the first in their countries to pilot environmental practices and technologies and our
                                   company has received numerous international awards for demonstrable improvements in environmental
                                   performance we have a robust system in place to monitor our environmental impacts and measure performance
                                   across all the sites where we operate improving our environmental performance across all our activities has
                                   benefitted our business in several ways we have saved costs by making our operations more ecoefficient
                                   enhanced our reputation and begun to future proof our assets against natural resource shortages moreover
                                   we are helping to lead our sector towards a more sustainable way of doing business in 2012 our property funds

      the environmental context
      reducing energy use and tackling climate change
      as specialist in shopping centre development ownership and management with properties in several geographies we can  and must 
      play a significant part in increasing the energy efficiency of the buildings we operate which are our main source of energy use by increasing
      energy efficiency in buildings we can help manage greenhouse gas ghg emissions and contribute to tackling climate change
      regulations on the energy consumption and ghg emissions of buildings are
      becoming more stringent across the globe including in emerging markets which
      we may be expanding into this means that highenergy consuming and carbon
      emitting buildings will be less desirable to investors and occupiers in the future
                                                                                                          our objective is to
      so by reducing the energy consumption and ghg emissions associated with
      our shopping centres we also aim to avoid costs and make our properties                             achieve a 70 reduction
      more attractive                                                                                    in ghg emissions per m2
      we are moving towards this objective on the right by seeking a maximum
                                                                                                          of gla by 2020 as
      average electricity consumption of 400kwh per m2 mall and toilet area per                         measured against a
      year across our shopping centres by 2020 we work with each of our centres to                       2005 baseline
      develop energy performance targets and to design new centres which are
      energy efficient
      we apply our safety health and environment development standards which specify the use of energy efficient boilers air conditioning
      units and other equipment such as lighting and appliances we also require all development managers to consider the use of renewable
      and lowcarbon technologies such as natural ventilation and combined heat and power wherever possible during design and we
      investigate opportunities for onsite generation of renewable energy at our shopping centres as well as for procurement of green
      electricity through the grid
      aside from the energy used by the buildings themselves we also seek to reduce the energy consumption and ghg emissions generated
      by associated activities such as vehicle emissions produced by people visiting our shopping centres or by staff travelling to and from
      work or on business trips most of our centres display public transport timetables and have cycle storage facilities for tenants and
      visitors we have green travel plans aimed at improving the accessibility of our shopping centres by public transport bicycle and foot
      emissions are also produced by tenants occupying our centres and we make efforts to advise and educate our tenants about saving
      energy and reducing ghgs from their activities
      our construction contractors too can be big energy users during initial construction major refurbishments or expansions we make sure
      contractors strictly adhere to our safety health and environment management system which includes guidelines for monitoring energy
      consumption and achieving greater energy efficiency we give preference to the use of demolition materials in construction as well as
      materials sourced within a 500km distance of the site in question
      all of our activity on energy and climate change is guided by our climate change strategy which was developed in 2006 this covers both
      our direct and indirect ghg emissions as set out in the guidelines of the ghg protocol developed by the world resources institute and
      the world business council for sustainable development we aim to develop and implement by 2020 a longterm climate change
      adaptation strategy covering investment development management and corporate activities
      outside of our own boundaries we advocate strongly for our industry and other sectors to improve their practices on energy and
      climate change in particular we support the 2c challenge communiqu√© signed in 2011 which calls for more global government action
      in this area

      the environmental context continued
      conserving freshwater
      as demand for fresh water becomes ever greater around the world due to population growth urbanisation increased economic activity
      and climate change we need to ensure we have adequate supplies for all our shopping centres particularly those in areas that are
      vulnerable to shortages such as portugal spain and greece
      by improving our water efficiency and avoiding water pollution we can reduce our exposure to water scarcity risks and minimise our
      water footprint which prepares us for potential future legislation and avoids costs by making sure our water use is responsible we not
      only help to maintain our supplies we contribute to global efforts to properly manage this precious resource
      one of our key objectives in this area is to attain a level of water consumption at or below three litres per visit  aggregated across all our
      shopping centres  by 2020
      we use the global water tool developed by the world business council for sustainable development to identify new or existing shopping
      centres that are at risk of water stress or scarcity when new projects are started or existing ones refurbished our safety health and
      environmental development standards stipulate that waterintensive equipment such as water cooled chillers must be avoided while at
      the same time taking into consideration the impact substitute equipment can have on other environmental impacts such as energy use
      we set requirements for water efficient sanitary equipment  such as sensor spray taps waterless urinals and low flush toilets  and we
      require that all design and equipment specifications maximize the opportunities for water use reduction and water recycling where
      feasible we also include rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems into new projects to reduce the need for freshwater or
      municipal water consumption and by 2020 at least 10 of total water consumed at our shopping centres will be reused greywater or
      harvested rainwater we have water meters in all our shopping centres which allow us to identify unusually high patterns of usage which
      will lead to new management measures
      it is also important to monitor and control water use in exterior areas of our centres for this reason our landscape projects must use
      efficient irrigation systems and we minimise the planting of species that have high water demands
      aside from using water efficiently we make sure we are dealing properly with our wastewater we have a wastewater quality standard
      that goes beyond existing legal requirements and by 2020 we aim to ensure that all discharges to local watercourses comply with this
      standard our shopping centres have up to five separate wastewater collection systems each allowing different types of wastewater to
      be reused or treated during the design phase of a shopping centre we also incorporate measures that reduce pollution to local water
      sources for instance by specifying that filter drains and porous paving must be fitted in external paved areas to prevent pollution from
      rainwater runoff stormwater management plans are agreed according to a sites characteristics and we also place strict demands and
      controls on our contractors over the risk of water pollution from their construction activities
      we aim by 2020 to have developed and implemented a longterm strategy to have a secure water supply with a particular focus on
      locations that are vulnerable to water shortages

      the environmental context continued
      better waste management
      the construction and running of shopping centres can generate large volumes of waste that if not managed properly ends up in landfill
      landfill waste is not only an inefficient use of resources the waste and the land it can generate damaging greenhouse gas emissions
      such as methane and carbon dioxide as well as pollutants that can leach into the soil and groundwater
      good waste management can reduce our impact on the environment but it can also save us money  for instance through reduced
      landfill tax bills and disposal costs or by cuts in consumption of raw materials additionally it ensures we are ready for more stringent
      regulation around the world when it comes as waste management is increasingly heavily regulated particularly in relation to restrictions
      on the use of landfill no company can afford to be behind the curve in this area
      we want to encourage the people who use our shopping centres to reduce the waste they generate if we do so we contribute to the
      general global effort to reduce reuse recycle recover and responsibly dispose of waste enhancing our reputation as a business that
      cares about the environment
      we take a progressive approach to waste management during construction work of shopping centres and our contractors are required to
      report back to us the results of waste management plans that are agreed in advance we are committed to designingout waste
      produced during building work  for example through offsite prefabrication  and where possible we specify endoflife recycling for
      building components which is particularly relevant for our refurbishment activities
      our safety health and environment development standards include a series of design requirements to maximise the waste separation
      potential of every shopping centre we develop
      once a shopping centre is built and operational most waste comes not from ourselves but from our tenants however we provide waste
      management services to our tenants which means we can have a positive influence on their recycling rates and waste management
      practices  not just by investing in excellent waste separation services but by finding new waste disposal opportunities such as onsite
      composting and incineration with energy recovery or by carrying out awareness raising activities
      we aim to progressively improve each shopping centres waste recycling rate and have set an objective to obtain a minimum average
      recycling rate of 55 and a maximum average landfill rate of 30 aggregated across all our shopping centres by 2020

      protecting biodiversity and habitats
      by far the most important reason for the unprecedented loss of biodiversity around the world in recent decades has been the destruction
      and alteration of habitats so as a responsible citizen we need to play our part in avoiding this wherever possible our main impact on
      biodiversity results from the development of land particularly when projects are built on undeveloped greenfield sites that are most
      likely to be rich in biodiversity or to perform valuable ecosystem services and functions
      as well as causing damage to biodiversity and habitats development on ecologically sensitive sites can increase the likelihood of
      opposition from local communities to our shopping centres resulting in expensive delays to or rejections of planning applications it also
      increases the risk of fines due to pollution or litigation through environmental liability laws
      on the other hand constructing on previously developed land and enhancing the ecological value of contaminated sites can bring
      benefits to the local economy environment and community this can increase support for new projects and enhance our reputation
      we strive to protect and enhance biodiversity on existing sites and new projects and for these reasons we have set an objective to
      promote the use of previously developed land for new shopping centre projects and to protect and enhance biodiversity wherever
      possible
      before land acquisition or any expansion of existing sites we carry out evaluations to identify the potential biodiversity impacts of
      building work on the site and of the operation of the shopping centre afterwards these evaluations identify mitigation measures that will
      help to preserve biodiversity and habitats and we monitor the implementation of these over time
      once work goes ahead our safety health and environment development standards require that premium ecological features must be
      preserved throughout construction and integrated into the landscape design all other relevant ecological features should be preserved
      to the greatest extent possible with native flora used on all outdoor soft landscaping works exotic or nonindigenous plants are avoided
      flat roofs are considered for planting and preference is given to the use of green barriers such as hedgerows rather than fences
      once construction is completed biodiversity impacts that may result from the daytoday operations of our centres  such as waste
      disposal and water consumption  are monitored we also seek to raise awareness of biodiversity through marketing events and other
      initiatives among shopping centre staff and visitors

      tackling greenhouse gas emissions associated with visitors travel
      the most significant contribution to our carbon footprint is from visitors travel to our shopping centres in 2012 visitors travel accounted
      for 83 of our total carbon footprint a 13 decrease compared to 2011
      whilst we neither control our visitors nor our employees travel to and from our sites we can seek to influence it we have developed
      green travel plans for 12 of our shopping centres and two corporate offices to promote the use of public and environmentally friendly
      transport some of the initiatives implemented as part of our green travel plans have included creating bicycle parking areas
      establishing walkways for pedestrians cooperating with local authorities to create new bus routes or additional bus stops and organising
      green transport campaigns

      reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption
      we have more direct control over our scopes 1 and 2 emissions which are associated with energy consumption in our operational shopping
      centres corporate offices and by our company car fleet scope 1 emissions decreased by 10 in 2012 compared to 2011 67 of these
      emissions are generated by the two cogeneration plants which we own at norteshopping and maiashopping in portugal the remaining
      emissions are linked to the use of boilers at 18 shopping centres our company car fleet and coolant leakage from airconditioning units
      we ensure that all equipment is used and maintained adequately and we repair equipment producing abnormal leakage we also procure
      more energy efficient boilers when they are renewed which has allowed us to reduce our natural gas consumption
      scope 2 emissions driven by electricity and hot and cooled water use increased by 141 in 2012 compared to 2011 this was due to the
      updating of electricity emissions factors and the inclusion of energy purchased on behalf of tenants


        energyefficient lighting bring multiple benefits in brazil
        challenge
        our two shopping centres in brazil  parque d pedro shopping and franca shopping  needed
        to make concerted efforts to reduce their energy consumption not just to meet the companys
        environmental targets but to save money on operating costs as part of these efforts we
        introduced the emc2 energy  money conservation control initiative which aims to reduce
        energy consumption at these two shopping centres
        solution
        during 2012 parque d pedro shopping invested approximately 126000 r315000 replacing hundreds of ordinary 150w light bulbs
        with 56w led equivalents throughout the centre at franca shopping adjustments included changes to lighting timer controls better
        use of natural light in the food court reduced lighting at nighttime and daily monitoring of energy consumption to identify hotspots
        results
        at parque d pedro shopping the changes have reduced the centres annual electricity consumption by 118000kwh as an added
        benefit the led lights are much less likely to overheat or short circuit reducing fire risks because they need less maintenance
        there is also greatly reduced use of the centres elevation platform to lift maintenance workers up to light fittings  which reduces
        the risk of accidents led lights are now being installed in the shopping centres entrance and parking areas
        at franca shopping annual electricity consumption has been reduced by 172000kwh work will continue throughout 2013 with the
        installation of energy meters and changes to the illumination of posters in the centres car park
        overall estimated savings for both shopping centres was approximately 110000 r275000 in 2012 alone the investment cost
        of work at parque d pedro shopping will be recovered in 16 months and at franca shopping it paid for itself in just 18 days

      energy and climate continued
      measuring the energy and carbon efficiency of our business activities
      measuring our ghg emissions and our electricity consumption in relation to our portfolio size gives us a more accurate indicator of
      whether our operations are becoming more energy and carbon efficient we do this using the following two key performance indicators
      with respect to which we have set longterm objectives
      b ghg emissions of our owned portfolio and corporate offices as tonnes of co2e divided by m2 of gla in shopping centres and by m2
        of offices this indicator includes our scopes 1 and 2 emissions and emissions associated with business air travel part of scope 3
        ie the ghg emissions which we are able to control
      b electricity efficiency excluding tenants of our owned portfolio as kwh divided by the mall and toilet area of our shopping centres
        this reflects the electricity efficiency of the areas within our buildings which we have direct control over we have focused on
        monitoring our electricity efficiency rather than energy efficiency as this is easier for us to accurately measure without including
        tenants consumptions and accounts for the largest part of energy use in landlordcontrolled areas
      we also measure ghg emissions scope 1 and 2 emissions and emissions associated with waste and wastewater of our owned portfolio
      divided by m2 of mall and toilet area in 2012 our first year reporting this was 0214 tco2em2 mall and toilet area

      energy and climate continued
      promoting the use of renewable energy in shopping centres
      we prioritise energy suppliers which generate electricity based on renewable energy wherever economically feasible almost all our
      shopping centres in portugal and spain and all of those in germany now have electricity contracts in place which have low co2 emissions
      factors per kwh
      we also evaluate options for generating renewable energy on site on new projects and on existing shopping centre sites where economic
      conditions such as feedin tariffs in europe19 are favourable different options are available to produce electricity or heat on site
      including wind turbines solar and photovoltaic panels combined heat and power chp and geothermal energy but chosen sites need to
      fulfil certain characteristics for these technologies to be feasible moreover the costs and benefits associated with each option needs to
      be carefully weighed up to ensure they are financially viable for our business
      manauara shopping in brazil generates part of the energy it consumes using solar energy systems on site at 8a avenida in portugal and
      uberl√¢ndia shopping in brazil the energy from solar panels covering the centres roofs are used to provide hot water in restrooms
      at loop5 in germany over 2800 photovoltaic panels on the shopping centres roof produce 600000kwh of electricity annually which is
      fed into the energy grid thereby adding renewable energy to the regional energy mix and avoiding 300 tonnes of co2 a year sonae
      sierra benefits from an annual rental income for the roof space making the agreement beneficial to us financially as well as being
      beneficial to the environment
      for more on our approach to managing energy see page 115




      19    feedin tariffs are a scheme set up by many governments in europe to promote smallscale generation of renewable energy they involve giving payments to energy users households
            commercial property owners etc for the renewable electricity that they generate

        reducing water use through landscaping
        challenge
        as part of our aim to reduce overall water consumption we were keen
        to minimise the need for watering of landscaped areas at our new le
        terrazze shopping centre in italy while maintaining their attractiveness
        and functionality
        solution
        we investigated the use of plants that were well adapted to the local
        mediterranean climate and which were therefore likely to have much
        lower water consumption we identified a number of native trees that
        were ideal for the site  including stone pine and holly oak  plus some
        from other areas such as the french tamarisk and the greek
        strawberry tree that were well suited to the environment
        results
        100 of all plants used for landscaping at le terrazze were well adapted to local conditions and this allowed us to install an ultralow
        volume irrigation system that uses the minimum amount of water possible aside from saving water in a waterstressed area the
        landscaping is in keeping with surrounding vegetation is attractive and has increased the ecological value of the site due to its use
        of native trees suited to local wildlife



      investment in shopping centres water efficiency pays off
      we invested a total of around 91140 in water efficiency improvements at our shopping centres in operation focusing on centres located
      in areas of water scarcity according to the wbcsd global water tool based on an analysis of our owned shopping centres and
      development projects against the tool we have identified one shopping centre in an area of extreme scarcity relative to the annual
      renewable water supply per person and extreme stress according to the mean annual relative water stress index a further five shopping
      centres are located in areas of high scarcity and two are located in areas of medium scarcity 35 shopping centres are located in areas
      where the water supply per person is sufficient or abundant for four centres no data was available with respect to our development
      portfolio one out of ten projects is located in an area of extreme scarcity relative to the annual renewable water supply per person and
      two are located in areas of medium scarcity all other projects are located in areas where the water supply per person is sufficient
      we conduct regular water audits at our shopping centres to analyse water use and identify opportunities to improve their performance
      the audits set out recommendations to improve a shopping centres water use for example following an audit in 2011 loop5 in
      germany developed a fouryear plan to implement the audits findings some of the recommendations included recalibrating water
      meters and improvements to water pumps
      in 2012 we continued our efforts to cut our water use targeting improvements at ten shopping centres in portugal spain and brazil
      through water efficient technologies and improved metering and leak detection more accurate and detailed metering allows us to
      develop a much deeper understanding of our shopping centres water uses for example at alexa shopping centre in germany replacing
      water meters with smart meters improve leak detection and facilitated remote monitoring allowing us raise employee and tenant
      awareness of their water use

      water continued
      investment in shopping centres water efficiency pays off continued
      in shopping centres a significant amount of water is used in toilet areas and for irrigation purposes and we implemented a range of
      actions to reduce water consumption in wcs and irrigation specifically focusing on improving the water efficiency of fixtures and fittings
      for example
      b at gaiashopping we installed 16 waterless urinals and 18 dual flush toilets in response to the recommendations of the water audit
        carried out at this centre saving 2654m3 of water the centres water efficiency improved from 24 litres per visit in 2011 to 21 litres
        per visit in 2012 generating savings of 6635
      b at boavistashopping in brazil we installed aerators in 76 taps in the centres public toilets which reduced the flow rate of these taps
        from 077m3h to 036m3h and its total water consumption reduced by 3 between 2011 and 2012
      b at franca shopping we installed two automatic taps near the food court and introduced daily monitoring of water meters in common
        areas these measures coupled with repairing a leak in the centres reservoir meant the centre achieved a reduction in total water
        consumption of 6 between 2011 and 2012 its water efficiency improved 270 litres per visit in 2011 to 245 litres per visit in 2012
        generating savings of 7359 18400 reais
      for a full list of water efficiency actions implemented in our shopping centres and on completed development projects in 2012 see
      page 126

      increasing the reuse of water on our sites
      in 2012 we continued our efforts to install water reuse and recycling systems in total ten sonae sierra shopping centres have rainwater
      harvesting systems in place 20 are harvesting groundwater and seven are reusing water from their cooling towers cooling towers and
      air conditioning systems are a large consumer of water but through processes such as reverse osmosis it is possible to treat and reuse
      that water
      following a feasibility study at uberl√¢ndia shopping in brazil we installed three 1000 litre water tanks to collect rainwater runoff from
      the shopping centres roof rainwater is directed into the tanks and it undergoes physical and chemical filtering to remove solid waste
      and disinfection before being used in the centres wcs cooling towers and the automatic irrigation system
      in 2012 we conducted a study into the feasibility of using rainwater harvesting at valecenter and loop5 in both shopping centres the
      feasibility study gave a positive outcome in the case of loop5 for example it was estimated that between 7500m¬≥ and 9500m¬≥ of
      water could be saved installation is planned for both shopping centres in 2013

      avoiding water pollution
      we study the quality of wastewater emitted by every shopping centre we own and manage and compare the results with thresholds set
      by our shems and current regulations in 2012 we took steps to ensure that discharges to water courses comply with sonae sierras
      wastewater quality standards and pollutant limits at 14 shopping centres in portugal brazil germany and romania following a 2011
      analysis that identified parameters which regularly exceeded the limits set oils and fats for instance we will build on this work in future
      years to ensure that all discharges to local water courses and sewers comply with our quality standards and are well within legal
      thresholds

      of in landfill the remaining tonnes were disposed of
      principally through recycling composting incineration
      with energy recovery and anaerobic digestion
      our completed construction projects generated a total
      of 16747 tonnes of waste of which 378 tonnes

      tackling waste on our construction sites
      our construction sites can generate significant quantities of waste construction and demolition waste is one of the heaviest and most
      voluminous waste streams and its disposal in landfill can result in significant harmful impacts for the natural environment we have set
      an objective to maintain high performance in terms of waste recycling on construction projects and to increase the proportion of
      construction materials used which have a recycled content
      in 2012 we applied our waste management practices on all projects under construction and achieved a recycling rate of at least 96 for
      completed projects meaning we met our target of 85

      increasing our shopping centres recycling rates reduces costs
      in 2012 our shopping centres achieved a global recycling rate of 55
      compared with 53 in 2011 meaning we exceeded our target to achieve a
      minimum recycling rate of 534 and met our 2020 objective

      we also reduced the rate of waste sent to landfill from 36 in 2011 to 29                                       the proportion of shopping

      waste continued
      increasing our shopping centres recycling rates reduces costs continued

        cutting waste at franca shopping
        challenge
        recycling and reducing waste are important aspects of responsible waste management but
        we understand that we have a shared responsibility with our tenants to ensure as much as
        possible our waste is recycled and as little waste is produced it is therefore vital that our
        tenants are on board with our joint responsibility to separate waste into its distinct recycling
        categories and reduce their waste production we therefore wanted to find effective ways to
        engage with our tenants on this subject

        solution
        at franca shopping we launched a competition among tenants to increase recycling rates
        and reduce amount of waste produced for one month during september the tenants
        categorised by business type would bring their recycled waste to be weighed for each kilo of
        recycled waste they would accumulate points at the end of the month the tenant from each
        category with the highest number of accumulated points won a prize

        results
        the initiative was a success as almost 120 tenants joined the competition recycling paper plastic tetrapak metal and light bulbs and raising
        awareness on the importance of recycling and their commitment to doing so on posters we published the names of the winners thanked everyone
        for their participation and finished with a message continue recycling in total tenants collected over 46 tonnes of waste and franca shopping
        was able to increase its recycling rates from 3752 in september 2011 to 43 in september 2012



      we continued our efforts to divert waste from landfill and improved our recycling rates at our shopping centres the majority of waste
      produced at our shopping centres is generated by our tenants activities so influencing their behaviour is one of the principal strategies
      we can adopt in order to reduce the impact of our shopping centres waste production
      in 2012 we introduced a number of initiatives to reduce waste and improve recycling rates
      b at shopping plaza sul we reorganised the waste recycling area to make it easier for tenants to separate waste using colour coded
        bags for the different waste types acquiring containers specifically for the food court such as for organic waste and introducing
        performance requirements in contracts we have also expanded the range of materials we can recycle to include iron and wood
      b at parque d pedro shopping we launched a competition which involved tenants submitting examples of waste reduction initiatives
        implemented or due to be implemented at the centre these were then assessed based on their effectiveness results achieved and
        creativity the competition opened with a presentation on the importance of waste recycling and examples of best practice
      b at riosul shopping improvements to waste collection procedures at the food court and a tenant awareness raising campaign
        conducted in 2011 meant the shopping centre achieved a recycling rate of 74  almost 40 higher than the average sonae sierra
        shopping centre as well as generating savings over 5000 better waste management practices led to a marked improvement in
        customer satisfaction and cut the shopping centres co2 emissions by 118 tonnes

      waste continued
      proactive waste management in our corporate offices
      in 2012 we improved the recycling rate of our corporate offices by 6 percentage points in comparison with 2011 meaning that we met our
      target to achieve an average recycling rate of 78 across our offices and exceeded our 2020 objective of attaining an 80 recycling rate
      the offices that contributed most to our performance were lisbon madrid and maia where oneoff activities cleaning resulted from the
      relocation of these offices for example five tonnes of gift vouchers were sent for recycling at lisbon madrid and maia increasing their
      recycling rates our bucharest office also saw an increase mainly due to an increase in paper sent for recycling due to its relocation
      at our sao paulo office we implemented a number of recommendations following a waste characterisation study we conducted in 2011
      they included
      b placing signs next to bins for different waste streams
      b placing messages around the office to encourage employees to use fewer plastic and paper cups
      b providing training for new employees and service providers on recycling
      b publishing quarterly updates on the offices recycling rate and progress towards its annual target

      biodiversity and habitats continued
      promoting biodiversity protection in operational shopping centres
      once our shopping centres are in operation there is less scope for us to enhance local biodiversity on site except on those shopping
      centres which include significant areas of green space within the site namely loureshopping in portugal and parque d pedro shopping
      and manauara shopping in brazil therefore during the operations phase we focus our actions on raising awareness about biodiversity
      protection capitalising on our ability to communicate with the large number of people who visit our shopping centres and on supporting
      local organisations involved in biodiversity protection

        protecting biodiversity at boulevard londrina shopping
        challenge
        the development of land for new shopping centres is our most significant impact on
        biodiversity particularly when projects are built on undeveloped greenfield sites to
        reduce this impact sonae sierra has set itself two biodiversity objectives to promote the
        use of previously developed land or brownfield land for new shopping centre projects
        and to protect and enhance biodiversity on new and existing sites by actively integrating
        ecological features wherever possible and adapting these to the regional context
        construction activities by their nature are disruptive and can threaten local flora and
        fauna through earthworks the removal of vegetation as well as the noise and dust they
        generate ensuring we minimise these impacts is especially important in developing
        countries such as brazil that are experiencing rapid urbanisation while at the same time
        being naturally rich in biodiversity

        solution
        many of the ecological features included in the design and construction of boulevard londrina shopping were a direct result of our objectives to
        protect and enhance biodiversity
        due to be inaugurated in 2013 the centre will have a total of 47800m2 gla and will serve a catchment area of more than 800000 inhabitants in the
        city of londrina in the state of paran√° in northern brazil
        the centre has been built on a brownfield site thereby ensuring the protection of existing natural and seminatural habitats nearby the area was
        previously occupied by a factory that produced vegetable oil therefore as part of the planning process we conducted an environmental due diligence
        study to assess the possibility of contamination from this previous use
        the key reasons for conducting environmental due diligence and other studies such as environmental impact assessments are to understand the
        potential environmental liabilities that sites may contain such as contaminated land or materials and to proactively mitigate any negative
        environmental impacts in terms of mitigation at boulevard londrina shopping we identified a number of measures that the development team was
        required to put in place prior to commencing construction works to compensate for the loss of any biodiversity

        results
        among the recommendations was an afforestation project the planting of trees in an area where previously there was no forest in the surrounding
        area other recommendations included work to ensure the sites soil permeability met legal requirements and the installation of a rainwater runoff
        system to capture rainwater on the roofs and other impermeable areas and to return it to the ground
        freshwater availability is an increasing concern in the state of paran√° in response the shopping centres design includes a number of features to
        conserve and reduce the consumption of drinking water in order to protect groundwater resources

      social performance
      our approach to social issues focuses on the stakeholder groups most affected by our
      operations our suppliers tenants visitors employees and the communities close to
      our shopping centres and new projects
                                  we formalised this commitment in 2004 with the introduction of our safety and health policy and in 2008 our
                                  safety and health management system became the first in the shopping centre sector to achieve certification in
                                  accordance with the ohsas 18001 standard
                                  it is part of our daytoday operations to make sure that our tenants and our shopping centre visitors are satisfied
                                  with the quality of service they receive from our company and results show that in spite of the challenging
                                  economic conditions our shopping centres remain attractive to both beyond our emphasis on customer
                                  satisfaction we have developed significant programmes to actively engage our stakeholders on wider sustainability
                                  issues and our studies point towards further opportunities to exploit a growing consumer appetite for more
                                  environmentally sustainable and healthorientated products and services

      the social context
      ensuring high standards in our supply chain
      our supply chain is a key area of reputational risk people who visit our shopping centres expect that the materials and services we use
      are produced transported and used to high social and environmental standards without exploitation of the workers who produce them
      or the environment from which they originate we share the same expectations and recognise that supply chain management is an
      important plank in delivering many of our social and environmental objectives
      procurement is complex in our industry and we have to deal with an extensive supply chain but we have a responsibility to properly
      manage it so that our expectations on social and environmental issues are delivered if we fail to do so we will be held to account for the
      failings of our suppliers and asked why we did not do better we may lose business face regulatory penalties and suffer reputational
      damage
      we therefore engage with our suppliers with the aim of encouraging them to adopt more responsible business practices for everyones
      benefit this we do through our responsible procurement policy adopted in 2007 which is integrated into our service suppliers
      management procedures these procedures ensure that social and environmental performance is considered when tendering managing
      and evaluating supplier contracts both for the development of shopping centres and their operation
      all contracts with critical suppliers must include safety health and environmental she clauses and subcontractors have the same
      level of requirements in this area as contractors if no formal contracts are signed then the service supplier must sign a warranty
      declaration to guarantee that she requirements will be met
      we also have she regulations for service providers that include for example an obligation on suppliers to adopt protective measures to
      minimise risks for workers compliance with these regulations is checked during work supervision she induction training is obligatory for
      all new suppliers and she training plans for each site include the identification of training needs for service suppliers
      although the sourcing of materials used in shopping centre developments is controlled by our contractors we encourage them to reuse
      demolition materials and favour materials that have low toxicity are locally sourced have a recycled content and are sourced from
      companies that adhere to ethical and environmental standards our safety health and environment development standards prohibit
      the use of timber products derived from nonsustainable managed forestry as well as materials known to have negative impacts on the
      environment or the health and wellbeing of building occupants we aim to increase the proportion of sustainable materials used in
      development expansions and refurbishment projects  with a longterm objective of using 100 certified sustainable timber by 2020

      working with tenants
      our research shows that tenants view corporate responsibility as a significant factor in their overall satisfaction with the service we
      provide so it is important we meet their expectations in this direction we view our tenants as strategic partners their financial
      performance impacts directly upon our own through occupancy rates and rental income so if they are not happy we are not happy
      our shopping centre management teams work with tenants on a daily basis including through individual facetoface meetings to
      ensure they are treated fairly and in a way that enhances their business potential helping to deliver a high quality service and
      maintaining high levels of tenant satisfaction we have a goal of achieving an average tenant satisfaction level of 5 out of 6 or above in
      all our shopping centres by 2015 as measured through the annual tenant satisfaction surveys we carry out in all our centres we use the
      findings of these surveys to develop action plans that will improve satisfaction levels and address areas where we have scored less well
      we help our tenants to improve their safety health and environment performance through training and by inviting them to participate in
      she committees we also encourage them to compete for two awards the person√¶ tenant award for best practice in safety and health
      and the planet sierra tenant award for best practice in environmental management additionally we monitor the work practices of
      tenants through she preventive observations spos a process designed to detect any instances of behaviour that present safety and
      health risks or environmental impact if issues arise we discuss them constructively with our tenants employees

      the social context continued
      supporting communities and meeting visitor expectations
      if we fail to attend to the needs of visitors to our shopping centres or to people in the wider communities around them then we ignore
      our responsibility to make a useful contribution to society we also hamper our ability to function as a business as the consequences are
      likely to be a reduction in footfall at our shopping centres reduced sales and greater difficulty in obtaining planning permission for new
      schemes by contrast maintaining good community relations and delivering exceptional shopping experiences to visitors is likely to
      result in higher footfall and sales and an enhanced license to operate
      we are committed to providing attractive shopping centres that serve the needs of local populations this means offering employment
      to local people working to provide sustainable transport systems and inviting local businesses to rent space in our shopping centres
      we acknowledge that the creation of new shopping centres can sometimes have an adverse impact on local businesses and to mitigate
      this we offer local retailers high quality accommodation in our centres we also provide alternative retail formats shop spots are ideal for
      entrepreneurs and small businesses to market their products in a prime location at a competitive cost flash stores give new and existing
      tenants an opportunity to try new ideas by offering lowrent six month contracts for empty retail units
      we develop projects in compelling locations creating shopping centres that offer leisure and entertainment and a broad innovative
      tenant mix and we create convenient and efficient layouts to offer visitors an experience that fits with the local setting by generating
      strong meaningful links with community values many of our shopping centres involve considerable improvements to urban
      infrastructures near the site usually developed in conjunction with local authorities this is particularly important in parts of the world
      where infrastructure is poor
      through our community advisory panels caps programme we make sure local communities are consulted on and involved in
      the development and operation of each of our shopping centres in a way that creates longterm relationships and is sensitive
      to local cultural considerations
      we also undertake to play a proactive role in raising visitors awareness of corporate responsibility concerns
      promoting a large number of events and campaigns with environmental and social themes and supporting
      charitable initiatives to promote the wellbeing of the local community around our centres

      making sonae sierra a great place to work
      by ensuring high levels of staff satisfaction we can create a more prosperous company but we also avoid costs associated with high staff
      turnover maintain high levels of productivity and attract a wider range of potential candidates to our jobs developing and retaining
      talent can increase our competitiveness because the talent we develop and retain enhances our knowhow which boosts our reputation
      in turn our strong reputation contributes substantially to attracting new talent thus perpetuating the cycle
      with this in mind we aim to have created the best possible working conditions for all our staff by 2015 the results of our biannual
      employee survey help us identify areas where we can improve our offering to staff for example by carrying out ergonomic assessments
      across our offices or introducing new policies to promote better worklife balance they also allow us to pinpoint areas of perceived
      unequal opportunities and to promote initiatives to change these
      one of our longterm objectives is to offer our employees more flexible working arrangements with the aim of becoming a recognised
      leader in this area by 2020 this means helping employees who want to work part time and from home as well as those who would like to
      have more flexible working hours to fit in with family and other commitments we promote initiatives to increase staff wellbeing offering
      employees the opportunity to sign up with gyms with which we have agreed partnerships
      we have a nondiscrimination and diversity policy that states our commitment to a meritocracy culture this is reinforced by our code
      of conduct which outlines our commitment to creating a workplace where each individual is treated fairly and where we recruit select
      train and remunerate based on merit experience and other professional criteria to enforce these principles and policies employees can
      turn to the sierra ombudsman to report workrelated concerns the code and our anticorruption policy outline the high ethical
      standards we expect of our employees and this is reinforced through training
      we nurture our employees talents through professional development programmes and training we also foster a culture of innovation
      through our innovation office which develops and coordinates activities to stimulate new ideas across the company the innovation
      office runs initiatives such as iwork a project that allows staff to question the way we work and investigate ways we can operate
      more efficiently
      we use key performance indicators kpis to measure how individuals are contributing to our business goals as well as to our safety
      health and environment objectives kpis allow employees to manage their own performance and we ensure that bonuses are paid
      according to that performance

      protecting the safety and health of everyone who uses our shopping centres
      we are responsible for the safety of millions of people each day who visit and work at our shopping centres  and who are involved in
      construction work on new and existing sites incidents occurring at our centres can cause harm to people and expose our company to
      risks such as reputational damage fines and delays on construction projects a progressive approach to safety and health sh can
      help us protect people futureproof our assets reduce insurance costs and enhance our reputation
      our sh strategy aims to prevent all accidents thereby protecting every person present on our premises zero accidents is our ultimate
      goal and we aim to achieve this through the creation of a safetyconscious culture across our entire organisation by 2015 we also aim to
      have obtained ohsas 18001 safety certification for all our new construction projects and all assets which we own and have managed for
      at least two years
      we strive to continually minimise the occurrence of workplace incidents and occupational diseases as well as to promote good health and
      wellbeing among our workforce we do this by implementing our safety health and environment management system which helps us
      embed a safety culture throughout all our activities minimising risks and promoting a safer and healthier lifestyle for all the people who
      visit and work in our shopping centres

      we also ensured that 100 of contracts signed by our
      critical property management suppliers included
      clauses for minimum requirements in relation to
      safety environmental and social standards
      for existing critical property management suppliers including maintenance security cleaning and waste management suppliers we
      conducted cr audits that involve a check list of cr issues to assess their knowledge about our shopping centres she procedures and the
      conditions of their equipment a survey of the audits carried out across all our owned operational shopping centres in 2012 revealed that
      b all main service suppliers demonstrated good team work organisation and timekeeping
      b among our waste management and cleaning suppliers training and knowledge of sonae sierras fire accident and evacuation
        procedures could be improved
      b amongst our cleaning suppliers the use of gloves and approved uniform was high however the use of protective masks  filters could
        be increased
      b among our maintenance suppliers the use of protective equipment and clothing is high with the exception of protective masksfilters
        and head protection tools were wellmaintained stored and labelled and safety sheets were readily available in most cases
        employees knowledge of working permit procedures was high however nonconformances were detected regarding the delivery of
        training and medical checkups to staff
      b our security suppliers demonstrated good knowledge of shopping centre safety procedures and high levels of conformance with the
        use of the correct uniform the percentage of security staff with firstaid and defibrillators certificates and availability of the
        respective equipment could be improved medical checkups also continue to have margin for improvement
      in early 2013 we will develop an action plan to followup on these results with a strong focus on addressing nonconformances we will
      then perform another round of cr audits for all critical property management suppliers across all our shopping centres
      in 2011 we set a target to be achieved in 2012 to reduce the number of nonconformities to 15 and a sample review of audits
      conducted by applicable shopping centres showed that this had been achieved in all cases

      ensuring the safety and health of our development and service suppliers is a priority for us we work closely with our suppliers including
      contractors and subcontractors to reduce safety incidents by sharing best practice and promoting safer behaviour for example in 2012
      we organised open she committee meetings to debate the management of safety and health issues during construction works in shops
      the meetings were an opportunity to discuss issues such as training needs safety performance and analyse recent accidents and their
      causes to agree the steps that can be taken to prevent their reoccurrence for more on our approach to safety and health see page 130
      we aim to treat our suppliers fairly and we monitor the number of days within which our suppliers invoices are paid in 2012 suppliers

           conscious that knowledge always needs to be updated and that because of personnel changes over time it is possible for some expertise to be lost

           solution
           since 2010 we have set up an annual joint fire prevention training project
           with the company responsible for building maintenance at dos mares and
           the local civil protection bureau which specialises in fire prevention
           training attendance is compulsory for all workers at dos mares and focuses
           on how to properly use fire extinguishers

           results
           we have achieved a significant increase in knowledge of how to use fire
           extinguishing systems among all workers and service providers making dos
           mares a safer place for those who visit and work at the shopping centre as
           a bonus the training project has fostered increased cooperation and
           understanding between those who have collaborated to provide it to date
           more than 55 service suppliers and tenants have participated in the
           training and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive its been
           exciting seeing a fire so close and especially helpful in knowing how to
           safely deal with it said one of the centres cleaning team employees

      suppliers continued
      investigating alternative materials for use in future developments
      it can be a challenge to find the most sustainable alternatives for many products used in our construction and refurbishment activities
      because the sustainability of these products depends on a number of factors including the raw materials used in the product the
      environmental and ethical impacts associated with the raw materials extraction the distance that the product and its various components
      have travelled the ecoefficiency of the processes used to manufacture the product and its potential to be recycled or reused at the end
      of its life
      we have undertaken several initiatives to identify and evaluate the different sustainability aspects of a number of materials and products
      used in our development activities
      for example using a methodology produced by the department of resources recycling and recovery of california calrecycle to
      identify the ecoefficiency of different types of materials which can be used for each building element we have created a sustainable
      materials checklist using colour codes to grade different types of materials according to how ecoefficient they are
      we have also included in our cr questionnaire for all new relevant suppliers questions to ensure that highrisk materials come from
      reliable sources in respect of child labour and working conditions the questions were developed following a study we completed in 2011
      to identify and evaluate of a number of materials and products used in our development activities the materials we identified for
      appraisal include light fittings sanitary fixtures furniture pipework ductwork and cabling solar panels airconditioning equipment and
      any other equipment manufactured in asia except japan and africa
      following a pilot to assess the recycled content of a number of materials used during the construction phase of boulevard
      londrina shopping in brazil we developed a methodology to assess the recycled content of the most significant materials
      used on future development projects including concrete brickwork steel glass and insulation as well as other materials used
      in significant quantities the findings will help us to identify which materials we might prioritise when seeking more sustainable
      alternatives and the methodology will be piloted during the construction works of parklake in romania

      integrating sustainable materials into completed projects
      on the le terrazze construction project in italy and the uberl√¢ndia shopping construction project in brazil we implemented a number of
      measures to reduce the environmental and health impacts of the materials used during the development process
      for example at both projects a list of prohibited materials was distributed and included in the tender documentation for
      contractors and subcontractors to reduce the use of materials substances and produces that could have a negative impact
      on the environmental and human health
      at le terrazze the technical details of all paints and other decorative finishes such as varnish and wood preservatives were
      assessed to ensure they were leadfree we also verified that all insulation materials used were free of cfcs and hcfcs
      similarly at uberl√¢ndia shopping construction project we ensured that all insulation materials were free from cfcs and hcfcs the
      project also managed to reduce the use of pvcbased materials with pvcfree alternatives representing 61 of the total cost of usual
      pvcbased materials for a project of its size other successes include the use of offsite fabricated materials to reduce waste and the
      volume of materials used onsite in total offsite fabricated materials represented 67 of the total cost of the centres fabric and structure

      monitoring our impact in our own offices
      we monitored our materials use across all our corporate offices and shopping centre offices to identify the proportion of materials used
      that were recycled input materials in 2012 we reduced our consumption of materials by 11 compared to 2011 which was due both to
      budget reduction measures and the increased reuse of materials such as paper archive folders document dividers and plastic bags
      however we decreased the percentage of materials used that were recycled input materials to 86 but reduced the amount of paper
      consumed per worker by 13 in comparison with 2011

      deliver a high quality service to tenants and maintain
      high levels of tenant satisfaction and we have set
      ourselves the goal of achieving an average tenant
      satisfaction level of 5 or above21 in all sonae sierra
      owned shopping centres by 2015
      in 2012 the global occupancy rate of our owned
      shopping centres decreased slightly from 967 in
                                                                                                                       alexa germany
      2011 to 961 see table on page 39 meaning we
      almost met our overall target to achieve a global
      average occupancy rate of at least 95 because six of
      eight countries achieved a global occupancy rate over                                                                                                           uberl√¢ndia shopping brazil
      the 90 limit but romania and greece only achieved
      806 and 635 respectively
      we narrowly missed our target for all our owned shopping centres to achieve an average tenant satisfaction rate of 38 or above 96 of
      shopping centres achieved it and for 85 of our owned shopping centres to achieve an average tenant satisfaction rate of 425 or above
      80 of our shopping centres achieved it
      these results are nonetheless impressive taking into account the difficult economic environment in most countries where we operate
      and have been achieved by working together with tenants shopping centre owners and visitors to improve the value proposition of our
      centres and differentiate them from competition

      tenants continued
      energy efficiency initiatives help tenants to reduce their costs
      in the context of the tough retail conditions in many of the markets where we operate and in particular in portugal spain and greece
      we have challenged our shopping centre teams to identify cost reduction opportunities
      increasing energy efficiency and reducing ghg emissions are one of the most important environmental issues for our tenants and
      energy is one of the main cost items in the service charge we introduced a number of steps across our shopping centres to help tenants
      save energy and costs following energy audits these included
      b evaluating tenants cooling needs and promoting the use of free cooling during winter
      b replacing existing lighting with led technology
      b making use of natural lighting where possible
      b installing individual meters to monitor energy use
      b reviewing the operation of air conditioning during winter
      investments in equipment to reduce energy and water consumption in common areas which were approved and implemented at various
      shopping centres also enabled us to pass on cost savings to tenants

      supporting tenants to improve their business
      changing consumer habits new technology and the economic downturn together present a challenging trading environment for our
      tenants but also a number of opportunities we work closely with them to respond to these challenges and in 2012 we introduced a
      number of initiatives to help support and grow their businesses while also contributing to our twin goals of ensuing high tenant
      satisfaction and occupancy rates many of these initiatives were developed internally by our employees see page 85
      for example promofans is a multichannel promotions and sales application that tenants can use to connect with customers and
      increase visitor numbers by offering promotional items for collection in our shopping centres by the end of 2012 promofans had
      over 100000 registered users and was supported by 350 tenants who offered 700 promotions flash stores are based in the popup
      store concept and aim to give new and existing tenants an opportunity to try new ideas while maintaining occupancy rates by offering
      lowrent six month contracts see case study other projects piloted during the year include a system that visitors can sign up to
      whereby we can anonymously track their movements through our shopping centres using bluetooth signals the information can be
      used to help improve the design of our shopping centres


        promoting innovation and supporting entrepreneurs
        challenge
        it is in our best interests to retain our tenants in our centres thereby maintaining high occupancy rates however in recent times capital restrictions
        due to the financial crisis and the uncertain economic climate have limited our tenants ability to expand and innovate and reduced opportunities for
        new businesses to grow both of which are vital to restoring growth and keeping our shopping centres fully occupied

        solution
        in portugal we launched flash stores a new concept aimed at supporting tenants and new businesses while at the same time making use of empty
        stores shortterm contracts mean tenants can try new products and ideas generating greater interactivity and forming closer relationships with
        customers which cant be achieved in traditional stores and set ups for entrepreneurs flash stores have the advantage of requiring a lower
        investment and greater flexibility in terms of contract price and duration flash stores provide a unique opportunity to test new concepts and
        products which if successful can lead to a more permanent contract

        results
        during 2012 the flash store concept was tested at three shopping centres in portugal centro colombo
        arr√°bidashopping and coimbrashopping with more than 17 local businesses and entrepreneurs taking
        advantage of the opportunity the flash store concept was integral to our 2012 agreement with the
        regional office of lisboa e vale do tejo dire√ß√£o regional de economia de lisboa e vale do tejo when we
        became the only private sector partner in the produtos de portugal produtos da minha terra portuguese
        products products of my homeland initiative that aims to promote and boost the sale of regional products
        to further support local businesses under the agreement businesses and associations of the lisboa e vale
        do tejo region can take advantage of the special conditions and establish flash stores at sonae sierra
        shopping centres with one such stores opening in centro colombo in 2012 by the end of 2012 flash stores
        were operating in 11 shopping centres and we plan to roll them out to our shopping centres across portugal
        and other countries in 2013

      tenants continued
      challenging tenants to follow safety best practices and reduce energy consumption
      in 2012 we continued to engage with tenants on environmental and social issues organising at least four meeting with tenants in each
      sonae sierra owned shopping centre in total we organised over 240 separate meetings the meetings are an opportunity to discuss
      performance on a range of issues share best practice and gather feedback topics included recycling initiatives efforts to reduce energy
      and water consumption information on incidents that have occurred and presentations on the main safety risks and hazards relevant
      to each shopping centre
      we held the second edition of the planet sierra tenant award which distinguishes tenants who demonstrate best practice in
      environmental management and performance in 2013 78 tenants competed for the award and 15 winners were selected they were

      communities and visitors continued
      in brazil all our shopping centres held sales campaigns with an environmental theme and we contributed to the publication of a special
      green edition of recreio  a popular childrens magazine  to coincide with world environment day on the 5th june more than 20000
      copies of the magazine were handed out to children in sonae sierra brasil shopping centres and copies were also given to employees
      children so that they could also enjoy the magazine and share the environmental messages with their families during the sales
      campaign shopping centre visitors were encouraged to take part in an online green attitude quiz which was accessible through our
      shopping centre websites visitors answered a series of sustainabilityrelated questions about their actions and behaviour to create a
      personal environmental profile and measure how green they are participants could share their scores with friends and families via
      social media

      dedicating time and resources to good causes through employee volunteering
      besides the impact we have on local communities at the shopping centre level we aim to contribute to the community at a corporate
      level by mobilising our staff to participate in community volunteering all sonae sierra employees are entitled to take one days leave as
      a volunteering day and most use this opportunity to participate in the annual sonae sierra community day which is held across all

      communities and visitors continued
      dedicating time and resources to good causes through employee volunteering continued
      as well as the specific events which took place as part of the sonae sierra community day sonae sierra staff contributed to local
      communities through some unique and ongoing initiatives in total in 2012 we welcomed 230 school and higher education institution
      visits to our shopping centres which involved educating children about environmental safety and health and cultural issues as well as
      more technical environmental and safety equipment and procedures for older students


        a new approach to safety awareness
        challenge
        with millions of visitors passing through our shopping centres each year we all
        need to remain constantly vigilant of the safety and health risks they face
        this is especially so with equipment that people use every day as they often
        forget about the inherent risks involved
        solution
        in 2012 we developed a novel approach across our european shopping centres
        to raise awareness of the safety risks posed by escalators and travelators we
        developed a fun and educational campaign using posters and stickers delivered
        through a never before used media  the escalators themselves
        this innovative approach helped to get visitors attention and ensure our message made a lasting impact simple and easy to
        understand images and messages highlighting the correct behaviour to avoid risks were placed on the sides of escalators the steps
        themselves as well as at the entrance and exit points to drive the message home
        results
        we surveyed 400 shopping centre visitors in portugal and spain to understand how effective the approach had been the results
        show that
        b 86 of respondents found the campaign graphics good or very good
        b 84 of respondents found the clarity of the message good or very good
        b 72 of respondents found the effectiveness of the campaign good or very good
        the feedback was especially rewarding as this was the first time that we had launched a campaign addressing this issue in such a
        creative way



      community advisory panels initiate engagement with the local community
      through our community advisory panel cap project we aim to integrate community consultation and engagement into the
      development and operation process of our shopping centres caps are currently in place at 33 sonae sierra shopping centres and
      development projects the caps help us to create trust and cooperation between our shopping centres and local community
      representatives at cap meetings which are held at least twice a year community representatives are invited to raise ideas and
      concerns and present potential projects for collaboration for example in 2012
      b serra shopping responded to a request from cap members to dedicate a space in the shopping centre where they could showcase
        their activities
      b parque principado worked with a local blood bank to set up a campaign to encourage shopping centre visitors to donate blood the
        campaign will take place in 2013
      other initiatives from across our portfolio include efforts to encourage greater water conservation and paper recycling campaigns to
      raise awareness of the social and professional challenges faced by people with disabilities and a training program for political refugees to
      help them find employment
      besides our caps we receive feedback from local communities through our geo tracking surveys media coverage and compliments and
      complaints that are presented to our shopping centres in 2012 we received 1356 cases of press coverage on social and environmental
      issues of these only 4 less than 03 were unfavourable favourable press coverage focused on various environmental initiatives held
      at our centres including earth hour sh day community activities the person√¶ tenant award and environmental and safety and
      health certifications achieved at multiple centres in brazil italy germany and romania

      communities and visitors continued
      measuring and enhancing visitor satisfaction
      engaging with visitors in order to understand what drives their behaviour and decisions is fundamental to our shopping centres success
      we undertake mall tracking surveys at our shopping centres every year or two years to help us understand our visitors profile their
      behaviour and requirements these surveys monitor trends in visitor satisfaction expectations loyalty and behaviour and also ask
      questions about social and environmental aspects shopping centres develop action plans on the basis of the survey results paying
      particular attention to critical success factors affecting visitor numbers and shortterm actions necessary to correct any negative results
      in 2012 we increased visitor satisfaction levels in portugal and spain and experience a small drop in visitor satisfaction levels across italy
      germany greece romania and brazil we use two different methodologies to monitor visitor satisfaction each country applies one or
      the other and results against both of these are shown in the charts below although we use different questions to analyse visitors
      feedback for different types of shopping centres in our portfolio in particular our centres are recognised for credentials such as
      b offering the visitor a wide range of stores services and leisure activities which provide a complete experience beyond shopping
      b offering visitors the certainty that they will be able to find what they are looking for
      b keeping their stores services and leisure activities up to date
      b supporting good causes and promoting regional development
      b offering entertainment for families
      in 2012 we implemented a number of measures to improve visitors satisfaction across all shopping centres in response to feedback
      received namely installing wifi improved eating facilities and wider entertainment facilities

                                                                                             data qualifying note

      investigating visitors attitudes towards green and ethical shopping
      even in the context of the economic downturn consumers still care about environmental and social responsibility and according to a
      study conducted by deloitte on shopping trends among european consumers23 more than two thirds of consumers avoid buying
      products with a substantial carbon impact and try to avoid products that may have been manufactured using child labour
      sustainability questions in our annual visitor surveys mall tracking in europe track consumer attitudes towards sustainability and in
      doing so identify ways in which we can help to meet visitors needs whilst at the same time promoting sustainable consumption choices
      to a wider market the results of the 2012 survey revealed that
      b 10 of visitors say that a companys environmental and social track record influences which shopping centre they visit
      b 23 say that a companys environmental and social track record influences what products they buy
      b a significant proportion of visitors 52 agree that a companys environmental and social track record is important but it is not an
        important factor in deciding where they shop or what they buy
      the 2012 survey results revealed some significant differences between countries in portugal and spain just under 12 and 11 of
      consumers respectively say that a companys environmental and social track record influences where they shop and only 13 and 8
      respectively state that environmental and social responsibility is not important with respect to shopping in italy 32 say that a
      companys environmental and social record influences what products they buy in greece while environmental and social issues are
      considered important by over 70 of consumers they are not widely taken into account in purchasing decisions

      introducing measures to improve staff satisfaction
      following the results of our latest employee survey in 2011 we introduced a number of measures to improve employee satisfaction
      levels we refined our employee engagement model and identified four strategic priorities
      b develop professionally each employee and promote alignment with sonae sierras values culture and corporate life
      b value each employee as an individual and help them build a better life for themselves
      b attain genuine happiness by respecting our employees personal lives
      b providing a sense of purpose by fostering opportunities for employees to support their communities
      in 2012 we implemented some specific measures to underpin this model and target other low scoring areas following the survey
      including promoting worklife balance and tackling perceived unequal opportunities these included
      b launching improving our people a new performance assessment and potential management model that aims to provide more and
        better information about our teams encourage the participation and involvement of our employees and promote a commitment to
        boosting personal development
      b strengthening our internal communication around existing flexible working arrangements which include leave of absence flexible
        working schedule parttime work and home working arrangements these communications included emails and meetings with
        employees
      b forming partnerships with gyms to give employees discounted membership applicable to sites with at least ten employees

      investing in staff training and development
      in 2012 we invested 499 per capita in staff training and development this value is lower in comparison with previous years and
      reflects the economic constraints on our company in 2012 we did however increase the delivery of internal training to staff and
      succeeded in providing employees with an average 358 hours of internal and external training during the course of the year a decrease
      of 27 in comparison with 2011 for examples of training initiatives carried out in 2012 please see page 128
      we encourage employees to identify their own training needs and we monitor participant feedback received on all our training sessions
      we also include questions on training and development in our employee survey whilst employees assessment of the training
      opportunities offered by sonae sierra has improved over the last five years this is still an aspect which could be further enhanced
      in 2012 100 of our direct employees received regular performance and career development reviews24

        improving employee training
        challenge
        we wanted to continue to develop the skills of our employees despite for economic reasons having to make cuts to training budgets across the
        company we were also keen to improve the overall quality of training regardless of the cuts

        solution
        from 2008 we reduced our reliance on training provided by external providers and brought much of the work inhouse saving money and freeing up
        resources to improve our own training programmes we set up a train the trainers initiative for our own staff and created crossfunctional inhouse
        training teams supplemented with an external consultant if needed as a result more than 60 training champions now act as trainers within sonae
        sierra and in excess of 1300 participations to this programme

        results
        the money we need to spend on training has been reduced with savings of around 415000 a year yet the feedback from those taking part in the
        training has been excellent and we have received systematically high evaluations from participants we have also found that internal trainers help to
        increase the knowledge of our business among participants in contrast to external providers who naturally know less about our operations we are
        continuing to expand the scheme by training more champions and developing new training topics


        it is a pleasure to be part of sonae sierras
        internal training team internal knowledge
        sharing is used to improve employee skills
        without having to require external services
        to do so and that means cost reductions

      b the innovation offices business innovation project bip programme was created to identify and raise awareness of highpotential
        ideas developed across the company and to encourage their implementation in 2012 four projects were adopted as bips including
        promofans and flash stores
      just under 6400 ideas were submitted by employees to our explore programme online ideas management platform and 50 of these

      promoting safety on construction sites
      in 2012 we achieved a 71 fall in the lost workday
      case accidents frequency rate lwcafr on
      construction sites meaning we met our target for a
      5 reduction the fall was due to the completion of
      construction works at uberl√¢ndia shopping
      in 2012 we began reporting although we have been
      managing this information for previous years the
      accident severity rate asr among development
      service suppliers to better understand the severity of
      accidents on construction sites measured as the
      number of lost work days due to accidents per million
      hours worked the asr in 2012 was 14597 we will
      continue to report this indicator in future to allow
      comparison
      we use the safe practice index spi audit tool to assess and improve safety conditions on our construction sites the spi measures the
      level of adherence to sonae sierras sh requirements as construction works evolve the higher the index results the higher the level of
      safety awareness amongst the construction workforce where deviations or nonconformities are detected various actions can be taken
      such as correcting them increasing worker supervision or providing further training or more resources
      in 2012 the average spi score across all our construction sites was 85 a 96 decrease compared to 2011 this was due to the below
      average performance at our boulevard londrina shopping construction works and a change in the way this data is calculated as we
      moved from an average rating to the introduction of a system that attributes greater weighting to audits with higher levels of participation
      and longer durations

      safety and health best practice
      all serious incidents which occur are investigated and lessons learned are communicated across the company through the tool called
      safety alerts which are messages that are sent to all sonae sierra employees and describe preventive actions which should be taken to
      avoid certain accidents
      in 2012 we developed an awareness campaign focusing on the prevention of one or more key safety risks at boulevard londrina
      shopping for example events were organised throughout the year regarding for example the use of safety equipment management of
      chemical waste respiratory protection equipment and creating safe work environment conditions

      making shopping centres safer
      in 2012 the lwcafr among our service suppliers in shopping centres increased by 10 in comparison with 2011 missing our target of
      a 4 reduction although the lwcafr has shown an increase over the four year period since 2009 this is more likely to be due to the
      improving quality of data reported at our shopping centres in 2012 our data audits did not find any incidents which had not been
      reported which means that we can now have greater confidence in the reliability of this indicator we will investigate the reasons for this
      increase further in 2013
      in 2012 the asr first year reporting for service suppliers measured as the number of lost work days due to accidents per million hours
      worked by suppliers based in our shopping centres was 6059
      we also saw an increase in the frequency rate of level three four and five category accidents per million visits to our shopping centres

      all our shopping centres when incidents do occur we issue safety alerts and update our shems procedures with the aim of preventing any

      identification and risk assessment first aid and ergonomics as well as induction training for new staff tenants and suppliers we also
      performed 10187 hours of safety health and environment preventive observations spo25 across our shopping centres including
      some of those which we manage on behalf of other owners the number of hours of spo performed decreased in comparison with
      previous years as the monthly target number of hours of spo set for shopping centres previously four hours per month was adjusted
      according to the number of shops and number of personnel in each shopping centre management team to perform the spo furthermore

      embedding our sh management procedures
      one of our shems procedures involves the regular inspection of our tenants units and in 2012 we carried out 5557 of these inspections
      and engaged with tenants to address all nonconformances detected
      all our shopping centres as well as our corporate offices have an internal emergency plan developed during the construction phase of
      the site or after acquisition and this plan covers all possible emergency scenarios it is tested at least twice per year on each site against
      two of these scenarios through the practice of emergency drills we have identified fires as being the most significant hazard for
      shopping centres and a fire emergency is one of the scenarios we practice every year in 2012 our shopping centres performed an
      average of 26 emergency practice drills covering fire earthquake and for the first time tsunami scenarios

      we raise awareness among our suppliers tenants and visitors about sh issues through regular meetings and other communications
      in 2012 we used open she committee meetings to debate the management of sh issues in construction works in shops with the aim
      of reducing the number of accidents the discussions covered topics such as the most common health and safety risks the most common
      injuries the ways that these can be prevented and included case studies of people who were injured in past years other initiatives included
      b at valle real shopping centre we implemented measures to reduce the risk level in the underground service suppliers workplace
      b to reinforce the communication of sh risks on escalators and travelators we put in place more visually engaging safety notices in
        the form of stickers and signs across our european portfolio
      b we also installed automatic external defibrillators aeds in the shopping centres where permitted by local legislation


        reducing operating costs through improved safety and
        health management
        challenge
        despite making significant improvements to safety and health practices in our
        operations in italy including ohsas 18001 certification for our gli orsi and valecenter
        shopping centres we had failed to register any measurable cost savings as a result of
        these changes

        solution
        in 2011 we set up a research programme to determine ways in which we could derive
        economic benefit from our improved safety and health performance this identified that
        we should be able to achieve reduced insurance premiums based on our safety and
        health practices in italy using an external consultant and working through the italian
        national institute for insurance against accidents inail we filled out a checklist of our
        safety and health measures and submitted our performance for evaluation

        results
        inail accepted that we qualified for reduced insurance payments as a result of good
        safety and health practices across all parts of the company this resulted in total savings
        on insurance premiums of 4045 in 2012 with further improvements we believe more
        savings will be forthcoming we also plan to investigate if similar savings can be made in
        other countries

      we celebrate world day for safety and health at work as an opportunity to reinforce the importance of preserving the safety and health
      of our employees visitors tenants and suppliers in 2012 we marked the occasion with an educational quiz to remind employees about
      the daytoday safety and health risks they face at work and how to manage them multiplechoice questions challenged employees to
      think how to respond in the event of a fire how to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and how to prevent the risk of falling or slipping
      because daytoday work activities can lead to stress in some individuals and high levels of continuous stress have a negative impact on
      health we are committed to helping employees that might be suffering from stress in the workplace during 2012 we delivered training
      on how to deal with stress as part of our internal training programme motive 209 employees from our property management business
      attend the training programme that covered stress management as well as other factors that contribute to employee motivation
      we continued to promote good ergonomic conditions for our workforce we regularly hold meetings in our office on musculoskeletal
      disorders which can be triggered by office work and on how best to handle manual loads every three years we conduct an ergonomic
      assessment of all sonae sierra offices and for new offices within six months of their opening to identify nonconformities against our
      standard for ergonomics  workplace attributes this sets out our workplace requirements for all sonae sierra locations covering the
      workspace wall coverings lighting indoor air quality indoor noise office furniture and computer hardware based on the results we put
      in place an action plan to correct any nonconformities and progress against this plan is independently verified by a third party

      sustainability issues core

      sonae sierras corporate responsibility steering committee which is chaired by the ceo and includes other representatives of the executive
      committee has identified that climate change can present risks and opportunities for the business and sonae sierra has already performed studies to
      identify the potential financial risks for its business due to climate change
      although it is impossible to predict how climate change risks will impact our business we believe in taking action now to prevent potentially serious and
      irreversible damage from occurring in the future it is now widely accepted among scientists across the world that some impacts of climate change will be
      inevitable on current trends average global temperatures are expected to rise by 2 to 3c within the next 50 years or so and the earth will be subject
      to several degrees more warming if emissions continue to grow if the increase in global average temperatures exceeds 15 to 25c major changes in
      ecosystem structure and function are anticipated with predominantly negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems goods and services such
      as water and food supply

      core continued

      the impacts of climate change in the form of extreme weather events  flooding heat waves weathering subsidence etc could cause physical and local
      depreciation to assets and those with unreliable energy supplies could also depreciate faster than others on the other hand adapting existing buildings
      and developing and acquiring new buildings which perform better in predicted climate change scenarios could help to maintain and enhance asset and
      portfolio value in the long term with reference to the findings of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and other sources we have
      identified the potential climate change impacts which may arise in the regions where we operate we cannot anticipate exactly how these impacts might
      affect our shopping centres although we can estimate for example that rising temperatures in several regions could increase demand for cooling within
      our shopping centres putting further pressure on energy resources and causing operational costs to increase
      in 2009 we commissioned a study to investigate the financial risks associated with climate change on a sample of our portuguese assets focusing on
      three components energy mainly electricity water and insurance costs this was done by identifying potential changes in energy use resulting from
      climate change under different scenarios and calculating the costs of these changes based on two main assumptions firstly that the price of electricity
      would be unchanged relative to what it was in 1990 and secondly that the price will change as a result of climaterelated policies in order to estimate the
      impact on the profitability of operations at the selected assets two approaches were taken the first was an accounting approach in which it was
      assumed that the cost structure would remain unaltered and reductions in profitability were calculated based on existing publicly available financial data
      for each shopping centre the second involved estimating the relationship between profitability and electricity prices using an econometric approach
      the econometric approach allows for the adjustment of operations in the centres to changing prices of inputs such as electricity and accounts for other
      indirect effects on profits such as increased visitors during periods of higher temperatures the results of this study revealed that
          the increased demand for energy and the anticipated increase in the price of energy is expected to reduce profitability by a maximum of between
           2 and 5 in 2030 and between 3 and 6 in 2050 with variations between different shopping centres
          in the case of water it was not possible to estimate the potential increase in demand due to climate change but the impact of increases in water
           costs was examined with the conclusion that these could reduce profitability by between 015 and 2
          the likely increase in insurance costs was estimated at 21 this could affect profitability between 01 and 07
      in portugal algarveshopping and norteshopping were selected for a more detailed assetlevel study the results of the study revealed that
          increased demand for energy due to higher temperatures combined with projected price increases are likely to impact on operational shopping
           centres profitability in the long term for example at norteshopping an estimated reduction of profits between 2 and 57 could occur in 2030
          water costs are also expected to rise but estimates vary significantly and the impact on profitability would be less significant for example between
           005 and 014 at norteshopping and slightly more at algarveshopping due to higher water costs in this region
          insurance costs are likely to increase by around 21 due to the increased frequency of extreme weather events and other risks associated with
           climate change the impact on profitability is likely to be around 01 at norteshopping and 07 at algarveshopping
      we also continue to review the relative materiality of other environmental impact areas in terms of the risk and opportunity they might present to the
      business as part of our risk management working group we use a standard risk management framework to evaluate environmental issues according
      to the likelihoodfrequency of occurrence and the scale of impact should they arise as well as energy and climate change other potential risks and
      opportunities include water waste and biodiversity and habitats see pages 21 to 22 the issues identified form the basis of our sustainability strategy
      which seeks to align our sustainability and business goals to generate value in the medium to long term for our business and society while addressing
      the longterm risks posed by social and environmental constraints such as natural resource shortages cost increases and more stringent environmental

      through a fund held and maintained exclusively for the purpose this does not constitute an indefinite liability to the employer the liability is limited to
      the pension premium which is only due as long as the employee is in service of the company the percentage of contribution is 5 for the employee and

      data qualifying note
      the companys environmental accounting ea model details the current costs capital expenditure and economic and environmental benefits resulting from the implementation of
      companys safety health and environmental management system excluding sh issues the model allows us to break down expenditures into legally mandatory socalled baseline
      expenditures and extrabaseline expenditures eg legionella monitoring in countries where no legal requirements exist in this way it is possible to estimate the economic effort of the
      company to strive to achieve more than just complying with legal requirements the ea is structured by environmental domain and specific activities and the presented figures include all
      shopping centres owned by sonae sierra in operation for the current reporting period except m√ºnster arkaden p√°tio brasil shopping tivoli shopping and shopping penha
      capital expenditure and current costs are calculated from the companys financial controlling statements classifying them by assigning one or several environmental activities along with
      its related percentages and legally nonmandatory fractions current costs include the human resource effort that is environmentally related and corporate environmental expenditure
      benefits can be physical or economic and are computed as differences of performance between 2012 and 2011 they are based on validated data also presented throughout this report
      economic benefits can be revenues monetary inflows from environmental conservation activities for example from waste recycling or savings avoided consumptions pollutants disposal
      or costs compared to the previous period

      significant actions are capital expenditure items corresponding to cost higher than 3500 for which environmental criteria were considered efficiency of resources use and have an
      associated quantifiable physical andor economic saving when compared with basic technology or prior existing situation these actions produce effects throughout the assetequipments
      operating period the effects from actions from previous years and those for this period are shown in the table the implementation date of the significant actions of 2012 was on average
      1031 meaning that the benefits physical and economic of significant actions of the period for a full year are 6 times bigger than the shown figures the benefits of significant actions of
      previous periods are likely to be underestimated since data started to be regularly reported in 2010 and data reported prior to 2011 was not exhaustively checked or validated nevertheless
      over the years the contribute of the unreported significant actions from the past will tend to decrease
      because the ea excludes legally mandatory expenditure the presented figures regarding capital expenditure and current costs differs from the table on page 127 detailing en30
      expenditure benefits can eventually include items resulting from the compliance of legally mandatory requirements for eg implemented actions from building energy certifications may
      impact the benefit reduction of electricity consumption on the other hand since benefits are computed from differences in centres performance from the last two years some current
      costs associated benefits may be excluded benefit of the period from previous years
      the economic benefits regarding waste include only the revenues from waste recycling
      revenues resulting from sale of energy electricity hot and cold water are only for the two shopping centres with chp plants norteshopping and maiashopping in portugal the volume of
      wastewater is estimated from the water consumption 80
      benefits figures were normalised taking into account some shopping centres operational data between periods such as opening hours and number of visits therefore the presented values
      may vary significantly from gricress indicators shown in this report

      materials
      we engage with our suppliers with the aim of encouraging them to adopt more responsible business practices in 2007 we formally approved our
      responsible procurement policy which commits us to
          integrating cr criteria into our service suppliers management procedures so as to ensure that the social and environmental performance of our
           suppliers is considered when tendering managing and evaluating supplier contracts
          engaging with our suppliers in order to improve their cr performance
          privileging the use of materials which are locallysourced have a recycled content have a lowtoxic content have a long life and can be recycled or
           used andor are sourced from companies which adhere to ethical and or environmental standards
      for sonae sierra it is difficult to control the selection of raw materials used in shopping centre development projects as our development contractors
      source materials generally premanufactured goods on our behalf this compromises our ability to gauge a clear understanding of the scale of our
      impacts in terms of raw materials consumption nonetheless through our sheds and our service suppliers management procedures we encourage
      our suppliers to reuse demolition materials and favour materials that are lowtoxic locally sourced have a recycled content andor are sourced from
      companies that adhere to ethical and environmental standards the sheds prohibit the use of materials which are known to have negative impacts
      on the environment and on the health and wellbeing of building occupants and timber products derived from nonsustainable managed forestry
      in 2012 a study was performed to assess the possibility to quantify the most significant materials consumed during the construction of new projects
      the defined methodology will be used at a pilot project in 2013

      energy
      increasing the energy efficiency of our activities  and in particular of our buildings  constitutes one of the main strategies to help us to achieve our goal
      of a 70 reduction in ghg emissions per m2 of gla by 2020 compared to the 2005 level we aim to attain a maximum average electricity consumption
      of 400kwh per m2 mall and toilet area per year across our shopping centres by 2020 energy efficient designs including energy performance targets
      and innovative engineering solutions are included in our safety health and environment development standards sheds within the sheds we
      specify the use of energy efficient boilers air conditioning units and other fit out equipment such as lighting and appliances we also require development
      managers to explore possible renewable and lowcarbon technologies during design such as passive solar design natural ventilation combined heat and
      power chp and district heating we are especially committed to designing buildings that will achieve high energy efficiency ratings under the european
      unions energy performance of buildings directive
      alongside our efforts to manage our shopping centres energy use as efficiently as possible during the operations phase as described on pages 54 to 57
      we investigate opportunities for onsite generation of renewable energy and procurement of green electricity through the grid
      we also seek to reduce the energy consumption and ghg emissions that are generated as a consequence of our other direct and indirect activities
      these include transport emissions generated by people visiting our shopping centres by our staff travelling to and from work and for business purposes
      emissions produced by tenants occupying our shopping centres and by our contractors on construction sites
      during the construction phase we implement our safety health and environment management system shems for construction or the she
      management plan for major refurbishments and expansions which include guidelines for monitoring energy consumption and implementing best
      practices in energy conservation in order to achieve greater energy efficiency

      water
      we aim to ensure a secure water supply at all of our shopping centres with a particular focus on locations that are vulnerable to water shortages we use
      the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd global water tool to identify the areas in which we are developing new centres that
      are at risk of water stress or scarcity
      when these projects go forward the companys safety health and environmental development standards sheds define that specific equipment like
      water chillers must be avoided in order to minimise our vulnerability to water shortages we also ensure that water efficient design including equipment
      specifications and water recycling engineering solutions is maximised

      environmental aspects continued
      water continued
      where feasible we integrate rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems on new projects to reduce the need for freshwater or municipal water
      consumption and we have set an objective for at least 10 of total water consumed at our shopping centres to be reused greywater or harvested
      rainwater by 2020 during the fit out process we set requirements for water efficient sanitary equipment such as sensor spray taps waterless urinals
      and low flush toilets for shopping centres exterior areas and when landscape projects are defined we specify efficient irrigation systems and minimise
      the planting of species with high water demands
      within our operational shopping centres we install water efficient appliances such as waterless urinals low flush toilets sensor taps and taps aerators in
      all refurbishments and set procedures to restrict water use wherever appropriate it is our objective to attain a level of water consumption at or below
      three litres per visit aggregated across all our shopping centres by 2020 our water metering strategy allows us to optimise shopping centres water
      consumption by enabling us to identify unusually high usage patterns and to define new management measures for tighter control of water usage
      regarding water quality we perform regular analysis according to its source and use that go beyond existing legal requirements our water quality and
      consumption management procedure sets out the process we follow we collect regular samples according to the water source including water supplied
      from the public network groundwaterboreholes or rainwater additional sources in brazil include water tank vehicles and water reused from wastewater
      treatment plants we require further analyses whenever a system change occurs or whenever there is a complaint the procedure also ensures that the
      cleaning and maintenance of water storage tanks meet the required standards
      in addition to monitoring water quality we record and evaluate water consumption levels against objectives and targets defined within the scope of the
      shems and analyse possible existing deviations taking appropriate action whenever necessary
      during construction works we implement our safety health and environment management system shems for construction which includes guidelines
      for monitoring water consumption targeting water efficiency improvements and implementing best practices in water conservation we also place
      demands upon our contractors in order to avoid the risk of water pollution from construction activities

      biodiversity
      we have set an objective to promote the use of previously developed land for new sonae sierra shopping centre projects and to protect and enhance
      biodiversity wherever possible
      environmental due diligence environmental impact studies eis safety health and environment development standards sheds and a site specific
      safety health and environmental management system shems are applied to all our new developments eis are performed when required by
      legislation and in all other cases preliminary environmental evaluations pee are performed according to sonae sierras specifications the eis
      identifies potential environmental impacts of each projects design construction and operation on the sites biodiversity and specifies mitigation
      measures we monitor the implementation of these recommendations to ensure that impacts on biodiversity are minimised as far as possible in cases
      where we are building a shopping centre on a greenfield or previously undeveloped site we ensure that all recommendations are implemented to
      compensate for any loss of biodiversity
      the sheds also establish requirements in relation to biodiversity namely
          ecological features classified as premium features according to the eis must be preserved throughout construction and integrated in the landscape
           design all other relevant ecological features should be preserved and integrated into the landscape project to the greatest extent possible
          native flora should be specified for use on all of the developments outdoor soft landscaping works and preference should be given to the use of
           green barriers such as hedgerows rather than fences exotic allochthonous invasive or nonindigenous plant or tree species should not be specified
           for any of our new shopping centres landscape projects
          flat roofs ie roofs with gradients of no more than 5 degrees which are not used for any specific purpose eg car parking pedestrians use housing
           of plant rooms etc should be considered by design as suitable locations for green roofs
      at our operational shopping centres and our corporate offices biodiversity impacts that may result from daytoday activities such as waste disposal and
      water consumption are monitored through our shems procedures we have ongoing projects at loureshopping in portugal and parque d pedro
      shopping in brazil to protect existing habitats and we also seek to raise awareness of biodiversity through marketing events and other initiatives among
      shopping centre staff andor visitors

      emissions effluents and waste
      waste
      our safety health and environment development standards sheds include a series of design requirements to maximise the waste separation
      potential of every shopping centre we develop so that once the shopping centre is in operation waste can be effectively sorted and sent for recycling and
      recovery a site specific waste strategy study is undertaken during construction to establish adequate provision of space for waste segregation bins and
      compactors temporary storage and internal preferential routes for disposal
      we take a progressive approach to waste management during construction works encouraging contractors to operate waste management plans aware
      of the difficulty that arises from the construction process being directly controlled by construction companies we are committed to gradually designing
      out waste produced during construction for example through offsite prefabrication
      where possible we specify end of life recycling for building components which is particularly relevant for our refurbishment activities in addition
      construction companies are required to report back to us the results of their waste management

      environmental aspects continued
      emissions effluents and waste continued
      during the operations phase the waste handled by sonae sierra is largely generated by tenants activities aside from seeking to influence tenants
      practices there is little that we can do to reduce waste production in our centres therefore our waste management efforts are focused on waste
      segregation management and disposal beyond legal requirements we aim to progressively improve each shopping centres waste recycling rate and
      have set an objective to obtain a minimum average recycling rate of 55 and a maximum average landfill rate of 30 aggregated across all our owned
      shopping centres by 2020 our site managers at each shopping centre are responsible for ensuring that waste is managed efficiently this includes
      providing appropriate storage areas and equipment that are well maintained preventing spillage and scattering during transportation and producing
      monthly reports of waste volumes we also provide staff with detailed instructions on waste codes rules for waste storage and final destination waste
      separation rules for nonhazardous waste and hazardous waste and waste transportation in each country particularly the documentation required
      emissions
      in 2006 we developed a climate change strategy to reduce our direct and indirect ghg emissions this covers scopes 1 2 and business air travel part of
      scope 3 according to the guidelines of the ghg protocol developed by the world resources institute and the world business council for sustainable
      development our longterm objective is to achieve a 70 reduction in ghg emissions per m2 of gla by 2020 compared to the 2005 level our primary
      strategy to achieve this is through energy efficiency initiatives we have not established a policy with regards to carbonoffsetting although we have
      compensated for co2 emissions in relation to some minor events
      it is part of our strategy to advocate more sustainable practices at an industry level and in 2011 we signed the 2c challenge communiqu√© that supports
      a robust equitable and effective united nations agreement on climate change
      during the construction phase we put in place a number of steps to reduce emissions of diffuse particles such as dust guidelines cover the correct
      storage of pulverised material regular spraying of site areas where the production accumulation and resuspension of dust may occur regular cleaning
      of site areas to clear waste materials procedures covering the transportation of construction waste regular washing of truck and other machinery
      loading and unloading procedures the use of dust traps for demolition waste crushers and actions to be taken in the event of a cargo spill
      effluents
      during the design phase we are committed to incorporating solutions that reduce pollution to local water sources for instance to prevent pollution from
      rainwater runoff we specify filter drains and porous paving in external paved areas and stormwater management plans are implemented to contain or
      decrease stormwater runoff according to the sites characteristics additionally our sheds guarantee that equipment like grease and hydrocarbon
      separators or wastewater treatment plants is installed minimising pollution through the pretreatment of these effluents before they are discharged
      our shopping centres may have up to five separate wastewater collection systems which enable different types of wastewater to be reused andor
      treated according to their characteristics
      our wastewater quality standard controls wastewater quality beyond existing legal requirements these are set out in our wastewater management
      procedure and include identifying all wastewater discharges into the municipal drainage systems andor wastewater systems and monitoring
      wastewater quality in accordance with the technical instruction for wastewater management we analyse the results and in any cases of nonconformity
      we produce a report setting out corrective actions
      wastewater discharges are analysed regularly by externally certified laboratories in order to control the contamination levels of our water discharges to
      municipal sewers streams etc among the main biochemical parameters usually analysed are biological oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen
      demand cod fats and oils total hydrocarbons total suspend solids tss ph detergents and sulphides through this control it is possible to
      prevent and to correct pollution to water sources

      products and services
      regarding indoor air quality we have a corporate procedure applicable to all shopping centres and a similar one for offices to guarantee that acceptable
      indoor air quality is maintained this involves conducting regular monitoring of critical air quality indicators including volatile organic compounds voc
      emissions periodic indoor air quality audits which cover a range of different parameters and legionella monitoring four of our air quality parameters are
      monitored online and transmitted to the public who visit our shopping centres through television screens in the mall areas
      during the design phase the sheds include standards which guarantee the use of best equipment for legionella control and the ongoing monitoring
      of indoor air quality parameters for example cooling towers must be made from materials that are corrosion resistant must not contribute to
      microbiological growth must be easy to clean and should entail drift eliminator devices shopping centres must have the capacity to measure indoor
      air quality against the parameters of air temperature relative humidity co2 and carbon monoxide co in different areas of the building

      compliance
      our shems ensures that as a minimum sonae sierra complies with all she legislation and regulations in the countries where it operates the legal and
      other requirements procedure is established and maintained to identify the legal and other requirements that are applicable to sonae sierras activities
      and periodically evaluate compliance with these

      land degradation contamination and remediation
      in accordance with our land use strategy we aim to treat contaminated soil rather than disposing of it in landfill in cases where remediation of
      contaminated land is required each project must investigate the possibility of employing the in situ bioremediation technique by identifying
      organisations which might be able to undertake this remediation work and the associated costs needed as well as business impact this investigation is
      made as part of our due diligence process
      our sheds prohibit the use of harmful materials such as asbestos lead chromium mercury and manmade mineral fibres suppliers are made aware of
      the prohibited materials list and the sheds audit checks that the prohibited materials list has been adhered to since not all of the shopping centres in
      our operational portfolio have been developed by sonae sierra or in accordance with the sheds we follow all legal requirements and best practices to
      ensure that harmful materials are managed where they exist harmful materials is one of the environmental aspects which are addressed through the
      due diligence process for the acquisition of existing shopping centres

      transport
      by giving preference to the reuse of demolition materials and use of materials sourced within a 500km distance we seek to avoid indirect ghg emissions
      associated with the transport of building materials to and from our construction sites during the operations phase we strive to maximise the
      accessibility of our centres to those using alternative transport modes we also continue to work to reduce ghg emissions associated with business
      travel for example by promoting the use of videoconferencing tools and restrictions on staff travel budgets
      most of our centres have dedicated spaces for the provision and display of travel information including public transport timetables and cycle storage facilities
      for tenants and visitors we have also established green travel plans at 12 shopping centres and two corporate offices to analyse the existing transport
      infrastructure and implement measures to encourage and improve the accessibility to the shopping centre by public transport bicycle and on foot

      this indicator includes all shopping centres owned by sonae sierra and in operation during the full reporting period and seven out of eight corporate offices maia office in portugal was
      excluded since electricity consumption isnt known because it is in a shared floorbuilding with no energy meters for maiashopping we did not consider the amount of hotchilled water
      produced by cogeneration in the building since consumption data arent known therefore we only considered natural gas consumption for cogeneration leading to an overestimated
      building energy intensity since a great part of the energy produced by cogeneration electricity is sold to the network and not used in the premises
      for this indicator there is a slight mismatch between the numerator and the denominator since energy consumption regarding cooled and hot water that is supplied to some tenants is
      considered even if those tenant areas are not and energy consumption in technical areas is considered but the areas not

        emissions factors used in previous years for brazil and romania there was no business train travel in 2012 for germany and greece the distances travelled by train were estimated
        based on the distances travelled in 2010 for germany and 2011 for greece and the variation in the number of employees in these countries between years
         for air travel the source of emissions factors is the defra act on co2 calculator and the radiative forcing factor rfi is from jardine 2005 oxford eci since the methodology in
         2011 did not include a rfi variations between flown distances and ghg emissions are not comparable these differences are also due to the different types of flights that compose the
         total distance travelled short medium and long haul and to the itinerary number of stops requiring landing and takeoff operations that are fuel intensive
       employee commuting this was updated based results from the companys 2011 survey regarding commuting patterns and 2012 employee numbers the emissions factors were
        updated and are according to values referenced in 2012 guidelines to defra deccs ghg conversion factors for company reporting
       visitor trips to and from our shopping centres this was updated for visitor patterns based on the same methodology applied in previous years and in accordance with 2012 visitor
        numbers the emissions factors were updated and are according to values referenced in 2012 guidelines to defra deccs ghg conversion factors for company reporting
         for shopping centres in brazil it was assumed that visitor patterns remained the same as those analysed in 2007 and therefore it was only updated in accordance with 2012 visitor numbers

      policy
      our safety health and environment policy establishes our commitment to conduct our activities so that risks towards people and our assets are
      minimised and the benefits enhanced it is our principle that the prevention of risk is a management responsibility and that responsibility for sh
      management belongs to our entire organisation
      we strive to reduce sh risks and incidents for all people working in our shopping centres including service suppliers our responsible procurement
      policy commits us to integrating cr criteria into our service suppliers management procedures so as to ensure that the social and environmental
      performance of our suppliers is considered when tendering managing and evaluating supplier contracts
      organisational responsibility
      ultimate responsibility for sh aspects lies with sonae sierras ceo and executive committee the she steering committee constitutes the senior
      level of decision making this committee establishes the she policy goals and objectives and monitors progress with respect to these objectives the
      sustainability office actively supports the she steering committee and advises on she policy and standards responsibility for the implementation of
      our safety health and environment development standards sheds and safety health and environment management system shems procedures
      is assigned to all leaders and managers in the line organisation who are also required to demonstrate a strong visible management commitment
      in 2008 our sh management system was the first in the shopping centre industry to be certified according to ohsas 18001 standard in 2011 this
      system was integrated with the environmental management system to create the safety health and environment management system shems
      the shems continues to provide us with the necessary tools to maintain a safety culture embedded throughout all our activities minimising risks and
      promoting a safer and healthier lifestyle to all the people who work in and visit our shopping centres to date 596 of our total shopping centres have
      obtained ohsas 18001 certification for their local shems as have five construction projects
      finally our organisation as a whole is supported by the she network which provides advice on sh environment management and technical issues
      training and awareness
      our she policy commits us to promoting safety training among our stakeholders our shems includes a competence training and awareness
      procedure whereby a competence matrix is used to identify the level of training required for each role and function during the annual personal
      assessment process for example all new sonae sierra employees must receive sh induction training and all site managers site correspondents and
      country she coordinators must attend training on all the she procedures within our shems as well as on legal sh issues specific to the country where
      they coordinate she management
      we collaborate closely with our critical suppliers on specific issues relating to she through our shems procedures our she training plans for each site
      include the identification of training needs for service suppliers
      monitoring and followup

      development and service supplier safety
      our service suppliers management procedures for development and property management define the various steps that should be followed from the
      preselection and bidding process through to contract closure and postcontract evaluation both our development and property management businesses
      have integrated the requirements of sonae sierras safety health and environment management system shems into their service suppliers
      management procedures so that these are set up in a way that ensures that our main suppliers performance meets with sonae sierras safety health
      and environmental she requirements
      within the scope of these procedures all contracts with critical suppliers must include she clauses and subcontractors have the same level of she
      requirements as contractors if no formal contracts are signed then the service supplier must sign a warranty declaration to guarantee that she
      requirements will be met we have also established she regulations for service providers which include for example the obligation for suppliers to adopt
      protective measures to minimise risks that workers are exposed to
      compliance with these regulations is checked during work supervision and for longterm contracts including contractors from construction sites and
      sh performance is evaluated during works execution
      all new shopping centre development projects must implement a sitespecific shems and achieve certification in accordance with the ohsas 18001
      standard for the entire construction phase additionally a safety plan is drawn up for each of our construction sites and compliance with this plan is
      compulsory for all contractors contractors cannot begin any activity without the validation of this document by the sites sh coordinator and sonae
      sierras prior approval each of our development projects has a full time sh coordinator to validate contractors risk assessments and if necessary
      establish additional control measures the sh coordinators and outsourced project management teams carry out permanent sh supervision and
      planning on construction works identifying and correcting unsafe actions wherever necessary in respect to expansions and refurbishments a simplified
      shems version is also implemented see page 25 for further details
      we investigate the cause of all incidents and communicate across the company the lessons that can be learned to avoid a repeat occurrence this is
      done using alerts a communication tool that is also used during the construction phase we also hold regular she meetings and carry out emergency
      practice drills on all construction sites
      procedures to identify and evaluate sh risks to people
      see performance indicator la8 for information regarding the monitoring and evaluation of sh hazards and risks to sonae sierras workforce external
      suppliers tenants and visitors
      prior to the commencement of construction or refurbishment works all design teams consider our safety health and environment development
      standards sheds during the concept and architectural development phase of all our new shopping centres refurbishment or expansion projects and
      minor works the sheds aid us in minimising sh risks from the outset of each shopping centres development and into the operations phase the
      implementation of the standards is mandatory for all projects with an investment proposal approved after december 2009 and is checked through a final
      audit carried out by a third party compliance with local sh regulations is also verified by competent authorities prior to opening as part of the licensing
      procedure for new shopping centres
      policies and procedures for the procurement transport handling use and disposal of hazardous materials
      within our sheds there is a specific requirement which is included within the design team and contractors service agreements which prohibits the use
      of hazardous materials and substances as defined by sonae sierra throughout the construction works the use and disposal of the any hazardous
      materials which are not prohibited is controlled by the implementation of our she procedures for development namely the shems for new projects
      the safety health and environment management plan shemp for major refurbishments and expansions and the small works procedure for minor
      interventions the onsite sh coordinators and development teams maintain a record of hazardous materials which come onto the site and are
      disposed of from the site
      during the operations phase and within corporate offices we have a procedure in place that sets out the main safety recommendations for handling
      hazardous products including the hazard characteristics of products the labelling rules storage incompatibilities and recommended protective measures
      these are supported by posters to raise awareness among service suppliers around the correct storage and handling of these products where possible
      we work with service suppliers to replace hazardous products with less hazardous alternatives that share similar characteristics
      policy and procedures for assisting employees with mental health issues substance and alcohol addiction and hiv  aids
      alcohol and drug use is prohibited during work shifts and inside all of our construction sites this is strictly followed up by the site sh coordinators and
      sh technicians throughout the entire construction in 2012 we held training sessions on stress management for our employees and in particular for our
      accounts department the objective of these sessions was to help employees to identify the effects of stress and learn how to manage and reduce them
      policy on compensation and benefits for employees for workrelated injuries and fatalities
      compensation and benefits are provided in accordance with the law ie through insurance policies specific clauses are added to service agreements
      with contractors in order to ensure that in case of serious workrelated injuries or fatalities the fines that are paid to sonae sierra revert to the families
      of injured workers

      policies and procedures for the commissioning operation and decommissioning of equipment
      proper commissioning is dealt with through two of the safety health and environment development standards sheds during the design and
      construction phase of our shopping centres these ensure that operational teams work in a shopping centre that is functional and efficient our contracts
      with service suppliers include requirements to make sure that preopening testing and training is performed on the new equipment so as to make sure
      that teams are trained to deal with all systems capabilities and functionalities decommissioning takes place within the scope of our she and
      maintenance procedures which make sure that the efficiency of shopping centre systems is closely reviewed and that investments are proposed to
      upgrade equipment where applicable

      4 shopping centres and offices campaigns in 2012 sonae sierra undertook several campaigns to raise public awareness about serious diseases for example the celebration of world
         day for safety  health at work 28th of april safety is the question at main offices and in offices of all shopping centres europe and brazil and events related to safety and
         health issues at shopping centres for example escalator safety at all shopping centres in europe

      education and training is provided in all local languages or in english
      sonae sierras has defined a transversal procedure in its safety health and environmental management system aimed at identifying and evaluating sh hazards and risks to people
      this evaluation is made for every area in offices centres in operation and development projects and through which we identify the associated activities that are developed the
      periodicity of occurrence the activitys responsible and the potential consequences to people identifying both injuries eg cut burns and occupational diseases eg muscle skeletal
      disorders hearing losses
      this risk analysis includes all risks identified to sonae sierras workforce external suppliers tenants and visitors considering whenever available the risk analysis provided by these
      stakeholders as reference for our own risk assessment
      as we evaluate a hazard we have to consider the existent control measures and deficiencies the periodicityprobability of the hazards occurrence and its potential severity after
      considering all these issues we classify hazards into four separate risk levels two that are considered as acceptable and two nonacceptable any nonacceptable risks that are identified
      must result in the implementation of additional risk control measures until risk is classified into one of the two acceptable risk categories
      examples
          in our shopping centres we identified that the activity of the inspection and test of emergency generators could generate loss of hearing capacity to avoid this we implemented
           several controls like short term worker exposure to noise regular noise measurements and communication of results mandatory personal protective equipment use signage and the
           provision of suitable hearing protectors
          in our offices the possibility of air handling units maintenance operations generating musculoskeletal disorders was recognised as so and to avoid this we provide mechanical
           transport equipments to ease work training on this equipments functionalities and promote regular inspections on their use
          in development sites we identified that workers involved in demolishment activities are more susceptible to pick up respiratory problems due to excessive dust conditions so we set a
           procedure to previously humidify all areas foreseen to be demolished and provide all involved workers with suitable masks and training on their proper use
      all matrixes are validated by qualified technicians either the country safety health and environment coordinators in offices and operational centres or safety  health coordinators in
      development sites and then approved by the respective site manager
      in shopping centres besides the previous validation the matrixes are also validated on site by a safety and health technician that is dedicated to concerns related to risks for staff
      additionally in all countries where this is demanded by law an occupational doctor also provides followup and feedback to sonae sierra staff in regular consultations and evaluates each
      staffs workstation to evaluate it and eliminate any possible future occupational health complaints or problems
      regarding shopping centres under development we have acknowledged that the task of identifying the number of workers that are exposed to a specific risk in a specific moment is
      extremely complex due to site specific factors as the variation of construction processes the multiplicity of tasks that a worker may perform or the previous training that workers
      possess and that the time and effort put into this identification will not produce relevant benefits to sonae sierra
      our posture focuses most of our efforts to ensure that all existent risks in each construction site have proper control measures associated and to continuously followup on the adequacy
      of these control measures throughout construction we identified that workers on constructions sites are more exposed to noise vibrations dust working with concrete knowing this and
      to minimize the associated risks the following measures are implemented workers rotation awareness use of personal protective equipment ie masks glasses gloves cleaning use of
      specific uniform to specific tasks
      all sites have to perform the risks and hazards assessment to evaluate which are the risks that workers are exposed to and then all of them are validated by qualified technicians either
      the country safety health and environment coordinators in offices and operational centres or safety  health coordinators in development sites and then approved by the
      respective site manager
      in management activity the risks of serious occupation diseases are less extensive than in development however sonae sierra was able to identify eleven occupational diseases all in
      service suppliers some examples can be tendonitis loss or reduction of hearing capacity or raynaud phenomenon the stakeholders that are more exposed to risk of occupational
      diseases are maintenance and cleaning service suppliers
      in corporate office the only risk identified is the risk of tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome during this year there was one occupational disease recorded in portugal it was a
      tendonitis which is consistent with our risk analysis

      human rights aspects
      disclosures on management approach
      overall
      our business activities do not typically infringe upon or come into direct conflict with internationally proclaimed human rights issues we mainly operate
      in regions which typically possess significant bodies of legislation to protect working conditions and human rights amongst the labour force
      we are expanding our business as a third party services provider into emerging markets such as north africa where legislation protecting working
      conditions and human rights is not as robust our traditional european markets in these markets where we provide third party services we do not sign
      contracts with service suppliers on behalf of the asset owner
      goals and performance
      it is our principle to respect the dignity and rights of each individual within the scope of our own direct activities we uphold this principle through the
      implementation of practices that are aligned with our code of conduct and our core values namely our responsibilities to our staff tenants suppliers
      communities and other stakeholders
      policy
      our code of conduct promotes the fundamental aspects of ethical behaviour that sonae sierras board believes should be adopted in all our activities it
      promotes ethical and responsible decisionmaking by providing guidance on dealing with issues such as bribery corruption legal compliance equality and
      human rights
      our code of conduct is based around six ethical principles which include the respect for the dignity and rights of each individual respect for individual
      identity independent of race gender or religion promoting a balance between personal and professional life acting with honesty and integrity
      commitment to the community and strict compliance with the law
      our responsible procurement policy commits us to integrating cr criteria into our service suppliers management procedures so as to ensure that the
      social and environmental performance of our suppliers is considered when tendering managing and evaluating supplier contracts contracts signed by
      our development and businesses with critical service suppliers included clauses for minimum requirements in relation to safety environmental and
      social standards
      organisational responsibility
      the sierra ombudsman promotes compliance with our code of conduct and encourages behaviour aligned with our ethical principles the ombudsman is
      an independent facilitator to whom all stakeholders can present their complaints with assurance that they will be processed investigated and responded
      to in a timely and sensitive manner
      training and awareness
      we conduct regular training on our code of conduct that is mandatory for all our employees
      cr questionnaires that are distributed to critical development suppliers collect information on our supplies policies and practices on a range of cr issues
      including human rights each supplier is allocated a score and this is communicated back to them to help raise awareness on cr and encouraging them to
      perform better when possible
      monitoring and followup
      we consider that the inclusion of clauses relating to human rights in contracts with our critical first tier suppliers and supplier questionnaires constitutes
      a form of human rights monitoring and followup

      suppliers
      we assess the cr performance of our development suppliers with whom we have large contracts in place over 25 million by distributing
      questionnaires to collect information on their policies and practices regarding a range of cr issues including ethics anticorruption human rights
      environmental compliance equal opportunities safety and health and community investment each supplier is allocated a score according to the results
      achieved and this is communicated back to them
      we also ensure that contracts signed by our critical property management suppliers include clauses for minimum requirements in relation to safety
      environmental and social standards for existing critical property management suppliers including maintenance security cleaning and waste
      management suppliers we conducted cr audits that involve a check list of cr issues to assess their knowledge about our shopping centres she
      procedures and the conditions of their equipment we work with suppliers to develop action plans to tackle nonconformities and conduct follow up audits
      to ensure any nonconformities have been addressed

      details of the communitiesrelated risks and opportunities that we have identified as being most relevant for our business are provided on page 22
      apart from gaiashopping in portugal which was completed in 1989 none of our projects have ever involved the displacement of local community

      corruption anticompetitive behaviour and compliance
      policy
      sonae sierras code of conduct promotes the fundamental aspects of ethical behaviour that sonae sierras board believes should be adopted in
      company business and activities and lists the ethical principles that include the duties of strict compliance with the law and acting with honesty and
      integrity the code of conduct includes one specific guideline on the avoidance of bribery and corruption by stating that it is forbidden to give or accept
      any reward or benefit with the purpose of influencing someones behaviour to obtain a commercial advantage
      the code also promotes ethical and responsible decisionmaking by providing guidance on dealing with issues such as bribery corruption legal
      compliance equality and human rights
      organisational responsibility
      whilst the executive committee is ultimately responsible for managing these issues ethical conduct is a personal responsibility and every employee is
      held accountable for his or her behaviour
      training and awareness
      regular ethics training is mandatory for all our employees in 2012 we concluded the best training programme behaviour with ethics sierra training
      for sonae sierra employees which is based on the contents of the code of conduct and anticorruption guidelines participation was compulsory and at
      the end of each session employees were required to sign and return the sonae sierra code of conduct acknowledgement confirming that they had
      received the code of conduct and agreed to comply with its provisions
      monitoring and followup
      the sierra ombudsman promotes compliance with our code of conduct and encourages behaviour aligned with our ethical principles the ombudsman is
      an independent facilitator to whom all stakeholders can present their complaints with assurance that they will be processed investigated and responded
      to in a timely and sensitive manner
      we ensure that compliance with the avoidance of bribery and corruption is upheld by incorporating corruption risk into the annual internal audit plan of
      activities which is aligned with the sonae sierra risk matrix through the audit work carried out by business process areas
      in relation to specific policies and practices followed by sonae sierra to mitigate corruption risk with respect to real estate valuations and transactions
      our asset management and development businesses follow the rics guidelines transactions are subject to approval by the board of directors of the
      special purpose vehicles spvs the board of directors of sonae sierra and in many cases by the investment companies of the funds whilst there are
      no specific guidelines to mitigate risks with respect to valuations the entity that carries out most valuations for sonae sierra indicates in its report that
      the fees collected from sonae sierra represent less than 5 of its revenue on a global basis within the context of our property management activities
      the procedure of getting bids for the services we contract out to suppliers minimises the risk of anticompetitive behaviour in the supply chain taking
      into consideration the strong involvement of several corporate organisational structures related to this process shopping centre management and
      central operation departments this procedure also ensures a clear coherent and accepted recommendation supporting thus and relevantly the final
      award decision
      public policy
      essentially sonae sierra supports political endeavours to encourage greater social cohesion and environmental responsibility although we resist
      changes in legislation that are likely to significantly and adversely affect our business lobbying activities which took place in 2012 are reported under

      on 31 december 2012 sonae sierra owned 47 shopping centres and had seven projects under development including four for third parties
      we have one significant local community engagement programme in place our community advisory panels caps which are described on page 80 in the
      community and visitors chapter of this report and are in place across 31 66 of our operational shopping centres and 2 of our projects under construction
      environmental impact studies eiss or preliminary environmental evaluations pees are carried out on 100 of new development projects and on
      major expansions they include specifications such as the identification of locations of historical architectural and archaeological value and data on
      important socioeconomic indicators within the study area when we begin new projects we perform a feasibility analysis which involves analysing the
      competition and impact of our activities on competitors performance
      through our geo tracking studies we evaluate the impact of our shopping centres on local consumer habits on an annual basis aside from these we do
      not have any local community impact assessment programmes in place across our portfolio we have community education projects in place at shopping
      metr√≥pole and shopping penha in brazil but aside from these we do not have any other local community development projects in place across our portfolio
      during the commercial licensing phase of new shopping centre projects we are obliged to comply with the planning obligations defined in each country
      and by each local authority for example in some locations we must set aside part of the site for the creation of green spaces and if this is not possible
      on the site in question we must pay a compensatory fee so that green spaces can be created in alternative areas the development of transport
      infrastructure around new shopping centre sites including roads bicycle paths and parking spaces footpaths etc is another example of infrastructure
      developed for community benefit in some instances to meet with mandatory requirements of local authorities and in others to meet with our own
      safety health and environmental development standards eg regarding the promotion of sustainable travel many of our shopping centres also offer
      play areas for children cr√®che services sports and waste recycling facilities which are available for the local community

      in italy we challenged in court regional and municipal decrees aiming at maintaining in place limitations on opening hours that had been cancelled by
      national law in december 2011 the action was taken in coordination with federdistribuzione the italian large retailers association and was successful
      as all such regional and municipal regulations were ruled illegitimate the case was taken to the italian constitutional court by a number of regional
      governments but their appeal was rejected and the law is now in place and not subject to any further challenge
      as members of cncc icsc italy sonae sierra campaigned heavily in the period between the passing of the law and the constitutional court decision
      in order to support the view that freedom of opening hours was beneficial both to the efficiency of retail operations and to the occupation levels
      we also campaigned through cncc and through assoimmobiliare of which sonae sierra is a member for a better coordination of urban development
      and land zoning legislation at regional level by establishing a binding frame of rules at national level limiting divergence of regional laws in this field we
      contributed to the drafting of a proposal for a new national law that was presented by assoimmobiliare to the public in a number of events and will be

      policy
      through our years of experience in designing constructing owning and managing shopping centres we identified the sustainability features which are
      most important for our operations our safety health and environment development standards sheds have been developed with reference to our
      own experience best available techniques international certification schemes such as leed and breeam and internationally recognised safety
      standards such as the national fire protection association nfpa and european safety standards
      the sheds are structured in a way that they allow our shopping centre projects to achieve the international breeam good standard or above for
      environmental design as well as our own minimum requirements we do aim to apply breeam ratings to our projects in future
      during the construction and operations phases we operate safety health and environment she management systems in all our construction sites
      and owned shopping centres which are based on iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 standards applying these standards enables us to guarantee that all she
      risks are identified and controlled it is also part of our policy to seek third party audit and certification of the she management systems across all our
      sites by obtaining iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certification shopping centres ensure that their management systems are aligned with sonae sierras
      corporate policy and that she procedures have been fully implemented certification demonstrates to our stakeholders our visible commitment to
      managing our she impacts and helps us to reduce the costs associated with those impacts

      goals and performance
      our primary customers are our tenants from 2013 our existing longterm objectives in relation to tenants will be fully embedded within existing
      business procedures and not managed as part of our sustainability strategy the longterm objectives are deliver a high quality service to tenants and
      maintain high levels of satisfaction striving to achieve an average tenant satisfaction level of 4 or above in all shopping centres by 2015 and engage
      with our tenants with the aim of helping them to improve their safety health and environmental performance
      commentary on our performance in relation to tenant satisfaction in 2012 including key success and shortcomings can be found on page 75
      commentary on our performance in relation to shopping centre visitors satisfaction in 2012 can be found on page 81
      organisational responsibility
      senior responsibility for tenant satisfaction and other aspects of tenant engagement and management are divided between the sonae sierra board
      director responsible for property management and leasing in europe including ultimate responsibility for sonae sierras 30 top tenants and the ceo
      of sonae sierra brasil responsibility is divided at the management level between the heads of property management in each country of operation
      shopping centre managers take responsibility for managing the day to day relations with tenants with support from centralised leasing teams we have
      an online property integrated management system pims in place which supports all property management processes in an integrated way covering
      leasing marketing operations administration maintenance safety and security activities
      monitoring and followup
      we regularly monitor the effort ratio of our tenants the ratio of rents plus common charges paid by the tenant to the sales they achieve and compare
      the performance of different tenants with similar operations in the same centre or similar units in different shopping centres if we detect that a tenant
      has a very high effort ratio we arrange a facetoface meeting with the store management team to seek to understand the reasons for this and if
      possible help the tenant to find a solution
      we undertake annual tenant satisfaction surveys in all our owned shopping centres which allow us to gain general feedback on operational aspects
      marketing events communications our cr programme and satisfaction with our shopping centre management teams survey results are used to
      develop action plans to address aspects which receive low scores and ultimately drive continuous improvement in tenant satisfaction levels recognising
      that understanding and responding to our tenants concerns will help us to deliver a higher quality service in 2008 we launched a top tenant survey in
      portugal spain and brazil to obtain feedback from key tenant companies at the senior management level in 2009 we also rolled out top tenant surveys
      in germany italy and greece and these were completed at the beginning of 2010 following these top tenant surveys tailormade actions plans were
      developed and are being implemented in each country
      we help our tenants to improve their financial and cr performance through training and marketing and our efforts to increase our shopping centres
      operational efficiency including reductions in energy water and waste costs in line with our environmental strategy help to deliver cost reductions for tenants
      with respect to shopping centre visitors we undertake mall tracking surveys at our shopping centres every year or two years to help us understand our
      visitors profile their behaviour and requirements these surveys monitor trends in visitor satisfaction expectations loyalty and behaviour and also ask
      questions about social and environmental aspects shopping centres develop action plans on the basis of the survey results paying particular attention
      to critical success factors affecting visitor numbers and shortterm actions necessary to correct any negative results
      we have a customer feedback system in place called customer contact management which provides a unique source of learning for our shopping
      centres we encourage visitors to submit their suggestions and complaints in writing and we ensure that the shopping centre manager personally
      responds to all suggestions and complaints presented in order to improve both the quality of our contact with customers and our ability to learn from
      them in 2010 we carried out a contact management project this involved reviewing and systematising all the procedures for written and verbal contacts
      with customers creating new tools for reporting customer contacts and training all the internal and external staff working in our shopping centres on how
      to handle customer questions and complaints in brazil we provide training to our customer contact management team and evaluate their skills and
      compliance with our customer care standards using a mystery shopper technique both within shopping centres and through calls made to the call
      centre shopping centre visitors may also present complaints to the sierra ombudsman
      when customers offer their time to provide written feedback it is essential to show that we take it seriously the first step is to ensure an adequate
      answer in a short period of time this timing is measured against the sla service level agreement the objective is to respond to customers in three
      working days but acknowledging that is not always feasible the sla target is 70 answered in three days 95 in one week and 100 in two weeks in
      2012 82 of written feedback was answered in three working days all employees working at our shopping centres are trained in how to manage verbal
      feedback through tools including a training film presentation and a pocket book summarising the correct procedures and behaviours

      marketing communications
      sonae sierra does not currently monitor marketing communications to evaluate conformity andor good practices with respect to transparency and fair
      marketing communication with customers this is principally due to the following two reasons 1 the budget invested in marketing communication
      campaigns does not justify the costs that sonae sierra would have to bear to contract the icap portuguese official compliance entity 2 to date sonae
      sierra has not received any complaints concerning lack of transparency in marketing communications
      customer privacy
      sonae sierra does not supply data concerning tenants to third parties sales achieved or results of audits except in cases where we are obligated to by
      law or we are authorised to do so by the tenant company sensitive tenant data is always kept confidential with data only being disclosed in the case of a
      shopping centre valuation and in this case the valuator who analyses the data is obliged to adhere to a confidentiality agreement the application of
      these measures eliminates the need for a specific strategic management approach concerning customer privacy

                  referred to below on the information referred to above
               scope
               3 we conducted our review in accordance with the international standard on assurance engagements
                  3000  isae 3000 issued by the international auditing and assurance standards board regarding
                  assurance engagements other than audit or reviews of historical financial information for a limited
                  level of assurance
               4 this standard requires that we plan and perform procedures and apply audit skills and techniques in
                  order to obtain an adequate understanding of the matters under review and considering the
                  circumstances to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence on which to base our conclusions in a
                  limited assurance engagement the procedures performed consist primarily of inquiries of sonae
                  sierras responsible and analytical procedures including tests on a sample basis and therefore less
                  assurance is obtained than in an engagement aimed at obtaining reasonable assurance

                    included in sonae sierras consolidated financial statements as of 31 december 2012

               6 based on the work performed as described in paragraph 5 above which was executed to obtain a
                  moderate level of assurance nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
                  corporate responsibility information included in the sonae sierras 2012 report referred to in
                  paragraph 1 above has not been reliable and consistently prepared and that it does not conform in
                  all material respects with the disclosure requirements of the gri guidelines for the a application
                  level and with the criteria defined by sonae sierra
