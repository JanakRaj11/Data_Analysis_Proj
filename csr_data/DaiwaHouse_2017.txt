      the daiwa house group philosophy




                        protecting children from traffic accidents
       the symbol of the daiwa house groups sustainable vision is reflected
             in the construction of japans first pedestrian overpass
                  the rapid increase in traffic in japan in the early 1960s led to an alarming increase
                                 in the number of traffic accidents involving children
      our founder nobuo ishibashi was greatly troubled by this situation he believed that pedestrians should be
        able to cross roadways above the traffic so he commissioned the company to construct and donate a
      pedestrian overpass made of steel pipe a construction method at which the company had become adept
               determining what is useful to individuals and society was a concept taken to heart during
                                         the founding of daiwa house industry
                                                                               refers to a pedestrian overpass of steel pipe construction

      endless heart  our founders spirit



            dont do things because they will make a profit
 since 1955 but because they will be of service to society




                  dont start off from the thought
                  what can i do that will make a profit
                  a company is a public organ of society and we must ask ourselves
                  what kind of product  or what kind of business  will be of use to
                  the world around us and make people happy

 aim to realize an environment where employees can concentrate
 themselves further on fulfilling and creative operations by
 leveraging information and communication technologies
 toward improved productivity through workstyle reform among
 employees more specifically the following four reforms are in
 progress
 ① workstyle reform toward onsite completed operation by
   upgrading the operational efficiency of construction engineers
   through the utilization of smart devices
 ② workstyle reform among office workers by upgrading the
   operational efficiency through the automation of office work
   which had to be handled by humans due to difficulties in the
   application of it
 ③ manufacturing reform by reviewing business models in housing
   construction as our core business thereby improving the user
   experience of customers more efficiently utilizing engineers
   and shortening lead time
 ④ communication reform to upgrade organizational power
   by establishing a system to broadly leverage the substantial
   knowledge and wisdom acquired by employees through
   work experience without limiting them within individuals or
   departments

       in addition to the above a help desk has been put up to
 establish an environment where employees can effectively utilize
 information and communication technologies the help desk
 not only provides consultation services concerning pcs but also
 prepares manuals that are easy to understand it promotional
 committee members are also appointed in each department
 and at each branch office the committee members facilitate
 cooperation between the information systems headquarters and
 frontline personnel thereby contributing to the upgrading of it

                 cocreating a brighter future with local communities


 interaction with local communities at plants
 showing consideration for local communities and proactively
 communicating with them are important elements of sustainable
 operations at our plants in this regard we go as far as to require
 exterior designs for parking garages that take into consideration
 the coming and going of nearby residents vegetation or walls
 for shielding noise emissions and nighttime headlights of trucks
 and green spaces and selected trees that reflect the seasons
 in our plant construction and renovation manuals that specify
 infrastructure codes moreover plants must be designed to
 function as a forum for hosting nearby residents in times of
 disaster
      plants also promote community cocreation activities in
 order to build good relations with nearby residents some
 widely implemented activities include cleanups participation in
 community events music and planting projects described earlier
 and offering students internships these internships and plants
 tours we give to students from local elementary junior high and
 senior high schools double as learning opportunities where we
 can show them a thing or two about manufacturing sites what it
 means to work and jobs of the future

      as a result we formulated our csr procurement guidelines in                                as a result of these efforts we expect to reduce our energy
fiscal 2015 and are encouraging our suppliers to address climate                                  consumption by about 15
change in fiscal 2016 we established a mechanism that enables
our suppliers to selfassess their activities and this effort has helped                         updated boiler facilities at the miyagi zao royal hotel
us monitor the progress of our initiatives to reduce co2 emissions
      in the future referring to the results of the selfassessment
we will share information on energy consumption in the production
stage of the products we procure and the state of implementation

      example          introduced eco navigator system for the renovation business

      when we suggest energyefficient renovations to our customers it is essential that we
      conduct a simulation of utility costs after the proposed renovation to confirm the benefits
      compared with the utility expenses before the renovation in fiscal 2016 in order to improve
      our abilities to offer these proposals we introduced our eco navigator utility cost simulation
      system in our renovation department this innovative system has been put to use and
      evaluated when proposing new house designs which has enabled us to improve significantly
      the nature of the simulation as well as its suitability for renovation purposes in particular by
      increasing the number of input variables as part of the information on existing houses
      including the addition of insulation we were able to enhance our capability to propose
      solutions as we have greatly increased the scope of facilities encompassed within renovations
      while increasing the accuracy of our simulations
            in the future we intend to employ our eco navigator system to strengthen our
      relationships with our existing customers during home inspections at the same time we                                   screen of eco navigator
      are able to enhance the solutions we propose to those living in houses built by our
      competitors this innovation will enable us to extend the life of existing houses and
      expand our scope of distribution

 in fiscal 2016 we collaborated with a manufacturer in the joint development of the weathery environmental
 sensor this environmental sensor incorporates three sensors motion wind speed and temperature                                              motion sensor
 humidity when it detects a temperature humidity or wind speed exceeding a reference value it notifies the
 administrator by email while also triggering an indicator light and voice alert this device transmits the
 weather status even from an unmanned site alerting personnel to take steps to prevent heat stroke or
 prepare for strong winds as a preventive measure as of may 15 2017 this sensor has been installed at 113
 construction sites we will continue to promote the popularization of this innovative system                                                weathery environmental sensor

  example          collaborating with roof tile manufacturers to determine the
                   effectiveness of precut tiles
  generalpurpose commercial roof tiles and the standard roof tiles used by daiwa house industry




                                                                                                                                                                                     customers
  have different widths based on the traditional japanese shaku scale which tends to result in an
  increased number of tile offcuts therefore in fiscal 2016 the mie technical training center of the
  company undertook construction testing of a roof tile developed by iraka solar ltd and
  manufactured by marusugi co ltd since this roof tile conforms to our standard dimensions it
  is possible to cut the roof tiles to create patterns needed for installation at the roof edge as a
  result the roof tiles can be easily precut at the factory thus reducing by 160 to 180 kg the
  amount of tile waste generated at the construction site when tiling a conventional hipped roof in
  addition this approach improves construction efficiency and eliminates the labor required to




                                                                                                                                                                                     employees
  dispose of the scrap
       beginning in fiscal 2017 we adopt precut roof tiles in order to reduce the generation of
  waste material with the expectation that this method will come into wide use in the future
  moreover as many other companies in the same industry have adopted the traditional shaku
                                                                                                                                  cutting pattern

  example          product development for preengineered buildings

  preengineered buildings are products of the commercial and office buildings segment of daiwa
  house industry in this business segment we have reduced the use of steel frames concrete and
  other resources by incorporating our proprietary structural designs in addition to improving our




                                                                                                                                                                                     local communities
  plant production rate we have reduced the amount of waste generated at the construction site
         the summer olympic games and paralympic games to be held in tokyo in 2020 are
  driving demand for temporary ancillary facilities in response to this demand we are developing
  sustainable products that make full use of the advantages of preengineered buildings
  specifically by developing floors and ceilings designed to be dismantled and relocated we
  can accommodate the need for relocation restocking and rebuilding of temporary structures
  by adopting construction methods that reduce waste we are taking steps to create a system
                                                                                                                               construction of roof panel

  improving productivity at our factories we will also introduce bim in the future to strengthen
  management of information on the materials we use in so doing we will standardize and
  streamline operations improve the efficiency of design production construction and transfer
  improve productivity and production capacity and improve the adoption rate of preengineered
  buildings

 in order to reduce the amounts of chemical substances handled in
 our plants we hold periodic meetings of a crosssegment joint
 working group that includes participants from the development                                   major efforts
 and manufacturing segments our development segment as part                                    measures to address soil contamination at our holdings
 of its commitment to continuous improvement investigates ways                                  plants
 to substitute less toxic alternatives for current materials using
 reports on the status of chemical substance usage in our plants as                             as one of our efforts to comply with the soil contamination

 management system and are continuing to comply with emissions                                   we are planning to test the soil at the other plants as well
 standards regarding soot and drainage
       with regard to wastewater in particular we perform ongoing
 maintenance and are more stringently monitoring the discharge
 from the wastewater treatment facility for the electrodeposition
 coating apparatus which is the main source of discharge to
 public waters coastal bodies of water and waterways in addition
 our plants in kyushu nara and ryugasaki introduced ds fems

      community association land
      daiwa house industrys tama new town higashiyama a singlefamily housing
      development is a largescale development consisting of 681 blocks locations for two
      community centers had been assigned in line with administrative guidance
            the one existing community center was already in daily use by residents but
      construction of the other facility had not been planned so residents led an effort to make
      use of this land effectively as a result the community association agreed to the use of
      the land as a vegetable garden and a new residents organization called higashiyama
      agri club was established within the community association after local farmers held a                                        workshops
      ninemonth workshop for participants work began in february 2016 the first harvest
      festival a local social gathering celebrating the bounty from the first harvest proved to
      be a great success monthly workshops are now an ongoing activity
            making use of the unused community association site as a vegetable garden made
      it possible to reduce maintenance costs which otherwise would have been a permanent
      burden on the community association now the garden provides daily nourishment and
      fosters a new community of club members community residents
            in the future we will continue to create opportunities for residents to interact and
      foster community activities

   report period april 1 2016 to march 31 2017                                            reference number of consolidated subsidiaries 162 99 in japan 63 outside japan

   reporting organizations daiwa house industry co ltd and its consolidated subsidiaries in japan                                                    as of march 31 2017


    the scope of these environmental data encompasses the domestic business operations of daiwa house industry and its consolidated subsidiaries which are the
    target organization of endless green program 2018 our environmental action plan
    excluded from the data however are smaller companies that impart no environmental impact for each indicator
    the coverage rate of the target companies is estimated at 96
    regarding the environmental impact of sites outside japan that are excluded from the data we report only co2 emissions and water consumption on pages 163
    and 176 of materials and data section because sales of our businesses outside japan represent only 3 of consolidated net sales




                                                                                                                                                                                     customers
    in addition in the event of a change in the number of consolidated subsidiaries subject to environmental management the following measures are undertaken in
    order to facilitate the comparison of any such change
    when the number of relevant organizations decreases during the term due to a sale etc
    data on the relevant organization is excluded from the relevant years data and is also excluded from data from the preceding years
    when the number of relevant organizations increases during the term due to an acquisition etc
    if the environmental impact is large data on the relevant organization is excluded from the data for the relevant year or base year but is included beginning with the
    subsequent term of the environmental action plan past data is also included




                                                                                                                                                                                     employees

    in general the time period covered by our reports is the preceding 3 to 5 years
    if a calculation method or the scope of reporting is changed corrections and reports are included in the abovementioned periods as well as in the benchmarks for
    the base year


   co2 emission factor
    as a general rule our group uses fixed values during the period covered by the environmental action plan three years in order to ascertain accurately the
    improvement status of the company itself
    regarding fuel etc we use values based on the energy efficiency act act on the rational use of energy and the act on promotion of global warming

   the end of their service life for the relevant fiscal year we then calculate the contributed reduction in co2 emissions by subtracting the result from the co2 emissions generated by a
   comparable equivalent product as for the contributed reduction of an esco the value is calculated by the existing home base method and the annual co2 emissions of all facilities
   subject to esco services during the fiscal year cumulative amount for an existing house are calculated we calculate the contributed reduction by deducting it from the co2 emissions
   of a comparable facility

 our response to thirdparty opinion
 i would like to express our wholehearted appreciation to ms unno for continuing to provide her valuable
 opinions on our groups csr activities
      based on the recent demands of a society that places sustainability as an important aspect of corporate
 activity since fiscal 2016 our group has formulated and begun to implement a mediumterm csr plan in
 harmony with our 5th mediumterm management plan
      in addition we have renamed our conventional csr report as our sustainability report and we are
 reporting elements that reflect the impact on the environment and society as well as business growth which
 affect each stakeholder in fiscal 2016 we strove to further disclose the information requested by our target
 readers in relation to governance and supply chain management however regarding the connection between
 csr and business strategy and value creation as related to society and the environment we believe that these
 are important management issues to be addressed in the future
      regarding social issues and the value chain our groups influence mainly in the construction industry is          tamio ishibashi
