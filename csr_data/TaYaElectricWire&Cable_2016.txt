chairmans statement
  60 is more than just a number
   october 2015 marked the 60th anniversary of ta ya on the anniversary day we arranged to have 60 ta ya couples walk down a red carpet
to embrace blessings from longtime customers friends and the neighborhood it was an especially touching and proud day for me
   in the last 60 years we started as an ordinary wire manufacturer and gradually expanded our expertise towards magnet wires high
voltage power cables solar power plants and even venture capital locationwise we have expanded our presence into hong kong china
and vietnam as a cable manufacturer we have claimed manyno 1titles in the local industry including the first to be certified by taiwan
power company for the supply of 69kv 161kv and 345kv highvoltage cables the first to voluntarily adopt leadfree production for all cable
products the first to obtain carbon footprint label the first to publish a csr report the first foreign company to list for trading in vietnam and
the first cable manufacturer to establish a foundation that is dedicated to building pristine homeland during the corporate governance evalua
tion organized by financial supervisory commission in 2015 ta ya was ranked among the top 20 of all twselisted companies
   i remember having been told by our seniors thatcorporations exist for societywhich is part of the reason that we have dedicated
ourselves to fulfilling our mission ofenlightened employees satisfied customers positive shareholders and pristine homelanda few
years ago a trend towards corporate social responsibility started taking shape which eventually prompted us to think one step ahead about
environmental and climate issues and redefine the industry we are in and the corporate role we play we realized that ta ya being a member
of the energy business is about to be liberated from a highly regulated industry and while we have long played our role as a connector of
energy we have the potential to become the supplier keeper administrator and service provider of energy
  energy is more than just connecting two ends
   this level of thinking brought feasible and progressive change to ta yas business we first began by focusing on our core business and
developed a new product called green wire that won ourselves thegreen classics awardwith respect to product line ta ya continues to
develop specialized cables for solar power offshore wind power and tidal power applications and has readied itself to assist in the construc
tion of renewable energy facilities in the future furthermore we have invested into the upstream of the energy industry installing solar power
equipment at rented factories institutions and campus rooftops we expect to achieve 50mw of total capacity in the next 5 years
  green means more than just opportunities
   in addition to protecting the environment ta ya pays great attention to maintaining a green lifestyle that is friendly to the environment
we have made social investments and organized corporate volunteers to introduce the green initiative into food clothing accommodation
transportation education entertainment and virtually all aspects of our daily lives we have envisioned a future where mankind can coexist in
harmony with the environment
   we have escalated the management and disclosure of our csr efforts through the assembly of group csr committee we have set our goal
to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 1 per year begun supplier csr assessment at affiliated enterprises adopted electronic industry
code of conduct eicc and expanded the boundaries of our csr report to cover overseas factories starting from this year
   these attempts and efforts are similar to the new corporate identity we have made for the 60th anniversary based on existing impression of
the dragon brand we drew the logo taya in a single stroke in the color of copper while turning and twisting along the stroke to resemble the
impression of a rising dragon the conventional red color inherits ta yas transcendent spirit and a metallic copperish color was added to
stress ta yas specialty in cable manufacturing while at the same time present a more modern and professional corporate spirit
   ta ya has redefined its corporate vision to becomea leading brand for new energy a creator of harmonious environment and pristine
homeland and a business trusted by employees customers shareholders and societythe change was made not only to capitalize on
opportunities of climate change but also to symbolize how the company has evolved to date we hope to write ta yas future as an unfold
ing story of creative thinking team work and a better home for which we welcome stakeholdersand the publics continual support and
guidance towards our goal

    social investment
      with respect to the increasingly popular issue of social
    enterprise the group holds the opinion that all social invest
    ments should be encouraged whether in the narrow sense or
    in the broad sense

      social enterprises in the narrow sense exist not only
    to solve problems in society but also reserves 30 of its
    earnings for charity purpose for a professional investor it is
    difficult enough to find an opportunity that delivers adequate
    roi return on investment let alone a social enterprise ta
    yas green inside project takes a different approach as it
    neither requires nor encourages the sponsored subjects to
    operate in corporate form and expects no return from the
    issues it cares for in other words social investment in the
    broad sense is equivalent to a social sponsorship and aims
    to achieve another form of roi namely return on impact
