energy saving dyeing and finishing

multiple initiatives have been taken by dbl group in
order to reduce the consumption of energy for the
dyeing and ﬁnishing processes the energy meters
installed ensure proper measurement of power
consumption for certain fabrics a temperature of
only 60 degrees celsius is required instead of the                      features
usual 100 for the dyeing scouringbleaching and
soaping processes the dyes used allow                             low temperature dyeing
consumption of less energy as well                                energy saving dyes
                                                                   moisture management
the wicking ﬁnishing process converts hydrophobic
fabrics such as polyester to hydrophilic hydrophilic
products intake water much better than hydrophobic
ones and thus enable optimum consumption of
water it also reduces weight loss of fabric during
processing which allows better handfeel and
increased fabric strength




dbl idea club

innovation in yarn production

our spinning mill makes use of different processes
that reduce the consumption of cotton recycled
textile materials are used instead of raw cotton the
coarse yarns used to produce fabrics reduce the
consumption of raw materials by up to 60 as
wastage is used instead of raw cotton up to 30
recycled material can be used with virgin ﬁber to
produce ornamented products known as neppy
yarns different colored neps are visible in the yarn
body and this works as ornamentation on the fabric
surface mixing of spinning waste produces snow
yarns which create a snow effect in the ﬁnished
fabrics which takes place in the new fashion trade

the spinning ill now targets to have 20 of total
production made from these recycled products

some initiatives to reduce water consumption

efficient machineries

we have installed stateoftheart dyeing machines that consume 50 less water in
comparison to the average dyeing machines this in turn has a direct effect on the receding
water table and energy consumption

reduced water consumption

water consumption in the fabric dyeing process has been reduced from 120 liters per kg of
fabric to 55 liters per kg less water means consumption of less dyes chemicals steam and
electricity and reduction in waste water discharge as such the environmental impact is
reduced and production cost is also lowered


                                            other water saving practices


                                                   repair leaking taps and educate staff to turn
                                                   off after use

                                                   replace water taps without aerators by taps
                                                   with aerators

                                                   replace single flush cisterns with dual flush

  energy management


energy is an essential point of the industrial sector to achieve sustainability as it is directly
related to ﬁnancial matters and global climate change energy consumption within the
organization is monitored and tracked to reduce wastage of the energy the following steps
are currently implemented to reduce energy consumption

         preparation of energy management policy

         collecting consumption of water steam diesel gas and electricity along with
         monthly production

         benchmarking and regulating energy consumption in consultation with the
         production team by doing process reengineering and innovations

         reducing carbon emission

         reducing diesel consumption in generators by 10

         taking initiative to reduce energy consumption by choosing alternative
         sources of nonrenewable resources

         training employees on energy and environmental aspects within the industry


dbl currently makes use of nonrenewable energy sources for its operations in 201516
10861313 liters of diesel and 40972573 cubic meters of natural gas has been used for
transportation 1819394 cubic meters of cng 1887658 liters of diesel and 338222 liters of
octane has been used


some initiatives to reduce energy consumption

natural water cooling pads

we are using natural water cooling pads in our production floors one side of the production
floor has cooling pads through which water flows continuously while the other side has
blower fans which pull and circulate the generated cool air on the floor the room
temperature for the workers is comparatively lower than the cooling done by ceiling fans the
need for installing hundreds of ceiling fans has been abandoned and energy consumption
has been greatly reduced workplace comfort has also increased signiﬁcantly


servo motors

we are using sewing machines with energy efﬁcient servo motors instead of the traditional
clutch motors in the sewing lines servo motors consume electricity only when the machine
needle is active whereas the clutch motor consumes electricity even on standby mode the
clutch motors are replaced as soon as the machines are out of order

 energy management


energy efficient machineries

  igh end energy efﬁcient capital machineries from urope us and apan are used in our
production processes these world class machineries have greatly reduced the energy
consumption for different production processes by 15 some of the features of our energy
efﬁcient and environment friendly machines are as follows


        the dyeing machines have individual heat recovery unit resulting in lower
        power consumption and energy saving by 15

        water consumption saving of 20 compared to normal dyeing machines

        reduction in consumption of dyes chemical and steam due to less water
        consumption

        heat recovery from captive power plant is providing energy saving of about 15




                               other energy saving practices


                                      reducing light intensity in certain areas

                                      switching off unnecessary lights during day

store rooms and the etp as well as the zones containing different machines such as the com
pacting machine and the generator pregnant women are also considered under risk manage
ment in order to avoid the risk to the fetuses they are to be seated when working allowed
leaving early during the lunch breaks and not allowed to work overtime

each type of analysis includes the description and consequence of the hazard the person at
risk and the control or preventive measures that can be taken in addition hazards are given
ratings calculated by using the frequencies of occurrence and the severity thereby effectively
identifying the risks or hazards to prioritize on

the kaizen suggestion box

dbl group appreciates ideas from all of its employees besides the suggestiongrievance
boxes an additional box has been included with the aim of taking in suggestions from workers
that relate to improving production efﬁciency this method provides a way to involve workers
in the decisionmaking process which makes workers feel important about themselves and
they highly appreciate the management for such initiative

these boxes are referred to as kaizen suggestion boxes and are present in all units these
boxes are green in color in order to help users easily identify and distinguish them users
submit their ideas in the boxes including their names in order to be identiﬁed for recognition


employee of the month and employee of the year

in addition to the kaizen suggestion system efforts of our employees are also recognized
through another monthly recognition system the employee of the month in 2016 a new
recognition system employee of the year was included as well the program was
inaugurated in the knitting section and has been replicated for the others units too these
ideas are compiled under dbl group idea club sustainability program

a huge advantage of having an employee of the month incentive is the motivation it
encourages the employees to work at their highest potential and move them towards
empowerment this is in terms of work performance as well as punctuality and attendance on
the job it promotes employees to work at their full potential the employee of the month
program is open for all employees and it gives them a feeling of fairness as every employee
has an equal opportunity at obtaining this reward

the evaluation system also encompasses suggestions provided by employees that would
improve working procedures the winners are provided certiﬁcates of achievements in
addition to cash incentives moreover their names and photos are displayed on the notice
boards of the respective units in order to further motivate them to grow in their careers and for
improving the company
