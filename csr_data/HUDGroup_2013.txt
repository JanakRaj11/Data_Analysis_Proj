2012 has seen a continuation of the marine industry downturn
with most analysts agreeing there will be no recovery within
2014 asian ship repair facilities have been particularly hard hit
due to the regional competition from chinese facilities previously
concentrating on ship building returning to the ship repair
market
hong kongs growth continues to spawn infrastructure
development projects and we are now well underway with our
restructuring program to allow us to take advantage of the
opportunities that these projects will present skilled labour will
continue to be a problem in the years ahead
as we move forward to the challenges of more diversified work
scopes and work site it is important that we maintain focus on
health and safety which remains our top priority additional
training courses will be arranged to ensure we are all aware of
the hazards and requirements associated with future contracts
the qhse division is working towards a continually improving
health and safety culture where we all take responsibility for the
health and safety of ourselves and of others but we all have a       david murphy

carbon footprint
for years we are aware of the impacts of our operation to the
environment and are keen on reducing our carbon emission
therefore we have worked on switching to different energy
sources as well as enhancing the energy efficiency of machineries
the carbon footprint here at hud mainly consists of burning of
vessel fuel and electricity other sources include vehicle fuel air
travel and fuel consumption for equipment and plant for the
coming years we will start monitoring our water consumption as
well as reviewing our waste management system
in 2012 our carbon emissions increased by 174 as compared to
previous year with two new 5000 hp tugs joining us and
increased business travel however there was a reduction of
fuel consumed by our equipment 21 and company vehicles

    in 2012 we organised a trip to nam sang wai
    followed by an organic farming activity for kids and
    family members nam sang wai is one of the
    famous wetland in hong kong having been
    damaged by fire as well as planned for
    redevelopment it remains as one of the valuable
    natural environments in hong kong together with
    precious value in scientific study

    hud also supported earth hour on the 23rd march

                                              looking forward
reviewing our progress 2012 and continuing our plan in 2013
reduction of fuel consumption would continue to be our main
focus on the environmental aspect in addition we will be
looking at alternative operating procedures to reduce our
environmental impacts on the safety aspects as we
acknowledge the relatively greater risk associated with our
industry we will continue to build up a sense of safety ownership
within our workforce
