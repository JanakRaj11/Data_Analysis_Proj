many of the daytoday operations in a company like veidekke are concerned with
social responsibility in practice our core operations include the development and
building of houses offices hotels roads bridges tunnels and railways we pave
operate and maintain kilometre upon kilometre of public roads we have about a
thousand ongoing projects in different parts of scandinavia at any one time clearly
there are many people who are affected in one way or another by our operations 
because they live next door to a building site or because they are clients or em
ployees or politicians who make decisions at local or central level about our future
projects no matter what processes we implement at veidekke we must never for
get the people who are affected by our operations our commitment to corporate
social responsibility will always be reflected in the way we manage the group and
it is therefore rooted in our basic values of being professional honest enthusiastic
and groundbreaking

we have set four main objectives for our endeavours to ensure responsible
operations in all parts of our organisation we will always

 run a healthy and profitable business
 live up to societys and our own ethical standards
 have an open dialogue and maintain good relations with the world outside
  the company
 be open and proactive with regard to problems and incidents

we will live up to these standards  whatever the project or task in hand

veidekke is a signiﬁcant purchaser of goods and services       while leaving 20 per cent open for other suppliers in this

players in the industry we make it our policy to give pre
ference to longterm contracts with our subcontractors it    veidekkes procurement strategy is about farsightedness
is then easier for us to work more closely with individual     and interaction and it is our goal to develop alongside our
suppliers and to exchange experience and standards in          preferred suppliers this means for example that we wish
the ﬁeld of corporate social responsibility today we re     to involve our suppliers in our corporate improvement
quire all our suppliers to follow our safety and environ      processes and that we encourage our established connec
ment rules and to make sure that any subcontractors they       tions to consider purchases from lowcost countries we
use follow the same standards we emphasise the impor         believe that this is the best strategy in the long run and a
tance of a constructive dialogue with our subcontractors       key factor in ensuring good proﬁtability over time
and we are often asked to take part in different develop
ment projects this gives us an excellent opportunity to
 inﬂuence the whole value chain in the building industry
and this is an opportunity we plan to exploit in the future

we have an annual turnover of bnok 193 in 2007 and
since we have a decentralised organisation we contribute
to local value creation throughout scandinavia both we
and the local communities in which we operate beneﬁt
from a wellfunctioning stable construction market
however our industry has traditionally been vulnerable to
economic cycles many companies have found it difﬁcult
to price projects correctly because prices rise steeply
during the building process and eat up the calculated
margins this has resulted in poor proﬁts for many
companies even in boom periods

                     veidekkes decentralised organisation means that the group
                     makes a significant contribution to value creation in local
