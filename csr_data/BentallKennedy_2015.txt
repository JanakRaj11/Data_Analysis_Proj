     simply better business




     with a 5year decrease in water consumption across our
     portfolio we are one step ahead of states and cities which
     are now mandating water reduction targets

     water                                                        waste
     water conservation is gaining importance this is            when it comes to waste management our main
     due to rising costs in a number of municipalities            focus is on reducing the amount that is sent to
     and climate change impacts on water supplies in              landfill since 2010 waste to landfill has decreased
     some geographies since 2010 we have averaged               by 7 showing a 5 year trend of 14 improvement
     a 15 decrease in normalized water consumption              per year as seen in the graph on page 8 there has
     per year across north america                               been a steady increase in the amount of waste
                                                                  diverted from landfill
     a water intensity metric tracks the water used
     in a building on a per square foot basis since              diversion rates measure how much waste is
     2010 our canadian office portfolio has improved             diverted to recycling compared to how much of
     normalized water intensity by 187 as shown in             the waste goes to landfill in 2014 waste diversion
     the graph on page 8 these improvements have                 rates in office were 52 and in enclosed retail
     been largely driven by an increase in building               were 45 showing strong improvements over the
     certifications such as leed and boma best each              2010 diversion rates
     of which have a strong focus on water efficiency
                                                                  looking forward we will continue to work with
     looking forward we believe that water efficiency            our partners in the waste industry to improve our
     will become a key factor in reducing utility costs           processes and increase our zero waste options for
     and increasing net operating income at our                   tenants another metric that will be important to
     properties across north america                             report on in the future is the percent capture rate
                                                                  of recyclable materials for example if only 10

                                                                  is 90
