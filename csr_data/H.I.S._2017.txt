       segmenting headquarters in each district has the benefit of
       improving services in truth it is also inefficient in terms of
       business expansion now onward we will firmly connect
       our business activities horizontally through our core business
       axis of overseas travel from japan and domestic travel
       within japan expanding horizontally positive aspects but
       also collaterally creating problematics which we will have
       to address swiftly to make improvements i am sure that
       we can achieve this kind of coordination and i think that
       we have created an extremely strong operational system
       yamanobe before the reorganization former district
       headquarters did implement many effective measures but
       it was difficult to achieve a horizontal spill over effect i
       think that this new system has tremendous merits

       presents an opportunityas the company has grown
       larger i think that we have perhaps been losing the spirit

we can always take a step back                                      ourselves first and create new products we will have

the workload has become compartmentalized so despite                with a strong sense of mission to organize information
having a lot of motivation it might be difficult to accomplish       from around the world and make it accessible from
certain changes or projects but i want our employees to             anywhere in the world at his japan too i want there
come to work telling themselves this is the work that               to be more staff who have a sense of mission as travel
i can accomplish and feel joy and motivation it is our             professionals and who take action empowered by this
responsibility to create a working environment that enables          sense of mission lets all work together as one
such attitude after all if our staff is not satisfied working at
his they cannot provide customer satisfaction either



generating new demand for travel
oda in the field of domestic travel i think we need to
generate new demand rather than focusing on the existing
demand if we create a new domestic travel movement
our domestic travel business will grow we are challengers
in the domestic travel fieldwe want to give all that we
have
yamanobe the global travel market is going online at an
accelerating pace but there are undoubtedly still services that
customers desire from stores we will win if we can provide
products and services unique to our stores services that are
unavailable on the internet without fail we are trying various
attempts including collaborations with cafes and i believe
that stores have a role to play in generating new demand

groups the occurrence of conflict cannot be avoided         shibusawa the commons asset management has five
peace might not naturally exist in this world unless we       points of view regarding the selections for investment one
consciously create it                                        of them is profitability its a financial value showed by roe

desires and interests                                        visible value the remaining 4 values all of which are invisible
shibusawa the reason why we need peace is because            are difficult to convert into numbers actually in these values
there is continuity in time in order for humanity to         that is where the possibility of creating sustainable value
cohabitate for long time give and take are necessary      for companies is hidden one of them is competitiveness
i believe in ethics and morality whose wisdom is             meaning why is the company competitive the next element
needed for humanity to maintain peace                        is management strength successful companies have wonderful
namekata for a society to sustainably exist rules are       leadership management strength is how well the leadership
established in the form of social norms or cultures          can be handed to the next generation next is the ability to
which function as deterrents and are transmitted to the       communicate i think this is real governance and foundation to
next generation                                              generate sustainable value in a company communication with
shibusawa i might be changing the topic a little but        various stakeholders is important the last one is companys
capitalism and democracy are driven out of control            culture people are the most important resources and assets
by selfishness of course the current situation is           however i think how we evaluate people and how well we
important but if the people in support of capitalism         describe the evaluation also belongs to company culture
and democracy were to consider the future generations         rongoanalects of confucius and sorobanabacus
of children and grandchildren to come they would be          are referred to as symbols of moral capitalism however i
peaceful conversely if we think only of the present        understand that it is not only teaching what is right and pure
capitalism and democracy tend to be violent                  but also teaches about state and reason why morality and
namekata it is important to always think longterm           ethics are important to create sustainable value a winwin
with time continuity to be conscious of the fact that         situation for both makes cocreation possible
peace is not a guarantee                                     namekata i see sustainability is born from there thank you
shibusawa that is right and in order to be conscious        very much for your valuable opinion today
about peace thinking from other peoples point of
view is required the work of the his group leads
to this exercise anyone can easily go overseas and
experience the idea that there is a world like this
therefore i think that going overseas is important


the positive aspects in choosing
a company aiming at longterm
investments  visible values and values
that cannot be converted into numbers 
namekata currently the number of japanese
international travelers remains steady do you think
that japanese people need to go overseas more
shibusawa i think so by going overseas the people
who are locked in the frame of japan will realize the           profile

inside of the frame is a comfortable safety zone seeking       options as well as the sale of business equity derivatives in a foreign

opinions from third party

csr and makes highquality csr reports we invited
ms tatsumi and received her opinion as third party
on december 16th 2016 the following is the
summary of her opinion


 after reading csr report 2017 by his group
                          while i was reading this report the       at first the consideration for the environment was difficult
                          first thing that caught my attention       to see i would like the advanced efforts in huis ten bosch
                          was the new corporate philosophy          to be widely spread to inform consumers companies
                          i fel t that the opening phrase in       and consumers are in a give and take relationship if
                          accordance with the law s of the           companies keep saying that cheap prices should be valued
                          universe was especially wonderful        consumers will seek only for cheap items in contrast if
                          for the development of a sustainable      companies show that there are other values in addition to
   nippon association of  society that we aim for now this         environmentally conscious methods which tend to increase
   consumer specialists
      board member
                          phrase    gets to the point if we do      the price consumers will consider those values in terms of
    kikuko tatsumi        something that is against the laws         more than just the price besides if consumers show the
                          of the universe a sustainable society     attitudes that they would purchase items which they see as
                          cannot be achieved i heard that the       valuable even if they are a little expensive companies will
phrase has been adopted as a policy since its founding and           realize that it is not good to focus solely on cheap prices
i felt a deep philosophical sense to it i would like the whole      i think that companies grow consumers and consumers
group to surely share it                                            grow companies from that meaning calculating the
i am interested in energy related issues the other day i visited   amount of co2 emissions in each office for the first time is

described in this report in huis ten bosch vegetable cultivation   communication but also for internal communication
by led lights was conducted and solar power generation               however im concerned about a downwardsloping section
systems were also successfully operated in various places           of the line graph of trends in employee satisfaction survey
however there was a topic that i was anxious about                 in the employees satisfaction survey internally sharing
it is regarding led lights or storage batteries charging             purposes and results of daily work leads to improvement of
electricity and there was not much detailed explanation it         workers satisfaction i would like you to use this report for
