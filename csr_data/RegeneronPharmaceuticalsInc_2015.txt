sustainability in action
as we grow our business we also want to reduce our environmental impact to achieve this we focus on
reducing energy water use and overall waste as well as supporting sustainable practices by our employees
and within our communities

energy
regeneron invests in efficient smart buildings when constructing new facilities and renovating existing properties
the design for new buildings at our headquarters completed this year included energyrecovering hvac energy
starrated office equipment a solar panel array intelligent lighting controls and highefficiency led lighting these
strategies helped create an energyefficient laboratory and office environment we also incorporated ways to increase
indoor air quality reduce material and transportation impacts and minimize construction waste this sustainable
planning and design resulted in a leed gold certification


existing property renovations also included energyefficient hvac equipment lighting controls and lighting upgrades
and finetuning controls sequences and meters furthering our efforts to minimize our environmental footprint


at our new industrial operations and product supply site in ireland renovations of the existing building in 2015
included the installation of highefficiency boilers recirculating airhandling units retrofitting existing units with
variable speed drives led lighting in clean rooms and occupancy lighting controls in the administration building
we always look to improve and are implementing a monitoring and tracking program to identify additional
reduction opportunities over the next several years


we installed electric carcharging stations at our headquarters this year with expansion to other sites planned for
2016 we also plan to create solar energy through the installation of solar panels at our rensselaer facility

             theres an old saying that we do not inherit
              the earth from our ancestors we borrow it
              from our children i like to think regenerons
              standards epitomize that thinking and we are
              working hard every day to further minimize our
              disruption to the environment
