qualities are referred to as sustainable engineering we are equally convinced that innovation is the primary driving force behind
promoting sustainable engineering in fiscal 2011 the first year of the hitachi chemical group csr mediumterm roadmap
stage 2 we have clarified the responsibilities of each executive officer and identified our ideal scenario for each business divi
sion through to 2015 drawing on this broad picture of the groups future we have established quantitative targets and key
performance indicators kpis for each fiscal year while initiating an appropriate followup program to monitor and assess ongo
ing progress turning to the groups traditional focus on carbon management the promotion of resource recycling and the
reduction of resource loss we have also positioned business innovation at the heart of each initiative to provide the underlying
impetus for our efforts to promote sustainable engineering details of the groups performance in fiscal 2011 and objectives for

 3 develop disk brake pads that comply with north american regulation for copper alloys

   disk pads are components used in the brakes of cars and motorcy
   cles that stop the vehicles by being inserted on both sides of the
   discs that rotate with the vehicles although they are extremely
   light disk pads wear down from friction when they are used gener
   ally copper is used in disk pads to enhance wear resistance but
   there are concerns that the dissipated copper results in water pollu
   tion and restrictions on copper used in disc pads will come into ef
   fect in the united states in 2021 as part of our sustainable engi
   neering efforts we plan to bring copperfree disc pads to the market
   in advance of the regulations coming into effect our goal is to halve
   copper usage by 2015
