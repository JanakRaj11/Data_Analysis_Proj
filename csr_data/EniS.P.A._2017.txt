the widespread use of natural gas facilitating its production and transport and extending its use in order
to decarbonize the whole production chain research has included the development of materials
for the absorbed natural gas ang transport technology processes to convert natural gas into methanol
which can be used in lowimpact fuels and to produce chemicals technologies for separating

to produce plastics fibres and materials for construction

     in the company culture especially if this building process is not viewed as being a shared value it was for this
     reason that i thought about opening up a space where a doing moment became a sharing moment and where
     we can play with ideas to build towards a common vision ceos blog 6 july 2015
