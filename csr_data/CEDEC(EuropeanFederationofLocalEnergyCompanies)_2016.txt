2   cedec annual report 2015

the presidents statement
dear cedec members and supporters

another year has passed in eu energy policy in my opinion 2015 was the year of the european energy union and
citizens only appointed a few months prior commissions vicepresident maroš šefčovič came forward with his
vision on an energy union in early 2015 based on five pillars energy security internal market renewable energy
energy efficiency and research and innovation which will be the key priorities for the coming years so far  so
familiar but in the introduction vicepresident šefčovič also stipulated that the union should be one with citizens
at the core for the first time in an official text citizens are recognized not only as the ultimate addressees and
benefiters of eu energy policy but also drivers of important changes

in our view this is an important step as local companies our businesses are deeply rooted in local communities
citizens are their shareholders and therefore local energy companies are held accountable to the public interest
they are not only an important provider and operator of local infrastructures they are also important engines of
economic growth employers and supporters of local activities in many regions they are operating closely to the
people it is hence in their nature to put citizens at the core of their activities

while cedec would have liked to see more concrete proposals for more citizencentric policies and had suggested a
number of them in previous months we are happy to see our vision and actions taken up in the energy union paper
cedecs philosophy is that a true european energy union will be built with the support of citizens and local actors
such as local authorities local energy companies or cooperatives as we see in todays energy transition these
actors are the real drivers behind the change towards a more sustainable secure and affordable energy supply
the energy transition is not one of a few major players rather its a collective project led by engaged citizens and
the organizations and companies they support cedec member companies have been living the vision of citizens
at the core for many years and in many regions of europe therefore they feel fit for the new energy system with
integrated solutions at local level

it is therefore more important than ever that cedec is closely and actively involved in eu policy makingprocesses
with our specific knowhow and background i believe that our association has proven to be a reliable and valuable
partner for eu policy makers and will continue to make its distinct contributions to eu policies i am convinced that
the voice of local energy companies is indispensable in brussels

i hope that we can also count on the support of our members and other supporters in the future let me assure
you that we will continue to work hard let us translate the vision of citizens at the core of the union into a reality
together
