    attention to the social and environmental aspects seeking        vulcanisation a process that consumes considerable energy
    to use materials that do not represent a hazard for human         and in general requires less materials for the same voltage
    health or the environment efforts include performing             level furthermore no degassing time is needed which again

           ecosustainable solutions

afumex
cables with lower harmful emissions when in contact with
flames
prysmian technology has perfected a generation of cables
under the afumex name using jacketing that is low smoke
zero halogen lsoh on contact with flames this type of
jacketing greatly limits the emissions of acidic gases toxic
gases and smoke that often cause panic and physical injury
while also from an ecological standpoint corroding surfaces
and polluting the water table
prysmians afumex cables have been used in some of the worlds
most prestigious buildings where safety is paramount

afumex green
the first ecological building wire
the new afumex green cable presented in the 450750v class
and made at the sorocaba factory in brazil replaces part of the
petroleumbased polymer with green polyethylene which is a
100 recyclable material obtained from sugar cane this initiative
is consistent with the efforts made by the group to offer customers
ecosustainable products that reduce co2 emissions
estimates indicate that for every tonne of green resin produced up
to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide are captured and removed from the
atmosphere

plaser
the first ecological cable for electrical circuits
plaser is the first high performance ecosustainable cable for elec
trical circuits produced using recyclable materials plaser lowers the
environmental impact of circuits while also raising their efficiency and
power transportation capacity
the prysmian groups rd department has completed a project that
compared the environmental impact of two different systems for the
production of medium voltage power cables plaser and xlpe this
study used the carbon footprint methodology to quantify the entire
environmental impact of each system in terms of its emissions of co2
equivalent the results showed that the co2 emissions associated with
plaser cables are 30 of the total emissions attributable to xlpe cables
being about 8001000 kg of co2 for each kilometre of cable produced




      commitments for the future
in 2014 the group launched a project to identify and             products concerned while also reducing the dissipation of
implement parameters suitable for the broader monitoring of       energy and power
rd activity especially in terms of open and green innovation
                                                                  implementation of the design to cost dtc project will also

implement various energy efficiency initiatives at a number      at global level including directive 201227eu in particular
of factories in recent years eg replacement of lighting       the objective of the directive is to increase the efficient use

     water consumption by the group in 2014 amounted to 7421534 m3 which was about 2 less than in the prior year and about
     17 lower than in 2012
     the reduction in 2014 was principally due to a decline in the water consumption of the optical fibre category 1129

     about 60 of ozonedepleting gases were concentrated                             first was mainly due to the firsttime inclusion of the wuhan

     compared with the prior year there has been a slight increase                     refrigerant gases with hfc gases that are less problematic
     in ozonedepleting substances in the telecom sector 49




        most of the ozonedepleting substances reported relate to hcfcs especially freon aka r22 which is less problematic than other families of refrigerant
         gases already banned by law such as cfc and halon

     1   the information for the power cables category includes the telecom energy and accessories operating units at the oulu factory available information
           relates to each factory as a whole the quantities produced in relation to such information have been normalised so the telecom cables produced by the
           above operating units are identified in weight terms rather than in km as in the telecom cables category
     2   hazardous and nonhazardous waste the information for the power cables category includes combined data for the telecom and energy operating units at
           the bishopstoke factory since this factory does not accumulate separate details for each unit available information relates to the factory as a whole
     3   water consumption and hazardous waste the information for the power cables category includes combined data for the accessories and energy operating
           units at the gron factory since this factory does not accumulate separate details for each unit available information relates to the factory as a whole
     4   the information is significant at sector level in fact the quantity of ozonedepleting substances does not relate to production activities and accordingly it
           is reported separately in total for the energy and telecom sectors
     5   for the purpose of normalising the environmental parameters the volume of power cables produced is expressed in tonnes being the sum of the weights
           of the cables produced in the years concerned 2013 and 2014 and the related compounds produced by prysmian excluding the compounds purchased in the
           marketplace and simply added to the products
     6   for the purpose of normalising the environmental parameters the production in km relates to finished optical fibre excluding any semifinished fibre sold
           as such by the optical fibre factories considered in this report
     7   the production of telecom cables is expressed in km and obtained by summing the production of cables made from optical fibre quantified in fibre km
           and with those made from copper quantified in pair km the decision to use km rather than tonnes to quantify the total production of telecom cables was
           taken due to the fact that the unit of measure expressed in length reflects the production process and the related impact of environmental parameters
           more closely than the unit of measure of production expressed in weight terms
     8   only absolute amounts are reported for accessories since normalised units of production are not available for this category in particular the nature of
           production included in this category various considerably connectors for cables accessories for lifts etc




          the environmental data for the production sites not included in this analysis is not thought to be significant with respect to the mass of environmental data
           reported considering the low number of sites involved maximum 5 of the total and the limited extent of production at those locations
