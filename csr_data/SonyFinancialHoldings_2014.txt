     life insurers have a profit structure in which costs are high in the initial period of a new policy resulting in losses and profits are made
      by recovering these costs during the period of insurance consequently business management cannot be accurately assessed based
      solely on results for a single fiscal year
     this is particularly the case during years when new policy sales are strong as firstyear policy expenses are high reducing profit
     accordingly ev is widely used overseas especially in europe as a tool for comprehensively evaluating life insurers

         paperless application process
         a paperless application process allows customers to confirm policy
         content onscreen and conclude the procedure by providing an
         electronic signature this paperless process can facilitate customer

         understanding as well for example we can indicate important items
         for emphasis depending on the customer and respond to any ques
         tions that customers may have about accidents and illnesses on

            customers can register a bank account online from which to make

         smartphone connections to the
         customer database
         we have developed a specialized app that allows customer represen
         tatives to use a smartphone to photograph health reports and other
         documents that customers provide during their application and send
         this information to the companys system while the information is
         being sent to the system the app simultaneously erases the docu

         sensitive data                                                         photographing medical documents
            linking a customer representatives smartphone with the customer
         database allows the representative to call up and refer to a custom

                    to which hedge accounting is applied and derivatives to which hedge accounting is
                    not applied
        qualitative information
        1 transaction details the main derivative transactions used by sony life are as follows
           currency derivatives forward foreign exchange transactions
        2 transaction policy sony lifes policy is to conduct derivative transactions for the purpose of reducing the risk associated with the held
           assets and liabilities sony life does not engage in speculative derivatives trading
        3 purpose of use sony life uses derivatives for the purpose of reducing the risk associated with the held assets and liabilities sony life
           does not apply hedge accounting to derivatives
        4 risk details the derivative transactions used by sony life are subject to the risk of fluctuations in market prices however given that
           sony life uses derivatives mainly to reduce the risk associated with the held assets and liabilities the sum of the risk associated with
           derivative transactions and the underlying risk of assets and liabilities is limited
             the act of trading in derivatives is intrinsically subject to credit risk however sony life selects counterparties who are highly unlikely to
           default on agreements related to these transactions
        5 risk management systems sony lifes balance of derivative transactions is within the limits that sony life has set inhouse on
           transactions conducted by the division in charge of investment the administrative division receives reports directly from the transaction
           counterparty this system enables the administrative division and the investment division to independently determine derivative positions
           and transaction profits and losses in addition the management of risks related to derivative transactions is conducted strictly by the
           department in charge of supervision also the risk management division regularly reports the overall risk status to the companys board
           of directors and executive committee
        6 supplemental information regarding quantitative information forward foreign exchange transactions are undertaken for the purpose of
           reducing the risk of foreign exchange movements associated with foreign currencydenominated receivables and payables etc the

   tions conducted by the division in charge of investment the administrative division receives reports directly from the transaction counter

        1 investment environment
        during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 the japanese economy continued to grow in the first half public investment as well as
        exports showed sizable growth thanks to the governments economic stimulus package and the still depreciating yen in addition private
        consumption was solid thanks to the improvement in consumer confidence supported by the buoyant stock market in the second half
        there was a lastminute surge in demand in view of the coming consumption tax hike from april 2014 resulting in substantial increases in
        the sales of durable goods and private housing investment while the real gdp growth rate temporarily stalled at one stage due to a decel
        eration of the growth momentum in public investment and exports which have been driving the economy it proved to be generally solid
        throughout the fiscal year
          the real gdp growth rate year on year was 29 for the apriljune quarter of last year 13 for the julyseptember quarter 03 for
        the octoberdecember quarter and 67 in the januarymarch quarter
          the japanese bond market remained under the strong influence of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policy of the bank of
        japan boj implemented in april last year as the boj announced that it would double in two years the monetary base as well as its hold
        ing of longterm japanese government bonds jgbs and exchange traded funds etfs while more than doubling the period of the aver
        age remaining maturity of its longterm jgbs concern grew over the potential decline of market liquidity immediately after the introduction
        of this new boj policy triggering temporary interest rate volatility on the other hand since the boj announced it would aim to realize the
        two percent consumer price stability target and continue its quantitative and qualitative monetary easing until such time the japanese
        economy can maintain a two percent inflation rate over the long term the interest rate rise in the short and midterm maturity sector
        turned out to be limited thanks to the time axis effect which in turn spread to the longterm maturity sector slightly reducing interest rate
        volatility in the bond market as the market settled down in the period up to the fiscal yearend the interest rate was on a gradual decline
        trend the yield on 10year jgbs which is the bellwether for the longterm interest rate went down to 0325 at one point in april 2013

        middle of may 2013 encouraged by the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policy by the boj implemented in april last year along
        with the governments growth strategies then the index went down to a level below the 13000 mark in a correction phase discouraged
        by tapering quantitative easing in the us and concern over emerging economies before a recovery trend gradually prevailed on the back
        of solid domestic corporate earnings as of march 31 2014 the nikkei stood at 1482783 up 242992 from its level a year earlier

        the end of march 2013 to 10374 against the us dollar at one point in may 2013 encouraged by the quantitative and qualitative mone
        tary easing policy of the boj implemented in april last year then investors bought back yen in a riskoff market sentiment discouraged by
