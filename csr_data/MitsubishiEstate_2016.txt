   our environmental aspirations are on tangible display in the marunouchi area first we have adopted a
smart city approach and heat island countermeasures not as extraordinary initiatives but rather as a stan
dard approach a second example is the otemon towerjx building completed in november 2015 which is
built with technology that actually cleans the water in the neighboring moat of the imperial place or con
sider the 3x3 lab future that we built in the otemon towerjx building a venue where not only those
who work in marunouchi but also general visitors can drop in casually and interact at mitsubishi estate we
work with the people who live in marunouchi as well as the companies who use the offices and the people
who work in them to create networks for resolving social issues
   japans population is projected to keep declining in the future this means that determining how society
can maintain its vitality will be a key question we understand that we must foster environments in which all
kinds of people can enjoy active livesfor instance environments where people can work while raising
children or environments where the elderly can enjoy good health and dynamic lives these are the kinds of
social issues which we are determined to help solve in our future urban development efforts

strengthening governance to enhance management speed and transparency
the times are changing at an extremely fast pace including the external environment facing the real estate
industry in my view improving governance is part of our effort to adjust how we operate to match this
speed in order to accelerate decisionmaking we plan to give authority to individual business units so that
they can move ahead with business on their own responsibility thus raising the speed of management with
this aim in june 2016 we made the transition to a company with nominating committee etc structure
forming three committeesthe nominating committee audit committee and remuneration
committeewith the majority of the members of each committee being outside directors this is intended
 to raise the transparency and objectivity of management
    our goals are to get faster on the offensive side of the ball while also raising transparency to enhance the
 quality of governance

                                                   keenly aware of risk management always acting with integrity
                                                   business always comes with risks which makes the way in which risks are managed extremely important scan
                                                   dals are not acceptable we have used past experiences to demonstrate a sincere response and i believe that the
                                                   results have been solid
                                                       when developing business globally there are regulations in each country that must be observed not only must
                                                   we comply with each countrys rules we must also address all conceivable risks with a keen awareness accordingly
                                                   our internal audit office carries out thorough checks while working closely with other divisions to ameliorate
                                                   riskwe will always act with integrity while making the most of this strong internal audit function

                                                   building a business which fosters personal strengthsour most essential resource
                                                   above all else i look for personal strengths in our employees real estate is an extremely important asset for the
                                                   country companies and individuals without human capital that can earn trust from the public we will not be
                                                   entrusted with development of such a critical asset this means that enhancing personal strengths is one of the
                                                   most important issues for our organization of course this cannot be achieved just by offering lectures people
                                                   truly grow by getting involved in projects and gaining experience on site including experience outside japan
                                                   this is yet another reason why keeping our business successful for the longterm is so important to uswe
                                                   want to keep growing our people
                                                      in short we believe that our social mission is to ensure that our business meets social needs and in so doing
                                                   provide a venue for our employees to take meaningful action which translates into human resources development

                                                   making reliable future projections beyond 2020
                                                   when i joined mitsubishi estate it was only active in japan but it has now become a global company as
                                                   such future business expansion will be a fascinating challenge in order to increase our global reach while
                                                   transforming tokyo into a global financial center we will also need to strengthen our investment manage
                                                   ment business in order to give japanese investors more opportunities to invest in overseas real estate i see this
                                                   as a great new business opportunity
                                                      when we launched our mediumterm management plan in 2014 we set numerical targets we thought
                                                   would be extremely challenging to achieve in three years thanks to a favorable economic environment and a
                                                   lot of hard work however we were able to achieve the consolidated operating income target one year ahead of
                                                   schedule now we hope to build on this momentum and pick up the pace even further we plan to discuss our
                                                   future vision and draw up projections for the next three years through 2020even looking 10 years further

                                           correspondence between the key themes and the kpis management is essential in achieving the key themes
                                           and finding ways to measure the immeasurable for management purposes remains a challenge in order to
                                           help facilitate progress on the key themes you might want to give more consideration to kpi setting
                                              for example companies will face more and more questions in the future about the sources of the energy

                                           to see mitsubishi estate play a role in creating a model for a more sophisticated urban development in which

completion of otemon towerjx building equipped with water purification facility for imperial palace moat
in november 2015 mitsubishi estate completed the otemon towerjx building a 22story high
rise developed jointly with jx holdings inc this building is particularly unique because it was the
first privatesector project to introduce a rapid water purification facility and largescale reservoirs
which are designed to improve the water quality in the imperial palace moat
   in recent years the quality of the water in the imperial palace moat has deteriorated significantly
as a result of algae blooms attributable to a chronic lack of fresh water the purification facility
installed in the basement of this building will take in water from the imperial palace moat and
purify it at a fast speed of about 018m3 of water every five seconds equivalent to the volume of
water in a household bath this amounts to about 500000m3 annually to prevent water from
stagnating as a result of low water levels in the moat a massive water reservoir about 3000m3
equivalent to about six 25m pools was installed to release water into the moat this initiative is
intended to improve the water quality around otemon gate in particular thereby helping to
enhance the urban environment around the outer gardens of the imperial palace
     in addition some floors are equipped with led lighting systems with image sensors that auto
matically adjust illumination and color temperature and radiant air conditioning and desks with
individual heating and cooling units to maintain a calm and pleasant office environment with few
temperature irregularities all the while conserving energy by adopting environmentally friendly
exteriors and facilities the company expects to reduce co2 emissions per unit of floor space in the
office area by about 36 this is equivalent at the implementation and design stage to the s class
under the comprehensive assessment system for built environment efficiency casbee
     in addition the project makes the most of its proximity to the green areas of the imperial palaces
outer gardens the building together with the adjacent otemachi park building which will be
completed in november 2017 creates green space equivalent to about 45 of the buildings
external area thus providing a relaxing area for workers the otemon towerjx building epitomizes
a cuttingedge office space that delivers both energy conservation and comfort
