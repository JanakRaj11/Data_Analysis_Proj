 the use of electricity and gasoline by techno associe accounts for about 97 of the companys total co2                                    by encouraging employees to share or rent cars use carsharing services and make greater use of public
 emissions we are therefore focusing on reducing the use of these                                                                         transport we have been able to reduce the companys car fleet from 237 cars in 2009 to just 128 we set
      our target for fiscal 2016 was to reduce co2 emissions by 2 compared to the previous fiscal year                                    a target of having environmentally friendly cars account for 80 of our company car fleet up from 717
 to this end we switched to led lighting and made work processes more efficient to save electricity we                                    in fiscal 2011 by switching to hybrids and fuelefficient models as of march 2015 we had reached
