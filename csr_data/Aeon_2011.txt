    under this awareness we drew up the aeon supplier code              many people that have supported our successful history and
of conduct which has enabled us to work together with the               our commitment to assist the victims of the great east japan
supply chain including our manufacturing partners to pursue            earthquake i believe the mission of management should be to trust
environmental conservation activities and establish appropriate          the potential of the retail industry which is built upon our three
working conditions moreover international frameworks are at            pillars of community people and peace develop human resources
the heart of our management in 2004 aeon became japans first          that will take on new challenges as well as consolidate and lead the
retailer to sign on to the united nations global compact a set          actions of these human resources in one direction
of 10 principles laid out by the un on human rights labor the
environment and anticorruption we were also the first to acquire
sa8000 certification an international standard on protecting
human rights in the labor market
    in addition we need a csr strategy that is integrated with our
group management strategy in order to continue to grow together
with our stakeholders and local communities over the long term to
this end together with formulating the mediumterm management
plan in october 2010 we formulated the aeon sustainability
principle in march 2011 that defines csr activities for the entire
group in this we have laid out four key objectives for achieving
sustainable management by 2020 that balances group growth with
the development of society these are 1 realization of a lowcarbon
society 2 conservation of biodiversity 3 better use of resources
and 4 dealing with social matters
    this resolution represents our commitment to stakeholders and
each year we will manage and release our results by stipulating

40th anniversary of its founding during the past 40 years the
market and society have both undergone significant changes
but the reason behind why aeon was able to consistently achieve
growth can be found in its daily commitment to its stakeholders
this has enabled us to constantly evolve and transform significant
changes in our operating environment into growth opportunities
as new megatrends sweep toward us both in japan and overseas
i believe we must once again seek out new challenges and new
horizons in the retail industry in order to continue to realize unique

delivery in which clothing is brought to the store on hangers and
then displayed on the sales floor using the same hangers this
reduces the amount of cardboard boxes used when transporting

   kohyo co ltds mislabeling of product origins and preventative measures
   on november 30 2010 kohyo co ltd a subsidiary of aeon headquartered in osaka city was ordered to cease relevant advertisements
   and take remedial measures by the consumer affairs agency of japan based on article 6 of the act against unjustifiable premiums and
   misleading representations for mislabeling the origin of live horned turban a marine snail advertised in a newspaper insert
   this incident occurred from april 1 2010 to may 7 2010 when kohyo co ltd took out newspaper ad inserts on 10 separate occasions
   that listed the daily special as live horned turban from shimane prefecture or other domestic sources the origin country however of
   the actual product was south korea after this mistake was uncovered aeon co ltd and kohyo co ltd launched a joint investigative
   committee that included third parties to review the incident the results showed that the reason for the labeling mistake was because the
   origin country of the product was not thoroughly crosschecked with the country of origin listed on the newspaper ad insert
   aeon considers this problem as problem for all of its group companies together with building a structure to prevent similar reoccurrences
   we will take actions to ensure that the group companies comply with laws more thoroughly

   like the previous years report i feel aeons environmental and            i felt that the relationship between the four key issues
   social report 2011 features content that helps foster pertinent         chapters and subchapters as well as the subsequent layout of the
   csr communication with stakeholders this years report                 report was somewhat difficult to understand
   narrows its focus to four key issues which provides for a more             specifically there were areas where the link between the main
   systematic manner of delivering information overall the report         text and description of kpi and chapter titles were unclear in the
   left a favorable impression on me as it also includes updates           section entitled dealing with social matters slightly modifying
   based on the areas for improvement that i pointed out in last           the layout of chapters and including a list of related pages for
   years independent review and provides easytounderstand              easy reference will i believe make it easier for readers to find
   information on the emergency measures implemented by the                information as well as make the overall report easier to read
   aeon group in the aftermath of the great east japan earthquake             i would also like to suggest including interviews with aeon
                                                                           people and other stakeholders in the main body of the report as one
    particular strengths                                                  method of involving stakeholders more by having stakeholders talk
   aeons report is split into different media depending on the target     about their own thoughts and beliefs the report will foster a greater
   reader information pertinent to customers is mainly included           closeness with readers as well as a broaden understanding of the
   in the print edition while information for professionals such as      group through offering different perspectives
   financial institutions ratings agencies or ngos is featured in the
   online version this approach conveys aeons proactive stance           evaluation of report contents
   toward accurately disclosing information in a more focused
   manner ok                                                              i believe the bar for the quality of companywide initiatives
       the report covers the aeon sustainability principle which          will be raised one level higher thanks to the groups key issues
   was enacted in march 2011 and indicates the four key issues            and newest kpi both established in 2011 this is because it will
   as well as kpi tied to each the report also more clearly outlines      also provide an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of and
   aeons commitment to achieving sustainable management by                relationship between individual initiatives taken to date and
   balancing group growth with the development of society as              make it possible for more focused initiatives to be taken on a
   well as specific initiatives it will take to fulfill this commitment   companywide basis while i believe aeon will regularly revise its
   moreover i applaud the fact that the scope of goals and targets       key objective and kpi going forward i hope that it will actively
   which predominantly focused on aeon retail co ltd in previous        incorporate external perspectives into its management as well by
   reports has been greatly expanded to include all consolidated          holding stakeholder dialogue and other means as is expounded
   group companies in japan and certain businesses in china as a         in the aeon code of conduct the company is supported by a
   result of the new kpi                                                  great many people as such a key to promoting csr management
       by discussing what aeon aspires to achieve and what actions         will be the extent to which engagement is deepened with both
   it has taken to address the four key issues as well as including the   internal and external stakeholders
   newest kpi in parts of each chapter the report enables readers to          in closing aeon views asia as a new growth opportunity for
   better understand the actions that aeon has taken with sincerity        the group as approximately 10 of its operating income already
   in each of these initiatives                                           originates from markets in asia in the previous fiscal year aeon
                                                                           also showcased its activities in china in a special feature article i
    further improvement possible                                          hope that aeon continues to undertake csr activities in the asia
   i believe it would be beneficial to feature an explanation              region and report on these in order to align the direction of its
   concerning the process for determining the four key issues              csr management with business strategy
   and kpi the details surrounding how the csr action policy of               i have high expectations for aeons csr initiatives going
