                 ence of a typical working day we therefore gain a personal insight
                 into working conditions at the workshops                                       our aim is to boost the positive impact our company has on people

                 since taking over the traditional german brand offermann new
                 subjects such as the procurement and tanning of leather in india
                 have arisen our first step was to significantly reduce the supply
                 chain to focus only on one producer

                 since january 2016 we have been in the process of making the
                 value chain more transparent and building new supplier structures
                 we want to make our processes for leather as transparent as the
                 processes we have for our synthetic materials
