an overview of industry and competition

        the economics of the major buyers countries of frozen shrimp from thailand still facing
regression therefore the overall picture still not recovered yet since 2011 especially countries in
eu usa and japan had dramatically reduced importing of frozen shrimp while the supply of shrimp
also reduced in 2012 compare to 2011 due to ems early mortality syndrome in some areas this
made the shrimp prices not go down as lower demand in the market

       exporting shrimp in 2012 by the company

japan market the company massively increased the volume export to japan market compared to
2011 owning to our partner can expand and escalate the market share which amazingly opposite to
the japans economic one factor that these happen because the company can reduce the production
cost and increases the capacity

        european market the company significantly increased the sale to european market
compared to 2011 mainly because the company changed the strategy by focusing more on retail
stores furthermore the company jointed venture with partners and established 3 subsidiary
companies in united kingdom which are seafresh industry invest blue earth foods and sea farms
these three companies facilitate our company to increase the distribution channels in european
countries

       usa market the company exported to usa in year 2012 less than 2011 which correlated
with thailands export data that showed thai packers exported less in 2012 these were caused by
many factors such as increasing supply in competitors country disease of shrimp in thailand and
unrecovered economic in usa

however the company changed our strategy by establishing our subsidiary in usa in the beginning of
2013 in order to increase our distribution channel

        for the antidumping duty in the united states in 2012 the us department of commerce
announced final results of antidumping duty determination of frozen shrimp from thailand during
feb 1 2010 through january 31 2011 at 138 compared with 073 for the previous period the
us customs later announced the liquidation of frozen shrimp from thailand for the same period
