in transactions with antisocial forces and to prevent them                customers we have the customers aﬃrm and declare that
from intervening in transactions with customers through                    they are not currently linked with antisocial forces and

    have implemented a service where individuals can set limits on the amount of money that can be withdrawn from atms a card
    lock service and an ic card with a biometric veriﬁcation function

    banks for making related inquiries we are also accepting requests for return of such funds when they remain in the accounts of
    the perpetrators of these crimes in accord with the law for relief to persons victimized by deceptive transfer requests
    in addition when customers begin transactions we are beginning to request and receive pledges with clauses antisocial group
    clauses that they are not currently linked to and will not have future connections with antisocial groups if this pledge is broken
    and this corresponds to antisocial forces the group banks have introduced a pledge with a clause known as the exclusion of
    antisocial forces clause  that provides the legal basis for taking stronger steps to suspend transactions with such forces
