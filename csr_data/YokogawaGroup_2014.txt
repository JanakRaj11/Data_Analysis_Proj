 business strategies and csr

 yokogawa electric corporation yokogawa reevaluating the companys csr system and incorporating
 csr into business strategies has made its stand clear solving social challenges through its business
 operations yokogawas business is heading for creating not simply its own value but also social value

 accordingly the company takes a more proactive approach in its contribution to society

 the energy conservation and safetyenvironmental management have been realized in the com
 panys core business measurement control and information clearly the company places an
 emphasis on providing solution services by reaffirming its benefit to community and refocusing on
 sustainability ie a sustainable community it is recommended that the company continue to
 promote such efforts as a pillar of its evolution 2015 midterm business plan

 additionally through the implementation of csr under the concept of b to b to c business to
 business to community yokogawa has established a relationship with community as a b to b
 corporation thus the management of the company should aim not only toward the client companies
 with which it has direct contracts but also the communities stakeholders that have earnest needs

 yokogawa has to date mainly worked on presenting the csr concept however it would be better
 if the company showed how its business can create value to the communities in the areas of
 energy safety and environment by focusing on the communities and then explained yokogawa
 technologies products and examples of actual projects it has undertaken

 b to b to c also includes community activities and efforts made by individual employees i would
 like to know how these activities are helping to create value in the community from the stakehold
 ers perspectives who are on the receiving end of the results of such activities




                                                                                                   12

sharing the results of its efforts and the system on global basis

yokogawa continues to expand its overseas operations which in turn makes the globalization of its
business management a highpriority issue with respect to csr the company has gradually
engaged collaborations with the group companies worldwide but it is still being systematized

yokogawa should first establish collaborative relationships within european and middle eastern
regions where csr is implemented actively and voluntarily and then increase its communication
with the internal resources in those regions while seeking to establish relationships elsewhere as
for information disclosure it is important that the yokogawa headquarters csr website serves as
a liaison to the regional websites to integrate csr information i expect all members in charge of
csr from all the yokogawa group companies worldwide will be able to hold global meetings and
share understanding each other on this field


fundamental csr

human resources

the respect for human rights has in recent years become a growing issue on concern globally at
yokogawa the operations outside japan is on the increase and consequently the company will be
expected to further accord with international movements human rights as recognized globally encom
pass not only the rights of the companys employees but also those of various stakeholders of yokogawa
in other words many of the things the company is already doing such as having dialog and holding
discussions with residents of the local communities in which the company does business are also
included in humanrights activities therefore terms such as community involvement and labor
management are better easiertounderstand words to use in a local communityactual site than
human rights when conducting studies or rolling out programs that pertain to human rights in the broad
sense one example is that as the company conducts business in the middle east africa or any other
region where the social infrastructure is still insufficient yokogawas business operations could be
affected by political or social instability etc and the company might unintentionally destroy the
livelihood of the community as a result accordingly the company must be vigilant as such circum
stances are also of interest to the global community
this human rights issue extends to supply chains and yokogawa as its business expands into emerging
markets must understand the actual situations surrounding the employment and labor in such markets
it is therefore crucial that yokogawa implement and practice the companys supplychain csr guide
lines i encourage all of yokogawa to continue and expand the operation of the guidelines step by step

community development

yokogawa in the process of expanding its global operations has been engaged in various activities that
are rooted in local communities if each of those activities can be effectively explained on its websites
the company will be able to attain greater understanding among its users

it is also recommended that the areas and topics be sorted out for its community activities a little more in
order to determine where yokogawa should place its primary focus based on this it can then be
explained how these activities are carried out in each country in doing so it is important to start with
explaining the concept of b to b to c and convey the characteristics of these activities as yokogawas
business operations along with what yokogawa intends and hopes for it must be more than an ordinary
activity report that could be given by any type of business or company


                                                                                                        13

environment

as more and more products get lcalabeled representing the product has been assessed of it
environmental impact yokogawa is successfully responding to the needs of customers who are
becoming increasingly aware of environmental issues in consideration of concerns among users
and communities customers are more willing to select products explainable about the environ
mental impact from this point forward it would be helpful for yokogawa to know how its customers
perceive the fact that the company is trying to increase lcalabeled products it is recommended
for yokogawa to monitor the evaluations by customers and feedback to the development team with
the help of the sales or marketing teams




                                                                                              14

  protection of important stakeholder information

the yokogawa group works together with customers to provide them with solutions to protect impor
tant information entrusted to us by our stakeholders we implement information security measures to
address three aspects people equipment and information technology it


    people information security training

    the importance of information security and keep their knowledge up to date the yokogawa group
    uses an elearning system to annually provide training to all employees based on the belief that a

    entering straight out of university or in midcareer to familiarize them with the rules of their new work
    place we also review the details and results of the training through information security audits

    equipment continuous improvement

    we implement anti theft fireprevention and other security
    measures to protect locations where information is stored our
    facilities and equipment are kept under continual surveillance
    and efforts are made to replace obsolete facilities and equip
    ment with stateoftheart ones for rd facilities that require
    advanced security we implement a variety of security mea
    sures including the introduction of iris authentication for facility
    access control and the use of storage cabinets that can only be             opening a locked cabinet
    unlocked with an employee id card                                          with an employee id card

information technology it protection behind the scenes

the most vulnerable point with regards to information security breaches is people people can leak
information by mistake and misuse information out of ignorance it systems provide ways to
prevent such human errors

1 measures to prevent data leakage from pcs
  we create a more secure environment by installing antivirus software implementing biometric
  authentication using data encryption and more

2 antispam measures
  we have implemented an antispam filtering system because spam mail is not only bothersome
  but also includes malicious mail that may cause data leakage and virus infection

3 network connection device management
  to protect against unauthorized access and data leakage we prevent unregistered pcs and
  related devices from being connected to the network



organization

in yokogawa group information security activities have been developed based on the idea of
iso27001 and information security measures and policies are notified to the groups headquar
ters business headquarters and each group company by the general administrator of confidential

    kaneka corporation is set on both staying globally competitive and protecting the environment a
    stance that is consistent with its corporate philosophy this states with people and technology
    growing together into creative fusion we will break fresh ground for the future and tie in to explore
    new values we are also committed to challenge the environmental issues of our planet and contrib
    ute to upgrade the quality of life specific initiatives undertaken by kaneka corporation include the
    reduction of energy consumption complying with global environmental standards reducing indus
    trial waste and reducing risk through the development of various production technologies


    the background

    in the midst of a global economic downturn precipitated by events such as the bankruptcy of
    lehman brothers kaneka corporation is accelerating its efforts to reduce its operating costs as
    the companys takasago plant is a large consumer of energy it currently is engaged in an
    advance 17 initiative to slash its energy costs

    almost all the fuel and electricity consumed by the takasago plant is for its boiler steam turbine
    and generator btg facility with the rising price of crude oil kaneka corporation has urgently
    needed to implement countermeasures that would reduce this facilitys energy costs and in keep
    ing with its corporate philosophy the company is intent on reducing its co2 emissions a further
    aim of the company is the improvement of efficiency and reduction of labor costs




                                                                                                      26

the challenges

the btg facility has two boilers and four sets of steam turbines and generators and this equip
ment all varies in energy efficiency in addition the price of electricity fluctuates depending on the
season and the time of day the operation and maintenance of all this equipment has to be
balanced in such a way that cost is minimized and the steam and electricity requirements of the
takasago plant are fully met before this project the btg facilitys operators were kept busy
around the clock monitoring all process values in real time and manually adjusting to load
changes because the facility had a variety of operation patterns each of which required different
procedures for minimizing costs operators were required to have very high level skills and their
work was very stressful

the solutions

                                          the engineers at the takasago plant had reached the limit of
                                          what they could accomplish through hardware modifications
                                          pid control and sequence control strategy to improve energy
                                          efficiency at the btg facility after considering the use of an
                                          operational support package and a pims they turned to
                                          yokogawa for an advanced process control apc solution that
                                          could be fully integrated with their existing control strategy
toshihiko hayashi director
of the energy department
at the takasago plant             although the plants engineers fully understood the benefits that
                                  an apc solution could have in automating the btg facilitys
operations they were also well aware of their plants complexities and knew that they would need
an experienced partner that could help them apply this technology and derive its full benefits

they knew that with yokogawa which
has a long track record in implement
ing over 400 apc solutions worldwide
in a wide variety of process industries
they would have a tried tested and
proven partner




                                                           engineers from kaneka corporation s production
                                                                 technology and energy departments




                                                                                                             27

working closely with their counterparts at the takasago plant the yokogawa team assembled for
this project installed and integrated the exasmoc multivariable predictive controller and the exapi
lot operation efficiency improvement package with the monitoring control and operation func
tions of the plants centum cs 3000 dcs the exasmoc apc controller uses models to optimize
plant behavior by computing sequences of variable adjustments this has made it possible for
example to rapidly adjust set points when boilers and turbines are started up or shut down the
exapilot package enables the automation of operational sequences such as plant startup shut
down and product switchover by storing system procedures based on the expertise of experi
enced plant operators




                            combination of the centum dcs exapilot and exasmoc



the results

through the integration of the centum cs 3000 dcs with the exapilot operational support and
exasmoc apc solutions the btg facilitys operations could be fully automated significantly
reducing operator workload and achieving an 85 reduction in alarm situations the plant can
now be operated much more smoothly and flexibly operational efficiency is up energy costs
have been reduced 021 and co2 emissions are down 1000 tons annually the achieved
improvements are exactly on target

further improvements in energy efficiency are foreseen in the immediate future at the takasago
plant efforts to secure additional improvements at this plant are ongoing and range from the
improvement of stability at low loads optimization of control strategy based on alarm analysis and
the reduction of changeover times when the plant switches from daytime to nighttime operation

                                        pleted construction of a natural gas liquefaction plant at
                                        risavika in sola municipality that produces 300000 tons of lng
                                        per annum the plant receives natural gas from a field in the
                                        north sea via a 50 km high pressure pipeline from kårstø that
    skangass as stavanger norway
                                        was built by lyse

    this plant has all the facilities necessary for every phase of the natural gas liquefaction process
    including co2 removal systems a 30000 m³ storage tank a coil wound heat exchanger is used as
    main cryogenic heat exchanger a linde

    operations at this new plant yokogawa
    europe successfully installed an
    integrated plant process control system
    consisting of a centum vp distributed
                                                                   plant process overview

    simulator ots the plant has been running smoothly since becoming fully operational in 2010


    the challenges and the solutions

    1 ots for familiarization of liquefaction processes and operator training
    skangass needed to avoid any delays in getting this new plant fully operational and key to that
    was having all plant personnel fully trained right from the start of operations for the first time ever
    and in a team effort with skangass yokogawa configured a full stimulation type operator training
    simulator for a gas liquefaction plant employing the same safety and automation system sas as
    the actual plant with fully identical operational functions this high fidelity model of the natural gas
    liquefaction process behaves exactly like the actual plant and allows plant upsets and equipment
    malfunctions to be simulated in a stimulative training environment this makes it possible for
    operators at skangass to undergo repeat training for a full range of situations



                                                                                                         29

2 system integration optimizes total plant operation
key to maintaining safe operations is for the operators to
know in real time what is happening throughout the
plant this has been made possible through the com
plete integration by yokogawa of the plants centum
vp dcs fasttools scada system and prosafers
sis with other systems such as the tank gauging system
at their control stations operators can easily call up and
view trend chart plant overview alarm summary and
operation guide graphics giving them the right informa      one operator per shift in the central control room
tion at the right time on processes throughout the plant

for example operators can confirm on screen the status and operating sequence for the plants two
drier absorbers which alternate on a 24 hour schedule with one unit operating and the other regen
erating to guard against thermal shocks during startup or shutdown they also are able to monitor
temperatures in the coilwound heat exchanger whose operation is key to the natural gas liquefac
tion process and which has been carefully configured in the centum vp system in real time opera
tors can monitor at their terminals remote terminal data that has been transferred via a general packet
radio system link to the yokogawa fasttools scada system in the main office contributing to the
overall efficiency of the skangass facility and ensuring increased safety and stable production

with this integrated system a single operator per shift can control the entire plant from the central
control room

                              flow in the lines that supply coolant to the plants refrigeration facility
                              operators have come to depend on its high accuracy and stability for
                              determining whether sufficient coolant is being provided




customer satisfaction

    executive summary

                                         pt pln is a governmentowned company that manages the
                                         electric power industry in indonesia to ensure a stable power
                                         supply for north sulawesi province pt pln has built and
                                         currently operates four geothermal power plants in lahendong
                                         which is located 30 km south of manado the provincial capital
                                         the two newest plants lahendong iii and lahendong iv each
                                         produce 20 mw of electricity and the financing for their
    pt pln lahendong north sulawesi
    indonesia                            construction was provided by the japanese governments
                                         official development assistance oda program and the asia
                                         development bank adb respectively

    indonesias economy is growing at a remarkable rate and the countrys demand for electricity far
    outstrips supply despite holding 40 percent of the worlds geothermal reserves enough to
    produce about 30000 mw the country has done relatively little till now to make use of this
    resource however the indonesian government has signaled a strong intention to begin develop
    ing the countrys geothermal resources

    geothermal energy is a clean and renewable power source and plants of this type produce
    extremely little co2 which is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect for this reason efforts
    to make use of this resource are gaining momentum and its development is expected to bring
    great environmental and economic benefits

    at the lahendong iii geothermal power plant yokogawa installed the centum cs 3000 distrib
    uted control system dcs with redundant controllers a backup system and a test system based
    on the success of these installed systems yokogawa subsequently received an order to install its
    centum vp dcs at the lahendong iv geothermal power plant


    the challenges and the solutions

    automated plant and turbine startup and shutdown
    plant and turbine startup and shutdown procedures are very complex and timeconsuming and
    place great stress on both personnel and equipment to eliminate operator errors during these
    critical processes the centum dcs has automated plant and turbine startup and shutdown
    procedures the startup and shutdown sequences are executed in accordance with the logic
    design and the dcs human machine interface hmi clearly shows the status of the sequence and
    the facility conditions it also guides operators in the acknowledgement of messages and alarms


                                                                                                     31

and the triggering of interlock sequences operator intervention during the automated plant and
turbine startup and shutdown processes is minimized ensuring safe and smooth startup and shut
down this greatly reduces operator workload and errors shortens the startup and shutdown
times and mitigates thermal and physical stress on the turbine

backup system
geothermal power plants have less auxiliary equipment and their control loops are not as complex
as those at fossil fuel power plants in addition they cost less to operate it is therefore feasible and
desirable to run a geothermal power plant nonstop at full load when a plant is operated in this
way reliability is a key concern and even when the plants dcs has redundant controllers and is
extremely reliable there is still a risk that it might fail in a corrosive environment for this reason
yokogawa has provided a backup system this backup system includes the following features

    monitors by using a graphical user interface to ensure safety operation while the backup
    system is engaged
    handles effective alarms
    performs emergency operation in the event that the dcs fails

the backup system ensures that the plant can run safely without any interruptions

countermeasures for abnormalities of steam production and reinjection wells
if a sudden well head pressure change a water imbalance caused by insufficient reinjection or
some other abnormal condition occurs in a steam field the dcs will display alarms and all neces
sary other information in graphic windows at the operator stations if immediate actions are
required the dcs automatically takes countermeasures if necessary the turbine will automati
cally shut down without the operators intervention

because nature can be unpredictable it is not always
easy to anticipate changes in the production and reinjec
tion well conditions when unstable well conditions lead to
an emergency yokogawas controls are able to keep the
plant safe by automatically carrying out operator tasks
                                                                           graphic of turbine system

test system
when application software needs to be modified the revised software must be tested before it can
be downloaded to the controller requiring a plant shutdown to maximize plant uptime yokogawa
provided a test system that uses the test functions of the centum cs 3000 this test system accu
rately replicates the plant control and graphical interfaces and the software can be easily
checked under the same conditions as with the actual plant system it can be also used to train the
operators


customer satisfaction

the design and structure of the centum cs 3000 and centum vp systems for these new
geothermal power plants exceeded pt plns high expectations the use of the same hmi in both
systems allows for complete consistency in the monitoring and control of the power plants and

 lca label




   guidelines for environmentally friendly design
1 environmental assessment standards for product design
we have established assessment standards in eight areas ease of recycling and treatment resource
conservation energy conservation longterm usability ease of collection and transport safety and
environmental protectiveness information disclosure and packaging these standards are used in
conducting assessments during each inspection initial design intermediate design and final design

2 lifecycle assessment lca standards
the lca standards are used for preliminary assessments of energy use co2 emissions nox emis
sions sox emissions and the like throughout the lifecycle of a product these standards are used in
conducting assessments during each inspection initial design intermediary design and final design
3 environmentally friendly product design guidelines
these guidelines establish design and machining and assembly methods that incorporate longlife
design energy conservation design resource conservation design and materials and parts selection
guidelines as well as standards for the recycling and disposal of products
4 criteria for hazardous substances contained in products
the following criteria are provided to ensure that environmentally friendly parts and materials are
selected during the design phase controlled substances are classified into five different levels

  banned substance 1 any substance that is banned from inclusion in a product
  banned substance 2 any rohs command regulated substance
  controlled substance 1 any svhc substance of very high concern under the reach regulation
  controlled substance 2 any substance that is banned at certain concentrations bound by the
                          limited purposes of use or restricted in any way
  controlled substance 3 any substance for which the amount contained in a product must be identified


                                                                                                   52

5 recycled product design standards
these standards encourage the three rs the reduction of waste and the reuse and recycling of used
products

6 energysaving design guidelines
these guidelines state that energy is to be conserved in the manufacturing and product use stages
they introduce energy conservation design technologies for products and manufacturing

yokogawa began to conduct the life cycle assessment lca in 1999 in the design
phase of all new products as part of efforts to minimize our products environmental
impact some of the results of the lca are disclosed on our website when lca
data is disclosed for a product the applicable product is lcalabeled in the prod
uct webpage andor sales brochure 


      reference the  quot  environmentally friendly  quot label will be attached to our products
                     that meet yokogawas environmental assessment standards for product design and
                     that are designed with greater environmental consideration than our previous
                     products or those of competitors
                      environmentally friendly products


    requirements for lca labeling

    a product will be lcalabeled if it meets all the requirements described below
    1 life cycle assessment has been conducted according to yokogawas engineering specifications
    2 the results of life cycle assessment are disclosed on the yokogawa website according to the
       companys internal rules


    conceptimplementation of the lca

    yokogawa has set its unique lca standards based on jis q 14040 environmental management  life
    cycle assessment  principles and framework we compare a new product with its previous product for
    assessment purposes the results of the lca of the previous product are multiplied by the functional
    factor to compare the environmental impacts based on the equivalent functionality of the new product
    when the results of the lca on the previous products clearly suggest how these products would impact the
    environment we may only conduct lca on the elements significantly affecting the environmental impact

increasing work efficiency with improved cleaning processes
reduction in electricity consumption

yokogawa manufacturing kofu factory

a part manufacturing line includes several cleaning processes in which different chemicals
solvents pure water and other cleaning fluids are used to remove cutting oil and other greasy
materials from the products being manufactured

alkaline cleaning fluids were previously used in the cleaning processes but they could cause
foaming and required several rinsing and drying steps given the above only the essential func
tions were kept in order to improve cleaning quality increase production reduce equipment space
requirements and cut down on electricity use etc moreover new equipment has been introduced
that uses alkaline ionized water as a cleaning fluid in an effort to improve the cleaning processes

alkaline ionized water excels at minimizing the degradation of the cleaning fluid and in degreasing
while cleaning ultrasonic cleaning in a vacuum state with alkaline ionized water makes it possible
to eliminate the multiple cleaning processes that previously had to be repeated prior to finishing
this has resulted in improved cleaning quality and a shorter completion time thus simplifying the
cleaning processes and cutting down on energy use specifically electricity consumption is
reduced by 888 kwh annually yokogawa manufacturings kofu factory will further simplify its
multiple cleaning processes in an effort to increase efficiency

improving the way to keep contaminated air away from the control panel
effective use of clean room air conditioning to reduce electricity use

yokogawa manufacturing ome factory

the manufacture of printed boards includes surface treatment processes such as the etching line
on which hydrochloric acid is used

rust could form and spread if the metal parts of the control panels for various surface treatment
equipment are exposed to the air containing hydrochloric acid or other types of acid to stop the
air within the factory from entering the control panels and thereby prevent corrosion of the panels
a compressor or similar equipment must be used constantly to feed clean air to the control panels
and increase the pressure within them air must be supplied 24 hours to the control panels with a
compressor resulting in the consumption of a great amount of electricity


                                                                                                                          58

to address this issue yokogawa manufacturings ome factory has made improvements so that a
portion of the conditioned air being used for clean rooms air being discarded is fed directly into
the control panels this has eliminated the need to supply air with the use of a compressor thus
achieving an annual reduction of approximately 24 mwh in electricity use


                                        comment by a person in charge
                                        because the conditioned air used in clean rooms provides
                                        outstanding cleanliness we plan to use it for other types of equip

    reducing chemical use with the elimination of cleaning processes
    significant reduction in the use of hydrochloric acid and water

    yokogawa manufacturing kofu factory

    cut parts undergo several cleaning processes before moving on to the subsequent manufacturing
    process

    yokogawa manufacturings kofu factory was able to eliminate the cleaning processes that were
    previously required doing so by changing the type of cutting oil used at the cutting station which
    is followed by the cleaning processes and by introducing a highprecision highpressure steam
    cleaner the previous cleaning processes included alkaline cleaning for oil removal water rinsing
    and neutralization with hydrochloric acid chemicals such as alkaline degreaser and hydrochloric
    acid as well as pure water for rinsing were used in the above processes the elimination of these
    cleaning processes has produced a reduction in the annual use of alkaline degreaser hydrochlo

reducing hydrochloric acid use from 60 tons to 30 tons annually
with an improvement for the etchant control system

yokogawa manufacturing ome factory

the manufacture of printed boards includes surface treatment processes such as the etching line
on which hydrochloric acid is used

various surface treatment equipment units are controlled based on parameters in the control
panel chemicals and water are added into the equipment accordingly air is fed into the control
panel 24 hours in order to prevent corrosion however the temperature of the air differs between
summer and winter which could cause an error in the etchant density setting in the control panel
and allow more chemical hydrochloric acid to be added than needed to ensure proper control
of the air temperature an improvement was made so that the conditioned air from the room air
conditioner is fed into the control panel this has ensured that the air temperature remains consis
tent throughout the year which prevents errors in the etchant density and enables proper control
of the solution being added the above improvement has resulted in an annual reduction of hydro
chloric acid use by 50 from approximately 60 tons to 30 tons


replacing thinner with a toluenefree type reduction in toluene use

yokogawa manufacturing kofu factory

the amounts of toluene and xylene used throughout yokogawa manufacturings kofu factory
continue to decline annually thanks to a range of measures implemented during the respective
years approximately 15 tons of toluene was used during fiscal 2013 the factory uses about 53
types of coatings for application to its products and has so far replaced at least 30 types of coat
ings with those with low or no toluene or xylene

the kofu factory has recently worked to replace the thinner used for cleaning jigstools with a
toluenefree formulation a type of lubricant that is applied mainly to the threaded portions of prod
ucts adheres to the brush table and other jigstools the thinner formerly used to clean and
remove such lubricant contains 58 toluene thus accounting for a large part of toluene use by the
kofu factory by replacing the thinner with a toluenefree one the factory will be able to reduce
toluene use by about 1 ton from the annual toluene use of about 15 tons during fiscal 2013


                                      comment by a person in charge
                                      at the kofu factory we have worked to replace the coatings with

paint for products of large production volume

this time by changing to the toluene and xylenefree paint we reduced toluene of approximately 190kg
and xylene of approximately 12kg contained in the paint which were used more than 1 ton a year


                                      comment by a person in charge
                                      the reduction of toluene and xylene has been our long struggle
                                      including the switch to powder paint we are making effort on changes
                                      to the paint that does not contain toluene and xylene by products
                                      we have repeated technical assessment on drying and degree of
                                      adhesion so that we realized the change of paints we will
 eiji murayama and masaki nakamura    continue to expand the change to the low toluene and xylene paint

   water resource conservation
the yokogawa group is implementing resourcesavingenergysaving measures and initiatives
designed to effectively use our limited water resource specifically we are working to reduce the
amount of water usage by improving our production processes and by introducing watersaving
systems to our office water supplies


   reducing chemical use with the elimination of cleaning processes
   significant reduction in the use of hydrochloric acid and water

    yokogawa manufacturing kofu factory

    cut parts undergo several cleaning processes before moving on to the subsequent
    manufacturing process

    yokogawa manufacturings kofu factory was able to eliminate the cleaning processes that were
    previously required doing so by changing the type of cutting oil used at the cutting station which
    is followed by the cleaning processes and by introducing a highprecision highpressure steam
    cleaner the previous cleaning processes included alkaline cleaning for oil removal water rinsing
    and neutralization with hydrochloric acid chemicals such as alkaline degreaser and hydrochloric
    acid as well as pure water for rinsing were used in the above processes the elimination of these
    cleaning processes has produced a reduction in the annual use of alkaline degreaser
    hydrochloric acid and water by approximately eight tons three tons and 1000 tons respectively

   the past cleaning process

                                              that were previously required our initial goal was to reduce hydro

            yoshihiro koshimizu               ing processes has also made it possible to cut down on the amount
     kofu factory manufacturing dept 1       of pure water used in the collection vessel and rinsing bath
          yokogawa manufacturing              for other cleaning processes that follow subsequent manufactur
                                              ing processes efforts are underway to simplify or eliminate them
                                              the ongoing efforts to increase work efficiency are helping to

initiatives on conflict minerals

certain minerals tin tantalum tungsten and gold produced in the democratic republic of the
congo and nearby nations and distributed via supply chains might be used to fund armed forces
engaged in illicit activities involving humanrights violations acts of violence etc and conse
quently such materials are referred to as conflict minerals

we at the yokogawa group consider it a groupwide challenge to cut off such funding of armed
forces at every point and stage in our supply chain and thus we aim to become conflictfree by
not using conflict minerals in any of our products

to meet the aforementioned challenge the yokogawa group has carried out the following efforts

    dedicated structures were put in place in the relevant departments in 2011 through which we
    took appropriate action

    as a member of the responsible minerals trade working group run by the jeita japan
    electronics and information technology industries association we coordinate our efforts with
    those of other corporations and obtain the latest information

    as of 2013 we are cooperating with our suppliers to investigate the use of conflictive minerals
    in certain products additionally our procured gold and tantalum investigated in 2013 has
    been confirmed as conflictfree




                                                                                                75

the yokogawa group plans to implement the following initiatives as we move forward

    conduct individual investigations on the parts and processed components used in our prod
    ucts by reflecting the requests and other requirements of our customers

    if the findings of an investigation raise a concern about the investigated mineral as a possible
    funding source for armed forces we will take immediate action to stop using the mineral

in july 2013 we added our requirements on conflict minerals to the yokogawa group supply
chain csr guidelines and the guidelines are freely available and accessible to the public on our
website

the yokogawa group will continue to do its utmost to ensure the responsible procurement of
minerals

   yokogawa science classes help develop nextgeneration talent
yokogawa electric offers the yokogawa science classes for fifth and sixth graders as well as their
parents and families with the goal of helping develop nextgeneration talent who are interested in
science and technology our curriculum capitalizes on yokogawas technology and human resource
in the areas of measurement control and information and currently includes six programs which are
provided mainly within the facilities of yokogawas premises

    list of programs

        becoming a discerner of light lets make an illuminance meter
        communicating via light lets make an optical transceiver
        capturing radio waves lets make a germanium radio and catch radio waves
        forming a temperature investigation team lets make a radiation thermometer
        discovering the secrets of light lets make a rainbow flashlight
        measuring electricity with a magnet lets make a meter to check the battery



   becoming a discerner of light lets make an illuminance meter

    in our daily life we use a variety of light sources such as fluorescent lights leds not to mention the
    sun and flames in this program the participants will study the brightness of the light sources found
    around us and learn how the brightness can be compared

    the class instructor will be a yokogawa employee volunteer the instructor first presents explana
    tions by using yokogawa electrics weather instruments which work on the same principle as an
    illuminance meter sunshine recorder and solarimeter the employee volunteer then explains the
    principle of the illuminance meter and how the meter works and instructs the children individually
    to make their own illuminance meters with the use of solder

    once the illuminance meters are completed the participants will become discerners of light and
    measure the brightness of various light sources around them measuring the brightness of a lighting
    device will not only spark childrens interest in the brightness of light sources but will also give them
    an opportunity to learn that an understanding of brightness is useful for energy conservation


                                                  comments by children
                                                     before i could only sense the difference in bright
                                                     ness this device is useful for comparing brightness
                                                     ill go home and measure the brightness of my desk

communicating via light lets make an optical transceiver

this class unveils the mechanism of optical communication which has become well known
through the internet

a yokogawa employee volunteer first explains how the use of light makes it possible to send a large
amount of information accurately and quickly and then describes how the optical transceiver
works the optical transceiver allows for the transfer of light and sound which are the basic
elements in the transfer of information children will then make their own optical transceivers by
soldering lightemitting diodes phototransistors earphone and other components to a substrate
the children will run communication experiments with one another and will use an optical fiber to
confirm with their own eyes that light that doesnt usually bend can actually bend

subsequently using yokogawas digital oscilloscope the class participants will observe the optical
transceivers signal which is usually invisible and thus deepen the understanding of how the sound
is transmitted moreover the class introduces the participants to some engineering jobs by shar
ing stories about the struggles experienced in product development the instructor teaches how
important it is to be creative while thinking hard and carefully

                                                 i want to send not just sound but also images in the
                                                 experiment
                                                 the instructor was excellent at explaining things
                                                 and i really enjoyed the class




     communicating on trial each other



capturing radio waves lets make a germanium radio and catch radio waves

what are radio waves how can you listen to only one radio station out of so many different radio
waves being broadcast this class zeroes in on discovering the wonders of radio waves

a yokogawa employee volunteer first explains how radio waves work as well as their frequencies
then the children will make their own germanium radios that allow them to listen to an am radio
broadcast without the need for batteries all class participants go out to the ground located next to
the classroom and try the radios theyve made in order to see if they can really listen to a radio
broadcast on them when they actually hear a radio broadcast the excitement can be seen on the
faces of the children as well as their parents and families

subsequently using yokogawas digital oscilloscope the participants will observe the radio signals being
received which are usually invisible and thus deepen their understanding of how radio waves work

forming a temperature investigation team lets make a radiation thermometer

in daily life we often describe temperature by using sensory phrases such as it looks hot or it
looks cold you might burn yourself with hot water but needless to say we need to use a variety of
temperature settings when we cook or store food this class introduces the participants to tempera
ture while the temperature can be measured with a number of different methods a yokogawa
employee volunteer explains how the temperature can be measured without the thermometer even
touching the object to be measured

children attending the class will make their own radiation thermometers which enable contact
free temperature measurement the employee volunteer instructs the children individually to make
 their radiation thermometers by soldering to the substrate a semiconductor temperature sensor an
 indicator to provide a numerical indication of the temperature etc

once the radiation thermometers are completed the children will use their thermometers to mea
sure the temperature of hot water bottles of different temperature levels and find out which bottles
are hot and cold without touching the bottles

                                                 i could really measure the temperature without the
                                                 thermometer even touching the surface
                                                 ill go home and measure the temperature of things
                                                 in my house

discovering the secrets of light lets make a rainbow flashlight

what color is the sunlight why does a rainbow that appears after a rain shower have different
colors this class zeroes in on discovering the secrets of light

a yokogawa employee volunteer explains how rainbows work as well as the three primary colors of
light and then instructs the children individually to make their own rainbow flashlightswhich can
produce the three primary colors of lightby soldering the red blue and green lightemitting diodes to
the substrate the children will carry the flashlights theyve made and bring them into a dark room



                                                                                                     89

where they will see for themselves how the color of the light changes according to different combi
nations of the intensities of the respective lights being emitted by the diodes of three colors in the
light source the children will try and make specified colors

measuring electricity with a magnet lets make a meter to check the battery

why does a magnet stick to a metal surface based on the theme of measuring electricity with a
magnet this class zeroes in on discovering the wonders of the magnet

a yokogawa employee volunteer first explains how electricity works and describes the properties
of an electromagnet the children will then make their own meters that work with the force of an
electromagnet the class will run an experiment in which an electric current is allowed to flow
through the coil of an electromagnet to see that the number of staples sticking to the coil varies by
the level of electric current through this experiment the children will learn the relationship
between the electric current and the force the meter will be completed by soldering a switch
resistor and other components and clipping the coil to the substrate respectively the children will
connect their meters to new and old batteries and see for themselves how the needle moves
according to the voltage of the battery being measured

comments by parentsfamilies

the parents and families of the children who attended the classes made the following comments


  comments by parentsfamilies
     what was taught in the class was excellent i particularly liked the introduction to what they
     actually do on the job
     i liked how the class taught us to be creative by taking examples of what they actually do on the job
     we didnt just make a device we were also able to learn how the device works and hear
     firstperson accounts and that was very helpful for parents and families too
     its the kind of activity that takes advantage of this companys characteristics i hope theyll
     keep doing this
     the employee volunteer was meticulous and careful in teaching




participation in musashino science festa

each year yokogawa participates in the musashino science
festa an annual event held by the city of musashino its a
comprehensive event for scientific experimentation in which
elementary and junior high school teachers businesses
volunteer organizations etc in the city set up booths to
exhibit their experimentation there are approximately 1000
visitors to the event each year

the theme of yokogawas booth was lets see the sound
visitors to our booth observed what their voices looked like            observing childs own voice
                                                                             on the oscilloscope
using a handmade microphone amplifier and oscilloscope
the children seemed really interested as they watched the waveform change according to the
loudness of their voices and the frequency or pitch of the sound we recorded the musical scale of
each visitors voice for the range of an octave and printed it out so that the visitor could take it home
yokogawa staff who participated in the event as volunteer staff enjoyed themselves as they
instructed the visitors how to observe their voices using the oscilloscope




                                                                                                         91

    the tokyo metropolitan government regional npos and corporations aimed at conservingregenerating
    undeveloped woodlands and copses on the hills of tokyo and thereby contributing to biodiversity

    one of the areas covered by this initiative is the landscape conservation area in tatemachi
    hachioji city spanning 24392 square meters a familiar conservation area surrounded by houses
    on the tama hills in hachioji fireflies thrive along a clear stream that runs through this conserva
    tion area local volunteer groups regularly organize weeding and bushthinning operations in
    order to regenerate the natural environment

    the area used to be undeveloped woodland which was richly endowed with nature and well taken
