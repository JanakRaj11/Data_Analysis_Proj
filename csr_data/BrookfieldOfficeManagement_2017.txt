     with the help of the toronto parks and trees foundation tptf the team at hudsons bay centre in toronto transformed the lobby into a parklike setting bringing in live plants
     turf planters and park benches for a week the indoor park provided tenants with a spot to connect with nature and donate to assist tptf in improving parks and green spaces
     within the city of toronto

     in calgary both fifth avenue place and suncor energy centre hosted earth day fairs for tenants in their lobbies with displays by tenants suppliers and community organizations
