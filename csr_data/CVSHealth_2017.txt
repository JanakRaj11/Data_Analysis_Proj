accessible
and affordable
health care
the broader insurance coverage provided under the
affordable care act has not eliminated the challenges
many americans face in accessing affordable care
total health care spending has slowed since 2008 but
a greater proportion of costs have fallen to consumers
thanks to fastrising premiums and deductibles and
while most americans say they have a usual place to
go to for medical care that isnt an emergency room
a significant shortage of primary care physicians is
predicted over the coming decade

were committed to bringing accessible and affordable
care to as many people as we can its the right thing to
do  and for the largest pharmacy health care provider
in the us its also a strategy for longterm growth

our geographic reach and range of business areas
put us in a unique position to support patients payors
and providers in ways that facilitate more accessible
and affordable care

  office minuteclinic is addressing unmet needs and
  acts as an extension of primary care

 affordability we keep our prices close to cost
   most of our services are available for less than

   unnecessary use of highercost sites of care 
   such as emergency rooms  for routine care

tobaccofree lives

it has been more than two years since
we became the first national pharmacy
chain to remove tobacco products from
our retail shelves and we are still the only
national pharmacy chain to have taken
this bold step for a company devoted
to helping people on their path to better
health it was just the beginning

tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable
death and disease in the us responsible for
more than 480000 deaths each year our providers
offer counseling to hundreds of thousands of
smokers who wish to quit and we are investing
millions of philanthropic dollars each year in
communitybased smoking cessation and youth
tobacco prevention programming

investing in a tobaccofree generation
about 90 of smokers started smoking before they
reached college age virtually all the rest started by
age 26 thats why we believe it is vital to educate
youth so they never use tobacco products in the first
place while youth cigarette smoking has fallen to
historic lows use of smokeless tobacco among young
people has been holding steady meanwhile
a rising number of youths are smoking electronic
cigarettes which have uncertain health effects and
may serve as a gateway to tobacco products

in march of 2016 we announced be the first a
fiveyear 50 million initiative to help deliver the
nations first tobaccofree generation be the first
focuses on education advocacy tobacco control and
healthy behavior programming in partnership with
organizations positioned to address this challenge

of the tobaccofree generation campus initiative            informed community more open to policy acceptance

kathleen rohan director of saint xaviers university
health center is a former smoker so she understands
the impact of tobacco on health as well as the
challenges of quitting any exposure to secondhand
smoke is unsafe so eliminating all exposure gives
our campus community an immediate health benefit
rohan says a tobaccofree campus discourages
the initiation and use of tobacco products in young
adults and creates a supportive environment for
those wanting to quit it reduces litter improves fire
safety and creates a more welcoming environment
for prospective students

the saint xavier community spent three years
preparing to go tobaccofree a multistakeholder
committee tasked with evaluating the original student
proposal recommended going tobaccofree  not
merely smokefree  out of concern for the dangers
of all tobacco use the distinction between the two
means the campus also bans the use of ecigarettes
and other smokeless tobacco products

but the drive to adopt the policy stalled for some
time because the committee had not done enough
to educate the decision makers on the benefits

 veraschuberts son bobby was 15 when he was           though it might seem distressing for veraschubert           supported his efforts to get sober but his struggle 
 prescribed vicodin after a wisdom tooth extraction    to have to relive this experience over and over in front     and his familys  is still not over at one point bobby
the exposure was innocent but the life in store for   of strangers she feels the opposite doing these           told his mom that he wished hed seen her presentation

to other prescription drugs and eventually heroin      with drugs the stories are similar in all different kinds    awareness is a form of prevention veraschubert says
bobby was selling his possessions to buy drugs         of neighborhoods veraschubert says whether                ive been given such a great platform to help people

controlling our major sources of greenhouse gas emissions

cvs health is committed to addressing our climaterelated impacts through reductions
in greenhouse gas emissions as stated in our climate change policy statement
in 2016 we committed to developing a sciencebased emissions reduction target
a sciencebased target will align our ghg reductions with global emissions budgets
generated by climate models

we are working to determine how to define track and        our new buildings conform to the 2012 international
validate the target we are currently assessing our           energy conservation code which requires greater
scope 3 emissions under the greenhouse gas protocol          insulation and other efficiency measures that result
which comprise indirect emissions from sources we             in a 15 energy savings from previous code
do not own or control we will partner with our largest
suppliers to expand scope 3 data collection in 2017        decreased heating demand due to warmer weather
ahead of disclosing our target in 2018 currently our        in 2016
intensity goal and measurements include scope 1
and scope 2 emissions as well as scope 3 emissions         a 2016 update to the epas electricity emissions
from business travel and our dedicated thirdparty            factors accounting for the fact that energy produced
distribution fleet                                           to power the electrical grid is getting cleaner

meanwhile we continue to work to reduce our ghg           in 2016 we achieved a performance score of b from
emissions in 2016 we achieved a cumulative reduction     the cdp formerly carbon disclosure project which
in carbon intensity of 23 per square foot of retail       measures efforts to mitigate climate change we saw
space when measured against a 2010 baseline our           improvement in our score through disclosure of our
original goal established in 2010 was to reduce carbon   energy efficiency projects and commitment to setting
intensity by 15 per square foot of retail space          a sciencebased emission reduction target
we achieved that goal in 2015 three years ahead of
schedule we attribute this achievement to                 for more information on our ghg actions and policy

hours of electricity to operate our retail locations our     we are exploring additional led opportunities for our
electricity use in 2016 was 15 lower than in 2015           store exterior lighting we have also been retrofitting

use of natural gas in 2016 decreased by 8 in 2016
the most important factor behind the decrease                 energy management system
was likely the warmer weather the contiguous us            we continue to upgrade our energy management
experienced a 5 decrease in heating degree days              system ems which helps us drive energy efficiency
in 2016 a heating degree day is a measure of the             by controlling lighting hvac and other systems from
overall demand for buildinginterior heat                    a central location we retrofitted 276 additional stores

in 2016 we fasttracked the led interior lighting strategy   temperature or lighting controls designed to increase
that we launched in mid2015 aimed at reducing our            efficiency the ems allows us to standardize set points

since we began the interior lighting program in 2011         building heating and cooling are significant contributors
we have invested more than 115 million in our interior       to ghg emissions we have approved new energy

waste diversion and recycling

in 2016 we completed several projects that took advantage of our existing store systems
to improve our processes for minimizing and diverting waste we leverage store system
technology to manage waste more efficiently and we work with our suppliers to further
reduce waste streams throughout the supply chain

occasionally we have to remove unsold goods from our         quantify the issue share the information with suppliers
shelves that are slightly damaged out of season or         and give them an opportunity to modify their packaging
otherwise unsalable but still usable we work to divert      we can also share the data with our merchandising team
these goods from landfills or incineration to highervalue   to help guide its decisions around product selection
purposes such as liquidation or donation in 2016 the
value of our product donations was more than 55 million    we continue to work to reduce material use and increase
                                                             recycling opportunities throughout our operations

                                     we continue to evaluate ways to reduce water usage
                                     and have taken steps to monitor and reduce our

sunscreen protection
as awareness about skin cancer has grown so have
concerns that some sunscreen products are failing
to adequately protect users from the dangers of sun
exposure the us food and drug administration
fda reviews the active ingredients in sunscreens to
ensure they are generally recognized as safe and
effective in 2016 we decided to go beyond fda
requirements by joining the skin cancer foundation
the only international organization devoted solely to
education and treatment of skin cancer the skin
cancer foundation has started to certify cvs healths
store brand products to their higher standards and to
provide its seal of recommendation on our sunscreen
products were leading with heart by providing customers
this added layer of validation

labeling and transparency
consumers are demanding greater transparency
around the ingredients included in the products they
choose in 2016 we increased the rigor of our label
claim substantiation process to give consumers more
confidence in product label information

we completed additional due diligence on certifications
that appear on labels to ensure reliability we also
began a process of partnering with our suppliers to
validate the label claims on all of our store brand
products in every category  more than 4000 products
for example suppliers who make claims based on
studies must provide us with validation of the studies
methodology and results this is a more robust review
than required under industry standards

this label claim substantiation process is in addition to the
required registration and monitoring of product ingredients
through wercsmart our supply chain compliance tool
as well as our ongoing product testing regime

our palm oil policy
palm oil is a versatile raw material its one of the most
commonly used vegetable oils and it can be found in
cvs health brand and private label food products as
well as in a range of home and personal care products
sold in our stores were concerned about palm oil
production because it sometimes involves the clearing
of tropical forests which provide invaluable environmental
and social benefits

we announced our new palm oil policy in 2016
our goal is to ensure that by 2020 100 of the
palm oil we use in our products will come from
verified responsible sources delivered through fully
traceable supply chains

in 2016 we joined the roundtable on sustainable palm
oil rspo we have asked our suppliers to adhere to
the rspo principles  criteria on palm oil and palm oil
derivative sourcing the principles and criteria aim to
mitigate deforestation to avoid planting on carbonrich
peat lands to avoid planting on land acquired illegally
and to avoid planting on land that is customarily used
by others without the free prior and informed consent
of local communities palm oil plantations must be free
of human rights violations including forced and child
labor human trafficking and poor working conditions

we aim to ensure that by the end of 2020 all products
shipped to our distribution centers will adhere to these
guidelines we will report our progress annually to the
rspo and on our website

patterns they are given concrete information on the
effects of incidents including on the lives of affected
colleagues and they have been given safety toolkits

and train to serve on facilityfocused emergency
response teams erts the erts gained 100 new
members in 2016 bringing the total above 500

role of the incident commander who is responsible
for overall management of the emergency response
team in each facility facilities with erts receive free
trainings in areas including cpr first aid and
evacuation protocols

by the end of 2016 26 facilities had erts an additional
nine facilities are scheduled to host erts by the
end of 2017 in 2018 we plan to expand erts to our
omnicare facilities

our recorded incidence rate for our retail stores was
407 in 2016 an improvement from our 445 incidence
rate in 2015 our accident frequency rate in our
distribution centers was 528 also improved from the
2015 rate of 532 but slightly above the industry average
of 50 in 2016 we had zero highgravity citations

compliance policies and practices

our industry faces a large and ever
changing compliance landscape so were
always looking for ways to harness new
technology to help colleagues stay abreast
of regulations and address them fully

using technology to address compliance
for example in 2016 we revamped our quarterly
compliance training of all colleagues which primarily
occurs online to be better customized to the needs of
the colleague colleagues are tested on the information
they know or remember so the training focuses on new
information or knowledge gaps this approach makes
better use of colleagues time and facilitates retention
of the most important new information

also in 2016 we launched a regulatory tracking system
for environmental and safety compliance management
the tracking system helps us look for patterns and
trends identify areas of concern and benchmark
against peers it also helps us to identify and prioritize
projects for improving our compliance practices

we have launched a new environmental health and
safety documentation portal for use by our store
colleagues this online portal contains all
documentation our store colleagues need to comply
with our environmental and safety management
programs colleagues receive a daily feed that is
customized at the store level

we believe these investments will make compliance
information more accessible throughout the enterprise
and improve our compliance performance over time
