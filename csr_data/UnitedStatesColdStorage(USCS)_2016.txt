the 2015 environmental health and safety report covers the 2015 calendar year for the activities of
all facilities within united states cold storage the previous report was issued for the 2014 calendar
year in 2015 however uscs is also required to issue a monthly ehs update to swire that focuses
on many of the same topics this report focuses on the uscs workforce and their protection both
financially and on the job the impact that our operation has on the environment and how we are
planning to improve in the future this is the third iteration of this report to follow the gri level c
template for sustainability reporting the previous annual reports had been issued to swire without
such a template because of this there are portions of some metrics that are not fully reported on due
to limited data recording the infrastructure has been put into place to record all data that has been
omitted from this report in 2015 and to include this information in subsequent issues of this report

uscs warehouses require significant quantities of electricity water and refrigeration oil during their
normal operations this section summarizes the performance indicators that impact the environment
in which we do business the company continues to implement energy efficiency measures improve
warehouse design and optimize operational practices to minimize environmental impact the critical
performance indicators that were identified by uscs include

    energy consumption
    green house gas emissions
    water consumption
    sewage generation
    waste oil generation
    renewable energy generation solar

the performance indicators utilized were based on yearly statistics compiled from every uscs facility
a full breakdown of these statistics is provided in the appendix

energy consumption en3

in 2015 uscs consumed 272460078 kwh 980186 gj of power across all facilities an increase
over last years total of 243871808 kwh 877959 gj the average cubic storage capacity of the
company increased from 213185000 cubic feet 6036717 cubic meters to 239612000 cubic
feet 6785045 cubic meters in order to account for the changing amount of cold storage space
uscs internally uses power consumption per cubic food to measure the efficiency performance of the
company as a whole

environment continued

over the past 5 years uscs has taken several measures to reduce power consumption such as investing
in energysaving led lighting projects for warehouses bringing in third party energy specialists to
perform studies at select locations and investing in renewable energy resources such as solar panel
arrays as expected there is a downward trend in kwh per cubic foot for the company uscs goal is
to provide yearoveryear kwh per cubic foot reduction by 15 this goal was not realized in 2015
due to projects that increased power consumption at certain warehouses without significantly increasing
storage capacity the warehouse in lumberton nc added a new blast freezer addition and a rail dock
was added to the quakertown east facility both of these projects increased profitability as well as
energy consumption but did not add to the total cubic capacity

greenhouse gas emissions en16
over 99 of uscs greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 were generated from the purchase of electricity
while the remainder was generated from the usage of company owned vehicles

uscs has quantified the amount of carbon dioxide it either directly scope 1 activity or indirectly
scope 2 activity generates as a result of conducting normal business operations the methodology
for the calculation of these quantities for years 2014 and 2015 are represented in the appendix in
2015 uscs generated the equivalent of 275880539 lbs 124998 tonnes of carbon dioxide when
measured relative to storage capacity there is a slight increase over 2014 but still an overall downward
five year trend which can be attributed to increased energy efficiency companywide this is the result
of the following factors
        1 uscs continued investment in energy efficient technologies such as variable frequency
            drives and led freezer lighting
        2 continuous improvement philosophy applied to efficient warehouse design and
            operation
        3 energy audits at wilmington and minooka

renewable energy en6
in 2015 uscs built and commissioned a 268 mw ground based photovoltaic array adjacent to the
lumberton north carolina refrigerated warehouse facility this system was brought online in mid
november of 2015 and produced 186270 kwh through the balance of the year the lumberton solar
array is projected to generate 3595917 kwh of energy over its first twenty years of operation which
will offset approximately 250000 of power cost per year together with the roof mounted solar array
in tulare uscs generated 921078 kwh of renewable energy in 2015

the panels require cleaning multiple times per year since system commissioning 4541318 kwh
of renewable energy has been generated which is approximately 03 of uscss annual energy
requirement

saw a 16 drop in water usage per cubic foot uscss goal is to reliably measure both water and
sewer utilization and to reduce consumption on a yearly basis reducing water consumption can be
achieved by increasing the cycle of concentration on evaporative condensers as well as using rain
harvesting technologies the amount of wastewater disposed for uscs in 2015 was 93387238 gallons

uscs continues the practice of replacing mineralbased refrigeration oil with synthetic refrigeration
oil when new oil is to be purchased synthetic oil has proven to provide a longer cycle between oil
changes due to synthetic oils higher thermal viscosity chart 16 above represents recycled oil per
1000 cubic feet thus far recycled oil has been the only waste product monitored by uscs going
forward the company has made plans to record all other forms of waste from our facilities such as
used stretch wrap and damaged pallets it is our goal as a company to become zerolandfill with
