  responsible leadership
  tvo believes in voluntary corporate social responsibility that supports business operations and is based on tvos
  values targets and corporate social responsibility policy as well as legislation and stakeholder expectations

  the responsible leadership theme of the corporate social responsibility 2013 report includes a review by the
  ceo a description of the operating environment strategic objectives a description of good corporate governance
  risk management and the corporate management system as well as an account of companylevel policies and the
  companys code of conduct

  review by the ceo

  2013 was a busy year for tvo people the annual production output of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant reached a
  record high work progressed in the olkiluoto 3 site and the olkiluoto 4 project proceeded to an analysis of
  received tenders and negotiations with potential plant suppliers we also expanded our internal development project
  targeted at strategic management leadership competencies and the efficiency of operations

  a good production year
  we can now enjoy the fruits of the determined work done to improve the technology safety
  and lifecycle management of our nuclear power plant our success is proven by the fact that
  despite some unplanned outages we reached the highest annual output of our history at
  1463 twh of electricity and an excellent availability 951 a good history does not
  however guarantee future success the close monitoring of the condition of the plant units
  and their timely development are targets of continuous development

  work at the olkiluoto 3 construction site has progressed to an advanced state but there is
  still plenty of work to do our challenges are increased by the inability of the plant supplier to
  provide us with a reliable schedule for the completion of the project the plant unit will be
  technologically advanced and its safety features in particular will set an example to all
  industrial production we continue to do everything in our power and give our support to the
  supplier of the turnkey plant delivery to launch the production operation of ol3 as efficiently
  as possible with no further delay

  winds of change in the energy industry
  the position of nuclear power in the electricity market is challenging the market situation favors renewable energy sources
  that receive government subsidies as well as cheap fossil fuels such as coal
  the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc published new alarming research results on the progress of climate
  change the energy sector causes nearly 80 of all greenhouse gas emissions which means that decisions that have an
  impact on the field are very significant for the mitigation of climate change the lifecycle emissions of nuclear power are at
  the same low level as those of hydropower wind power or solar power the steady production of nuclear power is the only
  plausible path to a lowcarbon future
  nuclear power meets the conditions of sustainable development therefore it has an important role in finlands energy and
  climate strategy and clean energy program and capacity increases are justified nuclear power investments are large and
  their repayment periods long the planned service life of the new plant unit is 60 years it is important that no shortsighted
  political decisions are made that would disturb the stability and predictability of the operating environment or the efficiency of
  the markets

  responsibility the core of our operations consists of safe and economical production and nuclear waste management
  operations energizing leadership and competent personnel and transparent and proactive interaction and communications

  we listen to the worries of the general public through many channels and regularly measure the development of the
  acceptability of nuclear power and the stakeholder groups opinions of our operations according to an attitude energy
  survey carried out in 2013 56 of the respondents felt that finlands experiences of nuclear power are positive and a clear
  majority of people believe that nuclear power has an important role in reducing climate emissions and improving finlands
  competitive advantages

  competitive advantage through improved leadership and procedures
  the two central principles of our operations the uncompromising safety culture and continuous improvement apply not only
  to the technical reliability of the plant but also to leadership and the way in which our working community functions our
  internal development project progressed in 2013 and an increasing number of tvo people participated in strategic planning
  and the development of operations

  according to our revised mission launched in 2013 our objective is to produce safe economical and climatefriendly nuclear
  power to our shareholders through our shareholders finnish industrial companies and energy utilities we create wellbeing
  all over finland

  safety
  the safe operation of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is based on highquality power plant engineering the
  principle of continuous improvement highly capable and conscientious employees and independent external
  supervision tvos personnel are committed to a high standard of safety culture

  the safety theme of the corporate social responsibility 2013 report includes a description of tvos safety culture
  and its development a report on special events and an account of research and development operations

  safety culture

  safety at the core of operations
  the nuclear energy act requires that the use of nuclear energy must be safe it shall not
  cause injury to people or damage to the environment or property the safe operation of the
  olkiluoto nuclear power plant is based on safe power plant engineering highly capable and
  conscientious employees and independent external supervision safety is a factor shared
  by the entire nuclear power industry

  safety is a special area of focus for nuclear power plants because the uranium fuel
  becomes highly radioactive during the power production process and continues to
  generate heat even after being removed from the reactor spent nuclear fuel is cooled in
  waterfilled pools as water also acts as an efficient radiation shield the olkiluoto power
  plant has abundant water reserves to ensure the cooling of both the fuel in the reactor and
  the spent fuel the plant also has multiple power supply backup systems for cooling water

  various atmosphere surveys and selfevaluations are carried out at tvo to examine the state of the safety culture based
  on these the state of the tvo safety culture is good it must however be continuously monitored and developed in 2013
  tvo carried out a safety culture selfassessment including a review of documentation and a survey filled in by the entire
  personnel the assessment is repeated every three years tvos safety culture was found to be at a good level tvos
  strengths included the emphasis laid on the strategic importance of safety highlighting safety as a primary concern in both
  internal and external communications longterm planning and the continuous development of the plant units and attention to
  any minor deficiencies these ensure the good overall state of the plant to maintain a high standard of safety culture in
  accordance with the continuous improvement principle the selfassessment team has issued some recommendations mostly
  related to organizational learning and the development of operations

  uranium from bedrock to bedrock

  the safe use of uranium fuel is ensured at all stages of the power production chain from the responsible
  procurement of uranium to the safe final disposal of spent fuel

  the uranium from bedrock to bedrock theme of the corporate social responsibility 2013 report includes the
  following sections procurement of uranium production of electricity at olkiluoto 1 and olkiluoto 2 progress of the
  olkiluoto 3 and olkiluoto 4 projects nuclear waste management finnish state nuclear waste management fund
  and final disposal of spent nuclear fuel

  procurement of uranium

  from responsible partners only
  uranium is an element widely present in nature  approximately 40 times more common
  than silver nearly half of all uranium is produced using conventional mining techniques in
  underground mines and open pits while roughly the same quantity is produced by in situ
  leaching the rest approximately 7 is produced as a byproduct of other mining
  operations these operations cover approximately 85 of the uranium requirement of the
  worlds nuclear power plants the remaining 15 is obtained from various inventories and
  the reprocessing of spent fuel

  the largest producers of uranium based on the statistics of 2012 are kazakhstan
  canada australia niger and namibia together these countries are responsible for
  approximately three quarters of the worlds total production volume uranium is usually
  produced by large international companies with operations in several countries the eight
  largest companies cover approximately 85 of all production with ten mines producing
  more than half of all uranium                                                                                                          case

  valid in the country where the operations take place the requirements set for the
  operations are further specified by licenses concerning the construction operation and
  environmental practices of the facilities proper practices require that the original licensing process of a production facility
  also pays attention to decommissioning operations funds for waste management the closure of the mine and the ore
  enrichment plant and landscaping should be gathered during production operations

  certification of quality environmental and occupational health and safety management systems is widely applied large
  operators in particular have certified the management systems of their production facilities responsible companies follow
  the same standards and the principles of safety and social responsibility in all their locations which in turn promotes the
  development of legislation and procedures of new mining countries

  tvos supplier evaluation method
  tvo applies a diversified nuclear fuel procurement chain which means that separate contracts are concluded for the
  different stages of procurement usually with several suppliers for each stage procurement operations are based on long
  term contracts with leading suppliers

  tvo employs a supplier evaluation method and only procures uranium and nuclear fuel refining services from suppliers who
  have passed the evaluation process a systematic evaluation process precedes the closure of each supply contract in
  addition to the requirements set for the products the process also considers the reliability and responsibility of the supplier

  tvos supplier evaluation also includes active monitoring and evaluations at fixed intervals remote monitoring from finland
  and excursions to production sites both provide tvo with an opportunity to examine suppliers practices and when
  necessary to demand that changes are made to them the purpose of supplier evaluation is to ensure that suppliers pay
  appropriate attention to environmental issues the wellbeing of personnel and quality management special issues
  concerning mines are also considered such as the impact of operations on local people

  safety and energy efficiency
  over the decades the ol1 and ol2 plant units have been systematically developed the basic idea is to maintain the plant
  units as good as new latest technological solutions that improve the availability productivity and safety of the plant units
  are implemented continuously both plant units now have a rated net electrical output of 880 mw while the original output
  was 660 mw

  in addition to the production output the modernization has also improved the energy efficiency of the plant units which
  means benefits for the environment tvo is a party to the energy efficiency agreement and complies with the related energy
  production action plan that aims at the implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures as well as improving the
  efficiency of primary energy usage and the overall efficiency of energy production tvos energy efficiency objective based
  on the energy efficiency agreement is to save 340 gwh in 20082016 the efficiency plan will be valid until the end of the
  agreement period tvo already achieved its objective savings of 340 gwh of electricity by the end of 2011 the saved
  amount corresponds to the annual consumption of approximately 18000 houses with electrical heating systems

  annual outage with refueling and maintenance
  the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is constantly kept in an excellent condition by alternating refueling and maintenance
  outages the annual outages that take place every spring at olkiluoto usually begin with a refueling outage where part of the
  uranium fuel is replaced and the necessary repairs and maintenance operations are carried out together with any
  preparatory work for the following years maintenance outage the refueling outage usually takes about one week

  the annual maintenance operations then continue with the maintenance outage of the other plant unit where major
  maintenance and modification work is carried out in addition to refueling the maintenance outage usually takes two to three
  weeks extensive modernization and reconditioning operations have been carried out during the maintenance outages at
  approximately fiveyear intervals

  the 2013 annual outages of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant took place from may 12 to june 14 ol1 underwent an eight
  day refueling outage and ol2 a maintenance outage of approximately 18 days


  the main focus of the ol2 outage was on replacement of lowvoltage switchgear and work on the reactor two subsystems
  got new lowvoltage switchgear and transformers that meet the requirements of the latest regulations the relevant standards
  and future plant modifications replacement of switchgear is part of the systematic longterm development of the plant units
  other important work included the repair of a generator stator refueling containment testing and replacement of two main
  seawater pumps

  at ol1 refueling was followed by replacement of two main seawater pumps and annual maintenance testing and repair
  work

  2790 at the end of the year approximately 2000 people were working at the site an
  uncompromising safety culture is a basic requirement at the site and occupational safety
  indicators remained at a good level
  the construction of the plant unit has progressed to an advanced state in december 2013
  the plant supplier announced that it would focus its effort on the design tasks that are the
  most urgent and critical for the project at the same time the plant supplier told about its
  plans to reduce the number of subcontractors and workers at the ol3 site tvo has
  required that the plant supplier provide an updated overall schedule and an account of the
  measures to be carried out to ensure the appropriate progress of the project after the end
  of the period under review in february 2014 tvo announced that it has not received from

  nuclear waste management
  low and intermediate level waste also called operating waste accumulates during the
  operation and maintenance of the nuclear power plant some of the nuclear power plant
  structures become radioactive during the operation of the plant and need to be finally
  disposed of when the plant has been decommissioned nuclear power plants use uranium
  fuel which becomes high level radioactive waste during operation and requires final
  disposal at a repository before final disposal spent nuclear fuel is kept in the interim
  storage facility for spent nuclear fuel

  responsibility for nuclear waste management lies with the nuclear power companies that
  must carry out the necessary nuclear waste management measures for their own waste at
  their own cost according to the finnish nuclear energy act nuclear waste generated in
  finland must be treated stored and finally disposed of in finland and the import of nuclear
  waste into finland is prohibited

  tvo also takes care of the operating waste and the power plant decommissioning waste                                                   case

  interim storage for spent nuclear fuel was launched in fall 2010 and construction work has
  proceeded as planned the interim storage is expanded in accordance with tvos plans for
  the interim storage of spent fuel elements from both the existing ol1 and ol2 plant units and the ol3 plant unit currently
  under construction the plan is to officially commission the expansion in 2014 the extension doubles the available fuel pool
  capacity

  advance collection of waste management funds
  financial investments into final disposal are already being made the cost of final disposal is collected from the owners of
  tvo in the price of nuclear electricity

  in finland nuclear power companies bear the costs of nuclear waste management and the funds for that purpose are
  collected into the state nuclear waste management fund each year the ministry of employment and the economy
  determines the share of each nuclear power company in the state nuclear waste management fund as well as the waste
  management fee to be paid to the fund each nuclear power companys share of liabilities in the fund is decreased by the
  investments it has made in final disposal

  the annual fee payable to the fund is determined on the basis of the amount of disposable nuclear waste accumulated less
  the effect of actions taken for nuclear waste management the fee is also increased or decreased on the basis of how well
  the fund succeeds in its investments if the interest income is higher than expected the fee is correspondingly reduced the
  objective is to accumulate enough assets in the fund so that it allows for the final disposal of accumulated nuclear fuel to be
  carried out
