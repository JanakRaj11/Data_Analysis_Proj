                                                  in our opinion is that the companys offering of
                                                  products and services actually meets a social need
                                                  the company must fulfil its social role in society

key points in 2015
the net result in 2015 was 27 million negative versus 47 million
negative in 2014 the revenue of just under 20 billion was slightly
higher than in the previous year 2014 19 billion mainly due to
strong grows at property development and residential building and
the german operations the underlying operating result came to
5 million negative 2014 12 million negative with an improvement
in the second half of the year compared to the previous year 2015 6
million positive versus 2014 5 million negative writedown of real
estate and land holdings of 12 million significantly affected the net
result

the improvement in the underlying operating result was mainly due to
the positive developments at property development and residential
building netherlands collectively 10 million better than in 2014 and
infra germany improvement of 5 million operations in belgium had
a satisfactory year contributing 7 million to the underlying operating
result however as in the previous year the result was heavily affected
by the negative result of the infra operations in the netherlands a loss
of 26 million was reported here compared to a loss of 22 million in
2014 with both years heavily influenced by the processing of risks and
results from projects acquired in 20122013 the conditions in this
market which is relatively stable in terms of volume but features a high
level of competition are only gradually improving a positive factor is
that the regional infrastructure and asset management activities in
which road construction has a prominent share showed an improve
ment in the second half of the year

           the level of working capital fluctuates significantly
           during the year fluctuations may be projectspecific
           and related to payment schemes or may be due to
           discussions regarding the progress of a project the
           construction sector features a seasonal pattern impacted
           by higher levels of activity in the second and fourth
           quarters this is particularly visible in the infra and
           nonresidential segments moreover large integrated
           projects often involve contractual discussions on the
           part of both the customer and the contractor that are
           financially settled in the fourth quarter of the year
           working capital is usually at its lowest level at the end
           of the year higher requirements for working capital
           during the year lead to a higher capital requirement
           which heijmans meets by using a revolving credit

residential property development and residential
building
last year saw a strong recovery in the market this trend was national
with the greatest development in the four large cities where pressure in
the market and demand increased sharply contrary to the market in
the precrisis period there is greater than ever demand for influence on
product development and customers continue to be critical with respect
to quality in relation to price the composition of products is also
changing partly due to demographic developments such as the ageing
population and individualisation in addition apart from the increasing
demand for housing there is pressure with respect to affordability
especially for young people looking to buy a home rental therefore
continues to be attractive investors have been offering more affordable
rented accommodation in recent years to cater for this demand
especially since the housing associations focused more on their core
activity in 2015 and the management of their core portfolio for them
making their stock more sustainable is a more topical theme than
newbuild for heijmans this has led firstly to the development and
realisation of investment rented accommodation also in the lowercost
segment and secondly an increase in renovation management and
maintenance to make the existing portfolio more sustainable heijmans
continues to focus on the private owneroccupier market consisting of
apartments and groundlevel dwellings

            i  may be only 25 years old but im not afraid
             to remind colleagues and subcontractors about
             safety sometimes there are people who have a
             problem with this they see me as just a youngster
             and they dont care about the rules you have to
             ignore this and show that everyone has to keep
             to the rules old or young it makes no difference
             to me we should all work together to keep our
             construction site safe

safety

sustainable employability focuses on optimising the health involve
ment and development of employees the aim of sustainable employa
bility is that work should be more fulfilling that there should be less
absenteeism and higher productivity at the same time economic and
technological developments require organisations to be versatile this
requires people and organisations to be fit both literally and figurative
ly to cope with the changes they are asked to make in past years the
human resource policy has focused mainly on market developments
and the need for downsizing the organisation the organisation had to
become more flexible in order to adapt to changes in the market the
market changed again last year especially within the residential
segment and there is once again potential for cautious growth in
combination with the rapid ageing of the population especially at
construction sites flexibility is more important than ever in our hr
policy

heijmans achieves sustainable employability by targeting safe working
conditions continuous availability the right people in the right place
increased flexibility and the development of its employees

safety
the construction sector features constantly changing circumstances
and a high degree of complexity builders work with partners suppliers
and subcontractors under high pressure in terms of both time and cost
construction is labourintensive and not without danger the number
of accidents is slowly declining but in comparison with other sectors
the construction industry has high scores for absenteeism and
accidents leading to hospitalisation health and safety therefore
directly affects the construction industry not only as regards cost but
also the attractiveness of the sector moreover this aspect directly
affects reputation

             work together seamlessly is making a mistake
             this can create a false sense of safety there is

knowledge
intensity

the essence of the work is becoming increasingly complex and
knowledgeintensive extensive knowledge is needed to be able to meet
the desires and requirements of customers and end users usually
within a short time period in a competitive market and subject to strict
regulation unlike the situation in the past construction is increasingly
less about simply having operational capacity today and in the future
it is much more about relieving concerns meeting performance
agreements and identifying and realising new possibilities that
increase quality efficiency and convenience in the long term this
means that the profile of a heijmans employee is changing since this
development places direct requirements on an employees ability and
intelligence

heijmans positions itself as a learning organisation and therefore
encourages learning both collectively and individually in various
ways

learning
the right knowledge and skills are needed to deliver good performance
by linking strategic objectives to personal ambitions and talents of our
employees learning can make a big contribution to quality based on
the fact that learning is a responsibility of the individual employee
heijmans facilitates the learning process heijmans bases this on
learning on the job and gaining experience but learning is also
supplemented by coaching feedback and targeted courses and training
the first element learning by gaining practical experience is the
biggest investment

the training level is classified in four categories that

development of expertise
the bundling of product groups into 10 clusters
has created an expertise centre which also provides for
account management and contract management with
respect to contractors this enables development
combination and safeguarding of knowledge in crucial
areas and therefore creates extra added value for the
organisation the setting up of account management for
suppliers also provides a single contact point within the
heijmans organisation where the right expertise is
located and relationship management can be used to
bring about further sustainable cooperation with
preferred parties across multiple projects

encouraging sustainability safety and
innovation
via procurement a significant contribution is made to
the realisation of our ambitions with respect to safety
sustainability and innovation the following actions
were also taken in 2015 to further improve awareness of
safety and the actual level of safety
 suppliers and subcontractors have been assessed on
   their safety performance with effect from 2015
   warnings and sanctions are registered by the quality
    safety department and discussed at procurement
   meetings
 all subcontractors and suppliers are informed about
   the go safety programme they are also involved
   and reached via the regular site meetings the
   heijmans policy and the associated rules are an
   integral part of the contractual agreements with all
   subcontractors and suppliers
 the top 50 suppliers and subcontractors were invited
   to attend a stakeholder event in march 2015 this
   meeting also featured extensive attention to the go
   programme and the go app was introduced further
   details of the go app are provided in the section

             approach to this type of largescale road
             construction projects see it as an area
             development rather than simply an accessibility

heijmans is building the contours of tomorrow and is working on a
portfolio of thousands of projects the way in which heijmans initiates
and realises these projects can make the difference in using scarce
resources and raw materials such as energy timber water and so on
heijmans strives to reduce this burden through real reductions in its
co2 emissions the volume of residual material separating waste and
reusing waste after removal the ultimate goal by 2020 is not to
withdraw but to contribute materials energy space and therefore also
value

examples and progress in 2015

innovative materials
last year showed that the circular economy is becoming increasingly
significant for making processes and business operation sustainable
this is not yet actually reflected in legislation and regulation in
addition it emerged that after years of focus on energy pressure from
developments such as 3d printing and usage of alternative materials
has led to an even greater emphasis on innovative materials and
sustainability lighter andor reused materials are leading to signifi
cant changes to design and realisation contracts in the construction
industry for instance the use of composite as a building material for
bridges or lock gates this weighs much less and therefore in the case
of the composite bridge over the a27 is much faster to install and
therefore causes less disruption to road traffic

     dilemmas

     culture and structure
     heijmans attaches a high value to ethical conduct by its employees
     openness is a basic requirement for this a more open working attitude
     is encouraged by the example set by the management and directors
     the discussion of large and complex works in the weekly executive
     board meeting and the review meetings with management  in addition
     to this culture heijmans has introduced a structure for the reporting of
     issues relating to conduct and integrity such reports are then investi
     gated if necessary and action can be taken

     compliance officer
     heijmans has appointed a compliance officer who acts as the central
     contact and reporting point for integrity issues the anonymity of
     reports is ensured and the compliance officer considers the action
     necessary in each case given the nature of the issue and the applicable
     rules in many cases issues are resolved on the shop floor for instance
     in consultation between the employee and their supervisor however
     this is not always the case

     integrity committee
     the integrity committee is responsible for advising the company with
     respect to integrity the integrity committee discusses issues dilem
     mas and themes relating to integrity and all matters associated
     therewith twice a year and makes recommendations on this basis for
     policy or the initiation of training for example the executive board
     establishes the policy and decides which actions are to be taken in this
     context the committee is chaired by the ceo other members of the
     committee are the compliance officer the director of procurement and
     the chair of the cwc

risk
management

doing business in the construction and property sector involves risk in
principle there can be no competitive advantage without taking risk and
therefore no return the operating margins in the industry and at
heijmans are currently low and below the strategic levels that
heijmans aims for and are required to operate profitably this further
underlines the importance of risk management it is therefore an
essential duty of the management to make wellconsidered decisions
with respect to the risks the company wishes to incur and how these
risks are managed

the markets in which heijmans operates have contracted sharply in
recent years competition is intense and pressure on margins has
increased in addition new types of contract have been introduced that
led to a shift of responsibilities to contractors such as heijmans
at the same time this development offers strategic opportunities for
adding value heijmans aims to achieve this on the basis of its knowl
edge expertise and innovative strengths by leading the way in the
offering of integrated sustainable and socially relevant solutions to
customers and users for heijmans the only way to maintain a
sustainable position in this market is to add value
risk management was a highpriority item on the business agenda
during the reporting year this section describes the risk profile the
main risk factors and the way in which these are managed it also
describes the main activities and results in 2015 with respect to risk
management and lists the priorities for 2016 the risk section also

the item other mainly refers to the cashgenerating unit infra netherlands 16 million

the remaining amortisation term for the intangible asset that was part of the burgers ergon acquisition is 11 years

the remaining intangible assets of the other acquisitions relate mainly to concessions for sand quarries

goodwill is tested annually for impairment based on the relevant cashgenerating unit for an explanation of the
calculation of the realisable value reference is made to the accounting policies

the impairment tests are based on the value in use calculated by means of the discounted cash flow method the pretax
wacc weighted average cost of capital used for this calculation ranged from 10 to 11 2014 from 11 to 12
corresponding to a discount rate after tax of 86 2014 91

the value in use of the cashflow generating business units is based on their expected future cash flows the period
adopted to determine the present value of cash flows is indefinite in the determination of future cash flows the medium
to longterm planning for the relevant cashflow generating unit is used the assumptions underlying the medium to
longterm planning are partly based on historical experience and external information sources the medium to long
term planning generally covers a period of 5 years cash flows after 5 years are extrapolated using growth rates not
exceeding 2 2014 2

the realisable value calculated for the impairment test depends on the growth rate used and the period over which the
cash flows are realised

the amortisation of the other intangible assets is recognised in the statement of profit or loss under other operating
expenses

      the expected cash flows are discounted using a pretax wacc varying between 10 and 11 if the pretax wacc had
      been 1 point higher this would not have resulted in an impairment cash flows after 5 years are extrapolated using
      growth rates not exceeding 2 if this maximum were 1point lower this would not result in an impairment

      the cashflow generating unit nonresidential  to which the goodwill and other intangible assets of burgers ergon and
      the majority of the goodwill for ibc is allocated in total 62 million  is sensitive to changes in the assumptions
      whereby the realisable value could become lower than the carrying amount according to the impairment test the
      realisable value of the cashflow generating unit nonresidential is currently some 120 million higher than the
      carrying amount one significant factor in this context is the change in the ebit margin for the test the ebit margin was
      assumed to grow to 4 of revenue in future years if the ebit margin were nil the realisable value would be equal to the
      carrying amount the change in the funding status of projects is another important factor

      the realisable value of the cashflow generating unit oevermann is now approximately 45 million higher than its
      carrying amount the realisable value is sensitive to changes in the assumptions so that it could be lower than the
      carrying amount one significant factor in this context is the change in the ebit margin for the test the ebit margin was
      estimated to grow to approximately 2 to 3 of revenue another major factor is the expected settlement of debtor
      positions

measurement of deferred tax assets
as at yearend 2015 the loss carryforward is 408 million of which 352 million relates to the loss carryforward of
the dutch fiscal unity this loss carryforward has been set off against the fiscal unitys deferred tax liabilities breaking
this loss down shows that 123 million relates to 2012 170 million to 2014 and 59 million to 2015 in order to
prevent underutilisation of 2009 losses available for setoff amounting to  91 million and to improve the tax position
of the heijmans nv fiscal unity a change in the accounting policy was made in 2015 when preparing the 2013 corporate
income tax return with regard to the valuation of the strategic land holdings the value for tax purposes of these land
holdings has thereby been aligned to the ifrs valuation for the 2013 tax return this has resulted in a oneoff 305
million tax benefit the resulting positive taxable amount has been used to offset all of the 2009 and 2011 taxdeductible
losses and part of the 2012 taxdecuctible losses this has led to application of the loss of 4 million written down in
2014 in relation to the year 2009

the losses of the dutch fiscal unity are subject to a loss carryforward period of 9 years a deferred tax asset is recognised
to the extent that it is probable based on forecasts that sufficient future taxable profits will be available that can be
utilised towards realising the deferred asset the forecasts are based on the order book the 2016 business plan and the
longterm forecast these also underlie the measurement of the realisable value of goodwill for impairment tests for
the longterm forecast the average ebit margin of the dutch fiscal unity is assumed to grow to approximately 3 of
revenue the forecasts of the results before tax up to and including 2021 show that there will be sufficient profits
available to set off any tax losses the remaining settlement term of 9 years is generally longer than the period currently
used until 2020 a factor inherent in the measurement of the deferred tax assets is that the utilization of losses depends
on the realisation of the 2016 business plan and the longterm forecasts which are the groups best estimates

the remaining loss carryforward amounts to 56 million and relates to a number of belgian operating companies
15million to oevermann 21 million and to franki 20 million in principle losses in belgium and germany can
be set off against future profits for an indefinite period subject in germany to a maximum for the annual profit being
used for setoff taxable profit of up to 1 million in any year can be used in full for set off of taxable profit exceeding 1
million only 60 can be used for set off

measurement of deferred tax liabilities
for determining the amount of the deferred tax liabilities the value for tax purposes of the construction work in progress
in the netherlands including residential building projects is largely treated as being equal to the value under ifrs

deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised for any temporary differences originating at subsidiaries joint operations
or joint ventures no deferred tax assets or liabilities have been recognised for temporary differences arising from

      strategic land portfolio
      the strategic land portfolio comprises land holdings that are measured at cost or net realisable value if lower net
      realisable value of an individual land position can be the direct or indirect recoverable value the net realisable value
      depends on the expected manner and timing of realisation accordingly the value is generally derived by using an
      indirect method for determining the recoverable value the indirect recoverable value is the estimated revenue in the
      normal course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling to calculate the present value of the
      expected cash flows a discount rate of 6 is often used unless thanks to favourable financing terms a different percen
      tage has been set for a joint arrangement setting the discount rate takes into account the expected capital structure
      operating risks and circumstances relating to heijmans or specifically to the project

      determining the indirect recoverable value involves the use of judgements and estimates the strategic land portfolio is
      affected by several elements of uncertainty such as demographic changes location and details and implementation of
      development plans and administrative decisions with as local a focus as possible for each location the outcome is an
      expected trend for land and residential property prices as well as other variables that ultimately determine the indirect
      recoverable value twice a year the group carries out its own assessment of the values of all the land holdings

      in general the risk of deviations from the judgments and estimates is greater for strategic land holdings without a site
      allocation plan than for those with one moreover this risk keeps increasing the longer the expected delay is for the start
      of the development work the net realisable value of the strategic land portfolio was calculated in 2015 and compared
      with the carrying amount this led to a writedown of 112 million and a writedown of 04 million concerning a joint
      venture 2014 writedowns totalling  165 million and a reversal of an earlier writedown of 28 million concerning a
      joint venture the decreases in value are partly due to specific local conditions that have adversely affected the success
      of projects time to completion expected margins and the number of completed residential properties

      the value of work in progress is periodically assessed for each project by the project manager and the manager of the
      unit concerned the assessment is mainly based on the information in the project files the project accounting records
      and the knowledge and experience of the persons involved estimates are an inherent feature of this process and of the
      project activities valuations as is the fact that the group is involved in negotiations and discussions on the financial
      settlement of projects such as extra work or reduced work claims arbitration and penalties delivery times and the
      quality of the work it may turn out at a later stage that actual results differ from the estimates this will be so particu
      larly for longterm projects that include considerable customisation it can also occur if there are unsettled claims or
      discussions with clients about additional work that are still continuing on the closing date with respect to one of its
      infrastructure projects heijmans has a difference of opinion with the client regarding payment for potential additional
      works heijmans is of the opinion that additional works fall outside the scope of the contractual agreement however the
      client is of the opinion that these works are covered by the original contract amount and are for the account and risk of
      heijmans at the time of preparation of the financial statements the parties were in consultation the costs of these
      potential additional works which have not as yet commenced are estimated at several tens of millions of euros and have
      not been recognised the executive board is of the opinion that it is under no obligation to perform these additional
      works and has concluded that it is unlikely that these costs will be for the account of heijmans and if the additional
      works have to be performed that heijmans will be entitled to an additional payment

      the uncertainty surrounding the abovementioned estimates increases for example
       contract types involving special arrangements mean more risks for the group such is the case with a dc contract
         under which the group accepts the design risk dbmo contracts also include responsibility for maintenance and
         operation
       projects are in the design stage when producing a final design from a provisional one significant changes may be
         necessary which can require a positive or negative adjustment to the initial forecast
      projects are also fraught with opportunities and risks during execution examples include additional work claims and unfore
      seen circumstances that could be for the account of the group

revenues from additional work are included in the overall contract revenues if the client has accepted the sum involved in
any way claims and incentives are recognised under work in progress insofar as it is probable that these will generate
revenue and can be reliably determined when determining the amount to be recognised specific contractual arrange
ments and the legislation of the country where a project is being carried out are taken into account

for claims and penalties imposed by contractors against heijmans because of construction overruns for example these
are recognised if it is likely that they will have an adverse effect

bonuses are recognised as revenues from work in progress if the project is far enough advanced and it is probable that the
performance indicators specified will be met and the bonus amount can be reliably determined if the bonus can only be
received after expiry of a predetermined period following completion of the project then that bonus is only recognised
when it is sufficiently probable that the bonus will be received

the positive balance of work in progress represents all the projects in progress for third parties where the incurred costs
plus the capitalised profit less the recognised losses are greater than the progress billings

the negative balance of work in progress represents all the projects in progress for third parties where the incurred costs
plus the capitalised profit less the recognised losses are smaller than the progress billings

      syndicated bank financing		
      of the committed and syndicated bank facility 231 million runs until 31 march 2016 and 212 million until 31 march
      2017 this facility is provided by a bank consortium comprising rabobank ing bank abn amro bank kbc van
      lanschot bankiers and deutsche bank collateral has been provided for the facility the credit margin on this facility
      ranges from 15 to 20 depending on the leverage ratio 50 million of this facility was used at yearend 2015 the
      financial covenants agreed are a recourse leverage ratio not exceeding 3 and an interest coverage ratio of at least 3
      both to be tested every six months in principle if the conditions are not complied with drawings under the facility are
      repayable immediately on demand the executive board actively monitors compliance with the conditions

      agreement was reached with the bank consortium comprising rabobank ing bank abn amro bank and kbc on
      24 february 2016 to extend the facility until 30 june 2018 as of 1 april 2016 the committed facility will be 256
      million in which a previously uncommitted overdraft facility will be included the agreement stipulates that from 31
      march 2016 the aforementioned interest coverage ratio will be tested quarterly and must be at least 4 formerly 3 as
      from yearend 2016 in addition commencing mid2017 the company will have to test for an average leverage ratio of
      25 additional collateral has also been provided this extension and the amended conditions are in line with heijmans
      plans for this financing period to structurally improve the ratio of net debt to ebitda

      the leverage ratio is calculated as the net debt divided by ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and
      amortisation the interest coverage ratio is calculated as the ebitda divided by the net interest expense the definitions
      of these items include several adjustments in the reported figures as agreed upon with the bank consortium in the
      credit agreement the key adjustments in relation to the accounting definition of net debt are increase by net debt from
      joint ventures and reduction by the amount of outstanding cumulative financing b preference shares and the financing
      of certain projects that are negotiated without any recourse towards heijmans nonrecourse the main adjustments
      with respect to the ebitda in accounting terms concern the capitalised interest results on the sale of business units fair
      value adjustments reorganisation costs and operating results of joint ventures the main adjustments with respect to
      the net interest expense in accounting terms are removing the interest expenses from nonrecourse project financing and
      cumulative financing b preference shares these ratios were complied with during the reporting year as the recourse
      net debt was negative at yearend 2015 the recourse leverage ratio is not relevant interest coverage ratio at yearend
      2015 was 60 given the business plan for 2016 the group expects it can continue operating during the next financial
      year within the framework of the covenants the development of ebitda and the net debt are the relevant parameters in
      this respect the development of net debt is subject to seasonal effects and fluctuations due to specific projects which is
      mainly relevant for the the covenants in midyear when the capital requirement is higher

      pension rights under this plan this concerns employees who have been with the company since before 1 january 2012 and
      were accruing supplementary pension rights with pensioenfonds heijmans the plan is an average pay scheme with
      conditional indexation and qualifies as a defined contribution plan no new members will be admitted to the pensioenfonds
      heijmans plan the pension accrual of these employees who became members of the supplementary plan before the end of
      2012 remains guaranteed by stichting pensioenfonds heijmans nv while employees stay with heijmans the pensions they
      accrued until the end of 2012 are conditionally indexed heijmans pays a contribution each year to cover the costs of this
      approximately 29 of the members in the new plan were members of the former plan who are still employed by heijmans
      and accordingly have a conditional right to indexation depending on the salary increase in accordance with the collective
      employment agreement for the construction industry for a maximum of 4 per year for the rest 50 are former employees
      and 21 are pensioners the average term of the pension liabilities is approximately 17 years because of the funding deficit in

      is under no obligation to make a subsequent contribution the pension contributions and required buffers are calculated in
      accordance with the rules stated in the pensions act in accordance with these rules the contributions are cost effective and the
      funding ratio set by the pension fund policy needs to be at least 104 at yearend 2015 2014 104 the coverage ratio as at
      31 december 2015 is 1035 it is expected that equity will be at the required level within the prescribed term and that no
      further measures will be necessary supervision of compliance is a responsibility of de nederlandsche bank dnb the
      netherlands central bank the board of the fund comprises representatives of the employer employees and pensioners

reasonably possible changes as of the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions with the other
assumptions remaining unchanged can affect the liabilities associated with the defined benefit plans as shown below

the above effects were determined by the actuary who performed the calculations the combined effect of changes to
more than one of the assumptions can be different from the sum of the corresponding individual effects owing to
interactions

the effects presented apply only to the liabilities and not to the fair value of the investments for a plan in the form of
an insurance contract the effect of a change in the discount rate is largely mitigated by an equal but opposite effect on
the plan investments this is because of the guarantee provided by the insurer

heijmans expects to contribute approximately 3 million in 2016 to the defined pension plans and approximately 30
million to the defined contribution plans the expected contributions in subsequent years are likely to be in line with
those expected for 2016 depending as well on changes in the abovementioned actuarial assumptions

      623       financial risks and management

      general					
      in the normal course of business heijmans is exposed to various financial risks including credit liquidity market price
      and interestrate risks				

      this section describes the degree to which these risks manifest themselves the objectives set regarding the risks and the
      policy and procedures for measuring and managing them as well as the management of capital			
      		
      the risk policy is focused on the identification and analysis of the risks to which the group is exposed and the setting of
      acceptable limits					

      the risk policy and systems are assessed on a regular basis and then modified if necessary for changes in market
      conditions and the operations of the group the objective is to create a disciplined and constructive approach to risk
      management with the aid of training standards and procedures whereby all employees are aware of their roles and
      responsibilities					

      the audit committee periodically reviews the risk management policy and procedures in addition the committee
      reviews the risk policy used in the light of the risks to which the group is exposed					
      					
      credit risk					
      credit risk is the risk that the group will be exposed to financial loss if a party against which heijmans has a claim fails
      to meet its contractual obligations credit risks arise primarily from receivables due from customers and consortium
      partners

      the credit risk associated with property development is limited as future residents can only take possession of the new
      property once they have met all their obligations the creditworthiness is assessed in transactions involving the
      development of commercial property building assignments and infrastructure projects with additional collateral
      possibly being requested heijmans carries out many assignments for public authorities for which the credit risk is
      considered extremely limited

      the assessment of creditworthiness is part of the standard procedure credit risk is mitigated by prefinancing arrange
      ments and payments in instalments risks are insured with a credit insurer if considered necessary

      the large number of clients a substantial part of which are private individuals and public authorities means there is no
      concentration of credit risk

      the cash and cash equivalents are held at different banks that are assessed as regards creditworthiness and as a result
      credit risk is limited

      a provision for doubtful receivables is recognised following an assessment of the potential risks for each individual
      receivable doubtful receivables are subjected to an impairment test and written down as necessary to the present value
      of the future cash flows if lower

      price risk							
      price risk associated with the purchase of raw materials and auxiliary materials as well as with outsourced work is
      mitigated by making price indexation agreements with clients or where possible by making price agreements with
      suppliers at an early stage if necessary derivatives may be used occasionally to hedge the price risk of procuring raw
      materials

      interestrate risk							
      the interest rate policy at heijmans is directed towards limiting the impact of changes in interest rates on the results of
      the group in addition some of the loans have been concluded at fixed interest rates
      					
      if the interest rate for 2015 had been 2points higher on average then the result before tax based on the positions of the
      statement of financial position at yearend would have been approx 21 million higher 2014 12 million higher the
      effect of a 2points difference in interest rates on the groups equity assuming all other variables remained constant
      would have been an increase of 16 million 2014 an increase of 09 million this effect on the result before tax was
      mainly due to the cash balance at yearend 2015 the interest rate exposure measured on the basis of the average debt
      during the year would have a more limited effect on the result

2014 23 at a floating rate due to seasonal effects the average debt during the year is higher than the debt at the
closing date the portion of the gross debt subject to a floating interest rate is also higher during the year the gross
floating rate interest debt is offset by items such as cash and cash equivalents which are also subject to floating rate
interest

the average weighted interest term to maturity of the project financing is 01 years 2014 02 years

the interestbearing loans are measured at amortised cost rather than at fair value the measurement of the loans is
therefore not affected by changes in interest rates

currency risk
the currency risk on sales purchases and loans is extremely limited for heijmans since by far the greater part of the
cash flows within the group are in euros

fair values
the table below shows the fair values and the carrying amounts of the financial instruments the fair values are
allocated to different levels of the fairvalue hierarchy depending on the inputs used to determine the measurement
methods
the levels are defined as follows
level 1 	quoted unadjusted market prices available to the group on the measurement date in active markets for
           identical assets or liabilities
level 2 	input that is not a quoted market price at level 1 but is obtainable for the asset or liability concerned either
           directly as a price or indirectly derived from a price
level 3 input for the asset or liability not based on data available in a market unobservable input

heijmans has no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value

       the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value


      the above values are based on the present value of future cash flows the loans with a fixed interest rate are discounted using
      the yield curve for 31 december 2015 plus the relevant risk markup

      all loans with a variable interest rate are assumed to have a fair value equal to their carrying amount

      capital management
      the policy has been designed to achieve a sound capital position with sufficient availability of credit to be able to ensure
      continuity for stakeholders a sound capital structure is based on a leverage ratio a net interestbearing debt after deduction of
      cumulative preference finance shares b plus nonrecourse finance divided by ebitda not exceeding 30 and an interest cover
      ratio of at least 40 see also note 619 for a description of the financial ratios in the conditions agreed with the banks

      628       management estimates and judgements

      the accounting information in the financial statements is partly based on estimates and assumptions the group makes
      these estimates and makes assumptions about future developments based on factors such as experience and expectati
      ons about future events that may reasonably be expected to occur given the current state of affairs these estimates and
      assumptions are continually reassessed

      revisions of estimates and assumptions or differences between estimates and assumptions and actual outcomes may
      lead to material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities

      nonresidential
      the stakeholder meeting on 19 october was attended by
      9 different clients and suppliers and the management of
      nonresidential the purpose of the meeting was the
      proposition that the focus in the market was more on
      the end users so that buildings should not only be
      practical but also serve ecological and social goals the
      question was whether those present endorsed this
      proposition and how this could be reflected by non
      residential the participants stated that they had also
      noticed this trend and expected heijmans to take a
      proactive stance the withdrawal by the government
      and new contract types meant that contractors could
      assume a much greater role and thereby introduce
      innovation heijmans could help to develop this with an
      ecosystem of knowledge and partners

        1 a relatively large amount of rubble was removed in 2015 due to the nature of the projects acquired this also weighs heavily in the
            final figure since the reporting is in tonnes and not volume and rubble is relatively heavy
        2 the definition of preferred supplier was changed in 2015 so that the number of preferred suppliers has risen significantly
