performance
2009 interim report

our report is changing
we are changing our approach to reporting
which is how we hold ourselves accountable
to our goals so far mec has published
two comprehensive accountability reports
covering 2004    05 and 2006    07 in the
future we want our reporting to be more
timely better influence future change by
aligning with our overarching mec strategy
and communicate our results in a more
engaging way

that is why in 2011 we will move to a
webbased report along with quarterly
dashboard updates in 2011 youll be
able to find all of the information you would
get in past reports but in a more interactive
and timely way a group of stakeholders
representing members staff environmental
and human rights advocacy groups supply
chain and industry peers will give input on
our content as well as the way in which
we present it we will continue to use the
global reporting initiative and aa1000
for guidance

in the meantime this shorter report is
an interim measure covering the years
2008 09 and is intended to keep you up to
date as we move to our new model here
we invite you to explore where weve been
see our progress over the last two years
and find out where were going
