2015 was a milestone year for the amatheon agri group           however we see the opportunity for fast recovery as the

                                                                in line with our sustainable approach to operations we
on the farming front a major project in 2015 was the           developed new partnerships with international and local
usd 25 million development and construction of two              institutions  helping make smallholder farming more
dams in zambia  one of which was through a strategic           viable and profitable and exemplifying the strong social
project with the internationally renowned toyota tsusho         impact that public private partnerships can make
corporation these dams accelerated our investment
program and will provide the backbone for future                the year was by no means easy every agribusiness in
farming  giving us access to much more irrigated land         the region is feeling the pressure caused by the el niño
despite the shortterm effects of el nino in the country       weather phenomenon and the significant zambian
                                                                kwacha devaluation and recent economic setbacks
in uganda our farming clusters were solidified and             due to declining copper prices however agriculture
further developed though shortfalls on margins and             remains highly attractive and despite these shortterm
yields remain while there were patches of hostile              struggles the medium to long term outlook for agri and
weather over the year which affected crops our ugandan         foods in africa remains buoyant though our economic
farming operations became much more efficient in 2015           performance has not yet reached our targets we remain
and we became one of the largest grain producers in             confident in our strategy and see no reason to change it

networks we have developed a significant client base           and resources are setting us up to become a leading
with smallholder farmers and have formalized our                player in the african agri sector and i look forward to
trading activities with them in fact after the profits seen   sharing this journey with you
from smallholder grain purchases in 2015 it has become
the cornerstone of our trading portfolio and will continue
to expand as amatheon grows

a key highlight for the year was our meat processing
operations under the real meat group umbrella which            carl heinrich bruhn
increased our revenue by consolidating four companies
were setting ourselves up to improve margins and are
structurally lowering our operating costs  though this
is not yet reflected in 2015 as the cost inflation and
currency devaluation heavily impacted the bottom line

in 2015 amatheons ambitious farming expansion
targets were met and have solidly laid the foundation
for future operations by the end of the year the water
storage milestones of two new dams were achieved
and significant bush clearing had taken place  both
enabling additional operational hectares the abba dam
provides a storage capacity of 103 million m3 of water
and the katonga dam provides 76 million m3 of water
despite the visible impact of el nino in 2015 these
two dams are critical to amatheons longterm farming
success and were a major highlight of the year

in addition to growing soya maize and wheat ground
nuts and sugar beans were planted for the first time
and have performed well so far with the first harvest
expected in aprilmay 2016 the short rainy season
compromised borehole replenishment and crop growing
itself and caused significant power challenges country
wide in july the zambia energy supply company
zesco announced it needed to ration energy to all
sectors due to the severe supply shortages as a result of
the poor rains for amatheon this meant limited access
to power for 1216 hours per day until generators arrived
in august  with cost implications and impact on yields

during the year amatheon entered into a project with
toyota tsusho corporation ttc  the trading arm of the
toyota group  who saw amatheon as a strategic partner
to implement a greenfield farming project katonga
farm ltd involves developing 2700 hectares of land for
cropping and to construct a dam for enhanced irrigation
capacities the company is built around back office
synergies with amatheon agri zambia to streamline
processes and benefit from reduced overheads within
six months the land had been cleared and 1361
hectares were planted and the dam construction was
near completion as targeted

importantly amatheon formalized and expanded its
trading activities with nearby smallholder farmers
around 4500 metric tonnes of grain was purchased
through 10 rural depots and a livestock component
was introduced whereby amatheon buys cattle from
the community and fattens them through its feedlot
after the clear benefits of establishing a network of
depots and a database of registered clients in the area
amatheon will continue significantly scaling up its
smallholder engagement next year as a core component
of farming and trading activities

following modest beginnings in 2014 amatheons
ugandan farming operations significantly expanded in
2015 with 2262 hectares growing maize rice sunflower
and soya and a network of over 1300 smallholder
farmers developed

during the year additional land was opened up satellite
clusters were solidified and new land was acquired
bringing the total size to 7500 hectares this has laid
solid foundations for future developments and has firmly
established amatheons presence in uganda  now one
of the largest grain producers in the country

despite this years challenging weather conditions 
especially with dry periods between july and august
 yields for rice and certain maize varieties were good
highlighting the fertile land and favorable climate
conditions without the need for irrigation investment
while the limited availability of soya seeds proved
problematic amatheon established channels to import
better seeds into the country and started trialing other
grain varieties such as hybrid rice following an extensive
soil survey with multiple specialist companies

in line with the expansion of the farming operations a
drier and cleaner system was installed on two clusters
as well as large warehousing facilities on both sites
these will play a critical role in providing insulation
against inclement weather and allowed amatheon to
be approved as a supplier to the united nations world
food programme wfp additionally amatheon invested
in new equipment and a workshop upgrade rice milling
options were also explored with a strong business case
prepared for 2016

trading relationships with smallholder farmers were
developed in 2015 and amatheon built a strong base
supplying grain at its depots while the training and
trading activities provide economic empowerment and
social impact for smallholders in nwoya district they
also provide amatheon with a growing network for
suppliers and clients for significant trading volumes in
the future

the management team in uganda achieved its training
objectives  ensuring amatheon now has a capable team
of operators for a sophisticated machinery fleet this
is no minor feat in a country with very limited history of
largescale in commercial grain farming and has proven
to be a real challenge in the past

zimbabwe is on the edge of a return to commercial
farming activities and amatheon seeks a first mover
advantage after establishing amatheon agri zimbabwe
aazim last year the companys first maize harvest
took place in mid2015 with a satisfying performance
 exemplifying the potential despite challenging
conditions

amatheons modus operandi in zimbabwe is contract
farming whereby amatheon provides the equipment
capital and management of the operations and carefully
vetted farmers receive a percentage of the revenue this
first harvest of 880 hectares resulted in good yields in
some areas  comparatively better than rainfed farming
operations in neighboring areas despite erratic rains
that caused water stress on some crop

considering the significant threat of el niño for the 2015
summer planting season amatheon mitigated its risks
by deciding against further continuation or expansion
of the rainfed cropping operations the impact of
el niño seen in early 2016 confirmed it was a sound
decision during this period amatheon began identifying
appropriate land for irrigation and redefined its
zimbabwe strategy  which includes various crops and
commodities with direct access to european markets
running in parallel to largescale cropping for the local
market

with the countrys high agricultural productivity
superior infrastructure to many nearby countries and
skilled labor force amatheons zimbabwe strategy is
now clearly defined and important networks are well
established  positioning the company for the future and
ensuring competitive advantages as the reconstruction
of the agriculture sector begins

2nd largest meat
company in zambia




in 2015 amatheon established itself as a top player in      in other countries
the zambian meat market by consolidating integrating
and solidifying its place as the second largest meat         operationally a new organizational structure was
company in the country over the year four meat             introduced following the acquisition of real meat

a lusakabased pork abattoir and meat processor             starting to create one strong team in one location
immediately thereafter the real meat company                furthermore a feedlot was closed and a new abattoir
acquired control of more beef ltd a company operating      was built in choma thereby creating the opportunity to
the butcheries in pick n pay supermarkets across             source in southern and central provinces and allowing
zambia and its fully owned subsidiary buccamore foods       more sourcing while diversifying the risk by the end of

economic empowerment                                         partners


alongside its largescale farming operations amatheon
uses its commercial farms as a nucleus to support and
trade with thousands of smallscale farmers leveraging
the platform infrastructure and communication
channels that amatheon has established the
outgrower programme provides structured access to a
network of smallholders  in turn allowing amatheon
to significantly increase its trading volumes while
simultaneously achieving significant social impact by
incorporating smallholder farmers into the rural value
chain amatheon helps build vibrant outgrower networks
fosters entrepreneurship stimulates local productivity
and diversifies sources of income

the outgrower programme provides free training on
conservation farming and business skills establishes
rural depots to sell inputs and buy grain and
links farmers with credit institutions it developed
significantly in 2015  by the end of the year 6344
farmers were registered 13 depots were established and
140 farmers participated in a loan trial scheme payback
rate for these loans was 100 and farmers were able
to take their business to the next level in zambia alone
almost kusd 500 was injected into the local economy
through amatheons grain purchases from smallholders

importantly a livestock component was also introduced
into the programme whereby a veterinary firm provides
vaccinations and animal health trainings and amatheon
provides a reliable output market this new addition
to amatheons buying basket helps farmers see the
opportunities of investing in their livestock and reduces
their dependency on cropping
