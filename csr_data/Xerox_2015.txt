            of special interest to you


            during the last few years weve broadened the company with the expansion of our services
            capabilities and we are now better positioned and equipped than ever to help the world work a
            little better at the same time we have deepened our dedication to responsible global citizenship
            which is an inextricable part of our heritage


            since our founding over a century ago weve been motivated to make positive contributions to

            running throughout this report its organized around five themes that capture the essence of our
            citizenship efforts


            in doing good business you will learn why we believe that strong corporate governance is critical
            to longterm value creation and how we strive to make certain that every aspect of our business
             from supplier relations to financial practices  operates according to the highest standards of
            ethics and integrity for example we require all employees to complete ethics and compliance
            training annually in 2014 xerox people completed more than 1 million hours of training on topics
            from ethics to antibribery

            foster a strong diverse and dynamic workforce with the experience skills passion and energy to
            deliver high performance for example we announced a new diversity policy called the wilson
            rule its named after joe wilson  the first ceo of xerox and a champion of equal opportunity
            in hiring practices the policy requires that women and minorities when available be interviewed
            as part of the pool of qualified candidates for an open management position in the us outside
            the us women when available will be interviewed as part of the pool of qualified candidates


            in putting customers first you will learn about our passion for customers and how our research
            and innovation helps them better serve their clients and our society for example our xerox maven
            solution works across the public health ecosystem supporting data sharing and coordination
            among epidemiologists and medical professionals on the front lines of preventing and containing


                                                                                                                  2147

            and mental hygiene as part of the ebola preparedness and response and is also used by 12 other
            public health agencies in the us and australia


            in preserving the planet you will see how our environmental strategy spans the entire business 
            from internal operations to the sustainability services we provide clients to how we engage with
            partners suppliers and employees as one example illustrating the steps we are taking along those
            lines we joined the sustainable electronic recycling international seri coalition to help launch a
            program that encourages companies to responsibly reuse and recycle electronics by partnering
            with seri to support the us environmental protection agencys r2 leader program were
            extending the reach of our sustainability practices to our customers and others in the industry
            magnifying our positive impact on our world


            in caring for communities you will get an overview of how our people invest their time and
            talent in a wide variety of organizations to strengthen the communities in which they work and
            live for example as early as 1968 our scientists were encouraged to donate their time to teach
            elementary school students the wonders of science motivate them to consider pursuing studies
            and careers in science and technology and provide good role models to emulate nearly 50 years
            later that program is alive and well


            those are just a few examples of the things were doing to nurture a holistic citizenship program
            that benefits people communities and the planet and also creates value for xerox employees our
            customers and our shareholders

            materiality
            in 2015 we updated our materiality approach in alignment with gri g4 guidelines company
            strategy and stakeholder feedback we examined changing external factors including regulations
            and standards social challenges people face around the world our evolving business model and
            environmental impacts of our products services processes and operations our assessment
            included an array of factfinding forums including interviews and workshops with internal
            stakeholders and xerox leaders it also included reviews of public and internal xerox documents
            discussions with external stakeholders and feedback from our employees we concluded


                 managing operations responsibly across our value chain  from decreasing environmental
                 impacts to protecting customer privacy to promoting diversity and ensuring ethical behavior
                  remains a priority for xerox

                 introductions achieved energy star certification
                 through a partnership since 2006 with the nature conservancy the xerox foundation grants
                 of over 2 million have helped conserve and protect globally important forests
                 xeroxs innovative merge parking management system was recently recognized as a
                 product of the year by environmental leader

            reducing environmental impact through our services and solutions
            our expanding services business offers solutions that reduce energy consumption and improve
            environmental performance


            we also help businesses resume after catastrophic events with locations around the world and a
            comprehensive business resumption plan we enable businesses whose plants or offices may be
            closed or debilitated to continue to function


            we provide an array of solutions to improve the productivity of transportation systems it
            infrastructures and backoffice processing an added benefit of many of these solutions is the
            opportunity to decrease environmental impact through reduced electricity usage reduction in
            paper waste and reduced consumption of gasoline for example xeroxs merge parking solution
            uses occupancy data from meters sensors and collection systems to enable rates to vary by
            location and time of day to create availability this reduces time spent searching for onstreet
            parking reducing fuel usage and leading to associated air quality improvements the merge
            parking management system was recently recognized as a product of the year by environmental

            standards
            our product standards encompass the following energy efficiency chemical management
            packaging parts reuse and recycling electrical and mechanical safety ergonomics electromagnetic
            emissions noise fire resistance and materials safety xerox business teams and the ehss
            organization review our products at each stage of the development process for conformance with
            environmental health and safety standards a requirement for the introduction of any new
            product all xerox standards ensure our products have the appropriate labels and information
            needed to meet all safety and environmental label requirements allowing our customers to be
            appropriately informed all products meet required industry labeling standards for each market


            lifecycle assessment
            we integrate lifecycle thinking into all of our product and service development activities as well as
            our innovation activities we conduct full lifecycle assessments lca  in accordance with
            appropriate iso standards  to compare products with a significant difference in technology and
            determine where in the product lifecycle the largest environmental impacts arise full peer
            reviewed lcas have been conducted on our solid ink products 8860 8870 8700 and colorqube
            9200 series in addition in 2013 we completed our first comparison of our toner cartridge system
            to a competitors allinone cartridge system this study compared the xerox laser product phaser
            6600 with a competitors laser device and the results helped drive design improvements for future
            releases of the product peerreviewed lcas are being conducted on an increasing number of our
            office products in order to provide our design teams with opportunities for future reductions in
            environmental impacts


            in some cases we utilize streamlined assessment methods in product development processes for
            equipment materials eg toner formulations and our services offerings an estimated 65 percent
            of our product categories have undergone full lca with nearly all other hardware products and
            many services undergoing a more targeted evaluation we encourage our customers to learn more
            about how their printing behavior affects the overall carbon footprint of their organization from a
            lifecycle perspective


            product design
            xerox has long incorporated environmental considerations into product design scientists in our
            materials research group evaluate aspects of safety energy materials and sustainability sems
            using a tool we developed that allows researchers to quickly compare the current design with a
            future proposed design the tool challenges designers to think about the whole lifecycle of the
            product and recognize any positive or negative impacts to the environment by using sems we
            can quantify energy reductions reduce risk of regulated materials and track progress over time
            sems was designed to be used in early research and development stages to understand tradeoffs
            and help make decisions early in the product lifecycle


            epeat
            for office products xerox uses the electronic products environmental assessment tool epeat  as
            the foundation of our design for environment program a comprehensive environmental rating

            reducing energy use through our products and technology


                 energy star
                 more than 10 years before the inception of the us environmental protection agency epa
                 energy star office equipment program xerox introduced the first imaging product with
                 an automatic powerdown mode since joining with the epa as a charter partner in 1993 we
                 continue to introduce copier printer fax and multifunction products that have earned
                 energy star status even as the certification criteria have grown more stringent

                 in 2014 100 percent of all our new eligible product introductions achieved energy star 
                 this continued success in cutting the power consumption of our laserbased printing products
                 has been achieved by adjustments in the fuser design changes to the properties of the toner
                 more efficient electronic controls and the workings of the xerographic system as a whole

                 the energy star program introduces progressively more stringent requirements over time
                 with the most recent revision having gone into effect january 1 2014 while the new
                 standard is significantly more challenging to meet our goal remains to have 100 percent of
                 new product introductions achieve this label

                 multifunction devices
                 our multifunction systems further reduce the amount of energy required to copy print fax
                 and scan by combining the functions of multiple products into one machine the annual
                 energy savings of replacing several individual energy star qualified copiers fax machines
                 and printers with one xerox energy starqualified workcentre multifunction system is up to
                 onehalf energy savings would be substantially higher if a multifunction system replaces
                 individual products that have not earned the energy star  rating

                 xerox connectkey
                 connectkey is a software solution that enables information to be moved to and from the
                 cloud without the security risks that commonly exist cloud computing is an alternative to
                 large data centers and is being recognized worldwide as less energy intensive than data
                 centers while generating fewer greenhouse gas emissions in addition xerox connectkey
                 and cisco energywise enable energy management by allowing for control management and
                 reporting of a devices power consumption and the setting of power states and timeout
                 intervals



                                                                                                                 43147

            deinkability
            in recent years deinkability has become an area of increasing concern particularly among our
            graphic communications customers ensuring that prints produced with our equipment and
            materials can be responsibly managed at the end of their useful life is an important consideration
            in our product development process when appropriate independent testing confirms that these
            prints pose no unique challenges to the recycling stream while the deinkability of xerographic
            prints has long been demonstrated a key milestone for a new technology came in 2010 when the
            cipress printer achieved a good deinkability rating from ingede the international association of
            the deinking industry


            paper use
            our equipment and software is designed to help customers operate efficiently the earth smart
            feature integrated into the xerox global print driver brings several resourcesaving settings
            together at the single click of a button these features such as duplex twosided printing nup
            multiple pages per sheet proof print and toner saving modes make it easier for customers to
            make responsible print choices xerox enterprise print services customers have access to
            sophisticated print management and reporting tools such as xerox print agent which provides
            additional methods of encouraging and tracking responsible print behavior software products such
            as docushare and freeflow digital workflow collection help xerox customers reduce paper
            consumption by facilitating electronic data management scan to email printondemand and
            distributethenprint workflows xerox has also been exploring creative ways to engage employees
            in the sustainability effort the xerox print awareness tool is an innovative solution that allows
            employees to view graphical representations of print usage and take an active role in helping their
            organization reach print reduction targets


            packaging and distribution
            packaging and distribution are integral parts of our product commercialization process we strive
            to eliminate reduce reuse and recycle packaging we document our expectations in our
            environment health and safety requirements for packaging standard  ehs710 and also in our
            general packaging standard  88p311 our commercial equipment is designed and tested
            extensively to be shipped without any requiring packaging we strive to eliminate or reduce
            packaging wherever feasible which conserves natural resources and decreases fuel use for
            distribution a sustainability win for business and the environment


            we also offer the xerox automated packaging solution this system uses the latest in document
            technology to print finish and cut customized folding cartons in short runs by creating packaging
            quickly and costeffectively this solution enhances materials efficiencies as well as decreasing
            obsolescence through the creation of customized boxes and containers automated packaging
            reduces financial and environmental costs associated with warehousing storage and disposal an
            advantage for focused marketing campaigns and rapidly changing competitive markets


            a few examples that illustrate our commitment to sustainability in this area


            developer housing assembly  converting to use of molded pulp
            for many years our principal supplier shipped housing assemblies to us packed in foam we moved
            production to the us and redesigned the packaging to allow us to take advantage of readily
            recyclable molded pulp solutions


                                                                                                                  44147

9282015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            the expanded polystyrene endcaps weighing 68 grams each and measuring 5 inches in length 65
            inches in width and 6 inches in height per side were replaced with molded pulp endcaps the result
            was a decrease in our material footprint large enough to increase the amount of product per unit
            load from 77 units per pallet to 144 an increase of 87 percent this eliminated 4800 kilograms
            10575 lbs and 8559 cubic feet of foam annually reducing costs and also conserving natural
            resources


            workcentre 7120 customer replaceable units crus  reducing our footprint
            as with our developer housing assemblies we redesigned packaging provided to us by a large
            supplier of color workcentre 7120 crus by removing polystyrene end caps and reducing the size
            of the package the result was a reduction of 4725 kilograms 10417 lbs or 27756 cubic feet of
            polystyrene waste annually and a 27 percent increase of product per unit load


            xerox replacement cartridges xrc  reducing solid waste
            for xrc products xerox packaging engineers replaced hot wire expanded polystyrene endcaps
            with inflatable air bags upon receipt of the package the air bags are easily deflated producing
            far less solid waste by mass and cubic volume compared to polystyrene an environmentally
            preferable alternative


            materials
            we have made a longterm commitment to eliminate the use of persistent bioaccumulative and
            toxic materials throughout our supply chain by applying strict internal standards and by tightly
            managing chemicals in our supply chain we were the first in our industry to evaluate the health
            effects of toner and did so for over 30 years we have reengineered or eliminated processes to
            dramatically reduce the use of toxics and heavy metals and have made substantial progress in
            eliminating the use of mercury mercurycontaining lamps that scan images and backlight user
            displays are being phased out as alternatives become available


            our requirements for minimizing toxic materials govern our product design and materials selection
            toxicologists conduct a comprehensive assessment of new materials in our products to ensure
            conformance with applicable global registration hazard communication and waste handling and
            disposal requirements as a result of our stringent requirements xerox toners and printing products
            are noncarcinogenic and nonmutagenic in addition these products do not cause adverse
            developmental or reproductive effects pose a toxicity hazard to humans or aquatic species cause
            a permanent adverse impact to the skin eyes or respiratory system or have the potential to
            generate federally regulated hazardous waste


            our supplier requirements are periodically updated as regulations change and new information
            becomes available all new product designs refer to these requirements and suppliers are expected
            to verify their compliance with them learn more at wwwxeroxcomenvironment


            our safety and supplier processes enable us to meet global regulations governing chemical use
            since 2007 xeroxs newly launched products have been designed to meet the european rohs
            requirements in all markets however where regulations allow some products may contain parts
            with small amounts of rohs substances in order to avoid premature disposal of existing parts that
            continue to have usable life similar types of legislation continue to be implemented in many other
            market regions through our proactive regulatory tracking process we expect to be fully compliant
            with all aspects of these regulations as the provisions become effective and applicable
                                                                                                                   45147

9282015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            in early 2015 xerox was informed by a supplier that certain units of four product families shipped
            in the second half of 2014 may not comply with the european unions restriction of hazardous
            substances directive rohs recast directive tests showed that four small plastic parts in the
            affected units contained a small amount of cadmium which exceeded permitted limits xerox
            stopped shipment of the affected units within our control and inventory was reworked with
            compliant parts affected product already placed at customer locations is being reworked on a
            next service call basis there is no customer or employee exposure or risk in accordance with
            applicable regulations xerox selfreported this nonconformity to the relevant authorities who
            assessed no penalties


            thirdparty supplies sold by xerox
            in some cases xerox sells supplies through its distribution network that are manufactured by other
            companies we review these supplies to ensure compliance with appropriate regulatory
            requirements in addition we also assess against our own stringent standards the results of these
            reviews ultimately determine which products carry the xerox brand information is provided on
            safety data sheets sds which have been recently updated to meet the requirements of the
            globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals ghs as implemented
            through regulations in our various markets


            endoflife management
            our aim is to design products packaging and supplies that make efficient use of resources
            minimize waste reuse material where feasible and recycle what cant be reused to meet this
            commitment we developed several programs xeroxs green world alliance initiative provides a
            collection and reuserecycling program for spent imaging supplies xeroxs product takeback and
            recycling program manages equipment at endoflife and we invest in technologies that reduce
            the creation of waste our solid ink imaging process utilizes compact cartridgefree solid ink sticks
            with no plastic housings or casings thereby reducing printrelated waste by up to 90 percent
            compared with comparable color laser products for laserbased products materials innovation has
            extended the life of critical replaceable components by up to 50 percent


            our approach to managing products at endoflife translates into significant environmental and
            financial benefits globally our combined returns programs equipment resale or remanufacture in
            conjunction with parts and consumables reuse and recycling prevented over 38000 metric tons of
            waste from entering landfills in 2014


            consumables takeback and recycling
            xeroxs green world alliance gwa initiative provides a collection and reuserecycling program for
            spent imaging supplies gwa is central to our commitment to wastefree products


            currently more than 35 countries participate in the xerox green world alliance each has its own
            gwa country website that describes the processes available to the customer or the appropriate
            points of contact for more information worldwide our customers returned over 39 million
            cartridges toner containers and other used supply items in 2014 equating to 3700 metric tons


            although our consumables returns programs have been in existence for two decades we continue
            to enhance them major improvements in the us program in 2010 were followed by similar
            changes in canada in 2011 including the north american ecobox program enabling customers to

            the xerox green world alliance website wwwxeroxcomgwa


            returned products are sorted and items suitable for remanufacturing are cleaned inspected and
            then remanufactured remanufactured cartridges containing an average of 90 percent
            reusedrecycled parts are built and tested to the same performance specifications as new
            products items that are not suitable for remanufacturing are recycled or recovered through energy
            from waste recycled waste toner and toner reclaimed from manufacturing that qualifies for reuse
            may account for 25 percent of the weight of new toner without compromising toner functionality
            reusing wastereclaimed toner saves several million dollars in raw material costs each year of the
            toner that cant be reclaimed 75 percent is recycled by our consumables recycling partner while
            the remaining volume is utilized at energy from waste facilities to generate steam and electricity


            total waste diverted from landfills from consumables recycled
            reused energy from waste




            2013 data has been restated due to calculation error in 2014 report


            equipment and parts takeback and recycling
            in the early 1990s we pioneered the practice of converting endoflife electronic equipment into
            products and parts that contain reused parts while meeting newproduct specifications for quality
            and performance we have developed a comprehensive process for taking back endoflife products
            and have established a remanufacture parts reuse and recycling program that fully supports our
            wastefree initiatives


            we design our machines with the minimum number of required parts and with high durability and
            reuse capability in order to encourage multiple product lifecycles during the active phase of a
            product all returned equipment is evaluated for reuse opportunities throughout the supply chain
            finally all parts are coded with disposal instructions so they are easy to recycle in the most
            effective manner during the endoflifeendofservice phase of the product life


                                                                                                                  47147

            xerox enables reuse according to the following principles


                 reuse of complete end item this requires the least reprocessing transportation and energy
                 usage
                 remanufacturing or conversion into a newergeneration product or part product families are
                 designed with a high level of commonality to enable maximum reuse in this manner this
                 allows us to remanufacture to as new performance specifications while reusing 70 to 90
                 percent of the machine components by weight without degradation of quality or
                 performance nearly 65 percent of machines returned in the us are given new life by being
                 sold as used or sent for remanufacturing of some sort
                 reuse of major modules subcomponents and parts for spares or manufacturing many of our
                 machines that have outlived their useful life are stripped of usable parts and components
                 prior to the scrapreclaim process used spare parts returned from the field are also
                 considered for this reuse stream xerox is continually looking to increase the number of
                 components that are reused in upstream and downstream processes after the original
                 machine has been designated for disposal
                 material recycling after the processes noted above have been followed any remaining
                 portion of a machine is stripped of any recyclable material eg plastics copper wire and
                 material requiring special disposal services such as pwbs batteries and lamps the remainder
                 of the machine is then crushed and sent to a scrap metal reclaim facility


            changes in volumes of waste diverted from landfills is due in part to changes in product mix
            design of lighterweight machines and growth of regulatorydriven local recycling schemes for
            example the transition to digital equipment and lighterweight parts has reduced the weight of
            both office and production equipment by as much as 50 percent over the last 10 years the
            decline also represents a decrease in the number of office machines returned for remanufacturing
            in europe due to participation in eu member state waste electrical and electronic equipment
            weee programs in geographies where xerox exercises direct control over the endoflife
            management of equipment return rates are high for example approximately 60 percent of all
            us equipment installs are ultimately returned to xerox for endoflife disposition a figure that
            rises to 100 percent for leased equipment




                                                                                                                  48147

            ewaste
            while xerox has long been committed to responsible endoflife management of equipment the
            proliferation of ewaste regulations has created a need for multiple programs in different countries
            and even states the subtle differences in requirements among these regulations pose challenges
            from a process consistency and efficiency standpoint for example with the implementation of the
            european unions waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive we continue to
            operate our european takeback program to enable equipment remanufacturing and parts reuse
            we also participate as needed in european member states individual collection and recycling
            programs


            in the us xerox recently partnered with a large electronics recycler to ensure that our customers
            have a means to have their old imaging devices processed in a responsible manner the program
            is consistent with the requirements defined in the various manufacturer takeback initiatives


            we carefully manage suppliers who provide recycling and waste disposal services a waste vendor
            approval process assesses the safety and environmental practices as well as compliance history of
            each vendor where appropriate we require these companies to document the final disposition of
            materials sent to their facilities including electronic scrap xerox does not allow its vendors to send
            electronic scrap to developing nations for processing we strive to work with only those recyclers
            who have implemented voluntary programs that are certified by accredited organizations the
            programs are us epas responsible recyclers r2 or the basal action networks estewards
            standards in addition in 2014 xeroxs two us equipment processing facilities achieved r2
            certification


            paper
            we recognize our obligation to responsibly source paper and enable efficient paper use our
            strategy begins upstream with the fiber source and continues on to processing and manufacturing
            through use and endoflife we utilize a multipronged approach through partnerships with our
            customers and suppliers the nature conservancy and other stakeholders including non

                                                                                                                       49147

            developing market operations


            we apply stringent paper sourcing guidelines for companies that provide paper to xerox for resale
            the requirements cover all aspects of papermaking from forest management to production of
            finished goods we supply papers that comply with sustainable forest management standards
            including forest stewardship council fsc and program for the endorsement of forest
            certification pefc fsccertified papers use raw materials from an fsccertified source controlled
            wood sources or postconsumer reclaimed sources as a requirement for displaying the fsc label on
            our papers we earned fsc chainofcustody certification from the rainforest alliances
            smartwood program xerox has also earned pefc chainofcustody certification


            we offer papers ranging from 80 to 100 percent postconsumer recycled content our recycled
            papers use postconsumer waste andor recycled fiber in place of new pulp recycled products are
            required to meet the same strict performance specifications as virgin products and are designed
            for optimal performance in our equipment


            our partnership with the nature conservancy
            through the xerox foundation grants of over 2 million since 2006 xerox and the nature
            conservancy have partnered to conserve and protect globally important forests through a variety
            of means  some maturing tools such as forest certification and high conservation value hcv
            assessments and other new tools and mechanisms for conservation such as the alignment of
            forest carbon and certification our partnership builds on the commitment of xerox to
            sustainability throughout its operations and corporate leadership on the world stage


            xerox and the nature conservancy formed the forest conservation partnership in 2006 to bring
            tactical resources and assistance to the paper industry as it strives to improve forest management
            practices as well as to help the conservancy meet its conservation objectives during the third
            term of the partnership in 2014 xerox supported the conservancys efforts to


                 develop and test a broadly applicable forest carbon methodology for improved forest
                 management that would allow landowners to achieve forest certification and serve as a
                 platform for potential carbon benefits

            energy goal 2020
            in 2003 we made a public commitment to reduce ghg emissions  our carbon footprint  by
            joining the us epa climate leaders program and launching an internal program known as energy
            challenge 2012


            this 10year initiative set a goal to reduce ghg emissions across all company operations 1 10
            percent by 2012 we met this target six years ahead of schedule so we set a new target of 25
            percent reduction by 2012 from a 2002 baseline at the conclusion of the program we
            successfully cut emissions by 42 percent  thats 210000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents
            co2e  and reduced energy consumption by 31 percent


            our new corporatewide goal is to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by 2020 from a
            2012 baseline in 2014 we reduced energy consumption by 11 percent and cut emissions by 15

            data when unavailable estimations have been used


            greenhouse gas inventory
            in keeping with the international guidelines of the greenhouse gas protocol developed by the
            world resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development we track
            the six major ghgs carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o
            hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 we express our
            carbon footprint in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents co2e


            energy sources account for more than 99 percent of our ghg emissions our ghg inventory
            includes direct emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels primarily natural gas and indirect
            emissions from purchased electricity and steam at our manufacturing sites offices and
            warehouses the inventory also includes the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels in our service
            and sales vehicle fleet


            in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol inventory adjustments are completed each year
            as a result of the opening and closing of facilities and changes to the vehicle fleet as reflected in
            energy consumption and ghg emission charts we have expanded our ghg tracking to include
            scope 3 emissions from employee business travel product transport and employee commute


            in 2014 xerox ghg emissions totaled 232241 metric tons of co2e about 51 percent were

            climate change risks and opportunities
            xerox has examined the regulatory physical and commercial risks and opportunities associated
            with climate change across our value chain


            we assess and manage our carbon risk by maintaining both a robust ghg emissions inventory and
            a mature regulatory tracking function that provides the necessary information to stay abreast of
            developing regulation we do not consider our company to be subject to unique risks due to
            changing weather patterns rising temperatures and sea level rise but we recognize that our
            business could be impacted by more frequent disruptions as a result of severe weather in locations

            where we operate we may also need to invoke our business continuity and resumption plans to
            aid customers who are impacted by business disruptions due to severe weather were experienced
            in working with customers to ensure continuity of critical applications by prioritizing business needs
            and developing customerspecific preparedness plans where appropriate our business resumption
            plans include communication with employees and customers management of employee health
            and safety issues business continuity and resumption processes and interaction with government
            organizations


            we recognize that the increasing costs of energy and concerns around energy security are issues
            that affect both our operations and those of our customers our commitment to reduce energy use
            in our operations was driven in part by cost savings and we recognized that helping our customers
            to reduce energy costs through more efficient document solutions could increase our revenues


            our immediate shortterm focus is reducing energy consumption in our own operations as we
            make progress toward achieving our corporate goal of 20 percent reduction by 2020 we strive to
            provide sustainable document management technology solutions to our customers to reduce the
            energy and environmental impacts of their business


            to meet our commitment for reducing energy use and protecting the climate our longterm
            more than threeyear strategy is to continue to invest in technologies that reduce the carbon
            footprint of our operations and develop technology solutions that help our customers to reduce
            the energy and environmental impacts of their business our ultimate aim is to be carbonneutral


            we invest in innovation market leadership and sound management practices that deliver
            measurable benefits to the environment our customers and society and that also increase
            shareholder value we recognize the importance of creative partnerships with suppliers customers

            air emissions
            xerox has significantly reduced manufacturing air emissions over the past 20 years continuous
            improvement remains a priority


            most of our air emissions originate from the production of imaging supplies such as toner
            photoreceptor drums and belts and fuser rolls although 2014 volatile organic process air
            emissions voc and nonvoc from these production activities were essentially the same as in
            2013 our historical reductions demonstrate the success of our design initiatives to minimize
            environmental impact emission reductions have primarily come from process modification lower
            production volumes of legacy products coated using organic solvents and production declines
            attributable to longerlife components


                                                                                                                     56147

            volatile organic process air emissions




            a subset of these volatile organic process emissions is defined by the us environmental
            protection agency epa as hazardous air pollutants hap in 2014 xerox reported worldwide air
            emissions of approximately 5 metric tons of hap under national toxic chemical release regulations
            including the united states toxic release inventory tri program methylene chloride methyl
            isobutyl ketone mibk 13butadiene and styrene represent virtually all of these hap emissions

            ozonedepleting substances
            xerox policy prohibits the use of ozonedepleting substances ods as ingredients in products
            spare parts accessories and packaging ozonedepleting substances are used as refrigerants in
            facility and vehicle air conditioning systems and various foodequipmentcooling systems although
            ods may be released during the normal operation and failure of these systems the total amount
            released is not significant from a companywide perspective elimination of ods as refrigerant is
            managed consistent with government phaseout dates


            toxic chemical releases
            the release of materials used in our worldwide operations is evaluated annually and reported to
            government agencies under national toxic chemical release reporting regulations such as the us
            toxic release inventory the canadian national pollution release inventory and the european
            pollutant release and transfer register releases for reporting year 2014 were 5 percent lower
            than 2013 levels and 71 percent lower than 2007 levels in 2014 reportable releases and transfers
            decreased primarily due to decreases in the amount of organic solvent used in production
            manufacturing processes




                                                                                                                 58147

            reportable toxic chemical releases and transfers




            in 2011 operations with reportable toxic chemical releases to the air land or water  in amounts
            of greater than one metric ton  established goals targets and objectives related to chemical
            releases progress against these goals as of yearend 2014 is summarized below


                 an initiative to reclaim spent methyl isobutyl ketone mibk continued to exceed
                 expectations in the third full year of implementation recovered solvent was qualified for use
                 as a cleaning solvent for the fluid delivery systems used in us fuser roll coating operations
                 as a result the amount of virgin mibk purchased in 2014 for use in the manufacturing
                 operation was reduced by 42 percent from the 2010 baseline on a normalized perpart basis
                 the amount of methylene chloride used to manufacture xerox photoreceptor belts was
                 reduced by more than 61 percent from the 2010 baseline greatly exceeding target this
                 dramatic reduction was primarily due to volume declines of legacy products and process
                 modifications that reduced the amount of methylene chloride used for batch cleaning of
                 production equipment
                 emissions of 13butadiene from us toner resin manufacturing operations did not meet the
                 normalized perbatch target in 2014 due to a process modification that increased transfer
                 losses actions have been taken to partially mitigate those losses and a new baseline will be
                 established

            spills and accidental releases
            our goal is to prevent all environmental releases of regulated materials to air soil and water we
            have greatly reduced the frequency of spills and accidental releases though we have not yet
            reached our target of eliminating these events


            in 2014 our north american operations identified two reportable accidental spillsreleases
            compared with five in 2013 both of the events occurred at our monroe county new york
            location one event was contained within the internal containment structure and cleaned up with
            no environmental impact the other was the result of a minor spill of a hazardous material which
            forced an evacuation of the building and subsequent ventilation of the material to the air
            immediate corrective actions were taken in both cases


                                                                                                                    59147

            water consumption and treatment
            as part of our commitment to conserve resources we monitor water consumption across our
            manufacturing distribution and rd facilities worldwide we have met the corporate goal to
            reduce water consumption by 21 percent by 2014 against a 2009 baseline


            our new goal is to reduce water consumption by 35 percent by 2020 against a 2010 baseline
            water consumption in 2014 was down 28 percent against the 2020 goal


            though we certainly continued conservation activities in 2014 any additional benefit was offset
            by changes in production scheduling that resulted in increases in manufacturing more frequent
            product changes and cleaning cycles as a result water consumption rose slightly in 2014


            however at our emulsion aggregate toner plant in webster new york employee teams worked to
            reduce overall waste generated by the process a primary focus was the amount of water used for
            equipment cleaning teams were able to identify opportunities to reduce the frequency of full
            equipment washes and to optimize the way water is directed through the equipment it improves
            cleaning efficiency and reduces the amount of fresh water used in each cleaning cycle


            the water discharges at manufacturing sites are monitored to validate compliance with local
            sanitary sewer discharge limits wastewater from manufacturing processes is treated as necessary
            before being discharged into local sanitary sewers we utilize best practices to prevent unwanted
            pollutants from entering waterways via surface contamination and runoff extensive sampling of
            wastewater discharged to both sanitary and storm sewers ensures that discharged water meets
            our strict requirements


            the new york water environment association presented our webster new york facilities with a
            silver environmental performance award for water discharge quality for 2014 this award
            acknowledges that nearly 4000 water permit analyses for sanitary and storm water met all permit
            specifications we have received five gold and ten silver awards since the program began in 2000




                                                                                                                 60147

            hazardous waste
            there were no significant changes to our worldwide hazardous waste volumes in 2014 however
            improvements included beneficially managing 73 percent of the hazardous waste generated in
            2014 through recycling andor fuels blending technologies as compared with 62 percent in 2013


            we do not export hazardous waste to developing nations a thirdparty supplier is contracted to
            recover spent methyl isobutyl ketone this material is returned to us to support ongoing coating
            operations solid and liquid hazardous waste streams that have an adequate btu value are
            managed via a fuels blending program an offsite waste disposal vendor blends these waste

            nonhazardous solid waste
            we have had major waste reduction efforts in place for many years we reuse boxes pallets and
            containers for parts delivery we recapture toner that is outside the acceptable size range during
            manufacturing recycle returned equipment and reuse totes for recycling scrap metal and paper


            we have an aspirational goal to drive our reuserecycle rate to 100 by 2020 at our technology
            facilities compared to a baseline year of 2009 additionally xerox has committed to developing a
            process to collect and track solid waste data at all of our services facilities


            our global manufacturing operations and all facilities in monroe county new york generated
            43000 metric tons of nonhazardous solid waste in 2014 up slightly from 41000 metric tons in
            2013 process waste consists primarily of paper wood pallets waste toner plastics and packaging
            waste such as corrugated cardboard equipment manufacturing waste includes scrap metal waste
            batteries and lamps miscellaneous trash and nonusable endoflife equipment and parts that are
            returned to xerox for processing equipment manufacturing waste made up about 65 percent of
            the nonhazardous solid waste managed by xerox operations in 2014


            in 2014 we managed 93 percent of nonhazardous solid waste beneficially up from 92 percent in
            2013 the increased reuserecycle rate can be attributed to an increase in our manufacturing
            operations using energy from waste technology for nonrecyclables in 2014 additionally in 2014
            our equipment resellers were able to return a number of products to the marketplace for resale
            that resulted in a significant reduction of all nonhazardous waste please note that the

            environmental remediation and compliance


            in 1985 we began a voluntary assessment program that identified 68 of our worksites requiring
            remediation we worked closely with the appropriate federal state and local agencies to initiate
            prompt and appropriate measures to ensure the protection of employees neighbors and the
            environment


            today only seven of the original 68 sites still require active remedial or control measures during
            2014 we were able to complete active remediation at two sites we have removed the sources of
            contamination and have remediated the properties for reuse or redevelopment in 2014 we
            completed remediation at a site in canada which was validated with final confirmation sampling
            in 2015 the other site remediated was in california which will now enter into longterm
            groundwater monitoring


            in addition to using conventional techniques for groundwater recovery and soil excavation we
            have a history of developing innovative remedial technologies these included techniques that
            enhance the recovery of contaminants such as highvacuum 2phase extraction and enhanced
            bedrock fracturing we also employ technologies where contaminants are converted to lessharmful
            substances through enhanced natural biodegradation and chemical oxidation


            compliance reporting
            we require our various operations and subsidiaries worldwide to report allegations of regulatory
            violations to our ehss group for tracking evaluation and corrective action where appropriate in
            2014 six instances resulted in a notice of violation two of these resulted in penalties one
            stemmed from incomplete inspection and maintenance records and the other involved exceeding
            wastewater discharge limits all issues have been abated and closed out with the relevant
            authorities and weve established appropriate controls to ensure ongoing compliance




                                                                                                                   66147

            caring for communities

            employee volunteer activities
            at xerox we believe a combination of financial and human resources can bring about greater
            change than either on its own this philosophy is perhaps best represented by our community
            involvement program this longrunning grassroots program backs the voluntary spirit of our
            employees with funding support from xerox in this way were making the biggest difference in
            the communities where we live and work


            since the program began in 1974 thousands of xerox people have been involved in regional
            communityfocused projects each year in 2014 the xerox foundation invested over 13 million
            in the community involvement program enabling 13000 xerox people to participate in 800
            projects


            outside of our employee volunteer programs xerox people also give their time and talent to a
            wide variety of causes here are a few examples


                 xerox scientists participate in the xerox science consultant program which sends our people
                 into elementary schools to teach science to inquiring young minds and to ignite interest in
                 science as a career
                 xerox lawyers provide pro bono work to a wide range of nonprofits
                 people across xerox  from the csuite to the factory floor  volunteer their time to
                 help make our world a better place

            during 2014 913 percent of our philanthropic investments were directed to institutions and
            organizations where someone from xerox was personally involved


            no relationship better illustrates xeroxs commitment to community volunteers than the one we
            have with the united way in 2014 the xerox foundation gave 18 million in grants to some 70
            united way organizations throughout the united states including 500000 to the united way of
            rochester new york in addition xerox employees personally donated more than 650000 of
            their own money as well as time volunteering at united way agencies and day of caring


            the grand total of xeroxs contribution to the united way in 2014 combining foundation grants

            establish a consistent level of ehss performance worldwide a common set of facility

            safety and building codes as well as specific regulatory requirements that may apply in different
            parts of the world


            the onsite review of these locations provided significant insight into the variety of business
            operations facility andor management issues and best practices that could be used to improve
            overall performance outside of the us due to the large variation in local regulations the audits
            identified a number of sites requiring some sort of physical upgrade modification or intervention
            to meet safety and environmental requirements corrective actions for all of these locations have
            been completed


            consistent application of accepted life safety and building codes within all 50 us states means
            there were fewer physical issues identified however some operational management process

            ergonomics
            because musculoskeletal disorders represent a significant portion of our workrelated injuries we
            work to minimize the risk factors as a job is designed we study exposure to ergonomic hazards
            and raise awareness with employees so they can make improvements to their workstations


            from manufacturing operations to office work we continue to study the causes and potential
            remedies for workplace injuries the following provides some brief highlights


                 manufacturing operations workstation evaluations are conducted in xerox facilities
                 worldwide for ergonomic hazards based upon risk profile and injury experience ergonomic
                 enhancements such as tilt tables lifts and hoists make it easier for employees to maneuver
                 parts and equipment during assembly
                 machine service xerox customer service engineers cses exposure to ergonomic hazards
                 has been studied the findings have helped us select tools and develop procedures to
                 mitigate risk of musculoskeletal disorders throughout the equipment design process
                 evaluations are done to assess risks for our cses the best time to make a modification is
                 when a product is still in the design or early test phases
                 office ergonomics our largest employee population is officebased raising awareness and
                 helping employees make effective workstation changes is critical to minimizing risk for this
                 population we created computerbased training on ergonomics principles and practices this
                 method of delivery enables employees to go through needed training programs at a time
                 that minimizes business interruptions for employees that require additional ergonomic
                 technical assistance due to workplace injuries or medical accommodations we have partnered
                 with a thirdparty consultant to conduct more detailed ergonomic assessments by leveraging
                 this consultant we are able to better support a larger geographic area we also continue to
                 focus on ways to unify the ergonomics program across all sectors of business


            asset protection and fire safety
            the xerox asset protection and fire safety program provides firesafe workplaces and limits the
            potential for losses to xerox equipment and property from fire explosion and natural hazards such
            as windstorms snowloading collapse and floods the program includes periodic inspections
            management reviews of findings and mitigation planning our philosophy is to maintain our
            highervalued locations to a highly protected risk standard in addition locations are reviewed
            for conformance to xerox standards and recognized fire and life safety standards we continue to
            demonstrate strong loss control performance and benefit from favorable insurance rates and
            premiums

            contractor safety process
            the goal of the contractor safety program is to ensure contracted work conforms to all applicable
            regulations and xerox environmental health and safety requirements contractors are qualified to
            the safety and health requirements prior to beginning work at a xerox location contractors are
            required to submit a job safety plan and workers on us xerox sites attend an orientation session
            incidents and injuries are tracked both as feedback and to measure program effectiveness
            although first established in our rochester new york operations this model is being applied
            successfully in many of our larger locations

            preventing and monitoring workplace exposures
            to protect employees from unsafe exposures to chemicals noise and radiation xerox applies
            exposure limits to worldwide manufacturing research and technology service operations based
            upon the threshold limit values tlv recommended by the american conference of
            governmental industrial hygienists these reflect the best advice of a widely respected committee
            of international experts however in jurisdictions where government regulations are more
            stringent xerox meets those regulatory requirements for some materials  including toners and
            certain solvents and metals  xerox has established exposure limits that are more stringent than
            the tlv or existing regulations and standards


            using the xerox exposure assessment process industrial hygiene and safety professionals monitor
            assess and report workplace exposures effective process design engineering controls safe job
            procedures and personal protective equipment are used to control exposures and protect employee
            health medical surveillance programs are in place to monitor the health of employees working in
            operations with specific jobs and hazards eg high noise organic solvents results of those
            medical exams are reviewed to ensure no adverse health effects


            of the workplace exposures monitored in 2014 approximately 99 percent were within xerox limits
            all were within regulatory limits or were controlled through the proper use of personal protective
            equipment where engineering controls were not possible
                                                                                                                  89147

            customer dreaming sessions
            in the words of sophie vandebroek xerox chief technology officer and president of the xerox
            innovation group something is only an innovation if it makes a difference to our clients or to the
            world so the question is how do you know what delights your customers in our case we ask
            them


            at xerox we view our customers as partners in innovation our researchers observe customers and
            their clients directly in their work environments and employ ethnographic methods to identify
            needs and pain points last year we conducted nearly 200 customer events with more than 2500
            participants more than half of those interactions were dreaming sessions where researchers and
            customers get together to explore the future of the customers business and identify the key
            issues

            working on ways to make it easier to harness data from images scientists and engineers from our
            four global research centers are applying advanced image processing sophisticated algorithms and
            predictive analytics to a range of industries including transportation and healthcare


            the merge parking management system deployed in downtown los angeles is one example of a
            solution built on xerox innovation this firstofitskind system gathers and analyzes data from
            smart meters offstreet parking lots and more than 6000 onstreet parking sensors to provide a
            complete picture of parking demand motorists use their smartphones and vehicle navigation
            systems to obtain realtime information on parking rates and available parking spaces and to
            make payments in addition smartpricing algorithms adjust parking rates based on demand this
            demandbased pricing helps eliminate congestion by offering incentives to drivers to use a
            different mode of transportation or park farther away

            putting customers first

            safe services and products
            safety has always been a cornerstone of our work in product development our comprehensive
            product safety plan details specific requirements and all xerox imaging equipment is assessed for
            conformance to these requirements we assess all potential hazards including the ways in which
            different hazards may interact we take a conservative position on potential health risks to
            employees and customers always meeting or exceeding government safety regulations


            customers are encouraged to review product safety information and understand the
            environmental profile of our devices user guides contain information regarding safe use as well as
            any applicable hazard warning our product safety data sheets psds offer environmental health
            and safety information for each xerox device safety data sheets sds identify hazards
            associated with specific materials and describe how they can be safely handled used and stored
            both our sds and product labeling have been recently updated to meet the requirements of the
            globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals ghs as implemented
            through regulations in our various markets customers can access sds and psds in multiple
            languages at wwwxeroxcomenvironment


            we have robust processes for tracking regulatory violations and nonconformity with voluntary
            codes and labels in 2014 no such instances resulted in fines or sanctions we did selfreport a
            noncompliance related to cadmium content in excess of regulatory and ecolabel limits in a small
            assembly used in several product families the situation and actions we took are described in
            detail in the sustainable services and products section of this report we have a comprehensive
            process in place for tracking customer concerns and other field events all customer issues such as
            incidents involving component failures and other potential safety concerns are investigated
            carefully to determine the root cause as well as monitored to discover trends corrective actions
            are implemented as necessary

            with the designers in our labs to test and continually improve the usability of new products


            machine emissions
            consistent with the worlds most stringent ecolabels we design products to control emissions of
            chemicals and noise as a result current products have achieved chemical emission levels that are
            well below global regulatory requirements  often at or near the detection limit of our
            measurement equipment  and are considered to have a negligible impact on customers work
            environments we publish emissions data on each products product safety data sheet

            cybersecurity
            cyber attacks pose a threat to our customers our employees and our partners  in short our very
            business thats why were always on the alert working to stop hackers who would deface our
            website or gain access to sensitive information we have comprehensive plans to deal with
            sophisticated threats such as organized cyber criminals cyberespionage groups and even state
            sponsored intrusion


            our cybersecurity strategy has five major components


            datacentric protection
            we use data segregation encryption and datalossprevention technologies to ensure safe and
            secure processing and sharing of critical information in addition all data is classified according to
            its sensitivity this data classification process enables us to understand the relative importance of
            securing each dataset and to make an informed business decision about the level and allocation
            of resources required


            standardsbased management
            by following industrystandard cybersecurity guidelines we ensure our processes are repeatable
            predictable and easily understandable


            of the numerous cybersecurity control frameworks we chose to implement both iso 27000 and
            the national institute of standards  technology cybersecurity framework


                 iso 27000 information security management system  this international standard defines
                 requirements for establishing implementing maintaining and continually improving an
                 information security management system we incorporate iso 27000 as a normal part of
                 our business processes independent auditors have certified many of our systems and data
                 centers as iso 27000compliant
                 national institute of standards  technology cybersecurity framework  created through
                 collaboration between industry and government this framework protects networks and
                 infrastructure the prioritized flexible and scalable approach helps us manage cybersecurity
                 related risk in a costeffective manner while this framework is relatively new to xerox it has
                 already proven useful to predict detect disrupt or deter respond and recover valuable data

            capability maturity assessments performed by independent parties and benchmarking with other
            companies find our implementation to be sound relevant and aligned with industry standards


            continuous assessment
            we utilize a combination of evidencebased assessments vulnerability scanning and penetration
            tests to validate that our data protection is effective and to ensure controls are operating properly
            on an ongoing basis




                                                                                                                      101147

            cybersecurity incident response
            we have emergency response procedures in place throughout our business if we were to identify
            an attempted cybersecurity attack we would take the following actions


                 identify whom to notify internally
                 establish a multidiscipline virtual response team
                 implement monitoring protocols and egress prevention
                 estimate the extent of the compromise
                 coordinate with legal counsel and insurance carriers
                 if necessary notify legal authorities

            these steps provide a general framework business units have detailed plans tailored to their
            needs we perform tests to assess our operational and managerial readiness on a regular basis


            cyber risk management
            recent highprofile breaches demonstrate that any organization can suffer a cyber attack when
            this occurs there may be costly consequences  such as regulatory fines or purchasing identity
            theft monitoring for affected parties many companies invest in errors  omissions or cyber
            liability insurance to mitigate this risk


            many insurance carriers and underwriters assess the level of risk when determining insurance rates
            xerox as well as other companies has received reduced premiums andor more favorable policy
            limits by implementing effective cybersecurity management


            cybersecurity is not solely the responsibility of the it department by collaborating across our
            company we effectively manage risk reduce the likelihood and limit the impact of exposure and
            enable quick recovery from any attack on our infrastructure networks and systems




                                                                                                                  102147

            anticorruption
            xerox operates an active and comprehensive antibribery and anticorruption program that
            complies with all related laws and regulations we have developed a global compliance program
            supported by policy and training to ensure zero tolerance for the giving or offering of a bribe of
            any amount or value including socalled facilitation payments the program also includes risk
            assessment of thirdparty intermediaries followed by the application of appropriate due diligence
            training and certification prior to engagement we are committed to enhancing the program
            continually


            banknote anticounterfeiting
            the risk of banknote counterfeiting has increased with the quality of digital imaging tools and
            color printing technology in response we have joined other companies the us secret service and
            the central bank counterfeit deterrence group a consortium of 32 central banks and note
            printing authorities to assess threats to currency and support the use of anticounterfeiting
            technologies technology to deter the use of digital equipment for counterfeiting banknotes is
            being standardized xerox sales and service employees are trained to respond to inquiries about
            our anticounterfeiting efforts


            black market supplies
            every year the global imaging industry  and the customers who use its products and services 
            suffer the loss of millions of dollars due to counterfeiting or theft of supplies we continually
            remind our customers that counterfeit supplies can result in poor equipment performance low
            supply yields inferior print quality toner leakage increased failure rates and equipment downtime
             all of which can cost time and money to avoid this risk we advise our customers to purchase
            solely from xerox authorized resellers we work closely with our procurement department to call
            attention to blending of supplies  the mixing of counterfeit with original materials to achieve
            lower pricing and make detection of counterfeit items more difficult


            theft of customer supplies represents an increasingly costly problem for xerox and its customers
            it is difficult to prevent because webbased sales channels make it easy to purchase stolen
            products and to sell them once they are stolen we continue to invest in technology and resources

                                                                                                                   110147

            to bring the problem to the attention of customers and to identify their obligation to maintain the
            security of supplies contracted and purchases through engagement and support of our
            customers and local law enforcement agencies we also provide tracing of stolen goods to identify
            and close the sources of theft

            and in collaboration with other original equipment manufacturers oems to combat acts of
            piracy and fraud our security team routinely works with the us federal bureau of investigation

            supplier code of conduct
            our supplier code of conduct and compliance program are the primary tools we use to ensure
            ethical management in our supply chain


            in 2006 we began working with the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc whose code
            of conduct sets industry standards on social environmental and ethical issues in the electronics
            industry supply chain in 2008 we became an official member of the eicc we have adopted the
            eicc code of conduct as our supplier code of conduct and xerox serves on the eicc senior
            executive advisory council


            we continually reinforce the importance of the supplier code of conduct to our supplier base we
            incorporate standards from the supplier code of conduct in purchase agreements we run a risk
            assessment and require suppliers to participate in the xerox compliance program finally we send
            an annual communication to our entire supplier base


            the xerox compliance program upholds our supplier code of conduct the following are
            components of the compliance program


                 all suppliers are subject to an initial risk assessment which is based on objective criteria
                 suppliers flagged in the risk assessment  in addition to suppliers deemed critical to our
                 supply chain  are required to complete detailed questionnaires in addition to highlighting
                 areas of potential concern these questionnaires clarify our expectations and reinforce the
                 importance of these topics
                 based on the assessments and questionnaires we annually select suppliers for compliance
                 review or audit
                 trained xerox personnel conduct audits onsite audits and compliance reviews both follow
                 the eicc audit format which addresses labor practices freedom of association child labor
                 and forced labor human rights environmental concerns and more
                 during the audit we classify areas of nonconformance as priority major minor or for
                 review we provide each supplier with a written performance assessment

            in 2014 we conducted 31 audits and 41 compliance reviews representing 30 percent and 46

            reducing emissions by reducing employee air travel
            business travel plays a big role in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions in
            recent years weve promoted videoconferencing and other technology as
            environmentally friendly alternatives to air travel thanks to these efforts weve
            reduced emissions due to air travel by 20 percent per employee for several years
            from 2013 to 2014 emissions went up slightly due to increased business
            requirements

            addressing employee inquiries
            a xerox proprietary webbased pollingroutingreporting system links employee
            inquiries or comments through the intranet with appropriate xerox contacts to
            identify and track any comment suggestion or unresolved problem for action

            the chart below displays the number of employee inquiries we received and routed
            for resolution the decline in inquiries in recent years is due to the overall resolution
            of systemic issues and the ability for employees to provide commentssuggestions or
            raise a technical issue
