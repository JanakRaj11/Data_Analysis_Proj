          materiality

eisais corporate philosophy is to give first thought to patients and their families and increase the benefits that health care provides
them likewise eisai provides employees who are the bearer of the patient contribution with opportunities to develop careers and
talent eisais mission is to increase the benefit for the patients then revenue and profit are brought about consequently we put
emphasis on this order of mission and the results
   on the other hand in order to sustain corporate value maximization to fulfil every stakeholders satisfaction with the corporate
philosophys concept of mission and the results in consideration it is regarded to be efficient to focus on the longterm investor
a beneficiary of residual income as the important stakeholder1 longterm interests of all stakeholders including patients and
employees taken into account it is believed that identifying the concerns which relate to the interests of longterm investor and
then taking initiatives on a priority basis is the fast track for the maximization of corporate value
   process for establishing materiality and eisais materiality matrix are shown below reviews and updates are undertaken as
needed

eisais hhc is different from corporate social responsibility csr which mainly involves social contribution activities
including acts of charity that do not directly contribute to business or corporate value it is relatively close to creating
shared value csv a business model that aims to pursue both social value and economic value eisais mission is to
create social value by enhancing patient satisfaction and economic value in the form of revenue and profit is generated
as a result eisai places importance on this sequence of placing the mission before the ensuring results

overview of socialization with patients program in japan in which members of public
relations pr and investor relations ir departments participated

eight members of visited jasmin ogi adachiku tokyo a residential complex for the elderly with smallscale and multifunctional
home care and services and implemented socialization the facility offers support and functional training for daily life in a homelike
environment as well as interactions with local people so that its users can remain as independent as possible each member who
participated in the program spent time with dementia patients and learned about their feelings


understanding of the reality of patients by pr and ir department members

we learned that dementia patients have very strong motivation of
dementia patients to communicate with others even though we met
for the first time the patients shared many stories with us about their
experiences in their youth families health and more
   they also seemed to be very worried and conflicted at times some
of them forgot what they had said only a few minutes earlier they had
difficulty finding the appropriate words and looked confused on such
occasions we talked to them and nodded with a smile this helped them
feel relieved and continue with their stories deep inside the patients wish
to stay connected to the society and to be needed and recognized by
others this is a common feeling that we all have
   some patients apparently tried to conceal their memory problem
but by fully accepting them as they are we saw many smiles on their
faces they are afraid of becoming more incapable of doing what they
had once taken for granted such as finding appropriate words while speaking at the same time they want to stay as they really are
                                                                  being exposed to these feelings we sensed the personality of dementia
                                                                  patients making someone else smile also makes you smile the patients
                                                                  looked shy when they were praised by the staff of the facility seeing this
                                                                  renewed our understanding of the importance of helping the patients get
                                                                  out of isolation and stay in a caring community where they can find other
                                                                  persons to spend time with and to live peacefully while feeling secure
                                                                     in addition to the socialization with patients program mr baba the

                                                                  surrounding dementia patients and changes in the systems relating to
                                                                  nursing care we deepened our understanding of the problems facing
                                                                  the practice of health care and nursing care we then shared with
                                                                  one another the feelings we got from the program and carried out
                                                                  externalization and combination

of the importance of closely considering patients feelings in the years ahead the pr and ir departments will seriously endeavor to
communicate benefit of eisais pharmaceuticals and solutions to patients in an easytounderstand manner


                                                                       24

sustainable corporate value creation

in the cfo policy i have placed mediumtolongterm roe management on the center line of corporate value creation
   under the dupont method roe can be analyzed by three elements consisting of margin ratio of profit to revenue
turnover total asset turnover ratio and financial leverage eisai is focusing on optimizing each of these three elements
   to increase margins eisai will focus on expanding highprofit global brands discovered and developed inhouse such
as lenvima halaven and fycompa eisai will also strive to improve margin by emphasizing selection and concentration for
priority projects and utilizing partnerships
   to improve turnover eisai will manage the cash conversion cycle ccc to control working capital and strive to improve
asset efficiency through steps including selling assets encompassing investment securities and streamlining inventory
   in using financial leverage eisai will pursue an optimal capital structure while maintaining financial integrity
   for maintaining a single a level credit rating we have set the kpis of net der of 003 a ratio of equity attributable
to owners of the parent of 5060 and net debtebitda of 03 years by undertaking business activities based
on financial discipline we are steadily reducing interestbearing debt and we secured net cash as of the end of fiscal 2016
for the first time in approximately nine years net der was negative 005 the ratio of equity attributable to owners of the
parent was 57 and net debtebitda was negative 031 years based on the view that we have secured sufficient financial
integrity we believe we can resume our leverage strategies at the end of fiscal 2016 we possessed investment securities in
the amount of 363 billion and broaderbased net cash which includes investment securities stood at 636 billion and net
der was negative 011
   through the above initiatives we will pursue sustainable roe on a mediumtolongterm 10year average basis rather
than focus on shorttermism
   this cfo policy of roe management is based on the corporate philosophy hhc and enlightened value maximization
theory michael c jansen 2001



 vcic valuecreative investment criteria
investments will become even more important for companies to achieve growth for this reason eisai has determined value
creative investment criteria vcic to ensure its strategic investments create shareholder value when making investments
we use net present value npv and the internal rate of return irr spread using a riskadjusted hurdle rate as kpis in
principle we naturally select only those investments with a positive npv and set a certain spread for irr to assure value
creation in setting hurdle rates we factor in all risk elements such as the particular investment project the investee country
and liquidity we have approximately 200 types of hurdle rates and apply the riskadjusted hurdle rate appropriate for each
respective investment project

 dividend policy
eisai returns profits to all shareholders in a stable and sustainable manner based on factors such as a healthy
balance sheet and comprehensive consideration of consolidated financial results dividend on equity doe ratio of equity
attributable to owners of the parent and free cash flow as well as consideration of the signaling effect we strive for an optimal
dividend policy based on an optimal capital structure that depends on longterm balance sheet management rather than
a dividend payout ratio based on shortterm performance as a kpi for dividends from the perspective of balance sheet
management eisai has adopted doe which indicates the ratio of dividends to consolidated net assets


                                                                28

in principle eisai strives to maintain dividends within the range of free cash flow at a multiyear level as kpis for maintaining
a healthy balance sheet eisai has set the targets of net der of 003 equity attributable to owners of the parent of 50
60 and net debtebitda of 03 years based on these policies eisai is maintaining a healthy balance sheet under present
conditions and therefore plans to maintain dividends of 150 yen1 per share in fiscal 2017 which is an expectation of
numerous shareholders2 with an intention of protecting shareholder value acquisition of treasury stock will be carried out
appropriately after factors such as the market environment and capital efficiency roe are taken into account

 eisais funding policy
eisais funding policy is based on the pecking order theory it defines the priority order of funding as follows cash on hand
comes first then the second is funding by debt and funding by new equity is the last option as an efficient funding
measure eisai adopts a global cash management system gcms for the effective cash utilization among group companies
therefore we consider cash on hand and debt come out on top and equity financing which could damage existing

and financial capital to create sustainable corporate value besides its financial capital eisai also works to enhance
nonfinancial capital

eisais pbr has generally been above 2 during the past 10 years and recently has been maintained at slightly
above or below 3 this means that the assessment of eisais market value has significantly exceeded its net
assets book value on accounting basis
  based on the assumption that shareholder value equals longterm total market capitalization and also equals book
value of shareholders equity bv plus mva eisais present financial capital is equivalent to bv while its nonfinancial
capital consisting of intellectual capital human capital manufactured capital social and relationship capital and natural
capital is related to mva the portion that exceeds pbr of 1 these are also called future financial capital nonfinancial
capital which becomes mva is sort of a selfcreated goodwill that cannot be recorded by accounting and can also
be considered as intangibles invisible value that should be created by the effort of the management this is called
the iircpbr model
  from the perspective of the latest pbr eisais selfcreated goodwill is earning high acclaim centering on esg
nonetheless we recognize that we must further enhance this value with efforts focused on the rd pipeline

first under the ①intrinsic value model market value added mva is defined as esgcsr1 value cost of capital
reduction effects customer value human value and organizational value
   in contrast to this the aforementioned ②iircpbr model explains the relevance of six capitals under the iirc
framework by positioning book value of shareholders equity bv as financial capital and relating mva to nonfinancial
capital consisting of intellectual capital human capital manufactured capital social and relationship capital and natural
capital based on the assumption that shareholder value equals longterm total market capitalization and also equals
book value of shareholders equity bv plus mva
   from the ③residual income model rim it is thought that mva converges in the total present value of equity spread
therefore it can be considered that future financial value creation based on equity spread over the long term does not
conflict with nonfinancial capital value such as esg and mva creation and is not mutually contradictory and can be
synchronized
   in conjunction with the nonfinancial capital and equity spread value relevance model the intrinsic value model
which relates nonfinancial capital to mva the iircpbr model and the residual income model rim which implicates
the relation between mva and equity spread are mutually complementary through the creation of mva also there are
many publicized academic research papers that prove the positive correlation between pbr and roe and the non
financial capital that substantiates this model

enhancing nonfinancial capital leads to corporate value creation through an improvement in roc return on capital

eisai inputs the six capitals that include nonfinancial capital and aims to create two outputs namely the provision of
solutions and development of new drugs mainly in the neurology area and oncology area
  in undertaking our business based on the corporate philosophy hhc we have strengthened initiatives toward esg
which is nonfinancial value additionally we strive to create outcomes such as fulfilling patient needs for prevention
cure and care as well as to make contributions to local communities by providing security and safety we believe these
outcomes will lead to the elimination of gaps that hinder the enjoyment of highquality medical treatment and care and
also contribute to the attainment of the sustainable development goals sdgs advocated by the united nations
  enhancing nonfinancial capital that depends on the corporate philosophy hhc will lead to highlevel output and the
realization of outcomes and will ultimately result in an improvement in financial and nonfinancial roc furthermore
as cfo i believe that these activities will lead to an improvement of roe as financial capital by a deferred
effect over the longterm which will eventually converge with an improvement of pbr a proxy indicator for
shareholder value and lead to the creation of sustainable corporate value

promoting engagement that emphasizes our premium total of approximately 700 dialogues per year

as cfo i believe that promoting an understanding of our nonfinancial information is essential for realizing the objectives
of our engagement which is to have our corporate value assessed from the perspective of mediumtolongterm
corporate value creation this nonfinancial information covers areas such as intellectual capital centering on our pipeline
and patents human capital that handles our operations our initiatives for improving access to medicines and our
corporate governance to attain this objective eisais ir team holds a total of approximately 700 dialogues with investors
and analysts on an annual basis among these cfo holds approximately 200 interviews including with overseas
investors every year the cfo and ir team strive to reduce cost of equity and are committed to promoting engagement
based on the idea of ir is not a cost center and contributes to corporate value creation regarding this point in a
report issued by smbc nikko securities inc senior analyst yasuhiro nakazawa on june 19 2014 eisais per was
noted as being more than 10 above the industry average the report referred to this as an ir premium and attributed it
to investors high regard of eisais clear capital policy and adept ir activities
  in promoting engagement we will hold discussions on sophisticated financial theories and capital policies such as
cost of equity and optimal capital structure likewise at the engagement in addition to pipeline as nonfinancial capital
we will actively emphasize the discussion point of value correlation between esg and capital productivity as cfo i will
pursue further synchronization model of nonfinancial capital and corporate value supported by experimental research
and aim for sustainable longterm shareholder value creation by repeatedly promoting engagement based on our
corporate philosophy hhc

a  cheung our greatest strength is that we possess                                               activities in the dementia area and this is one of our greatest
industryleading pipeline in the dementia area in collaboration                                  strengths one reason in general for the low success rate of

    6 ricchi and ongoing projects in neurology area
    a diverse range of ongoing projects in the area of dementia




 ricchi 1    early and minimallyinvasive diagnostics
pet positron emission tomography imaging and measurements using cerebrospinal fluid are utilized to detect the
accumulation of beta amyloid aβ for early diagnosis of dementia as major challenges the number of facilities with pet
imaging available is limited and cerebrospinal fluid must be drawn by inserting a needle into the spinal cord cavity of the
hip which places a large burden on patients eisai is therefore undertaking various projects for developing methods for
early detection of dementia such as by using blood biomarkers that reduce the burden on patients


 main ongoing project
 collaboration with sysmex corporation blood diagnosis
 we are utilizing sysmex corporations superresolution fluorescence microscope and attempting to identify brain
 derived soluble aβ aggregates in the blood currently eisais accumulated clinical trial samples are being used to
 examine the possibility of utilizing the measurement of uniquely structured aβ aggregates for diagnosing dementia

 ricchi 4     neuroinflammation and immunogenetics
glial cells in the brain and spinal cord play an important role in maintaining                    neuron interference by reactive glial cells
homeostasis by regulating immune functions and replenishing nutrients in the
central nervous system when activated in pathological conditions they move to
the disease site and attempt to devour damaged cells and extracellular proteins
such as aβ however if they maintain this activated state for a long period of
time they become reactive glial cells that release excessive inflammatory factors
which are thought to interfere with neurons this process is thought to be one of
the causes of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimers disease in fact
genomewide association study gwas on alzheimers disease has revealed
genetic risks reported to have mechanisms associated with neuroinflammation
eisai is focusing on projects related to reactive glial cells for the creation of
treatment in dementia area


 main ongoing project
 antifractalkine antibody e6011
 antifractalkine antibody e6011 is currently being developed for rheumatoid arthritis and
 inflammatory bowel disease and expanding its indications to include alzheimers disease is
 under consideration e6011 binds with fractalkine a chemokine that is induced on vascular
 endothelial cells during inflammation and by suppressing either the inflammation or the
 immune cell activity prevents reactive glial cells from interfering with neurons




 ricchi 5     synapse microenvironment
the tip of a neuron is called a synapse and has a swelled nodular               synapse microenvironment
shape synapses do not appress adjacent neurons and this slight
gap between neurons is called a synaptic gap in a synaptic
gap an electric signal is changed into a chemical substance
a neurotransmitter that transmits information to the next
neuron when an electric signal is transmitted to the synapse
a neurotransmitter from the synapse vesicle is secreted in the
synaptic gap and binds with a receptor in the cell membrane
of the next neuron an electric signal impulse then occurs and
information is transmitted to the next neuron in dementia patients
accumulation of abnormal proteins such as aβ and overreactions
of neuroinflammation interfere with the synapses which leads to
loss of synapses and death of neurons
   eisai is working on projects to revitalize neurons by improving
the synapse microenvironment and restoring synapse function
in this way through the reactivation of residual functions we are
aiming to cure alzheimers disease and prevent neuron death


 main ongoing project
 epha4 synapse modulator
 as one approach we are investigating the development of an alzheimers disease treatment that works by inducing stabilization of the
 synapses through enhancing cleavage of epha4 a protein which regulates maintenance and formation of synapse it is thought that the
 severed epha4s cterminal fragments play an important role in maintenance of synapses in fact there have been reports of reduced
 epha4 cleavage observed in alzheimers disease patients



 ricchi 6     neuronal regeneration
the brain is composed of neurons glial cells and blood vessels glial cells account for the largest part of all brain cells in
humans while astrocytes account for the largest number of cells in the cerebral cortex in the same manner as neurons
astrocytes receive neurotransmitters in the synapses that are the points of contact between neurons and then release
various neurotransmitters and this process is believed to regulate the efficiency of information transmission and influence
memory and learning
  while other companies and academics are attempting to treat neurodegenerative disease through neuron transplants
eisai has set its sights on astrocytes and is focusing on maintenance of brain durability in this field eisai is working on
projects to develop next generation treatment methods

what is dementia
dementia is a condition characterized by the occurrence of a variety of disorders and the emergence of impediments
to everyday life due to the death of brain cells and a worsening of cognitive functions resulting from various causes
there are different types of dementia symptoms of alzheimers the most prevalent dementia are mainly those related
to memory impairment core symptom while behavioral and psychological symptoms bpsd such as delusions and
hallucinations violence wandering and depression can also be observed other types of the disease include dementia
with lewy bodies and vascular dementia among others all of these are characteristically progressive


medicine creation targeting the accumulation of aggressive factors
marketed treatments for alzheimers disease ad including eisais aricept are designed to delay the progression of the
disease unmet medical needs for dementia treatment still remain high eisai currently collaborates with biogen inc a
pharmaceutical company focused on neurodegenerative diseases in developing next generation agents targeting beta
amyloid aβ and tau the socalled causal substances of ad
  ad is associated with the occurrence of neuronal cell death as a result of the gradual accumulation of proteins in
the brain called aβ from long before the onset of symptoms such as memory impairment the accumulation of
aβ is considered to accelerate the tau pathology and might be the cause of neuronal cell death resulting from the
accumulation of tau the accumulation of aggressive factors such as aβ and tau is considered to be the potential target
of ad treatment

for a long time reactive glial cells eisai is conducting a drug discovery study for e6011 targeted at reactive glial cells
   in recent years the occurrence of transformation of symptoms over time has become increasingly known it starts
as a sleep disorder 10 to 20 years before the diagnosis of dementia followed by behavioral disorder then cognitive
impairment in that order possible forms of sleep disorders beside basic ones include rem sleep behavior disorder rbd
and irregular sleepwake rhythm disorder iswrd among others rbd and iswrd are considered to be closely related
to dementia depression epilepsy anxiety dysosmia and other forms of behavioral disorders are considered to follow
sleep disorders due to the accumulation of aβ
   the brain has a mechanism for protection it is a known fact that protective genes and positive environmental factors
function to maintain homeostasis reported protective mechanisms include a function for phagocytizing and eliminating
aβ and other foreign matter that occurs within the brain a function for healing damaged nerve cells and a function
for facilitating the regeneration of nerve cells through the differentiation of neural stem cells among others this brain
maintenance system may be the new target of drug discovery aimed at curing dementia
   eisai considers that the future efforts to develop dementia treatments should focus on the process of accumulation
of aggressive factors such as aβ tau and reactive glial cells the transformation of symptoms over time that occurs
in the order of sleep disorder behavioral disorder and cognitive impairment and the brain maintenance system

it is known that sleep facilitates the excretion of aβ from the brain a sleep disorder may also accelerate the accumulation
of aβ and potentially lead to ad eisai is conducting clinical studies with lemborexant an antagonist to dual orexin
receptors which are involved in the regulation of sleep and awakening two phase ⅲ studies on insomnia disorder and a
phase ⅱ study on irregular sleepwake rhythm disorder iswrd associated with alzheimers disease dementia
    after the sleep disorder a behavioral disorder may occur in such forms as depression epilepsy anxiety and dysosmia
in relation to the accumulation of aβ and tau inhibiting these disorders might delay the onset of dementia eisai also
develops new drugs for epilepsy and other neurological disorders for example e2082 is a next generation ampa
receptor antagonist and e2730 has a novel mechanism of action furthermore eisai develops e2027 a pde9 inhibitor
against behavioral disorders and cognitive impairment due to dementia with lewy bodiesdementia eisai also conducts
a study for drug discovery targeting epha4 which concerns synapse stabilization


medicine creation targeting at brain maintenance system
it is a known fact that the brain has many protective mechanisms to maintain robustness the brain consists of
nerve cells glial cells and blood vessels glial cells function to facilitate the survival of nerve cells and to maintain and
metabolically support the intracerebral environment glial cells are said to be nearly 10 to 50 times larger than nerve cells
in quantity and occupy the largest part of cells in the human brain
    astrocyte the most common type of glial cell is known to receive neurotransmitters and release different transmitters
as nerve cells do astrocyte is also considered to structurally support the brain and acts as a mechanism for stimulating
neural transmission and nourishment
    microglia a type of glial cell is known as the cell with an immunity function in the nerve center in a normal state it
monitors the surrounding environment while moving the slender process when it is activated in a pathological condition
it moves to the disease site and plays roles such as phagocytizing damaged cells and extracellular proteins such as aβ
    the brain maintainance system supported by these protective mechanisms can be considered an important new target
of drug discovery aimed at the curing of dementia


eisais resources based on the maximum use of experience and knowledge toward
development of dementia treatments
it is considered that achieving the primary endpoint in a clinical study requires the satisfaction of four elements such
as the right drug discovery target right patients right dosage and right clinical evaluation indicators targeting aβ is

     eisais initiatives in dementia area extend beyond merely providing pharmaceuticals eisai also
     undertakes a variety of activities for solving issues faced by patients and the community and for building
     a foundation for a society that coexists with dementia in this section we introduce some of those
     specific activities


a 20year journey with aricept  enhancing recognition of dementia in the world

eisai launched the inhouse developed dementia treatment                          spread of simple diagnostic methods such as mmse that is
aricept in 1999 the introduction of aricept as japans first                     more suitable for the practical clinical stage
alzheimers disease treatment provided patients and their                            in 2000 eisai launched japan academy for alzheimers
families with great hope in the following section dr kazuo                     disease together with doctors this was set up in order to
hasegawa director emeritus at the tokyo dementia care                            promote discussions about various issues regarding dementia
research and training center describes the differences                           among medical specialists and primary doctors that transcend
between the situation today and the times prior to the launch                     fields of medical care and to support a proper paradigm shift
of aricept when there were no treatments for dementia                            this academy which was attended by 300 people at the first
                                                                                  session is now attended by approximately 1500 doctors each
 donepezil was a ray of light in the darkness                                  year
 during my practicing days doctors had no available treatments for
 alzheimers disease even when the disease was diagnosed at an early                 these types of initiatives have produced positive results and
 stage because of this doctors would express their regrets to patients          have helped significantly increase the awareness of dementia
 and their families with a sense of powerlessness and futility there are         throughout the world dr shigeki kuzuhara professor
 now clinical studies where donepezil can be administered and this is
 providing patients their families as well as doctors with a sense of            emeritus at mie university describes these changes below
 hopeful fulfillment this hopefulness is one of the major differences
 from the feeling of powerlessness that i recall from the past
                                                                                    for me the most notable and greaterthanexpected effect of aricept
                                               dr kazuo hasegawa 2009            in japanese society was the major change it spurred in the approach
        director emeritustokyo dementia care research and training center          and awareness in dealing with dementia prior to the launch of aricept
                                                                                    dementia was regarded as a symptom of aging there was little
                                                                                    awareness that this was a disease needing therapeutic intervention
   back then however dementia was still described in japan                        the arrival of aricept transformed this awareness i believe this
as senility and the understanding of this disease and its                        was a major turning point that led to efforts to overcome dementia
                                                                                    with the involvement of not just medical practitioners patients and
diagnostic methods had not adequately spread throughout                             caregivers but also with the participation of all citizens in japan the
society eisai was acutely aware that the environment                               limitations of drug therapy with aricept were also clearly demonstrated
surrounding dementia patients would never change just by                            at the same time and this helped promote a wide acceptance of the

discovery of a natural product with antitumor properties
called halichondrin b which was extracted from a marine
sponge called halichondria okadai however halichondrin                    extremely powerful antitumor activities and this discovery
b could only be obtained from the sponge in small amounts                  lead to the creation of halaven at the eisai research
so in order to provide a stable supply of a drug made from                  institute in andover the total synthesis process of halaven
this class of compound it was determined that an important                 was established consisting of over 60 steps and this led
milestone would be achieving total synthesis of the natural                 to halavens regulatory approval this medicine creation
product and finding a structurally simple analog for these                 process was an unprecedented series of challenges for us
two points professor yoshito kishis research group at                     but that is precisely why we can say that the creation of
harvard university played a decisive role through joint                    halaven was a result of the passion and brilliance of eisai
research by kishis laboratory and eisai it was determined                 researchers
that the right half of the halichondrin analog exhibited

on the creation of vegf  vascular endothelial growth                               lenvima we would like to increase the number of late clinical
factor pathway inhibitors rather their design concept                            stage projects we have several promising next generation
was to look at the entire tumor angiogenesis process and                           projects which we feel have potential equal to that of
by inhibiting it produce life extending effects in vivo as a                      halaven and lenvima these are currently in phaseⅰstudies
result lenvima has a unique mechanism of action which                              or in preparation to enter phaseⅰ and we will continue to

   eisai is currently developing an adc namely                              of progression free survival against the comparator
morab202 which combines the antibody drug                                  and we think that there is sufficient evidence that it will
farletuzumab developed with the antibody technology                         be competitive but because lenvima was granted the
of our subsidiary morphotek inc and eribulin                               breakthrough therapy and priority review designation from
halaven a masterpiece of modern organic synthetic                         the fda and approved for this indication based on the
chemistry with a novel mechanism of action that                              results of the phase ⅱ study there are few doctors with

chemotherapeutic agent which demonstrated the extension                      therapy is low we are currently strengthening measures
of overall survival os as monotherapy in largescale clinical              to counter these problems first we would like to improve
studies for the treatment of refractory breast cancer and soft               the prescription ratio among patients for which other
tissue sarcoma and its usage as payload is thought to be                    treatments have not produced sufficient results to that end
extremely useful morab202s nonclinical data suggests                     it is important to not only raise our share of voice but also
excellent efficacy and safety profiles with dosage of only                   to collaborate with medical and access organizations and
one fifth of that of halaven so we have great expectations                  to create real world evidence additionally we can expect

    intellectual property strategies



protection and reinforcement of intellectual property

the legal protection and effective utilization of products and technologies we develop are essential for the sustained growth and
advancement of eisai and for eisai to continue to provide a stable supply of pharmaceuticals to patients therefore we pursue a
number of strategic intellectual property activities and strategies related to our product portfolio and product creation operations

1 intellectual property activities
the intellectual property department has stationed persons responsible for intellectual property at eisais rd facilities around
the world and conducts activities globally relating to patents trademarks designs and copyrights while working closely with
each group of the rd department furthermore the filing of patent applications acquisition of rights and prior art searches are
carried out through close collaboration with rd and business divisions in addition when eisai introduces new technologies and
promising new candidate compounds it cooperates with relevant organizations and emphasizes the steadfast protection of patent
rights while ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations

2 drug creation activities and intellectual property strategies
besides exclusivity that protects prescription pharmaceutical candidate investigational compounds for discoveries such as active
ingredient applications manufacturing methods formulations and intermediates as well the intellectual property department
cooperates closely with the rd department to ensure that pharmaceutical products are properly protected after launch and
focuses on strategic patent applications and the acquisition of rights we aim for optimal patent portfolio management that also
includes screening methods and biomarker measurement in drug creation activities
   additionally eisai places high importance on patent searches of other companies in its intellectual property strategies and also
gives sufficient consideration to respecting the rights of third parties

3 contributions to licensingrelated activities
rather than simply looking to thirdparty licensing fees on patents as a revenue source we strive to create a strong patent portfolio
that will contribute to our business
   regarding the possible use of treatments for diseases occurring specifically in areas with inconvenient access to medicines we
plan to proactively outlicense our patents for neglected tropical diseases ntds in particular we are striving to conduct the most
efficient research on drug discovery by opening up our patent portfolio externally sharing goals and commitment with a wide range
of partner organizations and combining ideas technologies and knowledge

4 number of registered patents
to protect the outcome of our drug creation activities we diligently file patent      number of patent applications
applications in japan and overseas at the same time to efficiently manage
                                                                                          fiscal 2014     fiscal 2015       fiscal 2016
resources we carefully evaluate the strategic importance of each inventive
discovery and determine whether to file patents abroad and if so how many                   87              65                55
and in which country to file them

5 trademarks
eisai develops product names for all pharmaceuticals that are protected by trademark rights and implements brand strategies
throughout the world in collaboration with the marketing division

introduction of an example of our initiatives for sdgs
inclusive activities toward the elimination of lymphatic
filariasis lf at yarada village in india
in 2013 vizag plant of eisai india started production of high quality dec tablets and distribution across the globe at price
zero following an agreement with who
   at yarada a beautiful coastal village with the population of approximately 3500 people situated 30km away from vizag
plant more than 50 people were suffering from lf at the time poor health environment due to lack of awareness and
socioeconomic factors in the community were causing mosquito breeding leading to vector borne diseases including lf
when eisai staff interacted with the villagers they had learnt that not only providing medicine but also solving the root
causes of the diseases through inclusive activities with the local people was essential then various initiatives had started

approaches to infrastructure
in october 2013 eisai entered into a publicprivate partnership with the state governments
health department to support their vector borne diseases control activities at yarada village
   to improve sanitation and infrastructure eisai staff supported the antilarval operations
through ensuring regular spraying of the antilarval chemicals in the water logged areas and open
drains on the weekends eisai staff visited the village to monitor cleaning of the areas which
were conducive to mosquito breeding and also helped repair the old public toilets in a measure
to prevent further mosquito breeding mosquito repellant plants were planted near homes and              repaired pubic toilet in yarada
                                                                                                         village
open drains awareness was created among the villagers by the staff regarding precautions to
be taken against the vector borne diseases and proper disposal of waste

approaches by treatment drugs
as it was important to conduct disease awareness to let the people understand the significance of the treatment by drug in
the area where taking medicine was uncommon the disease awareness was conducted thoroughly in january 2014 over
60 eisai staff supported mass drug administraction mda program in elimination of lf at yarada eisai staff visited the village
for 3 nights before the date making announcement of mda through dandora which involves the beating of drums to invite
as many villagers to participate days after mda they visited each household to ensure that all the residents had taken the
treatment drugs

zero incidence of lf
sentinel survey was conducted in february 2017 by the state health department for screening the patients for wuchereria
bancrofti a parasitic worm which causes lf and no new cases of lf were identified in the village since the previous survey
in november 2013 now realizing that their children and grandchildrens generation will no longer suffer from lf the villagers
were feeling more positive

beyond lf sustainable growth through inclusive development
in october 2014 massive cyclone hudhud hit yarada and caused severe damage
eisai supported the educational institution zilla parishad school by restoring the
school building and donating drinking water tanks and a newly built laboratory
also it classes were offered by it technician from vizag plant restoration enabled
the students who were forced to study at school far from home to return to their
local school on december 2016 the local english paper the hindu reported
eisai staffs visit to zilla parishad school in the article the head master told that
the pass percentage of secondary school certificate exam during the last two
years had improved to 97 percent in 10th grade and several students had received memorial of reconstruction of zilla parishad
scholarships from the government                                                       school



                                            increased motivation among employees
                                            interacting with the lf patients at yarada i understood the
                                            severe condition that the patients were suffering from i am
                                            really proud of eisai for helping people from contracting such
                                            a disease every morning when i come to work i feel that i am

       corporate governance system
       our supervisory and executive functions have been clearly separated from each other for more
       than a decade in pursuit of a system that is oriented toward independence and neutrality




eisai has pursued the best corporate governance practices and has remained committed to the improvement of this governance for
the purpose of fulfilling hhc the companys corporate philosophy since june 2000 eisai has appointed directors from outside the
company and in june 2004 eisai revised its articles of incorporation at the annual general shareholders meeting and adopted
the company with committees system currently company with a nomination committee etc system at the same time the
number of outside directors has been increased to account for the majority of the board of directors this is intended to ensure the
fairness and transparency of our business management and as a consequence the management supervision function has been
strengthened
   eisai remains committed to the sustainable improvement of its corporate governance in pursuit of increasing the benefits to
stakeholders including patients customers shareholders and employees



                             adopted the company with committees system in 2004 and clearly separated its
                               management oversight functions from business execution functions
                             since 2004 more than half of eisais directors are outside directors
                             since 2005 the chair of the board of directors has been chosen from among the outside
                               directors the representative corporate officer and ceo is the only director serving
                               concurrently as a corporate officer

features of eisais corporate governance
❶clear separation of the functions between supervision of management and the execution of business
the core aspect of eisais corporate governance system is the clear separation of the supervision of management and
the execution of business through which maximum benefit is obtained from eisais status as a company with a
nomination committee etc system eisai has established that the chair of board of directors be an outside director
and that the ceo is the only director serving concurrently as a corporate officer to achieve this goal
the board of directors is able to devote its attention to management by entrusting a large portion of decisionmaking authority to
corporate officers this enables corporate officers to increase the effectiveness and flexibility of business execution and to enhance
the dynamics of management as well as ensuring autonomy by establishing internal controls
the corporate officers fulfill their accountability by making reports to the board of directors on the status of the execution of their
assigned activities both quarterly and upon request based on the reports from the corporate officers the board of directors
keeps uptodate on matters such as the progress of our business plans the current status and issues of our operations labor
management occupational health and safety efforts for environmental protection and the status of efforts to meet compliance
requirements such as the prevention of corrupt acts and bribery in this way the board supervises the execution of operations
under this system along with checking the status of execution of operations the board of directors also inspects the status of
internal controls such as business execution and decisionmaking processes from the perspective of shareholders and society

❷ensuring the independence and neutrality of outside directors
the presence of seven independent and neutral outside directors who account for the majority of the members of the
board of directors supports the effective operation of eisais corporate governance system eisais nomination committee is
composed exclusively of outside directors the nomination committee strictly applies the requirements for the independence
and neutrality of outside directors stipulated by the committee for the selection of candidates for outside directors

                                                                           with a 10year vision and numerical targets for every five years

                                                                           within the company about the validity of a 10year mediumterm

q  what was the background that led you to the                           wrong to say that we dont know what will happen in 10 years
    appointment as an outside director at eisai                           i was surprised to see that he had taken the opinion of an
                                                                           outside director so seriously that he had gone to talk to
a  i do not really know the background i wasnt closely                  frontline staff about it as well
involved with eisai so when the company contacted me i
was puzzled and wondered what on earth it could be about
i exchanged business cards with ceo naito for the first time              q  what is your impression of eisais employees
when the company had already decided to appoint me as an                       and corporate philosophy
outside director i was genuinely surprised by the whole process
i think my fellow outside directors felt the same                         a  a medical representative for fycompa once said to me
    in general when most companies are appointing an outside              it improves symptoms for epilepsy patients so much that ive
director i imagine someone in management will say something               actually had patients and doctors thanking me i was honestly
like i know someone who is reliable so we should just check              jealous of having that opportunity to be thanked by customers i
that there are no issues with independence or neutrality that is         have also heard a researcher with a real sense of responsibility
certainly not the case at eisai eisai starts by narrowing down a          saying a relative died from cancer so that made me determined
list of candidates whose independence and neutrality is assured           to create new drugs i feel that eisais employees do a
then the nomination committee consist exclusively of outside               rewarding job in a wonderful environment thats something
directors selects a new outside director with the aim of striking a        i hope employees themselves appreciate
balance for example across areas of expertise it may be risky               having visited a group home and seen eisais patient
from the ceo or the executing divisions point of view as                 socialization program in action it really felt like the
they do not directly involve in the process and it requires a             corporate philosophy has established itself to a large
certain amount of courage i would say that this process truly             extent i think this is due to ceo naitos many years at the
reflects eisais commitment to governance                                 helm of eisai and his determination to establish its corporate
                                                                           philosophy the ability of top management to take the initiative
                                                                           and disseminate the corporate philosophy across to those
q  what is your impression of how the eisai board                        on the frontline is a key factor in determining the companys
    of directors is run have you encountered any                          sustainability
    issues

a  eisai operates the plandocheckact pdca cycle very
effectively i have a real sense from board meetings that
outside directors opinions are taken very seriously by the
executing divisions if an outside director raise a question the
executing division provides a detailed explanation in a sincere
manner additional meetings can be held to provide more
detailed explanations if requested likewise new agendas can
be added for board meetings as a result of new issues identified
by the board i think this is possible due to the follow up for the
executing division by the experienced members of the board of
directors secretariat from the perspectives of outside directors
   the only issues i have encountered have been minor technical            interviewer yasukazu kanamori executive director investor
ones such as the presentation and readability of documents               relations

relationship with the labor union

since the establishment of eisai co ltd employees have been considered the most valuable asset to this end and to ensure
that employees feel at ease of devoting themselves to their daily work duties eisai co ltd has been working to maintain a fair and
healthy relationship with its labor union based on mutual trust and understanding and to build a good working environment
   in recent years talks between labor and management led to a common understanding that the governmentled reforms of working
style should be seriously considered and that eisai co ltd must set about changing the awareness of workers and exploring
new plans without delay to this end eisai continues to improve its working environment for instance by correcting the practice
of long working hours and introducing a system to allow employees who have to take care of family members to have one work
athome day on a weekly basis based on a healthy relationship between labor and management and by respecting each others
circumstances eisai co ltd and its labor union work as one to achieve the common goal of ensuring the happiness of employees

corporate activities with respect for human dignity and the highest priority placed on safety and health the policies stipulate a code
of conduct for safety and health in seven articles and we prepare a safety and health management plan every year in accordance
with the policies sharing the fundamental principle among all employees we carry out activities to secure safety and health with the
aim of realizing a workplace which will not hurt or cause sickness to anyone
   under the industrial safety and health act committees have been established at each of eisais offices in japan with 50 employees
or more in the committees periodic discussions on occupational safety and health are held with labor union representatives
furthermore environmental safety committees have been installed at every company and in order to eliminate industrial accidents
throughout the eisai group these environmental safety committees set annual plans to further improve the quality of activities and
carry out monitoring of the results and issues of initiatives every six months in the case of any industrial accident it is obligatory to
submit a report which is then shared with all offices in order to prevent a similar accident from recurring in the future
   similarly major research and production facilities of the eisai group in and outside japan have established their own occupational
safety and health management systems and are undertaking relevant activities these sites and facilities are striving to raise the level
of occupational safety and health by appropriately operating their respective management systems and by voluntarily and continually
going through the pdca cycle furthermore risk assessments are not only carried out on new facilities and buildings but based
on the industrial safety and health act amendment in june 2016 are also carried out on positions which involve the handling of
chemical substances in cooperation with industrial physicians and health insurance associations eisai also engages in efforts to help
its employees stay in good health and grow even healthier both physically and mentally
   in fiscal 2016 we had more industrial accidents than we did in the previous year but we had significantly fewer accidents that
subsequently necessitated an absence from work efforts will continue as we seek to completely eliminate industrial accidents
 a method for continually improving management operations by repeating the plandocheckact pdca cycle

   flow of rd drug creation research
as the name literally suggests drug creation research is research into producing new drugs which can be broken down into
three stages drug discovery research drug development research and clinical research during drug discovery research
researchers employ stateof theart technology to screen for and identify highly effective compounds and also conduct basic
research using external resources the identified drug candidates then proceed to the drug development stage where researchers
lay the groundwork for filing and approval around the world by evaluating the compounds physicochemical and biological
properties assuring their quality and safety and performing process chemistry research into methods of largescale synthesis and
manufacturing drug candidates that clear development research are then elevated to the clinical research stage after three phases
of clinical trials phaseⅰ phase ⅱ and phase ⅲ drugs candidates that are approved by regulatory authorities can be launched on
the market

   patents for new drugs and generics
substance patents are used to lay claim to chemical                      less than 20 years in the field of pharmaceuticals as these
compounds until the patent term expires only the patent                products must receive regulatory approval before marketing
owner or licensee can make sell or import the chemical for              due to legal requirements for this reason it is possible to
any use without infringing the patent these patents are very            extend a patent term for up to five years in some countries
