  review by the ceo
  the energy industry is undergoing a substantial radical change that began suddenly and may
  continue for several years
  the demand for energy has decreased due to the stalling of economic growth simultaneously
  subsidized investments in renewable energy have led to an increase in the supply of electricity
  as a result the market price of electricity has decreased at the same time the costs relating to
  the production of nuclear power have increased which has undermined the profitability of nuclear
  powerproduced electricity
  currently more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in finland is generated using nuclear
  power in the future the proportion will be significantly higher nuclear powerproduced electricity
  plays an important role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and meeting of climate
  goals without nuclear power is not any plausible path to a lowcarbon society tvos olkiluoto
  nuclear power plant is in good safe production condition with large investment projects
  underway furthermore tvo keeps improving its operations in order to maintain its
  competitiveness in the challenging electricity production market environment

  stable electricity production ol3 project progressing

  in 2014 the olkiluoto nuclear power plant produced 1476 terawatthours twh of electricity achieving record production
  output for the second consecutive year thanks to modernizations implemented in accordance with the principle of
  continuous improvement and the personnels longterm competence development efforts the power plant is in excellent
  condition technically as well as productionwise
  surrounded by four nature conservation areas the power plant situated at the small island of olkiluoto produces 23 percent
  of finlands total electricity output and 18 percent of all electricity consumed in finland the concentration of energy
  production in a small geographic area minimizes environmental impacts and makes it possible to preserve other areas in
  their natural state
  to prepare for the renewal of the operating license of the plant units in 2018 the power plant is currently undergoing
  modifications which will further improve the safety and reliability of the plant units new safety features will for example
  improve the plants ability to cope with events caused by exceptional natural phenomena another ongoing project aims to
  draw more attention to the companys safety culture and the associated practices and procedures
  despite the delays the olkiluoto 3 project has achieved also good results the pressure and leaktightness test carried out
  in the spring showed that the quality of the work is good and that the plant unit will meet the set quality requirements
  advances were made in the design of the automation system which play an important part in the completion of the plant unit
  furthermore testing of the automation systems was carried out in accordance with the plans and as scheduled
  the delays of the ol3 project will have a further impact on future growth projects the government rejected tvos
  application for the extension of the validity of the decisioninprinciple concerning the ol4 project and the postponement of
  the implementation of the project to a more economically feasible time the associated preparation design implementation

  and operational phases make nuclear power plant investment projects long and economically challenging large baseload
  power production projects are important to society however for investments and implementation to take place the
  operating environment and the necessary political decisions must be predictable the decisioninprinciple concerning ol4 is
  valid until june 30 2015

  integral part of finnish society

  tvo was established 45 years ago to produce electricity for its owners using nuclear power today tvo still continues to
  fulfill this mission the production of electricity in olkiluoto began 35 years ago ever since then tvo has systematically
  increased its production by modernizing the plant units and developing its operations further the ol3 project is a billion
  euroscale investment in the future together with the final disposal facility for spent fuel it will ensure that active operations
  will continue at olkiluoto for more than a hundred years from now
  for years tvo has engaged in longterm multidisciplinary work to promote overall development in the nuclear power
  industry and to guarantee its continuity the olkiluoto site has been developed taking into account the requirements of the
  future production increase the development of a sustainable waste management concept has also required an enormous
  amount of work and investments the achievement is the most extensive and advanced final disposal solution for spent
  nuclear fuel in the world the completion of the extension of the interim storage facility for spent fuel at the end of the year is
  an important part of the implementation of the well managed solution
  like the production of electricity in olkiluoto decisionmaking at tvo is firmly in domestic hands the companys owners are
  finnish funding for the investments is acquired from international financial markets the procurement of fuel is subjected to
  competitive bidding and distributed between several western suppliers these suppliers are expected to demonstrate
  responsibility in their operations and are regularly subjected to assessment

  looking responsibly towards a profitable future

  as our operating environment is undergoing a change tvo will keep up with the pace of development after renewing our
  strategy in conjunction with our current large nuclear facility investments we are now planning to reorganize our operations
  and develop our practices in order to improve our efficiency with the development work progressing rapidly spring will see
  the completion of the operations descriptions as well as the design and implementation of new more efficient operations
  cost savings are required to ensure stable production of electricity in the future as one means of achieving the necessary
  savings the company started cooperation negotiations with the employees in january 2015
  whenever changes are made in the company that affect the personnel the significance of a corporate culture and
  responsibility is heightened at tvo this means among other things that in parallel to implementing measures to increase
  shareholder value we develop our safety culture and wellbeing at work these three things form the core of our
  development program which also provides a frame for our other everyday development and human resources activities
  as we implement our strategy we take tvo towards better profitability and competitiveness the competitiveness of the
  electricity produced in olkiluoto serves to strengthen the operating preconditions of tvos owners and the success of other
  industrial production operations in finland thus the emissionfree electricity produced in olkiluoto using nuclear power will
  continue to have a great significance on the economic development electrical selfsufficiency and general wellbeing of
  whole finland

  operating environment
  nuclear power accounts for approximately 11 percent of the worlds electricity
  production nuclear power is the second most important form of lowemission
  electricity production after hydropower the current nuclear power capacity is
  392000 mw with another 76000 mw under construction like other forms of
  production nuclear power has external benefits and costs the most important
  external benefits are the virtual avoidance of co2 releases and local pollution
  and the improvement of energy security the associated concerns include
  nuclear safety and the management of radioactive waste 1
  in 2014 the consumption of electricity in finland totaled 833 terawatthours
  twh compared to the previous year consumption decreased by 08 the
  share of imported electricity remained high at slightly over onefifth of total consumption the production of nuclear power
  generated electricity amounted to 227 twh which accounted for 272 of consumption
  the energy industry is undergoing a substantial radical change that began suddenly and may continue for several years the
  stalling of economic growth has resulted in a decrease in the demand as subsidized investments are made in renewable
  energy at the same time the costs relating to the production of nuclear power have increased this development has
  undermined the profitability of nuclear power production
  finland needs new emissionfree electricity production in january 2015 the
  ministry of employment and the economy published a new report according to
  which domestic electricity production is not nor will be in the future sufficient to
  cover consumption during peak demand periods in the next few years the
  demand for imported electricity will be 2800 mw during peak consumption
  periods and up to 4000 mw in extremely cold winters the completion of
  olkiluoto 3 will alleviate the situation but not completely solve it the probability
  of shortterm consumption restrictions has increased
  in october 2014 the parliamentary committee on energy and climate issues
  published roadmap 2050 a report describing the steps to be taken on the way to a carbonfree future according to the
  report when domestically produced nuclear power is included finlands degree of energy selfsufficiency can be increased
  to 80 per cent

  procurement of uranium

  from responsible partners only
  uranium is an element widely present in nature  it is approximately 40 times more common
  than silver nearly half of all uranium is produced using conventional mining techniques in
  underground mines and open pits while roughly the same quantity is produced by insitu
  leaching the rest approximately 7 is produced as a byproduct of other mining
  operations in 2013 primary production covered approximately 90 of the uranium
  requirement of the worlds nuclear power plants the remaining 10 is obtained from
  various inventories and the reprocessing of spent fuel
  the largest producers of uranium based on 2013 statistics are kazakhstan canada
  australia niger and namibia together these countries account for more than three
  quarters of the worlds total production volume uranium is usually produced by large
  international companies with operations in several countries the eight largest companies
  cover approximately 85 of all production with ten mines producing roughly half of all
  uranium

  for waste management the closure of the mine and the ore enrichment plant and
  landscaping should be gathered during production operations
  certification of quality environmental and occupational health and safety management systems is widely applied large
  operators in particular have certified the management systems of their production facilities responsible companies follow
  the same standards and the principles of safety and social responsibility in all their locations which in turn promotes the
  development of legislation and procedures of new mining countries

  wellplanned fuel procurement
  tvo has highlevel expertise in all phases of the fuel procurement process furthermore the composition of the fuel and the
  manner in which it is used are designed by tvo itself this is not very common as most operators procure their fuel from a
  single supplier on a turnkey basis the policy chosen by tvo clearly strengthens the companys position as finlands leading
  supplier of nuclear power
  tvo procures its fuel through a decentralized supply chain entering into negotiations and making procurement contracts with
  each separate supplier in the various stages of the supply chain there are several suppliers for each stage of the chain
  and the procurement operations are regularly subjected to competitive bidding
  procurement operations are based on longterm contracts with leading suppliers if required tvo purchases additional
  batches and services from the market the developments of which are followed actively
  the majority of the uranium procured by tvo comes from kazakhstan canada and australia and the fuel elements ordered
  by the company are constructed and assembled in germany spain or sweden

  have passed the evaluation process a systematic evaluation process precedes the closure of each supply contract in
  addition to the requirements set for the products the process also considers the reliability and responsibility of the supplier
  tvos supplier evaluation also includes active monitoring and evaluations at fixed intervals remote monitoring from finland
  and excursions to production sites both provide tvo with an opportunity to examine suppliers practices and when
  necessary to demand that changes are made to them the purpose of supplier evaluation is to ensure that suppliers pay
  appropriate attention to environmental issues the wellbeing of personnel and quality management special issues
  concerning mines are also considered such as the impact of operations on local people

  nuclear waste management
  low and intermediate level waste also called operating waste accumulates during the
  operation and maintenance of the nuclear power plant some of the nuclear power plant
  structures become radioactive during the operation of the plant and need to be disposed of
  when the plant has been decommissioned nuclear power plants use uranium fuel which
  during operation becomes high level radioactive waste that requires final disposal at a
  repository before final disposal spent nuclear fuel is kept in the interim storage facility for
  spent nuclear fuel
  responsibility for nuclear waste management lies with the nuclear power companies that
  must carry out the necessary nuclear waste management measures for their own waste at
  their own cost according to the finnish nuclear energy act nuclear waste generated in
  finland must be treated stored and finally disposed of in finland and the import of nuclear
  waste into finland is prohibited
  tvo also takes care of the operating waste and the power plant decommissioning waste it
  is disposed of in the operating waste repository located at olkiluoto the repository also
  accommodates small radioactive waste generated in finnish healthcare industries and                                        case

  commissioned in december 2014 the extension doubled the available fuel pool capacity
  furthermore the extension doubled the space available for the interim storage of spent fuel
  assemblies from the olkiluoto plant units and provided improved safety features

  advance collection of waste management funds
  the cost of final disposal of nuclear waste and spent fuel is collected from the owners of tvo in the price of nuclear power
  produced electricity and deposited in a fund for future use
  in finland nuclear power companies bear the costs of nuclear waste management and the funds for that purpose are

  collected into the state nuclear waste management fund each year the ministry of employment and the economy
  determines the share of each nuclear power company in the state nuclear waste management fund as well as the waste
  management fee to be paid to the fund each nuclear power companys share of liabilities in the fund is decreased by the
  investments it has made in final disposal
  the annual fee payable to the fund is determined on the basis of the amount of disposable nuclear waste accumulated less
  the effect of actions taken for nuclear waste management the fee is also increased or decreased on the basis of how well
  the fund succeeds in its investments if the interest income is higher than expected the fee is correspondingly reduced the
  objective is to accumulate enough assets in the fund so that it allows for the final disposal of accumulated nuclear fuel to be
  carried out

  final disposal

  final disposal of spent nuclear fuel
  spent nuclear fuel must be managed to avoid any risk to people or organic nature a
  responsible producer of nuclear powergenerated electricity will look after the fuel all the
  way from bedrock to bedrock tvo and fortum have established a company posiva oy
  to handle the final disposal of the spent nuclear fuel produced in the olkiluoto and loviisa
  nuclear power plants
  final disposal has been researched and tested for 40 years first by the tvo nuclear
  waste office and later by posiva the multidiscipline research and development
  cooperation has yielded a solution that has gained wide acceptance in finland in the eu
  and throughout the nuclear power community
  in the solution developed by posiva spent nuclear fuel will be packed in copper canisters
  and placed in the olkiluoto bedrock at an approximate depth of 400 meters
  the safety of the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel is based on the multiple barriers
  principle the barriers ensure that nuclear waste does not come into contact with people or organic nature one deficient
  barrier a predictable geological change or other similar factor will not compromise effective isolation barriers include the
  solid state of the fuel the final disposal canister the bentonite clay buffer the tunnel filling material and the surrounding
  bedrock
  the plan is to pack the spent fuel into canisters in the encapsulation plant after encapsulation the canisters are transported
  to the underground disposal facility by an elevator

  before final disposal the spent fuel is kept in an interim storage facility at tvos olkiluoto power plant from the power plant
  the fuel will be transported to the encapsulation plant of the final disposal facility in special containers spent fuel from tvos
  and fortums power plants in olkiluoto and loviisa will be placed in the olkiluoto repository
  plenty of time has been reserved for the preparation and practical execution of final disposal thorough preparations and
  careful implementation ensure the safety of the final disposal the disposal of spent fuel is scheduled to begin in the 2020s it
  will continue for nearly 100 years
  posiva submitted a final disposal facility construction license application to the ministry of employment and the economy in
  late 2013 during the year under review the final disposal facility construction license application was supplemented with
  additional reports required by the radiation and nuclear safety authority stuk according to stuk it will submit its
  statement on the longterm safety of final disposal to the ministry of employment and the economy in early 2015 the
  advisory committee on nuclear safety will evaluate the statement and the safety assessment prior to their submittal to the
  ministry of employment and the economy a construction license is required for the construction of the actual final disposal
  facility to commence
  in 2014 posiva launched implementation planning for the final disposal facility and encapsulation plant with the objective of
  achieving readiness for the procurement of the facility subassemblies and strengthened its organization in preparation for
  the launching of the implementation phase an international tunnel closure testing program coordinated by posiva and
  partially financed by the eu continued in the final disposal research facility onkalo at the depth of 420 meters eight
  countries are involved in the program furthermore posiva has had prototype equipment constructed for the purpose of
  carrying out the componentspecific fullscale final disposal installation tests

  economic aspects
  tvo creates wellbeing employment and income by producing costprice electricity for its shareholders the company has a
  significant impact on the economy of the municipalities in the immediate region and it directly or indirectly touches the
  everyday life of thousands of people all over finland
  tvos operations are based on the production of electricity to shareholders at cost price owners cover all of tvos
  operating costs and in return receive electricity prorata to their ownership tvos owners consume the power themselves
  or sell it on to third parties the cost price model allows electricity companies and electricity users of different sizes to
  participate in major investments such as those required for nuclear power and reap the benefits of largescale production
  tvos owners include 134 municipalities which means that stable costs and predictability the benefits of costprice
  electricity are felt all over finland
  the financial performance of companies is compared using various indicators due to the cost price operating principle tvo
  cannot be analyzed using conventional financial indicators as they were created for comparing companies that aim to make
  a profit important indicators to tvo and the owners include the amount of electricity produced and the load factors of the
  plant units
  in 2014 tvos olkiluoto nuclear power plant achieved a record production output for the second consecutive year the
  combined electricity production of the two plant units 1476 twh billion kilowatthours exceeded the previous record
  made in 2013 by nearly 130000 mwh the combined load factor of the plant units was 960 the reason behind the
  excellent production figures was the exceptionally low number of production disruptions taking into account tvos share of
  the meripori power plant the company produced a total of 1515 twh of electricity olkiluoto accounted for approximately
  18 of all the electricity produced in finland
  the 2014 annual outages of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant took place from may 11 to june 9 2014 ol1 underwent a
  maintenance outage of approximately 17 days and ol2 an eightday refueling outage
  tvo makes investments to improve the availability productivity and safety of its nuclear power plant modernizations have
  brought the net electrical output of ol1 and ol2 from 660 mw to 880 mw 1760 mw combined and significantly improved
  the safety and efficiency of production operations tvo aims to maintain the plant units as good as new
  in july 2014 tvo signed a contract with westinghouse electric sweden wse on the replacement of the main circulation
  pumps of ol1 and ol2 covering a total of 12 main circulation pumps the contract is worth over eur 40 million the pump
  replacement will be carried out on a turnkey basis wse will be responsible for the installation of the pumps and the
  manufacture of special tools and it will share the responsibility for the design of the pumps with their manufacturer tvo will
  be responsible for the organization of support services during the installation as defined in the contract the replacement of
