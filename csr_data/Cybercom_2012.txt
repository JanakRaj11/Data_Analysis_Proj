cybercoms sustainability vision
and strategic objectives




ceo comment
for cybercom to be able to grow with
continued profitability it is important to
take responsibility for how people and the
environment are affected by the companys
activities we therefore work with longterm
sustainability issues and believe it is impor
tant to report and follow up on cybercoms
sustainability efforts


our view of social responsibility begins particularly
in our assignments as an it consultant to our custom
ers this includes our impact on our employees our
                                                               niklas flyborg president and ceo cybercom group
partners investors and society and the environment as
a whole

                                                               sustainability objectives
for example when we work in or procure from firms
in countries that lack democratic government have             our sustainability work has three strategic and long
flawed environmental laws or where human rights may            term objectives that we will actively work with in 2012
be violated moreover cybercom scraps equipment in                 ith regard to the environment we are working
                                                               1 w

we also work proactively with solutions that allow                consumption and our emissions from travel with
our customers in turn to reduce their environmental               the objective of achieving a 5 percent reduction

                                                                  groupwide employee survey intended to
during the year we completed a successful programme
                                                                  improve employee satisfaction
with csr ambassadors at cybercom in addition to
their regular jobs three it consultants were assigned to          e take a social responsibility by actively

and csr managers and to communicate the work                      of conduct to our suppliers and monitor them to
internally and externally another important event                ensure compliance
was the introduction of the lync video conferencing            in a broader sense social responsibility is also about
system at all offices within the cybercom group lync          using our core business and expertise for improvement
will replace some physical meetings thereby reducing          cybercom therefore supports organisations such as

                                                                of cybercoms sustainability efforts
around 30 employees in nine countries who support               i think we can help spread information and to initiate
the companys csr work they help with specific                 a discussion within the business areas and units about
actions such as workplace interaction regarding csr            what csr means in everyday work the hope is that
and they collect donations for example for books and           the units themselves can set goals based on their
toys to provide to children in rwanda                          circumstances and that in turn will support the overall
                                                                objectives of cybercom to achieve this ambassadors

                                                                perceived as abstract and it doesnt affect me but it
                                                                very much does
why did you apply for the role
of csr ambassador
i think its an exciting and above all important area to
                                                                how do you regard csr and business
work with in a company besides i was curious and              its essential these days csr is an important area that
wanted to learn more about csr and cybercoms                   can support business and that is also required by
work on csr so i saw it as an opportunity to get to            customers suppliers and potential employees who
know more and to use the knowledge of my role                  are increasingly aware of sustainability environmental
as a consultant and to make sure the importance of              impact and health and safety issues it can be a
working with csr is shared within the company                  decisive argument in for example procurement and
                                                                can be a decisive competitive factor

at cybercom do                                                 how do you use csr in your job

csr its also surprising how many people dont know            first and foremost its about keeping our code of
what csr means and above all what it means for the              conduct in mind i also talk about our rwanda trip and
employee and the company i hope i can help raise               cybercoms commitment to sos childrens villages its

one of cybercoms major shareholders
is the second ap fund the shareholder
representative for this government pension

ability analyst therefore also makes her
assessments from a sustainability perspective

be interesting to interview christina to get
a better understanding of our stakeholders
views on our sustainability performance


what does sustainability mean
to you as a shareholder
the second ap fund believes that companies can
generate attractive returns by taking into account
sustainability issues we therefore think it is positive
that companies such as cybercom are identifying and
working with the opportunities and risks in the area of
sustainability

ammar raza on being a
csr ambassador for cybercom
i have always believed that life is all about helping
others especially those in need peeping through
the window on my past the most memorable
moments i can see are the ones in which i did
something good to help others
i wanted to get more and more involved in such
activities but never got a chance until i got to know
about the cybercom csr programme and was then
selected as a csr ambassador that was indeed a
great moment for me as now i knew cybercom had
given me the chance to be involved in social activities         ammar raza with one of the 200 orphanage children at sos
                                                                childrens villages in gikongoro rwanda
throughout the year
being a csr ambassador i considered it my responsibil         as they say many a drop makes an ocean and as
ity to not only think of different ways to help the             almost all employees got involved in the csr activity
children in sos childrens villages rwanda but also to         and donated funds we were able to make very
help all other cybercom employees understand what               handsome amounts sufficient for a new computer
csr is and to get them involved in it as well                  lab a lot of orphans will now have a good computer
i thus came up with the idea of giving all the employ          education because of the combined effort of all of you
ees an option of donating to help these children in             you have taken a step towards building a better society
sos childrens villages rwanda by briefing them on             and if all of us keep up this good work we sure will
how and where the funds they donate are going to be             make a big difference
utilised                                                       the donations from employees are a clear indication
moreover as collecting funds is normally not easy              that each and every one of us wants to help contribute
because of employees being spread out on different              to a better society its just that a good platform
projects throughout the world i suggested that they get        isneeded and now we have the cybercom csr
the amount they want to donate to be deducted from              platform we should not just stop here but carry out
their monthly salary by sending an email to the payroll         the csr activities throughout the year thanks to
department in this way we had one easy central point           cybercom for giving us the opportunity to get involved
of collection and the response from the employeeswas           in csr activities and help in making a better society
simply remarkable within one week the funds donated
by the employees jumped to sek 30000                          ammar raza
the csr team has planned to use these funds to set
up a new computer lab with the latest computers at an
