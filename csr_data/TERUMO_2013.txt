   a message from the president


        continuing to contribute to society through healthcare
terumo was established in 1921 by several scientists and doctors including dr shibasaburo kitasato known in japan as the
father of modern medicine their aspiration was to create a superior clinical thermometer to protect peoples health and we




                                                                                                                                        a message from the president
continue to respect and maintain this same spirit in accordance with our corporate mission of contributing to society through
healthcare we continue to supply medical technology in the form of products and services to numerous countries around the
world and proactively address the host of issues that surround healthcare


     continuing to advance healthcare around the world


the global medtech market is now at a turning point in advanced
countries markets are slowing down and the focus is on constrain
ing rising healthcare costs in emerging countries medical demands
are expanding but there is also downward pressure on prices
   these changing environments are sometimes viewed as a
headwind but we believe the business segments in which
terumo operates will continue to offer opportunities for growth
for example intravascular intervention is no longer limited to the
arteries of the heart now this technique is also applied to those
in the brain and the legs as well as other parts of the body
furthermore in the blood management business in addition to
blood transfusion demand for therapeutic apheresis is growing
and as efforts to help prevent medical errors and reduce the risk
of infections increase in the general hospital business the need
for safetyoriented devices will surely continue to grow

   aiming to seize such opportunities and thus continue contribut
ing to society through healthcare terumos new fouryear mid
term management plan began in april 2013 this plan sets a policy
of ensuring sustainable and profitable growth based on our
longterm goal of establishing a greater global presence

will drive our growth through acceptance of a wide range of values and mutual recognition of our diversity we are aiming to
become a company in which differing ideas and knowledge can intermingle unfettered creating new value
   in february 2013 terumo established a diversity promotion department which will work to raise awareness of diversity
issues among our associates
   looking ahead we plan to promote diversity throughout the company from a variety of different perspectives

       promoting active participation by female employees

in japan as a first step in channeling mutual recognition of diversity into corporate growth terumos top management has
made a commitment to promoting active participation by female employees

   in fy2012 we forged ahead with various initiatives aimed at creating a suitable environment climate and awareness to
enable women to perform in the workplace these included a mentoring system for women and inspirational profile intranet site
mentoring system	this system pairs female associates working in different parts of the company or of differ
                                      ent ages so that they can share experiences and thinking to broaden their perspectives
                                      and provide mutual support for career growth raising the awareness and skills of female
                                      associates and having more women assume leadership roles within terumo will contribute
                                      to fresh perspectives and value creation
inspirational profile intranet site	a special section has been created on the company intranet for introducing female associates
                                      working in a range of roles and workplaces in terumo by talking positively about work and
                                      aspects of their private life these introductions help to inspire others both men and women
