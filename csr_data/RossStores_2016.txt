        operating sustainably




with almost 1300 stores across the country efforts to be efficient and sustainable help
us reduce our impact on the environment and generate cost savings which we pass on
to our customers our commitment to use less energy and fewer natural resources goes
back more than 20 years and we continue to improve our performance year after year

energy efficiency at our stores and distribution centers
our approach to lighting heating systems and insulation
enables us to conserve energy throughout the company
sustainable product transportation
transporting products is a significant part of our
environmental footprint we work with our partners to be
more sustainable consolidating shipments where possible
and reducing the number of trips to stores each day

reducing waste and increasing our efficiency
we encourage associates in our stores distribution centers and corporate offices to
participate in practices that increase our recycling reduce waste and decrease our use
of natural resources

sustainability at our headquarters
our new corporate headquarters follows the standards of leadership in energy 
environmental design leed certification with features that make the work environment
more comfortable for our associates while also minimizing our impact on the
environment




                                                                                            22

        energy efficiency at our stores
        and distribution centers




        our energy management system optimizes lighting and temperatures in our stores to conserve energy


we have a team dedicated to finding new and better ways to achieve energy efficiency
throughout our operations we have dramatically decreased our energy use year over
year which reduces our environmental impact and costs

sustainable energy management
for over 15 years our stores have conserved energy by
adjusting the lighting and heating ventilation and air
conditioning hvac systems so they operate efficiently
and only when needed additionally we process our
energy management information online which helps
us resolve inefficiencies quickly and keep energy use
to a minimum today we require highefficiency hvac
units to further lower energy consumption and continue
to look for new ways to reduce our footprint through
effective energy management

a highlight of our energy management program in several of our distribution centers is
our air purging program during the day the sun heats up our buildings at night when
temperatures drop we purge the hot air from the building and welcome fresh naturally
cool air this allows us to avoid several hours of airconditioning every day thereby
saving energy costs whats more the purging program reduces our electricity demand
from highpeak daytime hours and therefore reduces pressure on the electricity grid
our distribution centers also save energy through highefficiency motors and automated
systems that shutoff equipment when not in demand



                                                                                                             23

         energy efficiency at our stores
         and distribution centers

raising the bar on lighting efficiency
in the 1990s we achieved a 20 percent reduction in our electricity use in stores and a 12
percent reduction in the 2000s we are currently evaluating the use of led lighting as a
possible next step for our energy efficiency program

                                                     our distribution centers have also pursued
                                                     lighting efficiency through lighting retrofits
                                                     and use of skylights

                                                             construction innovation
                                                             in 2007 we began using thicker higher
                                                             quality insulation in roofs for new store
                                                             construction which reduces the demand
                                                             for air conditioning while we do not own
                                                             many of our store buildings we are often
our las vegas stores sign is illuminated by led lightbulbs able to work with our landlords on energy
producing the same light with 65 less electricity
                                                             efficiency improvements in texas arizona
and southern california some stores have white roofs that reflect heat from the sun
which can reduce the cost of cooling by 40 percent during the summer months we
plan to continue leveraging these and other new ways to construct more environmentally
friendly buildings




                                                                                                          24

        sustainable product transportation




with almost 1300 stores in 33 states the district of columbia and guam merchandise
transportation represents a significant part of our environmental footprint although we do
not own our fleet of trucks we employ several strategies to make product transportation
more sustainable
  we ship more than 25 percent of our products by rail which is less polluting than
  standard ground transportation
  over 75 percent of our transportation partners participate in the smartway transport
  partnership a us environmental protection agency program that improves fuel
  efficiency and reduces air pollution
 we combine and optimize truck loads in between distribution points to have fewer
  trucks on the road
 we also adjust store deliveries on a daytoday basis to minimize the number of
  miles driven
all of these approaches help us reduce air pollution limit greenhouse gas emissions and
lead to significant cost savings




                                                                                           25

          reducing waste and
          increasing our efficiency




ross reusable bags provide a fashionable and sustainable alternative to disposable bags


one of the most important ways we can operate sustainably is to commit to using fewer
natural resources reducing our waste and recycling materials we encourage all divisions
of the company to apply a range of practices to fulfill this objective

recycling cardboard boxes
                                                           with locations across the country we
                                                           send and receive millions of cardboard
                                                           boxes each year cardboard represents the
                                                           majority of our waste by volume recycling
                                                           boxes is an important part of our effort to
                                                           reduce our waste and demonstrate our
                                                           commitment to being a responsible retailer
                                                           we continue to test new recycling systems
                                                           at our distribution centers and stores which
                                                           not only divert tons of waste from going
                                                           into landfills but also help us reduce waste
                                                           disposal costs and decrease associate
                                                           labor




                                                                                                      26

        reducing waste and
        increasing our efficiency

distribution centers
our distribution centers receive merchandise from many countries around the world and
we process and ship these goods to stores across the country typically in cardboard
boxes we use a packing and shipping system that minimizes the number of boxes and
trucks required to deliver merchandise as well as a system to recycle millions of boxes
each year as a result we currently recycle almost 40000 tons of material each year at
our distribution centers and this measure grows by nearly 1000 tons each year
stores
our stores participate in an expanded recycling program where boxes are collected and
taken to a nearby recycling facility with more than 100 boxes per delivery this effort to
recycle quickly adds up we recycle an estimated 20 million cardboard boxes per year
through this program and this number continues to grow each year the current recycling
rate eliminates more than 20 tons of cardboard per store from the waste stream

smaller initiatives that add up
in addition to these larger initiatives the small changes
in how we operate our stores distribution centers and
offices also have a positive impact on the planet
some examples of these initiatives include
  we use recycled paper
  we do not issue paper catalogues like many other
   retailers which significantly minimizes paper waste
  the default setting on our printers is for doubleside printing
  we sell branded totes at our stores and encourage customers to use reusable 			
   shopping bags we sold 16 million reusable branded totes in 2014
  our stores and offices use large capacity refurbished printer toners which results in
   less plastic steel aluminum and rubber waste compared to traditional toners
  the majority of our associates receive electronic paychecks
  we use filtered tap water and reusable glasses at our headquarters instead
   of bottled water and paper cups




                                                                                             27

        sustainability at our headquarters




in 2014 we moved our headquarter to a new campus which is certified gold by
leadership in energy  environmental design leed the premiere program providing
thirdparty verification of green buildings this reflects our growing commitment to
envrionmental stewardship
our headquarters has features that conserve natural resources and help our associates
work in a safer and healthier environment including

  recycling and composting systems
  low flow fixtures that reduce water waste
  electric vehicle charging stations
  energy management equipment such as highefficiency hvac equipment energy star
  appliances and lighting with motion sensors and daylight controls
  lowemitting office materials that reduce the number of indoor air contaminants that 		
  are irritating or harmful to occupants
  building materials made from recycled content and systems to recycle construction 		
  waste




                                                                                        28

        conducting business ethically




ethical business practices play a critical role in our corporate social responsibility program
we aim to operate with high standards of integrity and transparency and adhere to
several policies to ensure we meet these standards
responsible supply chain
as a retailer of goods sourced from around the world we believe our responsibility
reaches beyond our stores and offices we operate our business in partnership with a
large network of suppliers and producers which can present risks beyond the walls of
our own operations
supplier diversity
we are dedicated to sourcing goods and services from a diverse set of suppliers and
are continuously seeking ways to build and reinforce longlasting relationships our
membership with the national minority supplier development council nmsdc gives
us the opportunity to continually increase partnerships with minorityowned suppliers
similarly as a member of the womens business enterprise national council wbenc
ross is committed to supporting womenowned businesses




                                                                                             29

        conducting business ethically

our approach to sourcing and human rights
at ross stores ethical business practices are at the core of our culture and can be seen
every day in the way we treat all of our constituents from customers and associates to
vendors and investors this focus on ethical business practices is also reflected in ross
policy that we will not knowingly purchase merchandise from any manufacturer involved in
the use of child slave prison or forced labor
                                                                            he majority of
ross is an offprice retailer with almost 1300 stores across the country t
the apparel footwear accessories and homerelated merchandise sold in our stores is
purchased from suppliers after they have been produced and imported to other retailers
specifications
though ross does not have direct control over the manufacturing processes for these
products we require suppliers to uphold our ethical standards both contractually and
through enforcement while ross orders and imports some products directly through
its international buying agents they represent the minority of merchandise sold in our
stores for these items we have additional requirements in place to monitor and enforce
compliance
ross standards and requirements related to sourcing and human rights are incorporated
in various company documents including ross code of business conduct and ethics
vendor compliance manual purchase orders vendor indemnification agreements and
buying agent agreements our code of business conduct and ethics is located under
corporate governance in the investors section of wwwrossstorescom and our vendor
compliance manual can be found at httppartnersrossstorescom
ross communicates its standards and requirements to vendors buyers and overseas
buying agents during our purchasing processes




                                                                                              30
