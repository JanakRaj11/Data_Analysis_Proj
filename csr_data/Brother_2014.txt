face to face talk taking on new challenges for the next
phase of growth




today the brother group has over 40000 employees of various nationalities in more than 40 countries
and regions in the world of rapid change what should brother do to grow sustainably as a global
company that is well accepted by society brother industries president toshikazu koike invited keiko
takeshita who is a popular actress appearing in ﬁlms and tv shows and actively involved in social
contribution and environmental activities while bringing up two children to discuss brothers csr
management

keep alert even when you are successful and actively take on challenges
koike you were born in nagoya city where brother industries head oﬃce is located what brother
products do you remember in your childhood

takeshita  my family used a brother sewing machine i used brother typewriters in typewriting lessons
when i was in 12th grade the main products today are totally diﬀerent from back then

koike  i remember you served as the chief pavilion director of japan pavilions at the 2005 world
exposition in aichi japan

                                                                takeshita  yes i took a photograph with my children and had it
                                                                printed on a tshirt ive brought the tshirt today

                                                                koike the printer was exhibited at the brother pavilion the
                                                                colors havent faded over the nine years in fact the tshirt
                                                                printer is one of the products that i suggested we develop at
                                                                that time i was the president of the sales company in the us
                                                                and i thought that inkjet printing would make tshirts more
                                                                comfortable to wear than those printed with the conventional

phase of growth
takeshita what a surprise i didnt expect to meet the person who started the project to develop the
printer

koikein those days brother was expanding globally as a communications and printing equipment
manufacturer the lineup of printers and allinones was expanded for the soho small oﬃcehome
oﬃce market brothers business grew rapidly in europe and the us

takeshita you wrote in your book1 that one must not get carried
away with success this applies to actors and actresses too when
they are just starting they receive good support but if their ﬁlms
become popular then theyll be closely watched by the mass media if
they get carried away they may lose control of themselves its
important not to become complacent with success
1 solution is inside us  60 management philosophies of toshikazu koike president of brother
    naoyuki takai kodansha company ltd


koikeexactly today two thirds of our sales come from the
printingrelated business including printers allinones and electronic stationery as smartphones and
tablets spread the need to print on paper will continue to decrease our results were good last ﬁscal
year due partly to the weaker yen in the long term our top priority is to create a new business that will
become our next core business and thats why i encourage employees to have a sense of crisis and
take on challenges the midterm business strategy cs b2015 is under way based on the theme of
back to growth toward 2015 we will drive the growth of the group by continuing to create products
that surprise customers and contribute to society

takeshitabrother has been around for a long time but is changing dramatically what is the basis of
the corporate culture

koikethe brother group global charter is the basis of all our activities all group companies and
employees must base their daily decisionsmaking and actions on the charters basic policies and
codes of practice the global charter also states that we must put the customer ﬁrst everywhere
every time and live the motto at your side honor individuals and diversity regardless of gender and
nationality and take action with a challenging spirit the global charter which was translated into 27
languages guides the daily work of more than 40000 employees we strive to ensure a long and
successful future by having a challenging spirit

a global company with collaboration among diverse people

                                takeshita it must be tough to share the policy with as many as 40000 people at
                                the 2005 world exposition in aichi japan i learned the importance of diversity in
                                nature and the same applies to personal relationships by working with others i
                                understand the importance of respecting individualities and working together i
                                dont have speciﬁc suggestions but i think we should try to recognize diﬀerences
                                and explore what we have in common

koike  at brother industries we have about 80 foreign employees with more than 80 percent of our
products manufactured outside japan we need to work with employees outside japan in all of our
operations including development production sales and services thats why we exchange staﬀ with
facilities outside japan through the trainee program for example we have been creating opportunities
for intercultural exchange by recruiting international students in japan and directly hiring employees
from outside japan when it comes to communication experience matters for example a person who
seems diﬃcult to get along with at ﬁrst may turn out to be a very interesting person
i think japanese employees in their 20s should work outside japan for three to ﬁve years but we have
not fully attained this goal we still have a long way to go to develop global human resources

takeshita  you often travel abroad is it because you value communication with fellow staﬀ

koike  yes i value communication with staﬀ the weekly message from the president which covers
ﬁnancial results organizational structure events and the presidents awards is translated into 10
languages and distributed via the intranet in 2005 i started an inhouse blog in which i write about
personal topics and ive posted nearly 750 times in the past decade by writing the blog and showing
that i am just an average joe i hope employees will feel closer to me and will understand my
commitment to life and philosophy i visit overseas facilities once or twice a month and talk with local
employees one employee asked me directly how come you climbed all the way to the top while so
young i answered it was just a ﬂuke some questions are tough such as what is your future
product strategy i try to answer every question if time allows about six times a year we organize
inhouse presentations by a video conferencing system which is our product to connect the main
venue with other facilities in japan i talk to about 1000 managers about ﬁnancial results annual
management plans and events in the group in particular

takeshita  i guess you write the blog during short breaks how do you schedule your work each day

koike  i always think of the people who count on me this is the source of motivation i do not need a
rest while i am on stage and watched by others

takeshita  you would not be able to survive on an uninhabited island

koike  no i may suddenly lose motivation if other people no longer expected me to take the lead

takeshita  changing the subject brother industries is among the top companies in the great place to
work survey2 how do you support working women

koike we oﬀer maternity leave childcare leave and shorter work hours just as other companies do
but most of our female employees who take childcare leave come back to work for us we have about
25 female managers one of whom was appointed as the ﬁrst female general manager but we still lag
behind europe and the us where husbands and wives are expected to play equal roles in raising
children in japan women are unable to demonstrate their full potential due partly to traditional
practices and their modesty

takeshita  at home i am an ordinary mother when my children were small they asked me why are
you on tv while father is cooking in the kitchen its hard work raising kids but i learned how to
allocate time and prioritize tasks while asking my husband for help and hiring babysitters and
housekeepers at work i received timesaving tips as well as encouragement from other working
mothers you may feel overwhelmed but youll survive it seems that the time when you must work the
hardest at your job also coincides with the time when you raise children that means you must work at
120 percent of full capacity  60 percent at home plus 60 percent at work

takeshita  brother has been supporting the reconstruction eﬀort since the great east japan
earthquake

koike we operate in many countries and regions around the world if a major disaster strikes in one of
the areas in which we operate we immediately respond in some way because the great east japan
earthquake wreaked unprecedented havoc it is crucial to continue to assist the reconstruction to date
we have given away tshirts featuring the chinese character kizuna which
literally means ties to employees who donated money the kizuna fund was
established so that employees can voluntarily make donations our employees
helped people in the disaster areas ﬁnd both a reason for living and also work
by using sewing machines they also helped organize a musical and sell
specialty products these activities are done as the brother group the other
day we commended employees who volunteered in supporting the
reconstruction after the earthquake under the volunteer award program and
last year both the company and employees gave donations for reconstruction
projects after the typhoon that hit the philippines

takeshita  i serve as the goodwill ambassador of the japan association for the world food
programme3 after the earthquake we received massive support from the united nations world food
programme mainly in the form of food and tents before the earthquake japan had always been the
one to help other countries so i felt both glad and shocked to ﬁnd messages in overseas newspapers
asking for support to save children in japan it showed the importance of mutual support as well as
immediate action and cooperation after the great hanshinawaji earthquake in 1995 i was involved in
poetry reading events in kobe in memory of the victims in 2012 i started to read poems in sendai the
aﬀected areas and the damage are so extensive in the tohoku region that local areas and cities must
work closer together than ever

koike  your work embodies our at your side spirit to support the aﬀected areas your father worked
for the government and later became a lawyer and helped the socially vulnerable you seem to have
inherited his dna as i understand you have been actively involved in environmental protection projects

                                       challenges without worrying about making mistakes in todays information
                                       society children are surprisingly knowledgeable but as with experiencing
                                       nature simply knowing of something is not the same as fully understanding it i
                                       want children to take the initiative and experience things with their ﬁve senses
                                       so that they can develop new ideas i think this is the starting point in any ﬁeld

                                       koikemistakes are an opportunity to enrich lives as president i expect young
                                       employees to take on challenges and make many mistakes i enjoy seeing them
                                       use their experience to make progress they should embrace challenges even
                                       tough ones and make mistakes rather than thinking too much and losing their
spirit of adventure i often tell them that many company leaders have gained their experience by
working on various challenges and making mistakes even if employees make mistakes the ultimate
responsibility lies with the top management who allowed them to take on the challenge employees
should not be prevented from working on their preferred projects or from being promoted because of
such mistakes i encourage them to take full advantage of their personal networks as well as the
companys assets and technologies a company that has diverse employees in terms of personalities
backgrounds and ways of thinking is more likely to prosper than a company which employs clones no
matter how skilled they are

takeshita diversity is the source of dynamism

conducting various surveys to identify potential needs and
embodying them in products

all of the brother groups business activities are driven by
feedback from customers opinions and requests are solicited at
various times and compiled into a database
in the planning phase for a new product in particular those in
charge of planning and development visit customers organize
group interviews and conduct webbased surveys these
extensive indepth surveys are designed to identify the
                                                                                             framework for reﬂecting customer feedback in

impressions and requests so that potential needs  which even
customers are not aware of  are identiﬁed and reﬂected when developing the next models
this process helps to ensure that the functions sizes designs and prices of products perfectly match
customers needs this is all part of the brother groups commitment to providing customers with new
values and satisfaction

delivering satisfaction to more customers in different countries and regions

in may 2013 brother released four blackandwhite laser printer models of which three were allinone
models in emerging countries the performance requirements and operating environments of printers
in emerging countries are diﬀerent from those in europe the us and japan we developed these
unique products by taking full advantage of the brother value chain management bvcm  brothers
proprietary management system for creating products that deliver satisfaction to many more
customers bvcm is intended to carefully analyze customers needs develop product concepts design
and manufacture products based on these concepts and deliver products to customers

focusing on aﬀordability and reliability
regional characteristics vary in emerging countries
the planning division extensively researched and
analyzed printer trends as well as operating statuses
                                                                              icons used in the hl1110 series catalog to explain the concept

that customers in emerging countries expect the
division ﬁnally came up with the concept for new products aﬀordability and reliability

product speciﬁcations were reviewed for emerging countries to make the products aﬀordable
speciﬁcally printing speed and maximum paper feed capacity were reduced to 20 ppm and 150 sheets
respectively while maintaining the userfriendliness of conventional models the size was also reduced
to its smallest ever concerning reliability priority was given to ensuring high durability and reducing
paper jamming in severe operating conditions the solutions required innovative ideas and technologies
to break conventional wisdom the daunting tasks stimulated the pioneering spirit required of the
development team to overcome these challenges

achieving hasslefree printing and signiﬁcantly reducing
size
in these product models the paper feed path was
halved by changing the path conﬁguration from an
s shape to a c shape paper jamming was
successfully minimized by introducing a new roller
material resistant to paper dust in addition to long
paper guides for stabilizing paper feed                                               paper feed path reduced from 450 mm to 220 mm

the paper tray was integrated with the front cover
to eliminate the cassette type tray the program
was reconﬁgured to provide functions suited for
the new models with memory consumption
reduced to oneeighth surplus memory is used to
ensure electric control of functions that had been
                                                                                       paper guides extended to prevent paper jamming while
conventionally controlled with parts the number of                                    achieving a reduction in size
parts was signiﬁcantly reduced by integrating
diﬀerent parts furthermore the volume of toner cartridges was more
than halved by increasing the toner ﬁlling density by more than double simply increasing the toner
density would result in an overﬂow of the toner from the ﬁlling port the development team overcame
this challenge by providing an air vent hole and innovatively designing the cartridge conﬁguration

these eﬀorts have delivered compact models measuring only w 340 mm x d 238 mm x h 189 mm and
weighing 45 kg new image processing technology ensures printing quality equivalent to that of
conventional models for images requiring large memory

minimizing product returns and servicing

based on brothers unique concept from the viewpoint of customers

eﬀorts to minimize the number of returns after shipment
at the brother group the percentage of products returned from customers for repair or return is deﬁned as
product returns and servicing rate we believe that the time and eﬀort suﬀered by customers due to trouble with
the products no matter how small is an inconvenience for them the brother group believes that reducing the
number of returned products close to zero should be placed above all others to achieve greater customer
satisfaction and together with all departments from development design manufacture logistics sales to services
we promote the acrosstheboard activity to pursue improvement of products quality

reducing unexpected defects in new products through quality improvement activities

working on quality improvement activities from the viewpoint of customers considering the
types of paper available in diﬀerent markets
the business inkjet allinone neo series released in the autumn of 2012 has
revolutionized the concept of inkjet printers these products have embodied the
commitment of brothers engineers as exempliﬁed by the a4 longedge feed
mechanism it is also of interest to note that after absorbing ink paper is
subject to rapid deformation due to ﬁber orientation in a longedge feed
mechanism such deformation is likely to make paper contact with the printer
head in the printing process among others which could aﬀect the printing
quality brother took up this challenge and developed proprietary technology to
control the swelling and expansion of paper the a4 longedge feed mechanism
has helped develop epochmaking products characterized by a compact body
with depth of 290 mm and a3 printing capability

customers use our products in various environments in development evaluation
process as we learned from printing on paper that we obtained in diﬀerent
countries paper deformed more than we expected impacting on the printing
quality in our conventional evaluations we had mainly used regular paper
typically available in markets in the americas europe and japan however we
                                                                                                      business inkjet allinone neo series
learned that the characteristics of paper are signiﬁcantly uneven in some                             featuring an a4 longedge feed
                                                                                                      which was considered diﬃcult to achieve
regions in terms of the thickness the moisture absorbency etc to solve this                        a3 printing capability and a compact body
problem we ﬁrst conducted a survey regarding paper available in the markets
in respective countries then we identiﬁed the types of paper that are available in large amounts in respective
regions and adjusted our products to these types of paper this process enabled us to recognize that diﬀerent
types of paper are on the market in diﬀerent regions and that printing quality is aﬀected by the environment such
as temperature or humidity levels we evaluated the printing quality utilizing paper used by a greater number of
customers and adjusted the products accordingly and we succeeded in further stabilizing printing quality

as brother operates and sells products globally it is no wonder that brothers products are used in various
environments and the paper used by customers is used in these same environments thus brother remains
committed to ensuring product development and services from the viewpoint of customers and to reducing
product returns and the servicing rate
