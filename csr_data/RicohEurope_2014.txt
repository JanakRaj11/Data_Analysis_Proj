                   to our stakeholders


                    since its establishment in 1936 ricoh has helped raise office productivity with its innova
                    tive technology today the ricoh group offers productsincluding a diverse line of office
                    imaging equipmentas well as related solutions and services in approximately 200 coun
                    tries and regions around the world in recent years the groups operating environment
                    has changed significantly consequently the imaging and solutions domainsricohs
                    core businessesare approaching a key turning point


                    against this backdrop ricoh worked to reform the business structure of the group itself
                    during the 17th midterm management plan which ran from april 2011 through march
                    2014 we were able to shift to a new profit model that provides customers with greater
                    value by transforming a traditional productbased business into a new model composed of
                    both products and services in addition we were able to expand business in emerging
                    markets grow our new production printing business and create other new businesses
                    with an emphasis on industrial products


                    building on these results the 18th midterm management plan which began in april
                    2014 looks toward 2020 and beyond and guides us toward our future ideala corporate
                    group making customers feel confident comfortable and convenient to reach this
                    goal we will emphasize businesses in the office business domain and accelerate approaches
                    in growth fields namely the commercial printing business domain industrial business
                    domain and consumer business domain we will reinforce technological strengths and the
                    close relationship we have built with our customers and anticipate market changes to
                    spur new value creation


                    with todays rapidly changing world the ricoh group will implement reforms that deliver
                    a level of speed and dynamism to outlive and outlast the changes that characterize the
                    operating environment we stride with confidence toward the future encouraged by the
                    corporate tagline imagine changean expression reflecting power generated by
                    leveraging the collective imagination of individuals to change the future our vision
                    extends beyond prevailing customer needs we seek to anticipate future requirements
                    that customers themselves may not yet be aware of and create new lifestyles naturally
                    the ricoh group will continue to emphasize profit creation but ultimately the goal is to
                    be welltrusted by customers and society as a whole and we will articulate the type of
                    company we want to be in the future and constantly evolve to reach that status to ensure
                    corporate sustainability and growth

human rights education workshop



   a message from hideki wakabayashi executive director of amnesty international japan
   workshops are an effective learning tool for discovering new perceptions
   the purpose of human rights education is to draw out latent ability within employees
   help them acquire knowledge they might not necessarily get through daily work
   activities as well as judgment skills and a deeper sense of morality and finally elicit
   an awareness of human rights so that they are able to apply it to corporate activities
   that do indeed respect human rights
       however listening to lectures and seminar presentations is a oneway process
   and does not leave much of a lasting impression the way to achieve results is by
   augmenting the human rights elearning offered to date with workshops which go a
   step further the retention rate is extremely high when people are engaged because hideki wakabayashi
   the practical activities reinforce whatever has been said                                 executive director
                                                                                              amnesty international japan
       this time around the discussions about what kind of stakeholders exist on the
   corporate value chain and what kind of human rights issues are found therethis
   must certainly have fostered new perceptions about human rights i look forward to seeing a wider group of people
   involved in the workshops and human rights due diligence becoming more firmly entrenched within the ricoh
   group

    helping to transform ricoh into a truly global entity
    i find that people at ricoh in japan are always willing to try new things although one of the big challenges is for me
    to explain how changes fit into existing processes ive noticed the younger engineers particularly embrace change and
    become incredibly agile my job as a manager is to help engineers fulfill their potential in driving cuttingedge technol
    ogy and i find that rewarding
         ive experienced a lot of differences in communication style between silicon valley where people feel like they
    must express their opinions or disagree and in japan which seems much more polite                                           max mcfarland

                                     my days are more rewarding since i opened the shop
                                     there are three reasons why i opened the shop first a shop in the village would mean that the women here would
                                     not have to go shopping at the store four kilometers away second i could do my own shopping right here and
                                     third i could bring in some money for my family
                                          since the shop opened its doors for business ive handled lots of products and ive been able to talk to a variety
                                     of people i just love it the village women say the shop is so convenient they really appreciate having a shop right
                                     in the neighborhood where they can buy an item that they
                                     suddenly run out of or pick up a small gift to take if they
                                     suddenly have to pay a visit to someone
                                          before i had the shop i just whiled away my time
                                     at home not doing anything of particular importance
                                     but now i spend time working and i can chat with my
                                     customers my days are much more rewarding im now
                                     making profit of several thousand rupees a month if i
                                     can boost sales higher id like to expand the shop then
                                     when the kids are older id like to get qualifications to
                                     be a beauty professional and that should bring in more
                                                                                                    entrepreneur anjana thakur who opened her shop in november 2012
