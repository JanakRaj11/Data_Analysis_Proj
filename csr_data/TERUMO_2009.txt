at terumo we refer to our employees as associates and expect each of them to continually develop and refine their
abilities think and act independently and make valuable contributions to the development of the company
our term for any given group of associates including a team section or department is pride referencing both the term
used to describe a group of lions as well as an appropriate sense of selfworth
terumo is therefore a group of proud individuals who cooperate with each other to achieve greater results
our associates work hard to improve themselves and the company rewards them by providing them with valuable
opportunities to demonstrate their abilities to the utmost extent
we believe our value as a company is equal to the sum of the value of our associates

  an environment for selflearning
people learn most effectively when they are selfmotivated based on
this understanding terumo provides only a few general training
programs including training for newly hired associates other training
programs are provided on a voluntary and selective basis in which
associates who have demonstrated noteworthy results may
participate at their own request or by the recommendation of their
supervisor
       for example we hold a selective training program for                                  presenting a proposal to top               heated group discussion
nextgeneration leaders known as the leo seminar each year out                            management

of about 100 applications we choose around 30 midcareer associates in their late 20s to late 30s based on their performance
contributions and an interview for the roughly four months of the program the selected participants balance their job with their training
assignments as part of their training they engage in serious discussions on management issues facing terumo and present their
recommendations directly to management at the end of the course some of these recommendations have been launched as a new
company project
       we also make it a rule to implement job rotation for all participants following the seminar to enable them to broaden their
experience more than 200 graduates of the seminar have already distinguished themselves in divisions across the company
 leo stands for leader executive organization it also refers to the purpose of the program which is to identify and develop those associates with the potential to grow into
  lions top management

innovation to improve quality and usability including efforts to prevent medical errors
and infections relieving patients pain and improving user satisfaction the eco
axis is based on the principles of cleaner reducing environmental impact and less improving resource efficiency and refers to
our efforts to use resources effectively through initiatives aimed at resourcesaving energysaving spacesaving and productivity
improvement without making waste nor generating hazardous substances
       these two axes may seem unrelated but a medical error or infection that causes pain to a patient also necessitates additional
treatment which involves the use of medical devices and equipment and pharmaceuticals the idea of peoplefriendly human is
therefore linked to the resourcesaving concept of environmentfriendly eco

  reducing waste emissions by the inhouse liquefying of waste plastic for recycling

we have established an experimental facility at our kofu factory to pyrolyze and liquefy
waste plastic generated in syringe or other production processes and have started
research into how to use pyrolysis oil as an energy source by not outsourcing the
treatment of waste plastic and instead recycling it within the factory we intend to achieve
the following


      1 effective use of resources
                                                                                                                         liquefaction equipment and collected oil
      2 reduction of risks involved in outsourcing industrial waste treatment
      3 reduction of co2 emissions in waste transportation


we are conducting further research to control the state of pyrolysis oil in order to be able
to use it more effectively

ethylene oxide is widely used to sterilize medical devices and
equipment we set voluntary concentration controls to track                         trends in dichloromethane emissions

  aiming at appropriate pcb management

in accordance with the law concerning special measures for promotion of proper treatment of pcb wastes and the waste management
and public cleansing law we have removed all transformers fluorescent light ballasts and other equipment containing pcbs to ensure
the prompt and appropriate disposal of these materials we completed early registration with the toyota office of the japan environmental
safety corporation jesco
      an investigation conducted by the japan electrical manufacturers association identified pieces of equipment that may
potentially contain trace amounts of pcbs on the basis of the time of manufacture or other factors following this we conducted our
own investigation categorizing and performing a complete analysis of every piece of equipment including examining manufacturer
warranties with the exception of those that could not be analyzed due to their sealed nature these will be examined when they reach
the end of their life

  green procurement

  toward the establishment of a green conformity assurance system

european environmental regulations rohsweee as well as chinese and japanese laws restrict the use of hazardous substances in
electrical and electronic equipment or require that such equipment be labeled meanwhile creating a conformity assurance system to
bring medical devices which are not yet targeted by the eu s rohs directive into conformity with these regulations is a vital task in the
achievement of ecofriendly operation
       our basic policy on conformity assurance is to prevent harmful substances from entering the factory and also prevent them from
exiting this concept is not vastly different from the traditional concept of quality assurance for medical devices it was necessary however
to add new rules to the management procedures due to the need to handle management elements not conventionally present we thus
added the following management steps the main elements of which had already been stipulated

           1
                 procedure for determining which items are subject to the assurance system
           2     procedure for determining conformity of parts and materials purchased and products shipped
                 created determination flow and determination standards for purchased partsmaterials partially implemented
           3
                 procedure for tracking information about substances contained in purchased partsmaterials
                 created instructions for investigating substance composition and began periodic investigations in fy 2007
           4     procedure for ecofriendly product design
                 provide results of substance composition investigation via database and provide conformity training
           5     procedure for risk management
                 risk analysisimprovement instructionsdetermination of whether selfdeclarations are allowed

     in the future we will integrate each of these procedures in turn into our quality management system to construct an overall
conformity assurance system
