implementation of key safety risks                                 key safety risks and how to manage them
last year we introduced the concept of key safety risks           are summarized in six targeted areas
mitigating risk to our people is a key element of our hseq
                                                                   hazardous activities
efforts and the key safety risks reinforce this message
by focusing on employee riskawareness and behavior               slips trips and falls

key safety risks describe our most significant risks              tools and manual handling
specifically defined for pgs and how these are addressed          journey management

our collective responsibility to ensure the safety of              building and vessel safety

the key safety risks have now been implemented                     and all other operational risks
throughout pgs with presentations in offshore safety
                                                                   follow hseq procedures

sessions in addition we have facilitated department               conduct risk assessment
level workshops with focus on how the specific risks              stop unsafe acts and intervene
and controls apply to each person position and role
