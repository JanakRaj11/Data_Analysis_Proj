pohjolan voima  responsible operations
throughout the energy revolution
we are currently experiencing an energy revolution that will irreversibly change the fundamentals of our energy
system the production volume of renewable energy will clearly increase and this increase is being speeded up by a
variety of support schemes wholesale electricity price has dropped and price fluctuations are high investments in new
electricity production on market terms have ceased old and unprofitable power plants are closed down at a
quickening pace the era of condensing power plants that produce electricity will soon be behind us the next electricity
production method to face the profitability challenge will be combined heat and power the risk of a shortage of
power will increase and compromise our energy security the outlook of the energy industry is unclear

the above is a quotation from my last years review the description is still accurate and there has been no change for
the better january 2016 saw an alltime peak in electricity consumption in finland which we were able to weather
thanks to fullscale import of electricity made possible by the fact that russia was celebrating an extended religious
holiday the debate about the adequacy of power generation gained momentum in 2016 and doubts of whether the
current electricity market is able to secure adequate power have become more frequent

pohjolan voima closely monitored the state of its operating environment in 2016 and continued the development of its
operations in the areas of hydropower thermal power and nuclear power as well as the improvement of its
competitiveness this will help us retain our ability to respond to future challenges


the kollaja project ended restoration of migratory fish proceeded
our hydropower companys production rate reached the excellent level of 20 twh the hydropower plants are in good
condition and their efficiency is excellent due to the recent renovations renovation of the automation systems of the
isohaara power plant on the kemijoki river was launched in 2016 earlier we renovated the melo power plant on
kokemäenjoki river and the iijoki power plants the harjavalta hydropower plant partially owned by pvos hydropower
company commissioned a new generator




1                                                                                        pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

in autumn 2016 the finnish government announced that it will not begin the revision of the rapids protection act the
decision destroyed pvovesivoimas ability to go forward with the kollaja project which aimed at building a reservoir
of flood water to be used in loadfollowing power production

cooperation to restore migratory fish continued on the iijoki river within a waterway vision project launched by the oulu
regional council and on the kemijoki river within the migratory fish project coordinated by the regional council of
lapland i believe that the broadbased cooperation and the variety of methods applied will lead to good results


investments in joint production condensing power plants in longtime reserve
pvos combined heat and power plants produce district heat and process steam for local industry and communities
and also electricity laanilan voima based in oulu invested in a power distribution system and the improved reliability
of the pyroflow boiler porin prosessivoima carried out full revision of the turbine and converted the backup boiler from
an oilbased system to burn natural gas instead hämeenkyrön voima invested in a reception system for recycled fuel
the kristiinankaupunki and pori tahkoluoto coalfired condensing power plants continued in the longterm reserve we
aim to find appropriate utilisation methods for these power plants still technically feasible for example in power
reserve


olkiluoto 3 proceeded to commissioning phase and posiva launched
construction
the olkiluoto nuclear power plant produces reliable domestic baseload power at worldclass capacity factors work on
the ol3 plant unit advanced and the commissioning stage of the construction project began in april 2016 tvo
submitted the ol3 operating license application to the ministry of employment and the economy

posiva began the construction of a final repository for spent nuclear fuel posiva also founded the subsidiary posiva
solutions which will offer the repository expertise accumulated within the company as a specialist service on the
international market posiva signed the first service agreements with the finnish fennovoima and súrao a czech
radioactive waste disposal organisation


responsibility means continuous development
our responsibility programme includes the selection of annual targets for development we developed the transparency
of fuel chain tracking for the peat biomass and recycled fuel acquired for thermal power production we provided
more detailed rules for our social influence we also launched an effort to improve our ngo operation and i hope to
achieve concrete cooperation and dialogue during this year the personnel and a group of partners of pohjolan voima
participated in an online training programme to learn more about responsibility and responsible operating practices


return to marketbased approach
the current electricity market with energybased pricing is irrevocably broken the current model does not guarantee
sufficient capacity or delivery reliability during peak consumption during any failures or under other special
circumstances decisionmakers have also seen the seriousness of the situation according to a survey carried out in
early 2016 by the request of pohjolan voima finnish energy industry decisionmakers are aware of the crisis of the
system resulting from inconsistent regulation and support systems




2                                                                                      pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

restoration of a marketbased energy system is the biggest challenge of our operating environment marketbased
operations cannot be returned merely by adjusting the current system instead thorough consideration of a new model
for the electricity market is necessary we must evaluate for example the powerbased market which has been
adopted or is being planned in some european countries


joint resources  with skill with courage together
pohjolan voima effectively supplies electricity and heat for its shareholders at cost price in this way we secure the
success of our customers and our operations indirectly create jobs and wellbeing for society as a whole we
succeeded well in this task in 2016 considering the major challenges found in the operating environment i wish to
warmly thank our employees shareholders and partners

joint resources are the basis from which we tackle any future challenges  with skill with courage together

production in 2016
in 2016 pohjolan voimas electricity production was 124 twh our share of all electricity produced in
finland was approximately 19 heat production totalled 43 twh

pohjolan voimas total electricity production capacity was 2645 mw at the end of 2016 its share of finlands total
electricity production capacity was about 16 heat production capacity was 1563 mw the total electricity production
capacity includes the capacity of pvolämpövoima oys condensing power plants 477 mw which are no longer in
production operation

in this production review pohjolan voimas volumes of electricity and heat production are shown in accordance with
pohjolan voimas shares in power plants which is why they differ from the group figures given in the financial
statements

see also pohjolan voimas production capacity on 31 december 2016

finlands electricity consumption in 2016 was 851 twh finnish electricity production totalled 661 twh while net
imports into finland amounted to a record volume of 190 twh in 2016 power consumption in finland increased by
31 from the previous year industrial power consumption increased by 16 and the power consumption of other
sectors by 46 from the previous year approximately half of the increase in total consumption can be explained by
the higher need for heating when compared to the previous year

2011



excellent year for hydropower production
pohjolan voima partially or fully owns a total of 12 hydropower plants located along the iijoki kemijoki kokemäenjoki
and tengeliönjoki rivers the combined electricity generation capacity of these plants is 528 mw of which pohjolan
voimas share is 447 mw pvos hydropower capacity increased by 4 mw when our associate company länsisuomen
voima launched its new power plant unit in harjavalta in september

in 2016 a total of 20 twh of electricity was produced using hydropower which is approximately 03 twh more than
on an average water year the aboveaverage production rate was achieved due to the rain received in the first half of
the year and in the summer and the high availability of the power plants

power production and 623 mw is condensing power production the condensing power production capacity includes
pvolämpövoima oys condensing power plants 477 mw which are no longer in production operation

combined heat and power plants produce district heat and process steam for local industry and communities as well
as electricity in 2016 the heat output of the combined heat and power plants was 43 twh compared to 53 twh in
2015 and the electricity output was 18 twh 21 twh the most important reason behind the lower production
output was pohjolan voimas divestment of three subsidiaries that own bioenergy plants condensing power plants
produced 04 twh of electricity 04 twh

in 2016 thermal power plants consumed 25 twh of coal 42 twh of woodbased fuels 19 twh of peat and 04

development of selected responsibility focus areas
each year we select focus areas for the development of responsibility in 2016 we focused on the following projects
  improved traceability of the fuel chains




10                                                                                  pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

  improved traceability of the fuel chains
  cooperation with ngos
  promotion of responsible operation methods among the personnel
  further specification of our rules for social influence


traceability of fuel chains
in 2016 we developed the transparency of fuel chains for the peat biomass and recycled fuel acquired for heat
production we complemented the fuel supply contract materials to better fulfil the requirements that we have set for
responsible operations within the fuel purchase process

we clarified and further specified the definition of traceability and the differences in the purchase processes for
various fuels as the basis of responsibility as a new factor we identified the need to develop the traceability of fuel
transportation in areas such as emission classification for the transportation vehicles we also audited peat suppliers
during the year and launched audits of biomass suppliers with the objective of supporting responsible operations in
2017 we will continue audits for the suppliers of all three fuels

an additional challenge is introduced by issues related to the sustainability criteria applied to biomass the
development project will continue and expand in 2017 to cover the development of responsible operations throughout
the value chain at the same time the project will be extended from thermal power to hydropower operations and the
responsibility of partners in this area

the industrial emissions ie directive which entered into force in january 2011 poses a major challenge to the future
of thermal power production in finland the directive has been enforced through the upgrade of the environmental
protection act and some related decrees the directive establishes rigorous requirements on power plants emissions
into the air these requirements have been applied to existing power plants since the beginning of 2016

some of the power plants of pohjolan voima are included in the national ie directive transition plan approved by the
european commission in spring 2014 the transition plan allows the committed power plants some flexibility in the
adoption of the new rigorous emission limits with the transition period ending in june 2020

cutting nitrogen oxide nox emissions is a major challenge to many pohjolan voimas boilers furthermore the ie
directive establishes that bat conclusions made on the basis of the best available techniques reference documents
will become binding the eu is currently updating the reference document on best available techniques for large
combustion plants lcpbref based on the draft reference document the emission limits are expected to become
more stringent

pohjolan voima is investigating the possibilities of achieving the emission limits in a financially and technically feasible
manner it has been estimated that the reference document will be published in the second half of 2017 and the
power plants will have four years to adapt to the new tighter emission limits


utilisation of byproducts at a good level
a total of 152 thousand tonnes of fly ash bottom ash and gypsum were produced fly ash and gypsum as byproducts
from flue gas cleaning in the context of the power plants combustion process of this volume 96 was reutilised in
earth construction the construction industry or as forest fertiliser in 2016 nearly all the generated byproducts have
been utilised in previous years the utilisation rate has been more than 100 due to the utilisation of byproducts from
interim storage accumulated earlier

our aim is to reuse a maximum share of the byproducts of thermal power production as raw material that could
replace nonrenewable natural resources such as rock and stone

nuclear power production complied with environmental permits
the operations of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant units owned by tvo a joint venture partially owned by pohjolan
voima complied with the companys environmental policy environmental permits and environmental management
system the cleaning efficiency value for biological oxygen demand at the sanitary water treatment plant fell slightly
short of the limit on one occasion the limits set for the annual average cleaning efficiency value were however
achieved

the greatest environmental impact of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant results from the heat released into the sea via
cooling waters any other environmental effects are negligible radioactive emissions into the air and water were
below the limits set by authorities

in december the southern finland regional state administrative agency issued decisions on the revision of
environmental permit regulations for olkiluoto the decisions concern the content of the environmental permit and the
water permit applied to the discharge of cooling water

preparations of the kollaja project ended
we discontinued the preparation of the kollaja project after a decision by the finnish government in september 2016
that the rapids protection act will not be revised we had proposed updates to the rapids protection act to allow the
construction of power plants at existing dams as well as building the kollaja reservoir and power plant in pudasjärvi
under strict criteria

we had been preparing the kollaja project for several years the project would have increased the volume of available
loadfollowing capacity by 100 mw which would have constituted a major proportion of the domestic loadfollowing
capacity needed in finland in the near future the project would also have been an important addition to the economy
of the oulu region the effects of the project were investigated and the project was developed on the basis of
extensive and groundbreaking research and surveys based on the research results the project could have been
implemented while also respecting the natural values and protecting the rapids and habitats of fish

costprice principle
according to the articles of association of pvo the group supplies electricity and heat at cost price to the shareholders
which means that it delivers the electricity it has produces or procured to its shareholders in proportion to their
shareholdings in each series the operating model of pvo is also called the mankala principle the name is derived
from a ruling issued by the supreme administrative court in the 1960s constituting a precedent in this ruling the
shareholders of a company called oy mankala ab were found not to have received taxable income when mankala
generated and supplied them with electricity at a price lower than the market price and the shareholders covered the
companys costs on the basis of its articles of association
each of the shareholders of each series bears their share of the variable and fixed annual costs as specified in the
companys legal documents parent company administrative costs are covered by a fixed yearly fee as defined by the
companys legal documents

in accordance with pvos articles of association each shareholders share of the liability for the annual costs will
always be limited to the amount corresponding to the proportion of its shareholding to all shares belonging to the same
series and another shareholders failure will not increase the shareholders liability based on shareholding the
shareholders are liable for costs specified in the articles of association paragraph 4


consolidation

subsidiaries

the consolidated financial statements include pohjolan voima oy and all its subsidiaries subsidiaries are those entities
over which the group has control the group has control overran entity if it has power over the entity it is exposed or
has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to use its power to affect the
amount of its returns from the entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred
to the group they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases accounting policies of subsidiaries have been
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group

the group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations the consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred and the
equity interests issued by the group the consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at
their fair values at the acquisition date on an acquisitionbyacquisition basis the group recognises any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net
assets the excess of the consideration transferred the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the
acquisitiondate fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the groups share of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill if this is less than the fair value of the subsidiary acquired in
the case of a bargain purchase the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income

intercompany transactions balances distributions of profit and unrealised gains on transactions between group
companies are eliminated unrealised losses are also eliminated unless they relate to an impairment




46                                                                                       pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

associated companies and joint arrangements

associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control generally accompanying a
shareholding of between 20 and 50 of the voting rights joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint
ventures a joint venture is a contractual joint arrangement whereby the group together with one or more parties has
undertaken an economic activity that is subject to joint control and whereby the group with other parties has rights to
the net assets of the joint arrangement

investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially
recognised at cost the groups share of its associates and joint ventures postacquisition profits or losses is
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and its share of postacquisition movements in other
comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income the cumulative postacquisition movements are
adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment the groups investment in associates and joint ventures
includes goodwill identified at acquisition net of any accumulated impairment losses when the groups share of
losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture including any other
unsecured receivables the group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made
payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its
associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the associates or joint ventures
unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the group


noncontrolling interests

the profit or loss for the period attributable to owners of the parent and noncontrolling interest is disclosed in the
statement of comprehensive income noncontrolling interests are identified separately from the equity of the owners
of the parent company in the statement of changes in equity

the group treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners of the group for
purchases from noncontrolling interests the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share
acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains or losses on disposals to non
controlling interests are also recorded in equity

when the group ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its
fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss the fair value is the initial carrying amount
for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate joint venture or financial asset in
addition any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for
as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities this means that any amounts previously
recognised in other comprehensive income are recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale




47                                                                                     pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

ventures is the euro foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the
closing rate at the date of that balance sheet
foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow
hedges and qualifying net investment hedges foreign exchange gains and losses relating to operations are included on
the relevant line items above operating income foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash
and cash equivalents are presented in the statement of comprehensive income within finance income or cost
translation differences on nonmonetary financial assets and liabilities held at cost are translated using the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions there are no nonmonetary financial assets or liabilities held at fair
value denominated in foreign currencies


revenue recognition
the groups energy operations are based on cost price sales of expert services relating to energy operations are not
based on cost price revenues are based on the consideration received for delivered energy or provided services all
revenues are presented net of valueadded taxes revenues are recognised as follows

energy revenues and other revenues
revenue for energy is recognised at the time of delivery revenue is recognised based on the delivered quantities
service revenue mainly consists of administration operating maintenance and network service revenues revenue for
services is recognised in the financial period when services have been rendered


other income

revenue from activities outside the normal operations is reported in other income this includes recurring items such as
rental income and nonrecurring items such as gains on sale of property plant and equipment rental income is
recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the lease agreement the gain on sale of property plant and
equipment is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer


research and development costs
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and included in other operating expenses except when the
development costs are expected to generate probable future economic benefits in this case the costs are recorded as
intangible assets and amortised over their useful lives there are no development costs currently in the consolidated
financial statements that fulfil the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset


interest income and dividends

interest income is recognised using the effective interest method dividends are recorded when the right to receive
payment is established



48                                                                                      pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

borrowing costs
borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred unless they are directly
attributable to construction of a power plant in which case they are capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset


income taxes
pvo delivers electricity and heating to its shareholders at cost price the shareholders are delivered a proportionate
share of the energy generated or procured by pvo according to their proportionate ownership in the various series of
shares based on the cost based pricing the group does not pay any taxes on its energy related operations therefore
the group does recognise any deferred tax assets or liabilities on these operations

income taxes and deferred taxes are recognised on the other hand on the services provided by the group

the tax expense for the period comprises current tax relating to the current period and any adjustments made to taxes
for the previous financial period and deferred taxes the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the
tax laws enacted the taxes for the current period are adjusted if necessary by the taxes related to the previous period

deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements however deferred income
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss deferred tax
liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the undistributed profits of the
subsidiaries if it is not probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future the most
significant temporary differences for the group arise from the depreciation of property plant and equipment losses
carried forward and the fair valuation of assets at acquisition

deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the balance sheet date
deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised


intangible assets
intangible assets are carried at historical cost less government grants received accumulated amortisation and
impairment historical cost includes all costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the intangible asset intangible
assets with a finite useful life are amortised using the straightline method over the following estimated useful lives

computer software                        310 years

other intangible assets                  510 years

no amortisation is recorded for goodwill and other intangible assets with infinite useful lives instead these assets are
tested annually for impairment intangible assets having infinite useful lives are water rights that have an infinite useful
life based on the water act and certain utilisation rights for transmission roads and land based on the act on the
redemption of immoveable property and special rights




49                                                                                        pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

emission allowances

at cost whether received free of charge or acquired from a third party emission allowances received free of charge
are in other words recorded at zero a short term liability is recognised to cover the obligation to return emission
allowances to the extent that group already holds allowances to meet the obligation the liability is measured at the
carrying amount of those allowances any shortfall of allowances held over the obligation is valued at the current
market value of allowances emission right and the related liability are derecognised when they are returned to cover
the obligation or when they are sold emission allowances are not amortised the cost of the provision is recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income within materials and services gains from sales of emission rights are
presented in other income


property plant and equipment
property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less government grants received less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the
acquisition of the assets borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of assets that
necessarily take a substantial amount of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of
the related asset additionally the cost of an item of property plant and equipment includes the discounted estimated
cost of its dismantlement removal or restoration

land and water areas are not depreciated depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straightline
method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives the costs
for dismantling a power plant are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the specific power plant

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based on the
estimated useful lives as follows

hydropower plant buildings structures and machinery                                                           4080 years

the assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate to reflect the changes in
estimated future economic benefits associated with the assets




50                                                                                     pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

if the asset consists of different components which have different estimated useful lives each component is
recognised as a separate asset replaced components are capitalized and any possible remaining carrying value of the
replaced component is derecognised in other cases subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with
the asset will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably

annual repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in
which they are incurred power plant modernization and improvements are recognised in the assets carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset as appropriate

gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
within other operating income or other operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income

depreciation on assets classified as held for sale according to ifrs 5 noncurrent assets held for sale and
discontinued operations is ceased


government grants
grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant
will be received and the group will comply with all attached conditions government grants relating to the purchase of
property plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset and are recognised as income by
reducing the depreciation charge of the asset they relate to government grants relating to costs are deferred and
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period necessary to match them with the costs that
they are intended to compensate these grants are presented in other operating income


inventories
inventories are stated at cost cost is determined using the firstin firstout fifo method the cost of inventory
comprises raw materials and other direct costs inventories are always stated at cost as the energy generation
operations are conducted based on cost price and therefore the cost of inventory is always equal to its net realizable
value


leases

leases group as lessee

finance leasing

property plant and equipment leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are
transferred by the lessor to the group are classified as finance leases finance leases are capitalised at the leases
commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease
payments the property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the
useful life of the asset and the lease term the corresponding rental obligations net of finance charges are included in
other current and noncurrent liabilities each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges the
interest element of the finance cost is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the lease period so as
to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period




51                                                                                     pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

if a sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease any excess of sales proceeds over the carrying amount
shall not be immediately recognised as income by a sellerlessee instead it shall be deferred and amortised over the
lease term if the leaseback is an operating lease and the lease payments and the sale price are at fair value there
has in effect been a normal sale transaction and any profit or loss is recognised immediately ias 39 is applied for the
collateralized financial liabilities that are resulted from sale and leaseback transactions that do not contain a lease in
substance the liability is amortised at cost each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges
according to the effective interest method


operating leases

leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases payments made under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a
straightline basis over the period of the lease

rental income from operating lease contracts where the group acts as the lessor are recorded in other operating
income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease


leases the group as lessor

leases of property plant and equipment where the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee are classified as finance leases the lease income is recorded as a receivable at its present
value the interest element of the lease income is recorded to the comprehensive statement of income over the lease
period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the asset for each period

operating leases of property plant and equipment where the group acts as the lessor are included in the property
plant and equipment in the balance sheet these assets are in the same way as assets in groups own use
depreciated over their useful life rental income is recorded on a straight line basis over the period of the lease


arrangements containing a lease agreement

the group has entered into arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease but conveys a right to use an asset
in return for a payment of series of payments and therefore contains a lease in order to determine if the arrangement
includes a finance lease component or other lease agreement the criteria in ifric 4 determining whether an
arrangement contains a lease is used determining whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the
substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether
a fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets the asset and
b the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset
if the arrangement includes a lease ias 17 is applied to determine whether it is an operating or financial lease as
described above other elements of the arrangement are recognised according to the relevant standards




52                                                                                     pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

impairment of nonfinancial assets

the individual assets carrying values are reviewed at each closing date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment if there is an indication of impairment the asset is tested for impairment goodwill assets that have an
indefinite useful life and intangible assets in progress are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment regardless of there is indication of impairment or not impairment for assets excluding goodwill is assessed
at the cashgenerating unit cgu level which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows
that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets goodwill is tested for
impairment at the level at which it is monitored by management which may be an individual cgu or groups of cgus
but is not tested at a level higher than an operating segment

an assets recoverable amount is the higher of a cashgenerating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use
value in use is the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be provided by the asset or group of assets
the discount rates used are pretax and reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and specific
risks relating to the relevant asset or group of assets

where the carrying value of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is
written down to its recoverable amount impairment is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive
income impairment arising from a goodwill impairment test is allocated first to goodwill and any excess thereafter
rateably over the other assets in the cgu assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment charge are reviewed
for possible reversal of the impairment if the estimates used in the calculation of the recoverable amount have
changed a reversal of an impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount net of amortisation or depreciation
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years impairment
losses on goodwill are never reversed


financial assets and financial liabilities

purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the tradedate at fair value financial assets
are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred
and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership

the group classifies its financial assets in the following categories financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
loans and receivables and available for sale financial assets the classification is determined at initial recognition and
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired


financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading or initially designated in this
category derivatives are categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges all derivatives held by
the group are classified as financial assets at fair value trough profit or loss as hedge accounting is not applied by the
group derivatives in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months
otherwise they are classified as noncurrent when the derivatives have a negative value they are classified as
financial liabilities held for trading liabilities in this category are classified as current liabilities if expected to be settled
within 12 months otherwise they are classified as noncurrent gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value
of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are presented in the statement of comprehensive
income in the period in which they arise



53                                                                                           pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

loans and receivables
loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market and not held for sale the groups loans and receivables comprise trade and loan receivables loans and
receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method they are included in current
assets except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period these are classified as non
current assets trade receivables are recorded at cost which corresponds to their fair value loans granted which have
a maturity date are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method loans lacking a maturity date are
valued at cost


availableforsale financial assets
availableforsale financial assets are nonderivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any
of the other categories they are included in noncurrent assets unless the investment matures or management intends
to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period availableforsale financial assets are initially
recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are subsequently valued at fair value unquoted securities for which
fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost changes in the unrealized fair value of availableforsale
financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income changes in fair value are recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income when the asset is sold or when it has been impaired the availableforsale financial assets
held by the group comprise unquoted securities valued at cost there is no active market for the securities and pvo
has no intention to dispose of these securities


cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand deposits held at call with banks and other shortterm highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less


impairment of financial assets
the group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or
group of financial assets is impaired a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment
losses are incurred in the statement of comprehensive income only if there is objective evidence of impairment if in a
subsequent period the fair value of an availableforsale financial asset increases the impairment loss of an equity
instrument is not reversed through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income the group recognises an
impairment of trade receivables if there is objective evidence that the receivable will not be paid in full


financial liabilities
financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred financial liabilities are
subsequently carried at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the
redemption value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method




54                                                                                           pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is
probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down in this case the fee is deferred until the drawdown
occurs to the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down the fee
is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates

derivative instruments are recognised as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss these are recognised
similarly as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss they are included in noncurrent liabilities unless the
liability is settled within 12 months of the end of the reporting period


derivative instruments
derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re
measured at their fair value the method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is
hedge accounted

teollisuuden voima oyj tvo a joint venture of the group is consolidated using the equity method see associates
companies and joint arrangements under the notes to the financial statements tvo uses derivative instruments to
hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk in fuel purchases as well as the foreign currency risk and interest rate
risk in borrowings denominated in foreign currencies hedge accounting according to ias 39 is applied to foreign
currency forward contracts and cross currency swap contracts hedging foreign currency risk in procurement contracts of
uranium in addition hedge accounting is applied to some of the interest rate swap contracts entered into hedging the
fluctuations in cash flows of interest payments on borrowings tvo documents its assessment both at hedge inception
and on an ongoing basis of whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item

tvo applies both cash flow and fair value hedge accounting the effective portion of changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and
presented in the revaluation reserve the gain or loss on the fair value of the hedge instruments relating to the
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within finance income and
costs unless they are capitalized as a part of an investment in a power plant changes in fair values accumulated in
equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss when a hedging
instrument expires or is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting any cumulative gain
or loss existing in other comprehensive income at that time are recognised in profit or loss during the maturity of the
hedging instrument when a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss that was
reported in equity is immediately recognised in the income statement

tvo applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on borrowings that are quoted the gain or loss
relating to the effective portion of interest derivatives hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in the profit or loss
within finance costs the carrying amount of hedged borrowings and fair values of derivatives hedging them are
considered part of interest bearing liabilities and assets if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting
the adjustments to the carrying amount of a hedged borrowing is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity

tvo presents fair value changes relating to nonhedge accounted interest rate options and certain interest rate swaps
within finance costs as regards those are not capitalised in the cost of the power plant under construction




55                                                                                       pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

other companies in the group have derivative instruments that do not fulfil the hedge accounting criteria according to
ias 39 examples of these instruments are some interest rate swap agreements which have been used to exchange
floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts hedging the foreign currency
risk in fuel purchases derivatives are recorded at fair value in the assets or liabilities changes in the fair values of
foreign currency forwards and interest rate derivative instruments are recorded through profit and loss within finance
income and costs derivatives are classified as current or noncurrent assets or liabilities depending on their maturity
date


employee benefits

finnish tyel pension system as well as the voluntary pension insurances are recognised as defined contribution
plans a defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate
entity the group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods

incurred defined benefit plans are plans that are not defined contribution plans the group does not have any defined
contribution plans

provisions and contingent liabilities
provisions for environmental restoration asset retirement obligations and legal claims are recognised when the group
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events it is probable that an outflow of resources will
be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated

provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using
a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
obligation the increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense where some or all
of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party the reimbursement is
recognised when and only when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received provisions are not
recognised for operating costs

a contingent liability is disclosed when there is a possible obligation that arises from external events and whose
existence is only confirmed by one or more doubtful future events or when there is an obligation that is not recognised
as a liability or provision because it is not probable that on outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the
obligation cannot be reliably estimated contingent liabilities are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements


environmental provisions
environmental provisions are recognised based on current interpretation of environmental laws and regulations when
it is probable that a present obligation has arisen and the amount of such liability can be reliably estimated
environmental expenditures resulting from the remediation of an existing condition caused by past operations and
which do contribute to current or future revenues are expensed as incurred




56                                                                                      pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

statements include an accrued expense representing the best estimate for the costs of the handling of the ashes held
in temporary storage at the end of the reporting period


asset retirement obligations
an asset retirement obligation is recognised either when there is a contractual or a legal obligation and the obligation
amount and timing can be reliably estimated the asset retirement obligation is recognised as part of the cost of an
item of property and plant when the asset is put in service or when contamination occurs the costs are depreciated
over the remainder of the assets useful life

waste including the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants and final disposal of the spent nuclear fuel

in the consolidated financial statements of tvo the share of the funds in the national waste management fund is
presented as part of noncurrent assets according to ifric 5 the nuclear waste management liability is presented in
provisions within noncurrent liabilities present value of the nuclear waste management liability is calculated by
discounting the cash flows based on the planned estimated future operations and their costs taking into account the
already realized operations

the initial present value of the provision for decommissioning of the nuclear power plant is included in the capitalized
investment cost of the power plant the initial present value is adjusted according to subsequent planned future
changes the cost for decommissioning of the plant is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the power plant

the provisions made for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel at the end of the reporting period covers all the future cost
for final disposal the cost of the final disposal of the spent nuclear fuel is recognised over the time the nuclear fuel is
being used any planned changes are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income based on
the spent nuclear fuel at the end of the reporting period

the time value of money when discounting the nuclear waste management liability is recognised by recording the
interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income

   accounting
   a debt instrument is measured at amortised cost only if the objective of the business model is to hold the financial
   asset for the collection of the contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows under the instrument solely
   represent payments of principal and interest
   all other debt and equity instruments including investments in complex debt instruments and equity investments
   must be recognised at fair value
   all fair value movements on financial assets are taken through the statement of profit or loss except for equity
   investments that are not held for trading which may be recorded in the statement of profit or loss or in reserves
   without subsequent recycling to profit or loss in addition debt instruments can be classified at fair value through
   other comprehensive income according to entitys business model
   based on the preliminary assessment prepared by the group the implementation of the standard will not have
   material impact on the classification of financial assets as according to the groups business model financials
   assets are held and contractual cash flows collected

     impairment of financial assets will be based on new expected credit loss method

59                                                                                   pohjolan voima  annual report 2016

  ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers  the iasb has issued a new standard for the recognition of
   revenue this will replace ias 18 which covers contracts for goods and services and ias 11 which covers
   construction contracts
   the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers
   to a customer  so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards
   a new fivestep process must be applied before revenue can be recognised
     identify contracts with customers
     identify the separate performance obligation
     determine the transaction price of the contract
     allocate the transaction price to each of the separate performance obligations and
     recognise the revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied
   based on the preliminary assessment prepared by the group the implementation of the standard will not have
   material impact in revenue recognition
  ifrs 16 leases  ifrs 16 will affect primarily the accounting by lessees and will result in the recognition of almost
   all leases on balance sheet the standard removes the current distinction between operating and financing leases
   and requires recognition of an asset the right to use the leased item and a financial liability to pay rentals for
   virtually all lease contracts an optional exemption exists for shortterm and lowvalue leases
   the income statement will also be affected because the total expense is typically higher in the earlier years of a
   lease and lower in later years additionally operating expense will be replaced with interest and depreciation so
   key ratios like ebitda will change
   under ifrs 16 a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified
   asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration
   based on the assessment prepared by the group the implementation of the standard will affect groups balance
   sheet and statement of profit and loss to some extent as almost all lease contracts will be recognized even
   though the most material lease agreements have already been recognized in the financial statements
 standard interpretation or amendment is not yet endorsed by eu

2 critical judgements in applying the entitys accounting policies and critical
estimations and assumptions
the group management makes judgements in the preparation of the financial statements relating to the selection and
application of the accounting principles these decisions relate specifically to those areas where the effective ifrs
standards allow alternative methods of recording valuation or presentation

the estimates and assumptions made by management in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are
based on the best knowledge at hand at year end estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based
on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances actual results and the detailed background information are followed by management
together with the business units using both internal and external sources of information changes to the estimates and
assumptions are recognised in the financial period in which changes occur and all the future financial periods


legal obligations
management judgement is required to estimate timing and valuation of the legal obligations a provision is recorded
when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events it is probable that an outflow
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated due to inherent
uncertain nature of litigation the actual losses may differ significantly from the originally estimated provision


impairment testing
impairment testing is carried out annually for goodwill and for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives impairment
testing for other assets is performed when there is an indication that the asset might be impaired the recoverable
amounts of cashgenerating units have been determined based on valueinuse calculations these calculations are
based on estimated future cash flows received from the use of the asset or the sale of the asset

pohjola voima operations are based on the costprice method mankala principle according to the companys legal
documents the shareholders of the company are invoiced a price for the energy received which covers fixed and
variable expenses of the operations when testing if the assets are impaired based on the valueinuse the discounted
cash flows correspond except for a few exceptions to the recoverable amount and therefore usually there is no
impairment recorded


environmental provision
operations of the group are regulated by a number of laws and regulations the group is in compliance with all
existing environmental regulations the group has recorded for the industry customary provisions for environment
protection expenses to cover its legal obligations

3 financial risk management

the financial risk management in pohjolan voima group is carried out centrally by the parent company treasury
department under policies approved by the board of directors the groups activities expose it to a variety of financial
risks liquidity risk market risk and credit risk

the objective of the financing function is to ensure the existence of sufficient funds for operative decision making and
to promote the low cost of electricity through its decisions

derivatives are entered into only for hedging purposes pohjolan voima does not apply hedge accounting under ifrs

liquidity and refinancing risks
liquidity and refinancing risks relate to the impact on the companys profit and loss and cash flows if the company is
unable to secure sufficient funding for its operations in addition to sufficient liquid funds and committed credit
facilities pohjolan voima group seeks to reduce refinancing risk by diversifying the maturity of its loans as well as
sources for its funding

in accordance with pohjolan voima groups financing policy the maturity of longterm debt and refinancing is agreed
so that a maximum of 25 of the outstanding debt will fall due within the next 12 months this principle is not applied
on the loans granted by the state nuclear waste management fund

liquidity risk is significantly reduced by the fact that pohjolan voima group invoices shareholders in accordance with
the articles of association the monthly fixed and variable costs

free liquidity is invested prudently and productively in instruments with a duration of up to 12 months the objective is
to diversify investments and these are chosen so that a secondary market liquidity is also ensured in adverse conditions
and so that most of the investments can be realized at a low cost

pohjolan voima group mainly uses the domestic commercial paper programs amounting to 300 million euros in order to
ensure shortterm financing as at 31 december 2016 110 million euros out of the commercial paper program was in
use 31 december 2015 117 million euros

pohjolan voima groups liquidity is secured by the 23 june 2015 entered 300 million euros revolving credit facility which
matures 23 june 2021 the credit facility has two options to prolong the facility and it does not include covenants the
loan facility was fully undrawn as per 31 december 2016 as well as per 31 december 2015

further pohjolan voima signed a total of 4475 million euros of committed credit facilities and a committed bank
guarantee facility of 200 million euros with banks in december 2016 loans drawn from the committed credit facilities
are planned to be used to partially refinance the loan from the state nuclear waste management fund maturing in
2017 as well as pohjolan voimas other bank loans maturing in 2018 the committed credit facilities signed in
december 2016 mature during 2019  2021 the committed bank guarantee facility ensures pohjolan voimas ability to
obtain necessary guarantees deliverable to the state nuclear waste management fund the committed bank
guarantee facility matures in 2019

pohjolan voima groups financial arrangements do no include any covenants

market risk
interest rate risk

changes in interest rates and margins on the interestbearing receivables and liabilities create an interest rate risk the
objective of the interest rate risk management in pohjolan voima is to protect the group against the incease of interest
expenses caused by the increase in the reference interest rates in accordance with the financing policy of the group
the interest rate risk is monitored by means of duration of the loan portfolio for each series of shares the duration of
the loan portfolios of the parent company and subsidiaries are set at the level where the electricity price sensitivity to
changes in interest rates is on an acceptable level considering the individual riskbearing capacity of each series of
shares interest derivatives are used in the management of the duration

currency risk

pohjolan voima group is exposed to foreign currency risk mainly due to fuel purchases coal purchases are made
almost entirely in us dollars because purchase agreements for coal are entered into up to 10 months in advance
before delivery and payment the euro versus dollar exchange rate changes will affect coal prices and thus also impact
the price of electricity produced the weakening of the euro leads to exchange losses and the strengthening of the
euro leads to exchange gains

the changes in foreign exchange rates are hedged for the undelivered contracts pvo hedges only purchases that are
based on signed contracts or that are secured by derivative financial agreements consequently hedging is made on
the date of the derivative contract or on the order date and it covers the period to the expected payment date of the
coal delivery hedging is reversed in line with the payment of delivery batches cost of hedging is allocated to the cost
of each batch of coal and therefore included in the production costs of each production facility if the terms of delivery
of the coal batches are changed the hedging will be changed in line with the change of the terms of delivery

both shortterm and longterm loans are mainly denominated in euros other than the eurodenominated borrowings
are hedged latest at the time when the loan is drawn all pohjolan voima groups loans were eurodenominated in
2016 and 2015

currency swaps forward contracts and options can be used for the currency risk hedging pohjolan voima has not used
any hedging instruments for the currency risk in 2016 and 2015

quantity and a price risk the foreign currency risk is included both in the pricing of the coal as well as the freight

quantities in advance due to the limitations of the shipping season purchases of coal for the production requirements
of the year can be initiated already during the previous year the aim is to time the shipping to the ice free season

also possible to hedge for the price risk by buying a quantity exceeding the annual requirement for coal within the
limits of the storage space available longterm purchase agreements are used not only in order to secure availability of
coal but also to hedge the price risk

fair value estimation
carrying value of receivables and other receivables with variable interest rates are calculated using the effective
interest method this is also a reasonable estimate of their fair value shortterm trade and other receivables
approximate their fair value as the effect of discounting is not significant for these receivables due to their short
maturities

availableforsale investments include investments in unlisted securities which are carried at acquisition cost because
their fair values are not readily available the group has no intention to dispose of these securities

carrying value of longterm loans and shortterm interestbearing liabilities is calculated using the effective interest
method carrying value of loans with variable interest rates is a reasonable estimate of their fair value carrying value
of shortterm interestbearing liabilities approximate their fair value as the effect of discounting is not significant due
to their short maturity fair value of loans with fixed interest rate is determined using a discounted cash flow method
discount rates used are the market interest rates at the closing date which were in between 037  066 02  10


derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value at the
closing date the fair values reflect the prices which pvo would have to pay or would receive if it called a derivatives
contract fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow method using market rates
prevailing at the closing date as the discount rate which were 037  066  02  10  fair values of forward
foreign exchange contracts and swaps are determined using quoted forward rates from contracts with similar duration
pvo does not apply hedge accounting according to ias 39 so the changes in fair values for derivative instruments are
recorded in the statment of comprehensive income

according to ifrs 7 items measured at fair value are classified into three different levels for the notes depending on
how much the fair values are based on market information fair values of instruments categorized as level 1 are based
on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical instruments fair values of level 2 instruments are derived
either directly or indirectly from quoted prices and level 3 of the fair values are determined using input data that is not
based on observable market data only derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet
and they are all in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy

legal proceedings
joint ventures

teollisuuden voima submitted in 2012 a claim and defense in the international chamber of commerce icc
arbitration proceedings concerning the delay and the ensuing costs incurred at the ol3 epr project the quantification
estimate of tvos costs and losses updated in july 2015 is approximately 26 billion euros and covers the period until
the end of 2018 which is according to ol3 plant suppler the starting point of ol3 eprs regular electricity production

the proceedings were initiated in december 2008 by the ol3 epr plant supplier the monetary claim the plant supplier
updated in february 2016 is in total approximately 352 billion euros the sum is based on the suppliers updated
analysis of events that occured through september 2014 with certain claims quantified to 31 december 2014 the sum
includes penalty interests calculated to 30 june 2016 and payments allegedly delayed by tvo under the plant contract
145 billion euros as well as 135 million euros of alleged loss of profit

in november 2016 the icc tribunal made a final and binding partial award in the partial award the icc tribunal
addressed the early period of the project time schedule licensing and licensability and system design this comprised
many of the facts and matters that tvo relies upon in its main claims against the supplier as well as certain key
matters that the supplier relies upon in its claims against tvo in doing so the partial award finally resolved the great
majority of these facts and matters in favour of tvo and conversely rejected the great majority of the suppliers
contentions in this regards the partial award did not take a position on the claimed monetary amounts the arbitration
proceeding is still going on with further partial awards to come before the final award where the tribunal will declare
liabilities to pay compensation

tvo considers its claims to be wellfounded and has considered and found the claims of the supplier to be without
merit the partial award provides material confirmation for the position

on the ol3 epr project as tvo has not received such information it begun leagal proceedings at the end of september
2016 before the commercial court of nanterre in france the aim of this is to urgently obtain this information with a
view to securing the assurances that allt he necessary financial and other resources particularly in relation to the epr
technology capabilities will be allocated for the completion and longterm operation of ol3 epr and that the supplier
arevasiemens will meet all their contractual obligations and liabilities

the companies belonging to the plant supplier consortion areva gmbh areva np sas and siemens ag are jointly
and severall liable for the plant contractual obligations
