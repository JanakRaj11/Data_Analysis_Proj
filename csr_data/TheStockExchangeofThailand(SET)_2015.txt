energy saving
of data center
set is keen on optimizing the efficiency of the computer center to support business to meet this goal
the resource management was put in place to address energy cost efficiency and minimize the impact
to the environment the aim is to reduce energy usage nonrenewable resource consumption
and greenhouse glass emissions implementation included airconditioning system management
wind direction management internal environment management and maintenance

 1    airconditioning system and wind direction management
tropical climate in thailand triggers a large amount
of energy consumption for cooling purpose
to enhance the operation at the computer center
while having less effect to the environment set
installed an airconditioning system with efficient
humidity and temperature control the location of
server rack cabinet was appropriately aligned with
the perforated raised floor cold aisle containment
system was integrated to maintain proper airflow
for the data center equipment this method could
help eliminate a chance of sudden crash as a result
the airconditioning system could work efficiently
in 2014 the power usage effectiveness pue
showed a 15 improvement compared with the
previous year

 2    internal environment management
the optimized temperature and humidity control of cooling system installed has enhanced the efficiency
of servers and equipment it is significant that the environmentally friendly fire extinguishers installed
neither destroy the ozone layer nor cause damage to computer equipment in addition the automatic
lighting control was also installed across the areas

 3    maintenance
the maintenance of electronic devices has been conducted on quarterly basis including cleaning
the airconditioner filter and cooling system which could consequently help save energy and extend
the useful life set has replaced existing monitors and bulbs in the computer center with the led ones
with relatively less energy consumption


                                                                                                        111

 innovation
 for energy saving
 an uptodate technology with high efficiency and energy saving features has been applied by
 factoring in key factors that would drive to longterm cost reduction efficiency set has also placed
 its importance on green technology management which integrated various actions such as using
 tablet devices promoting paperless activity wisely optimizing computer equipment usage travelling
 by ecofriendly vehicles etc

  1    office computer replacement
 in 2014 set laid out a policy to replace all
 desktop computers with portable laptops for
 the sake of longterm energy cost saving
 operational flexibility and preventing damage
 to data in case of power shortage or electricity
 problem



  2    virtualization and cloud services
 set has implemented virtualization and cloud services technologies in the computer center since 2010
 allowing the exchange to optimize its server resource management efficiently in 2014 the server
 consolidation showed that the capability of one virtualization server was equivalent to the performance
 of 12 old servers in addition these technologies have increased the operational stability as they helped cut
 operational cost reduce maintenance cost minimize space usage reduce energy and resource consumption
 as well as reducing the greenhouse gas emissions currently more than 70 of total servers are virtualization
 and cloud services types saving 094 million kilowatt of electricity usage and reducing the greenhouse gas
 emissions by 527 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent per year

green building
with an aim to raise the staff awareness of environment and energy conservation set has placed
its importance on interactive environmental management which focuses on running various
awareness campaigns in addition a green building assessment standard called leadership in energy
and environmental design leed has been applied as a guideline to conduct efficient action plan
in a move to reduce energy consumption and impact to the environment

the airconditioning system with
variable air volume vav feature has             led lighting system
been installed to help stabilize the
temperature within the building at 25         in 2014 set replaced existing lighting system at the computer
degrees celsius which could reduce           center with led ones in a move to reduce energy consumption
power cost and extend the useful life         and reduce greenhouse gas emissions saving thb 262000
of the airconditioners                      per year or a 20 decrease

    energy saving campaign
to raise staff awareness regarding energy conservation set has launched various campaigns including
taking stairs instead of elevator and energy saving talk engaging staff to exchange views on how they
save and reduce energy consumption in 2014 power consumption within the office building was 6666944
kilowatts and 4066056 kilowatts at the computer center consuming 10733000 kilowatts in total or a
042 decline from a year earlier the greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 2525 tons carbon dioxide
equivalent per year

the water pressure has been reduced
by 50 to save energy but the users still felt similar flow in 2014 water usage dropped
by 1320 from the previous year to 58916 cubic meters while the greenhouse gas
emissions was reduced by 024 metric ton carbon dioxide equivalent per year


                                                                                                          113
