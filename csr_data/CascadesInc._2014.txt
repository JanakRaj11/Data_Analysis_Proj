lowest rate possible


this exercise allowed cascades to gain a clear picture of which of its units offered an employee
assistance program and a physical activity program previously the company had no data
concerning these aspects


                   the results confirmed
                       that virtually
                   all plants

                 but that physical activity programs were much less common
                    there is therefore room for improvement in this area
