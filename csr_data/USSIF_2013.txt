   of 374 trillion driven in part by the growing number of institutional asset owners that consider governance
   issues in investment analysis and the dramatic expansion in the number and assets of mutual funds and
   alternative funds that consider environmental social and governance criteria

   the 2012 edition also included several improvements or changes over previous editions for example the
   report provided more context about why sustainable and responsible investment matters as well as a more
   comprehensive summary of the evolution and practice of sustainable and responsible investing across a
   range of asset classes

   landing page wwwussiforgtrends which compiled all relevant information about the report into one
   section the page also featured testimonials from industry leaders about the importance of the trends
   report as well as infographics to visually convey important facts from the report both these features helped
   make the report more accessible to those who are unfamiliar with sustainable and responsible investing in

   staff travel us sif staff is strongly encouraged to use public transportation or other shared rides whenever
   possible when commuting to work or travelling on us sif business us sif participates in the washington
   metropolitan area transit authoritys smartbenefits program which allows employees to pay for public
   transportation expenses with pretax income us sifs central office location adjacent to three major subway
   lines and bus transportation as well as a shared bike service provides incentive for its employees to use public
   transportation and all of them did in 2012 on business travel train use is promoted over air travel for short
   trips detailed information on staff travel appears in the analysis of the organizations carbon footprint below

   recycling and waste reduction us sif recycles office paper cardboard drink containers and other items
   including toner cartridges for its printers it also uses partially recycled paper us sif donates or responsibly
   recycles all used electronic equipment us sif staff and guests also use nondisposable drink containers
   plates and utensils and us sif staff composts its coffee grounds us sif offers electronic versions of all of its
   marketing research reports and other print materials to minimize paper use and limits print materials whenever
   possible the default setting on all us sif printers is doublesided more information on us sifs paper use
   appears in the review of its carbon footprint below

   environmental considerations for events us sif considers the sustainability initiatives of the
   prospective venues it reviews during the site selection process for conferences these considerations include
   energy use use of renewable energy green building certifications water use recycling and waste management
   use of local organic food food donations stakeholder relations and labor practices us sif also weighs whether
   a site is compliant with the green hotel initiative and whether it has calculated its carbon footprint with the goal
   of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions at event venues us sif encourages attendees to recycle and makes
   recycling as easy as possible it also seeks to choose sustainable organic and fair trade products in menu
   selections and avoids using bottled water at its events

   carbon footprint as advised by the global reporting initiative us sif used the greenhouse gas protocol
   ghg protocol developed by the world resources institute wri and the world business council for
   sustainable development to calculate its greenhouse gas emissions in particular it used the ghg protocols
   guidance for small officebased businesses working 9 to 5 on climate change us sif has no direct
   emissions under the ghg protocol all of us sifs emissions are indirect scope three emissions as us sif
   does not own its office space leasing it from a third party and does not own corporate cars or jets us sif
   focused measurements of its indirect emissions in four primary areas employee commuting business travel

commuting except for one employee who walked to work all us sif employees used public transportation
to commute in 2012 only two employees used car travel for a portion of their commute to get to the subway
although one of the employees only commuted on average three days per week and another employee only
commuted an average of four days per week each us sif staff member was granted three to five weeks of
vacation leave per year in addition to sick leave as well as the equivalent of two weeks federal holiday leave
therefore total miles in the table above are based on a 46week work year

employee workrelated travel us sif employees are required to file trip reports for all businessrelated
travel using these reports us sif was able to calculate mileage for all types of travel except some car travel
completed without receipts from car rental companies and some travel by public transport whenever possible
mileage estimates were made using google maps and other methods to arrive at the totals in the accompanying

emissions factors were drawn from the department of energys energy information administration


office energy consumption us sif leases office space in the barr building located in farragut square
at 910 17th street nw suite 1000 washington dc 20006 in 2012 the barr building used 1931738 kilowatt
hours kwh of electricity for its 92411 square feet or 2090 kwh per square foot us sif occupies 2235
square feet of space of the 92411 square feet serviced by the main meter based on these assumptions we
estimate that us sif used 46720 kwh in 2012 using the average emissions factor for our region 00001002
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour per the environmental protection agency we
estimated that the carbon footprint for the us sif office from electricity use was 4681 metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent co2e in 2012 there are several imperfections to this calculation that need to be improved
upon in future reporting first this did not account for us sifs use of common areas in the building second

   160 reams of paper in the production of marketing materials reports                                      travel
   business cards and daytoday office paper consumption the
   average weight of a ream of paper is 26 kilograms per ream and the
   carbon footprint for recycled content which us sif used is 1907
   kilograms of co2e per kilogram of paper consumed using these
   assumptions the carbon footprint of us sifs paper use was 0793
   metric tons of co2e

   total based on our calculations and assumptions us sifs carbon footprint is the equivalent of 14074 metric
   tons of co2e a breakdown of the primary contributors to this total appears in the accompanying pie chart

   room for improvement us sif does not currently have a strategy for reducing its carbon footprint aside
   from following its present strategies for limiting energy consumption travel and paper use

   eeo policy us sifs antibias policy states that it shall not discriminate and shall take affirmative action to
   ensure that it conducts all business without regard to a persons race color religion gender age affectional or

                   relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order
                   to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing
                   an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control accordingly we express no such opinion
                   an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
                   of significant accounting estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
                   the consolidated financial statements

                   we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
