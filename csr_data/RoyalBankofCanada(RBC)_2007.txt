towards
sustainability




in corporate responsibility circles much ink has been spilled    organizations ngos analysts and investors would like us to
debating economist milton friedmans famous dictum the           drill down and provide much more detail on issues specific to
business of business is business in my view a companys        their concerns
first responsibility is to be a successful business              as a result rather than continuing to produce a single block
but i also believe that companies will better ensure their        buster print report rbc will be moving towards more tailored
longterm viability when they also pay attention to the present   sustainability reporting geared to stakeholder needs we will
and future interests of stakeholders such as clients employ     strive to provide an appropriate level of detail on issues that
ees investors and communities in fact this is the heart of     are relevant to each stakeholder in the format that is most
sustainability                                                 appropriate to them
over the years more and more companies around the world          we are not only in the electronic age but in an era where we
have started to produce reports like this onewith some even      must use the planets natural resources wisely as such the
hitting the 200page mark these reports reflect the growing      cornerstone of our reporting will be online and we will use
belief that a companys value cannot be judged solely on one      this annual print report to provide a summary of our activities
quarters financial results but should go beyond the bottom      we include corporate responsibility information in our
line and include a longerterm view of how those results were     annual report as well as in other communications vehicles
achieved this includes the companys economic impact its        finally we will continue to enhance our communications with
business and workplace practices and its impact on society       ngos and provide detailed direct reporting to analysts and
and the environment                                              researchers from the ethical investment community

you might notice that this publication is shorter than in past    by using the contact information on the outside back cover
years but a shorter report does not mean that we have been
less responsible in fact it is just the opposite               gordon m nixon
corporate responsibility is less about words and more about
deeds and we continue to move towards sustainability while
producing strong financial results
but over the years we have learned that the main readers
of this report  our employees and clients  prefer a succinct
overview about the main issues facing our company we             president and chief executive officer

the environmental data reported here has been provided to rbc by thirdparty suppliers vendors and service providers we continue to work to
improve the reliability of the environmental data we receive so that it accurately reflects rbcs entreprisewide soft footprint there are variations
between the 200405 data reported here and the equivalent data provided in our 2005 corporate responsibility report these variations are a result
of our ability to capture and report on a greater proportion of rbcs operations a change in greenhouse gas emission factors by the wbcsd and the
quality of environmental data reported to rbc by our service providers we expect that these figures will continue to change as our soft footprint
program is more fully implemented and we will continue to report any such changes
