                                             and oﬃcial announcements
                                             environmental accounting is a means to publicize and quantitatively sum up the economic advantages accompanying environmental
                                             conservation measures and the beneﬁts of environmental conservation costs and activities and what we publicize in the environmental
                                             report fulﬁlls our commitment to explain business activities to our various stakeholders

                                                        establishing a quantitative evaluation summary is helpful for sustainable business management practices
                                                 those beneﬁts are summed up quantitatively and published to society as environmental accounting through environmental reports
                                                 evaluation of quantitatively calculated results can also assist our practice of environmental management

                                            able to take suitable environmental measures by deciding the appropriateness of product plans and

 7 eﬀorts to manage chemical substances
 substances that are damaging to the environment are used within products and for the manufactur
 ing of products to improve the quality therefore there are concerns of the great impact this could
 have on the environment during manufacturing use of and discarding of products
 the global consciousness of the environment is growing and requests to reducestop using these
 substances are growing every year from home and abroad
 with this as a backdrop we adhere to the laws and regulations of each country and not only work
 to fulﬁll our customer requests but also promote the management of chemical substances
environmentally damaging substancesby setting our own goals

resulting from industrial operations and strive to reduce this burden by suﬃciently understand

    so far we reached our goal to reduce plant co₂ emissions to an average of 7 during the span of ﬁve yearsfy 2008 to
    fy 2012compared to the level in fy 1990
    starting in fy 2007 the entire calsonic kansei group set a new goal to reduce the amount of co₂ emissions per unit by
    7 by fy 2010 in comparison to fy 2005 convert fuel implement energy saving technologies and equipment and aggres
    sively move toward introducing natural energy for all domestic production plants and aﬃliated production companies
    for our overseas production plants we aim to reduce the amount of co₂ emission per unit by 1 compared to the previ
    ous year by fy 2010 with fy 2005 as a base year
    we also closed the atsugi plant to reorganize our production in fy 2010 this enables us to help reduce co₂ emissions
