change it becomes especially important to strengthen confidence in our business
vontobels relationship of trust with clients employees and the public centres on the
achievement of good performance transparency is equally important  whether it is
in the context of our products our longterm targets or the value we create for our
different stakeholders this sustainability report is designed to once again provide a
transparent account of our commitment to sustainable banking it thus forms an im
portant basis that we can build on in order to preserve and further strengthen the
trust placed in us by our stakeholders both today and in the future

provements to our sustainability performance according to the motto what gets
measured gets done the key sustainability data published here form the basis for
regular performance checks a benchmarking with other organizations in the industry
as well as for the definition of new measures and objectives our targeted approach
is proving effective in terms of our environmental performance in particular in 2012

vious year for example our continued efforts in many fields have resulted in an
overall reduction of approximately 7 in our greenhouse gas emissions

wards the broad integration of sustainability themes into our investment processes

assessment of corporate governance in 2012 at the same time the research team in
asset management further refined its evaluation of sustainability criteria as part of
its equity research activities

the vontobel groups sustainability commitments have also been recognized by ex
ternal organizations one example is the carbon disclosure project cdp in its lat
est study it called on 350 companies in germany austria and switzerland to disclose
information about their strategies measures and results in the area of climate protec
tion by completing a detailed questionnaire vontobel ranked 26th in recognition of
its commitment and its transparent information policy and was the only company
that is not already listed on one of the major indices to qualify for inclusion in the
carbon disclosure leadership index the rating awarded to vontobel by the sustain
ability rating agency inrate was also well above average for both the environmental
and the social dimension and our company was thus classed as sustainable


these and other results provide us with an incentive to strive for continuous improve
ments in the different aspects of our sustainability commitments the information
provided in the following pages show the progress made in the year under review
we will continue to focus on achieving ongoing improvements in all areas of sustain

groups website


focus on clients
at the vontobel group our first priority when conducting our daily business activi
ties is to ensure that our clients are satisfied with our offering we therefore strive to
continuously improve our products and services


in private banking the individual advice offered by vontobel is one of the most im
portant factors underpinning our good relationship with our clients our relationship
managers take time to understand the wishes and needs of each client and they con
duct a structured assessment of their personal circumstances in order to offer them a
service that is tailored to their individual requirements


vontobel continuously expands its range of client services this is partly a response to
the findings of our regular client surveys during the year under review we enhanced
our e banking platform to allow clients to place stock market orders around the clock
and to also receive their bank statements electronically since spring 2012 the chief
strategist of the vontobel group monthly informs in short films about key changes in
our investment strategy and the reasons for investment decisions this way we are
providing clients with greater transparency about our investment decisions and in
vestment recommendations


in asset management a new productfocused sales structure has generated im
provements in our client advisory services as a result of focusing on individual prod
uct lines our relationship managers have a detailed knowledge of these products and
can thus offer clients swift access to specialized information this includes the organ
ization of special events at which we supply information about the background to
current investment themes in 2012 clients were given the opportunity to find out

the climate in addition vontobel sought to engage in a dialogue with companies
that finance major infrastructure projects to highlight the importance of the equator
principles  an environmental standard governing largescale projects discussions of
this nature provide our equity analysts with a profound insight into the opportunities
and risks to which each company is exposed at the same time this type of dialogue
paves the way for gradual improvements in standards and the minimization of risks

makes towards building a stable society and protecting the environment in 2012 we
conducted an extensive twoweek campaign entitled power your life for the second
time to raise employee awareness about sustainability issues this varied program
enabled employees to find out more about the topics of mobility nutrition and
health and resources in the workplace they were also able to play an active role by
for example taking an evehicle on a test drive using a pedometer or participating in
an early morning qigong session lunchtime cinema events and presentations as
well as an exhibition about climate neutrality educated employees about the issue of
global change various intranet articles recommended measures that employees can
take on a daily basis in order to put what they have learned during the campaign into
practice the range of offerings attracted a high level of interest and encouraged an
internal discussion about sustainability issues

sion both in absolute terms and per employee this was attributable to various factors
one major contributing factor was the transfer of the banks largest computing centre
to one of the most modern data centres in europe operated by the city of zurich the
new data centre was constructed according to the latest standards for energy effi
ciency and has been certified as a green data centre ensuring maximum energy effi
ciency was a priority not only in the construction of the data centre but also in terms of
its it infrastructure and server management waste heat from the citys nearby refuse
fuelled power station is converted into electricity and used to cool the it infrastruc
ture the waste heat from the server room is fed into the city of zurichs heat supply
network and is used to heat offices as well as around 400 apartments an energy audit
of the second largest building on the vontobel campus was completed during the re

                                                                                               sustainability at the vontobel group




the decision to move out of one office building that was heated via a district heating
network led to a substantial reduction in the use of this category of energy since the
employees who worked in this building moved to other existing premises there was no
subsequent increase in fuel usage as a result heating consumption per employee
based on ftes decreased by around 10  representing a significant reduction


business travel per employee decreased by almost 8 the proportion of business rail
travel rose from 4 to 7 while the volume of air travel declined by around 3 per
centage points this switch from air to rail travel is in line with our travel policy of en
couraging employees to take the train for shorter journeys paper consumption de
clined by around 11 both in absolute terms and per employee this reflects a
reduction in the size of the print runs for our publications as well as a decrease in the
amount of paper used by employees for printing and photocopying purposes 99 of
the paper used now bears the fsc label or has been produced using recycled paper


water consumption was reduced by almost 9 both in absolute terms and per fte
this was largely due to the relocation of the computing centre which requires substan
tially less cooling water at the new site the energy audit of the second largest building
on the campus also contributed to this reduction since it not only led to a decline in
electricity usage but also in water usage by the ventilation system the refuse volume
declined by 7 mainly reflecting a fall in the amount of waste paper this decrease is
linked to the reduction in paper consumption since paper accounts for a major part of
vontobels recycling the decrease in the volume of waste paper also led to a slight fall
in the recycling ratio


thanks to reduced resource consumption in practically all areas greenhouse gas emis
sions per employee declined once again they fell by approximately 7 in 2012 com
pared to the previous year lower levels of business travel were the main reason for this
decrease although the reductions in electricity and heat consumption were also con
tributing factors the entire vontobel group has been carbon neutral since 2009 in
conjunction with our established partner southpole vontobel purchased emissions re
duction certificates that are equivalent to our annual global co 2 output in order to
fully offset all our greenhouse gas emissions the proceeds from the purchase of the
certificates enable companies in developing countries and emerging markets to con
duct renewable energy projects the emissions are offset via the following schemes a
geothermal project in turkey the construction of micro hydropower stations in rural
areas of china and the building of various wind parks in india detailed information on
these individual projects is available on vontobels website


when renovating office premises vontobel focuses on the use of green building meth
ods and on ensuring that its offices can be operated in an energyefficient manner for
example the new building in geneva that vontobel has occupied since the end of 2012
is equipped with the latest generation of led lighting the amount of electricity used
with this type of lighting is around onequarter lower than with the best fluorescent
lighting currently available on the market energy factors are also a major considera
tion in the renovation of the new office building at bleicherweg

sustainability at the vontobel group




                                         during the year under review the vontobel staff restaurant began purchasing chicken
                                         from swiss suppliers which means that virtually all categories of meat served there are
                                         now sourced from within switzerland this reduces the distance over which food has to
                                         be transported and guarantees higher animal welfare standards in addition fairtrade
                                         coffee is now available in the central cafeteria which contributes to a more sustainable

                                         forts to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions its main areas of focus are
                                         fewer products that are transported by air fewer products from greenhouses that are
                                         heated using fossil fuels less meat lower energy consumption and less waste the first
                                         stage in this process was the completion of an expert audit in 2012 which indicated
                                         the main areas in which action needs to be taken


                                         social responsibility generates added value
                                         there is a long tradition of social responsibility at the vontobel group the bank is part
                                         of the global economic system and benefits in particular from the excellent operating
                                         conditions in its swiss home market in terms of high standards of education a good in
                                         frastructure and political stability vontobel therefore considers it important to make a
                                         contribution that will benefit society


                                         the payment of corporate taxes each year is one important way in which we assume
                                         our social responsibilities compared to the previous year value creation increased
                                         slightly in 2012 yet tax contributions were lower than in 2011 the dividend distrib

bank vontobel supports cultural environmental and educational activities by provid
ing donations and sponsorship funding as a founding member of the climate foun
dation switzerland vontobel once again provided funding for several climate protec
tion projects conducted by swiss small and mediumsized enterprises in 2012 the
climate foundation helped a dye factory to install a heat recovery unit for one of its
ovens thus significantly reducing the use of fossil fuels in addition support was pro
vided to a company that uses vegetable waste which is heated to produce vegetable
coal that improves nitrogen and co 2 fixing in the soil in 2012 vontobel made dona
tions and grants totalling chf 431000


it is not only monetary contributions that are beneficial society can also profit from
the transfer of knowledge a number of vontobel employees share their financial ex
pertise with others by giving talks and presentations at training events that are held
either internally or by external organizations the vontobel group believes it has a
duty to make its financial knowhow available to employees as well as to broader sec
tions of society in order to create greater public understanding of the complex inter
relationships within the financial markets and of the importance of the finance indus
try for the swiss economy


the vontobel group purchases a large quantity of products and services  ranging
from cleaning services and it equipment to the design and production of printed ma
terials  from external providers we therefore assign considerable importance to en
suring that our own sustainability principles are upheld by our business partners this
includes guaranteeing high employment standards respecting human rights making
careful use of natural resources and preventing corruption these principles are also
reflected in our general purchasing conditions as well as the more detailed purchas
ing guidelines


the vontobel group is involved in various organizations that promote a more sus
tainable approach to business within the finance industry and has signed the relevant
declarations in this way we actively support the sustainable development of both
the financial system and the economy as a whole


as a member of the sustainability forum zurich tsf vontobel was actively in
volved in drafting a paper that contains a vision for how switzerland can become a
leading sustainable financial centre drawing on interviews with experts a bench
marking analysis with other financial centres and research based on existing litera
ture various strategic directions and measures were defined to support the realiza
tion of this goal the report which was produced in conjunction with sustainable
finance geneva forms the basis for a dialogue with stakeholders that will enable
these theories and measures to be refined
