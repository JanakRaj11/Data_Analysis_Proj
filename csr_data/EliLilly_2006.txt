way to help contain overall health care costs as a re
sult society benefits as health care solutions become
more costeffective and people live longer healthier
and more active lives

at lilly we believe that relying on the judgment of
health care decisionmakers who provide and pay
for health care is the way to fully realize the value of
pharmaceuticals excessive or inappropriate govern
ment regulations including cost controls stifle the
innovation necessary to bring the next generation
of lifesaving drugs to customers applying market
principles to the health care system can ensure the
delivery of highquality lowercost health care by
encouraging innovation and efficiency which ulti
mately benefit patients

integrated approach to health care
in keeping with our commitment to provide cus
tomers with effective results and lower costs lilly
encourages the transition from the current compo
nentbased health care system to a comprehensive in
tegrated health care delivery system the traditional
approach of trying to control costs of each treatment
element ignores the fact that limitations on one ele
ment may lead to increased patient morbidity andor
mortality with a resulting increase in total health
care costs

for example while a new drug may cost more than
an older one the benefits of the new therapy may
far outweigh this increased expense by eliminating
other expenses such as hospitalization we believe
that the best approach to treatment is to consider the
whole patient and to use whatever combination of
interventions and therapies is most likely to produce
optimal clinical and economic results no element of
the health care delivery process can work alone
