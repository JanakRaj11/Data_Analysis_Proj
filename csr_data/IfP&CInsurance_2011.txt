                                 we have worked actively and successfully with environmental
                                 issues for many years the core of our environmental policy is
                                 that if shall always find the best solutions not only for the

                                 out a long list of activities

                                 year 2010
                                 we have launched a number of environmentally related insurance
                                 products such as insurance for electric cars in several countries
                                 we have also expanded the insurance protection against natural
                                 hazards in the nordic countries and intensified our work with
                                 raising the awareness regarding the need for environmental
                                 liability insurance

we have finalized our ambitious work with the 100environmental actionpoints one high priority
action point was to reduce our employees business travel which has dropped 35  during the
past three years this was achieved by implementing and increasing the use of video conference
systems which you can read more about under climate  energy

every year we take care of more than 300 000 damaged cars and order reparations of homes and
offices for millions of swedish kronor in order to reduce the environmental impact while handling
this great volume of services we consider requirements related to environmental and climate while
choosing a supplier transport system working materials and methods and waste handling during
2010 we achieved cost savings of hundred million sek by continuous developing of working
methods in car repair shops where damaged plastic parts are being repaired instead of replaced
