switch to geothermal energy in munich
our munich location is one of the biggest in
the group employing around 600 people the
office building in the suburb of unterföhring
has a high level of energy efficiency and since
2005 has been powered exclusively with
electricity from renewable sources in 2010
we took another significant step in improving
the buildings overall environmental perform
ance by changing over to geothermal energy

the energy is provided by the geothermie
projekt unterföhring which is managed by
the local community swiss res contract is
over a power input of 25 megawatts
sufficient to cover the heating and warm water
needs of the entire office building geothermal
energy is generated by extracting hot thermal
water from below the earths surface and
transferring its heat energy to a district heating
network through which it is distributed to 
end users geothermal energy has several
advantages it is fully renewable has a very
favourable co2 footprint and unit prices are
both relatively low and stable moreover
investing in a geothermal plant creates local
employment and economic valueadded

in 2010 some of the voluntary emission
reduction certificates we bought and retired
came from a project of three smallscale 
runofriver hydropower stations in the sichuan
province of china the three plants sell their
output of fully renewable energy to the central
china power grid substituting electricity
gained from burning fossil fuels ie coal in
addition to reducing co2 emissions and
air pollution the project has also created local
employment initially through construction
work and later through operation and mainte
nance furthermore the power station
contributes to grid stability thus facilitating
economic activity in the area
