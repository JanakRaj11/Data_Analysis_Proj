  na indicates this metric is not currently applicable to the business channels in this country or that data is not currently available to
  report for this metric in this country

 historic emissions for select countries have changed slightly as we have updated our emissions factors to reflect most recently available
2

 emissions factors because we are using 2010 as our baseline for our global carbon goal we applied the factors retroactively to ensure we
 are not misrepresenting any increases or decreases in emissions due to changes in factors rather than actual activity data finally we have
 adjusted our accounting to more accurately apply our renewable energy purchase offsets to our scope 2 emissions as opposed to total
 scope 1 and 2 emissions thus we are rereporting our net emissions to reflect this adjustment

  ur ecoconscious product criteria vary by market but are typically characterized by 30 or more recycled content materials andor
 o
 meeting specific thirdparty environmental standards in europe reported sales numbers generally cover advantage and online business
 channels but not retail

 in 2011 and 2012 select european countries started purchasing renewable certified zerocarbon electricity directly from their utility

 providers this is accounted for as zerocarbon electricity rather than an offset
