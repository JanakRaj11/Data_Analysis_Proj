emirates flies one of the youngest most advanced international jet fleet in the world with an average age of 64 years
the industry average is 113 years from a performance standpoint this translates into an extremely fuelefficient
fleet but how you fly an aircraft can also increase fuel efficiency emirates participates in the inspire programme

navigation service providers and a select group of airlines with the aim of using air traffic management best practices

a clean engine is more efficient
situation
jet engine core washing is part of emirates engineerings routine maintenance programme but increasing the
frequency of engine washing above that specified by the manufacturer is also beneficial it lowers the engines
operating temperature which extends engine life and reduces its fuel consumption
