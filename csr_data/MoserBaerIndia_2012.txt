bio gas plant we have successfully commissioned the
kitchen waste based biogas plant in the close vicinity of
our cafeteria satkar wef14 jun 08

the kitchen waste based biogas plant produces biogas by
using the thermophilic microorganisms that flourish in
extreme environment it produced biogas equivalent of
two cylinders of lpg from kitchen waste on a daily basis
the gas is a mixture of methane 7075 carbon dioxide
1015 and water vapours 510
