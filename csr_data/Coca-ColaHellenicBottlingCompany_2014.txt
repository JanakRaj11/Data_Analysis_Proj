   population of 141 million 70 of which is urbanised with a rapidly developing retail landscape russia has experienced strong
   growth in disposable income albeit with some deceleration in 2013 in the beverage market there are enormous opportunities
   for our business where we are already the leading brand in all core nartd categories

   the last decade has seen us consolidate our position in russia as the undisputed leader across multiple categories since
   2003 we have enjoyed a cagr exceeding 10 by leveraging our broad portfolio of winning brands this has been led by the
   growth engine brand cocacola which has achieved growth of over 54 since 2008 we also have a strong position in juice
   where we are reaping fully the benefits of our acquisition of multon with integration driving strong volume growth and
   increased efficiency through streamlining our beverage range this has resulted in a reduction in the number of required skus
   from 172 in 2010 to 89 in 2013 we also have the largest supply chain infrastructure in the country and we will combine this
   with our brand strength to maximise the opportunity in russias expanding beverage market we will fully leverage our total
   sparkling portfolio including cocacola fanta and sprite while continuing to grow our profitable still drinks business
   launching highmargin products in our juice portfolio these opportunities build on the legacy we created during the sochi
