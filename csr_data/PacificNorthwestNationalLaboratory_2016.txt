awardwinning technologies
in its annual rd 100 awards rd magazine
honored five advancements developed by pnnl
researchers including a few that are providing
the nation with more sustainable resilient
energy sources

power model integrator
energy forecasters working for utilities and other
power organizations currently rely on a combination
of personal experience historical data and their
own preferred forecasting model each model tends
to excel at capturing certain grid behaviors but not
necessarily the whole picture the power model
integrator is a new forecasting tool that delivers up
to a 50 increase in accuracy and the potential to    pnnls power grid integrator has demonstrated up to a
save millions of dollars in wasted energy costs      50 improvement in forecasting future electricity needs
                                                          over several commonly used tools

hydrothermal processing
a new chemical processing system can convert natural substances as diverse as waste treatment sludge
food scraps and algae into a variety of useful fuels the system is remarkably efficient in many cases
converting 99 of a feedstock like algae into fuels including biocrude oil which can then be refined into
aviation fuel
gasoline and
diesel fuel
the process
also produces
another fuel
 methane
gas  as well
as clean water
and useful
plant nutrients
such as nitro
gen phospho
rous and
potassium




                 a new hydrothermal process uses heat and pressure to chemically and physically change algae into
                 biocrude in a matter of minutes
