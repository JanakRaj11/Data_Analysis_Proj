chairmans statement




i
  t is my pleasure once again to welcome you our esteemed shareholders to the 2016 annual general meeting of wema
  bank plc in keeping with my role as chairman board of directors of this enduring institution i will be presenting our
  financial results and the operating environment for the 2016 financial year i will also be sharing with you some of the
banks achievements in 2016

distinguished shareholders fellow directors ladies and gentlemen no one will disagree that the 2016 financial year was a
rather challenging macroeconomic environment to operate under inspite of this i am pleased to say that our bank
delivered on large parts of its strategic goal for 2016 a strong validation of our longterm growth strategy

given perceived systemic headwinds and the changing landscape facing the banking industry it has become imperative to
us as custodians of the bank that we need to do things differently going forward such as leveraging on technology as an
enabler and a key element to the banks business model

wema bank continues to record significant achievements in this area which will culminate in the launch of nigerias first
digital bank this is a testament of our resolve to be the industry leader as far as technology is concerned and it is our belief
that this will help the bank drive value for our customers and you our shareholders in 2017 and beyond

operating environment

global environment  populism reorganising established world order

the global environment in 2016 was fraught with uncertainty first from a chinese economy in transition which then
impacted commodity prices to the growing nationalist movement that has swept through the united states of america and
parts of europe all in the wake of the syrianiraq crisis

according to the international monetary fund imf the global economy in 2016 grew at circa 31 however economic
activity is projected to pick up pace in 2017 increasing by 30 basis points to 34 fuelled by activities in emerging markets
and developing economies though not without the caveat from growing protectionism




   in 2017 we are placing significant emphasis on ensuring
   our customers enjoy quality and convenient banking
   services our commitment to delivering quality service has
   never been greater

tough macroeconomic environment expected to persist in 2017

the nigerian economy contracted in 2016 by 15 as low oil prices and disruption in oil installations counteracted the
governments growth plans in addition to this we witnessed the inability of the central bank of nigeria to significantly
impact price stability through foreign exchange supply as higher food transport and energy prices coupled with low fiscal
and economic activity as well as dampened consumer and investor sentiments

nevertheless there are silver linings for the economy the recent opec deal with some nonopec members to cut about 2
million barrels from daily production in november 2016 sent brent crude prices soaring past the 50barrel mark
57barrel january 2017 it is hoped that this price increase would be complemented by oil throughput providing the
needed tailwinds to improve economic activity in 2017 in addition we expect the government to release its audacious
economic plan particularly towards selfsufficiency and infrastructure

nigerias gdp growth for 2017 according to the imf is forecasted at 08 while inflation in 2017 is expected to trend
downward in the long run in response to adjustments to 2016 policies however this would only be attainable through
clear targeted economic policies while installing and instilling continued institutional reforms

financial scorecard

the bank continued to record improved performances as gross earnings in 2016 grew by 1736 from 4579 billion in
2015 to 5383 billion profit before tax pbt and profit after tax pat increased by 936 and 141 respectively to 327

our opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon

in connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements our responsibility is to read the other
information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated and
separate financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated

auditors responsibilities for the audit of consolidated and separate financial statements

our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes
our opinion reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with isas will always detect a material misstatement when it exists misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated and separate financial statements

as part of an audit in accordance with isas we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit we also

ÿ   identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate financial statements whether
    due to fraud or error design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is
    sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
    from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions
    misrepresentations or the override of internal control

ÿ   obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
    appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group

    doubt on the group and banks ability to continue as a going concern if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists
    we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the consolidated and separate
    financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our opinion our conclusions are based on the
    audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report however future events or conditions may cause the
    group and bank to cease to continue as a going concern

ÿ   evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the consolidated and separate financial statements
    including the disclosures and whether the group and banks financial statements represent the underlying
    transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation

ÿ   obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
    within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements we are responsible for
    the direction supervision and performance of the groups audit we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion

we communicate with the audit committee and the directors regarding among other matters the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit

we also provide the audit committee and directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable related safeguards

from the matters communicated with the audit committee andor the directors we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters we
describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when in extremely rare circumstances we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the benefits derivable from such
communication

         based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
         circumstances the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets
         and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these
         estimates

         estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates
         are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected

3   significant accounting policies

         the accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented in these
         financial statements

    a business combination

         business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date which is
         the date on which control is transferred to the bank control is the power to govern the financial and
         operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities in assessing control the bank takes
         into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable

         the bank measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the total of

         ÿ the fair value of the consideration transferred plus
         ÿ the recognized amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree plus if the business combination
            is achieved in stages the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquire less
         ÿ the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
            assumed

         when this total is negative a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss the bank
         elects on a transactionbytransaction basis whether to measure noncontrolling interest at its fair value or
         at its proportionate share of the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets at the acquisition date the
         consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of preexisting relationships




72 2016 annual report

                                                                          notes to the financial statements


          such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss transactions costs related to the acquisition other
          than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the bank incurs in connection with a
          business combination are expensed as incurred any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair
          value at the acquisition date if the contingent consideration is classified as equity then it is not remeasured
          and settlement is accounted for within equity otherwise subsequent changes in the fair value of the
          contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss

    b foreign currency

    the financial statements are presented in nigerian naira which is the banks functional and reporting currency
    transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rates effective at the date of the
    transaction monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are adjusted
    to the functional currency at the spot exchange rates effective at the reporting date the foreign currency gain or
    loss on monetary items is the difference between the amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of
    the period adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period and the amortised cost in the foreign
    currency translated at the exchange rate effective on the reporting date nonmonetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the
    exchange rate effective at the date that the fair value is determined foreign exchange differences arising on
    translation are recognised in profit or loss

c interest

    interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method the effective
    interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the
    expected life of the financial asset or liability or where appropriate a shorter period to the carrying amount of
    the financial asset or liability when calculating the effective interest rate the bank estimates future cash flows
    considering all contractual terms of the financial instruments but not future credit losses

    the calculation of the effective interest rate includes contractual fees transaction costs and points paid or received
    and discounts or premiums that are an integral part of the effective interest rate transaction costs include
    incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition issue or disposal of a financial asset or liability

    interest income and expense presented in the statement of comprehensive income include

     interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated on an effective interest
    rate basis
     interest on availableforsale investment securities calculated on an effective interest basis
     the effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash flow hedges of
    variability in interest cash flows in the same period that the hedged cash flows affect interest incomeexpense
     fair value changes in qualifying derivatives including hedge ineffectiveness and related hedge items in fair value
    hedges of interest rate risk

    interest income and expense on all trading assets and liabilities are considered to be incidental to the banks
    trading operations and are presented together with all other changes in the fair value of trading assets and
    liabilities in net trading income

    fair value changes on other derivatives held for risk management purposes and other financial assets and
    liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss are presented in net trading income from other financial
    instruments at fair value through profit and loss in the statement of comprehensive income

d fees and commission

    fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or
    liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate

    other fees and commission income including account servicing fees investment management and other
    fiduciary activity fees sales commission placement fees and syndication fees are recognised as the related




                                                                                           73 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements


     services are performed when a loan commitment is not expected to result in the drawdown of a loan loan
     commitment fees are recognised on a straightline basis over the commitment period

    other fees and commission expense relates mainly to transaction and service fees which are expensed as the
    services are received

e net trading income

    net trading income comprises gains less losses related to trading assets and liabilities and includes all realised and
    unrealised fair value changes dividend and foreign exchange differences

f dividend income
      dividend income is recognised when the right to receive income is established usually this is the exdividend date
      for equity securities dividends on trading equities are reflected as a component of net trading income or other
      operating income based on the underlying classification of the equity investment dividend income on available
      forsale securities are recognised as a component of other operating income

g leases

    lease payments

    payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straightline basis over the term of the
    lease lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the
    lease

    minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the
    reduction of the outstanding liability the finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to
    produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability

    contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of
    the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed

    leased assets  lessee

    leases in terms of which the bank assumes substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are
    classified as finance leases upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower
    of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments

    subsequent to initial recognition the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to
    that asset

    assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the bank at their fair value at the inception of
    the lease or if lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments the corresponding liability to the lessor
    included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation

    lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve
    aconstant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability

    assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned
    assets

    however when there is no reasonable certainty that ownership will be obtained by the end of the
    lease term assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives
    other leases are operating leases and except for investment property the leased assets are not recognised in the




74 2016 annual report

                                                                            notes to the financial statements


    banks statement of financial position

    bank as the lessor

    when acting as lessor under finance lease the present value of the minimum lease payments discounted at the
    rate of interest implicit in the lease is recognized as a receivable the difference between the total payments
    receivable under a finance lease and the present value of the receivable is recognised as an unearned income and
    subsequently recorded as finance income over the life of the lease finance charges earned are computed using
    effective interest method which reflects a constant periodic return on the investment in the finance lease initial
    direct costs paid are capitalized to the value of the lease amounts receivable and accounted for over the lease term
    as an adjustment to the effective rate of return

h taxation

    income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or
    loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income

    i current tax

    current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income or loss for the year using tax rates enacted or
    substantively enacted at the financial position date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous
    years current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends

    ii deferred tax

    deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes deferred tax is not
    recognised for

          ÿ temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
               combination and that affects either neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss
          ÿ temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will
               not reverse in the foreseeable future and
          ÿ taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill


    the measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the bank
    expects at the end of the reporting period to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities
    deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they
    reverse using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and
    assets and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax
    entities but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will
    be realised simultaneously

    additional taxes that arise from the distribution of dividend by the bank are recognised at the same time as the
    liability to pay the related dividend is recognised

    a deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the
    extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which it can be utilised

    deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
    that the related tax benefit will be realised

    i   financial assets and liabilities
           i recognition

          the bank initially recognises loans and advances deposits debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities
          on the date that they are originated regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on




                                                                                              75 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements


          the trade date at which the bank commits to purchase or sell the assets all other financial assets and
          liabilities including assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are initially
          recognised on the trade date at which the bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
          instrument a financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value for an item not at fair value
          through profit or loss transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue are recognised
          as part of the initial cost of financial asset or liability

     ii classification
     the bank classifies its financial assets in one of the following categories

           ÿ loans and receivables
           ÿ held to maturity
           ÿ availableforsale or
           ÿ at fair value through profit or loss and within the category as
           ÿ
      held for trading or
      designated at fair value through profit or loss

     see notes 3l m and n

     the bank classifies its financial liabilities other than financial guarantees and loan commitments as measured at
     amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss see notes 3i r and t

iii derecognition

     the bank derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or
     when it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cashflows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks
     and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred or in which the bank neither transfers nor retains
     substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset any interest
     in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the bank is recognised as
     a separate asset or liability in the statement of financial position on derecognition of a financial asset the
     difference between the carrying amount of the asset or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset
     transferred and the sum of i the consideration received including any new asset obtained less any new liability
     assumed and ii any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is
     recognised in profit and loss

     the bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its financial position but retains either
     all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them if all or substantially all
     risks and rewards are retained then the transferred assets are not derecognised from the financial position
     transfers of assets with retention of all or substantially all risks and rewards include for example securities
     lending and repurchase transactions

     when assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets the
     transaction is accounted for as a secured financing transaction similar to repurchase transactions as the bank
     retains all or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of such assets

     in transactions in which the bank neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
     of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset the bank continues to recognise the asset to the extent of
     its continuing involvement determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the
     transferred asset

     in certain transactions the bank retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee the
     transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria an asset or liability is recognised for the
     servicing contract depending on whether the servicing fee is more than adequate asset or is less than adequate
     liability for performing the servicing

     the bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expired




76 2016 annual report

                                                                         notes to the financial statements



    iv offsetting

    financial assets and liabilities are set off and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position
    when and only when the bank has a legal right to set off the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or
    to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously

    income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under ifrss or for gains and losses
    arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the banks trading activity

v sale and repurchase agreements

    securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos remain on the statement of financial position the
    counterparty liability is included in amounts due to other banks deposits from banks other deposits or deposits
    due to customers as appropriate securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos are recorded
    as money market placement the difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued
    over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method

    securities lent to counterparties are also retained in the financial statements securities borrowed are not
    recognised in the financial statements unless these are sold to third parties in which case the purchase and sale
    are recorded with the gain or loss included in trading income

vi amortised cost measurement

    the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured
    at initial recognition minus principal repayments plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective
    interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount minus any
    reduction for impairment

vii fair value measurement

    fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable
    willing parties in an arms length transaction on the measurement date when available the bank measures the
    fair value of an instrument using quoted prices in an active market for that instrument a market is regarded as
    active if quoted prices are readily available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on
    an arms length basis

    if a market for a financial instrument is not active the bank establishes fair value using a valuation technique
    valuation techniques include using recent arms length transactions between knowledgeable willing parties if
    available reference to the current fair value of other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted
    cash flow analysis the chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs relies as little as
    possible on estimates specific to the bank incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in
    setting a price and is consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments inputs
    to valuation techniques reasonably represent market expectations and measures of the risk return factors
    inherent in the financial instrument the bank calibrates valuation techniques and tests them for validity using
    prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on other available
    observable market data

    the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price  ie the
    fair value of the consideration given or received however in some cases the fair value of a financial instrument
    on initial recognition may be different to its transaction price if such fair value is evidenced by comparison with
    other observable current market transactions in the same instrument without modification or repackaging or
    based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets then the difference is
    recognised in profit or loss on initial recognition of the instrument in other cases the difference is not recognised
    in profit or loss immediately but is recognised over the life of the instrument on an appropriate basis or when the
    instrument is redeemed transferred or sold or the fair value becomes observable




                                                                                          77 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements

     assets and long positions are measured at a bid price liabilities and short positions are measured at an asking
     price where the bank has positions with offsetting risks midmarket prices are used to measure the offsetting
     risk positions and a bid or asking price adjustment is applied only to the net open position as appropriate fair
     value reflects the credit risk of the instrument and includes adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the
     bank and the counterparty where appropriate fair value estimates obtained from models are adjusted for any
     other factors such as liquidity risk or model uncertainties to the extent that the bank believes a thirdparty
     market participant would take this into account in pricing a transaction

viii identification and measurement of impairment

     at each reporting date the bank assesses whether there is objective evidence that financial assets not carried at
     fair value through profit or loss are impaired financial assets are impaired when objective evidence
     demonstrates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event has an
     impact on the future cash flows on the asset that can be estimated reliably

     objective evidence that financial assets including equity securities are impaired can include significant financial
     difficulty of the obligor default or delinquency by a borrower resulting in a breach of contract restructuring of a
     loan or advance by the bank on terms that the bank would not otherwise consider indications that a borrower or
     issuer will enter bankruptcy the disappearance of an active market for a security or other observable data
     relating to a group of assets such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers in the group or
     economic conditions that correlate with defaults in the group in addition for an investment in an equity security
     a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below cost is objective evidence of impairment

     the bank considers evidence of impairment for loans and advances and heldtomaturity investment securities at
     both a specific asset and collective level all individually significant loans and advances and heldtomaturity
     investment securities are assessed for specific impairment all individually significant loans and advances and
     heldtomaturity investment securities found not to be specifically impaired are then collectively assessed for any
     impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified loans and advances and heldtomaturity investment
     securities that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together loans
     and advances and heldtomaturity investment securities with similar risk characteristics

     in assessing collective impairment the bank uses statistical modelling of historical trends of the probability of
     default the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred adjusted for managements judgement as to
     whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or less than
     suggested by historical trends probability of default and the expected timing of future recoveries are regularly
     benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure that they remain appropriate

     impairment losses on availableforsale investment securities are recognised by transferring the difference
     between the amortised acquisition cost and current fair value out of equity to profit or loss

     impairment losses on assets carried at amortised cost are measured as the difference between the carrying
     amount of the financial assets and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the assets original
     effective interest rate losses are recognised in profit or loss

     if the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new
     one due to financial difficulties of the borrower then an assessment is made whether the financial asset should be
     derecognised if the cash flows of the renegotiated asset are substantially different then the contractual rights to
     cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired in this case the original financial asset is
     derecognised and the new financial asset is recognised at fair value

ix designation at fair value through profit or loss

     the bank designates financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the following
     circumstances

          ÿ the assets or liabilities are managed evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis
          ÿ the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise
          ÿ the asset or liability contains an embedded derivative that significantly modifies the cash flows that would
           otherwise be required under the contract



78 2016 annual report

                                                                          notes to the financial statements


    the impairment loss is measured as follows

         ÿ if the expected restructuring does not result in derecognition of the existing asset the estimated cash flows
           arising from the modified financial asset are included in the measurement of the existing asset based on
           their expected timing and amounts discounted at the original effective interest rate of the existing financial
           asset
         ÿ if the expected restructuring results in derecognition of the existing asset then the expected fair value of
           the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its
           derecognition this amount is discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date
           using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset

    impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account against loans and
    advances or heldtomaturity investment securities interest on the impaired assets continues to be recognised
    through the unwinding of the discount when an event occurring after the impairment was recognised causes the
    amount of impairment loss to decrease the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss

    if in a subsequent period the fair value of an impaired availableforsale debt security increases and the increase
    can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit and loss the
    impairment loss is reversed with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit and loss however any
    subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired availableforsale equity security is recognised in other
    comprehensive income

    the bank writes off certain loans and advances and investment securities when they are determined to be
    uncollectible

    the amount of each class of financial asset or liability that has been designated at fair value through profit or loss
    will be set out in a note a description of the basis for each designation is set out in the note for the relevant asset or
    liability class

x derivative financial assets

    derivatives are recognised initially and are subsequently remeasured at fair value fair values of exchangetraded
    derivatives are obtained from quoted market prices fair values of overthecounter derivatives are obtained using
    valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models

    derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative
    derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are only offset where there is a legal right of
    offset of the recognised amounts and the parties intend to settle the cash flows on a net basis or realize the asset
    and settle the liability simultaneously

    the method of recognizing fair value gains and losses depends on whether derivatives are held for trading or are
    designated as hedging instruments and if the latter the nature of the risks being hedged

    all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading are recognised in the income
    statement

xi embedded derivatives

    hybrid contracts contain both a derivative and a nonderivative component in such cases the derivative
    component is termed an embedded derivative where the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded
    derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract itself is not carried at fair value
    through profit or loss the embedded derivative is bifurcated and measured at fair value with gains and losses being
    recognised in the income statement

    j cash and cash equivalents

    cash and cash equivalents include notes and coins on hand unrestricted balances held with central banks and




                                                                                            79 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements


    highly liquid financial assets with original maturities of less than three months which are subject to insignificant
    risk of changes in their fair value and are used by the bank in the management of its shortterm commitments

    cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the statement of financial position

    k trading assets and liabilities

    trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that the bank acquires or incurs principally for the
    purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term or holds as part of a portfolio that is managed together for
    shortterm profit or position taking

    trading assets and liabilities are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of
    financial position with transaction costs taken directly to profit or loss all changes in fair value is recognised as part
    of net trading income in profit or loss trading assets and liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial
    recognition except that nonderivative trading assets other than those designated at fair value through profit or
    loss on initial recognition may be reclassified out of fair value through profit or loss ie trading category if they are
    no longer held for the purpose of being sold or repurchased in the near term and the following conditions are met

         ÿ if the financial asset would have met the definition of loans and receivables if the financial asset had not
           been required to be classified as held for trading at initial recognition then it may be reclassified if the
           bank has the intention and ability to hold the financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity
         ÿ if the financial asset would not have met the definition of loans and receivable then it may be reclassified
           out of the trading category only in rare circumstances

l loans and advances

    loans and advances are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted
    in an active market and that the bank does not intend to sell immediately or in the near term when the bank is the
    lessor in a lease agreement that transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an
    asset to the lessee the arrangement is classified as a finance lease and a receivable equal to the net investment in
    the lease and recognised and presented within loans and advances

    when the bank purchases a financial asset and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the asset or a
    substantially similar asset at a fixed price on a future date reverse repo or stock borrowing the arrangement is
    accounted for as a loan or advance and the underlying asset is not recognised in the banks financial statements

    loans and advances are initially measured at fair value plus incremental direct transaction costs and
    subsequently measured at their amortised cost using the effective interest method

m investment securities

    investment securities are initially measured at fair value plus in case of investment securities not at fair value
    through profit or loss incremental direct transaction costs and subsequently accounted for depending on their
    classification as either held for trading heldtomaturity fair value through profit or loss or availableforsale

    i heldtomaturity

    heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity
    that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and which are not designated at fair value
    through profit or loss or availableforsale

    heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any
    impairment losses any sale or reclassification of a significant amount of heldtomaturity investments not close to
    their maturity would result in the reclassification of all heldtomaturity investments as availablefor sale and
    prevent the bank from classifying investment securities as heldtomaturity for the current and the following two
    financial years




80 2016 annual report

                                                                           notes to the financial statements


     however sales and reclassifications in any of the following circumstances would not trigger a reclassification
      sales or reclassification that are so close to maturity that changes on the market rate of interest would not have a
     significant effect on the financial assets fair value

           ÿ sales or reclassification after the bank has collected substantially all the assets original principal
           ÿ sales or reclassification attributable to nonrecurring isolated events beyond the banks control that could
              not have been reasonably anticipated

ii fair value through profit or loss

     the bank designates some investment securities at fair value with fair value changes recognised immediately in
     profit or loss as described in accounting policy i ix

iii availableforsale

     availableforsale investments are nonderivative investments that are not designated as another category of
     financial assets available for sale investments comprise equity securities and debt securities unquoted equity
     securities whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are carried at cost all other availableforsale investments
     are carried at fair value

     interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method dividend income is recognised in
     profit or loss when the bank becomes entitled to the dividend foreign exchange gains or losses on availablefor
     sale debt security investments are recognised in profit or loss impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss

     other fair value changes other than impairment losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and
     presented in the fair value reserve in equity until the investment is sold whereupon the cumulative gains and losses
     previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised to profit or loss as a reclassification
     adjustment

     a nonderivative financial asset may be reclassified from the availableforsale category to the loans and receivable
     category if it otherwise would have met the definition of loans and receivables and if the bank has the intention and
     ability to hold that financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity

n investment properties

     investment properties are properties held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both but
     not for sale in the ordinary course of business use in the production or supply of goods or services or for
     administrative purposes the bank holds some investment property as a consequence of the ongoing
     rationalisation of its retail branch network other property has been acquired through the enforcement of security
     over loans and advances investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
     losses in line with the cost model in ias 16 cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition
     of the investment property

o property and equipment

     i recognition and measurement

     items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses
     cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset the cost of selfconstructed
     assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to
     a working condition for their intended use the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site
     on which they are located where the bank has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site and capitalised
     borrowing costs purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as
     part of equipment

     when parts of an item of property or equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate
     items major components of property and equipment




                                                                                            81 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements




     ii subsequent costs

     the cost of replacing part of an item of property or equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is
     probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the bank and its cost can be
     measured reliably the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised the costs of the daytoday servicing
     of property and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred

     iii depreciation

     depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straightline basis to write down the cost of each asset to their
     residual values over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property and equipment leased assets
     under finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives depreciation begins
     when an asset is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is derecognised or classified as
     held for sale in accordance with ifrs 5 a noncurrent asset or disposal group is not depreciated while it is classified
     as held for sale

    land is not depreciated the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows

    buildings                          50 years
    leasehold properties               over the lease period
    furniture and fittings             5 years
    equipment and machinery            5 years
    computer equipment                 4 years
    motor vehicles                     4 years
    work in progress                   not depreciated

    assets that are subject to depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable an assets carrying amount is written down immediately
    to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount the
    recoverable amount is the higher of the assets value less costs to sell or the value in use

    depreciation methods useful lives and residual value are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
    appropriate

    iv derecognition

    an item of property and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected
    from its use or disposal any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference
    between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the
    asset is derecognised

p intangible assets

    i software

    software acquired by the bank is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
    losses

    expenditure on internally developed software is recognised as an asset when the bank is able to demonstrate its
    intention and ability to complete the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future
    economic benefits and can reliably measure the costs to complete the development the capitalised costs of
    internally developed software include all costs directly attributable to developing the software and are amortised
    over its useful life internally developed software is stated at capitalised cost less accumulated amortisation and
    impairment

    subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits
    embodied in the specific asset to which it relates all other expenditure is expensed as incurred




82 2016 annual report

                                                                           notes to the financial statements


     amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software
     from the date that it is available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the
     future economic benefits embodied in the asset the estimated useful life of software is shorter of 3 years or the
     contractual licensing period

     amortisation method useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial yearend and adjusted if
     appropriate

q impairment of nonfinancial assets

     the carrying amounts of the banks nonfinancial assets other than investment property and deferred tax assets
     are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment if any such
     indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated

     an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the
     recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell in assessing value
     in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that
     reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset

     impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss
     has decreased or no longer exists an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used
     to determine the recoverable amount an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying
     amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or
     amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised

r deposits and subordinated liabilities

     deposits and subordinated liabilities are the banks sources of debt funding when the bank sells a financial asset
     and simultaneously enters into a repo or stock lending agreement to repurchase the asset or a similar asset at
     a fixed price on a future date the arrangement is accounted for as a deposit and the underlying asset continues to
     be recognised in the banks financial statements

     the bank classifies capital instruments as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the
     substance of the contractual terms of the instrument

     deposits and subordinated liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently
     measured at their amortised cost using the effective interest method except where the bank chooses to carry the
     liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

s provisions

     a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the bank has a present legal or constructive obligation that
     can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
     obligation provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects
     current market assessments of the time value of money and where appropriate the risks specific to the liability
     the unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost

     i restructuring

     a provision for restructuring is recognised when the bank has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan
     and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly future operating costs are not
     provided for

     ii onerous contracts

     a provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the bank from a
     contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract the provision is
     measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net
     cost of continuing with the contract before a provision is established the bank recognises any impairment loss on



                                                                                             83 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements


    the assets associated with that contract

t financial guarantees

    financial guarantees are contracts that require the bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a
    loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt
    instrument financial guarantee liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value and the initial fair value is
    amortised over the life of the financial guarantee the guarantee liability is subsequently carried at the higher of
    this amortised amount and the present value of any expected payment when a payment under the guarantee has
    become probable financial guarantees are included within other liabilities

u employee benefits

    i defined contribution plans

    a defined contribution plan is a postemployment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into
    a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts

    obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as personnel expenses in profit
    or loss when they are due in respect of service rendered before the end of the reporting period

    prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments
    is available contributions to a defined contribution plan that is due more than 12 months after the end of the
    reporting period in which the employees render service are discounted to their present value at the reporting date
    the bank operates a funded defined contribution pension scheme for employees in nigeria obligations in respect
    of the banks contributions to the scheme are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account on an annual
    basis the employee and the bank contribute 75 and 175 of basic salary housing luncheon and transport
    allowance respectively to each employees retirement savings account maintained with their nominated pension
    fund administrators

    ii termination benefits

    termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the bank is demonstrably committed without realistic
    possibility of withdrawal to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date
    termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised if the bank has made an offer encouraging
    voluntary redundancy it is probable that the offer will be accepted and the number of acceptances can be
    estimated reliably if benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period then they are
    discounted to their present value

    iii shortterm employee benefits

    shortterm employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
    service is provided

    a liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under shortterm cash bonus or profitsharing plans if
    the bank has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the
    employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably

    iv long term employee benefit staff gratuity scheme

    the bank operates a defined benefit pension plan which requires provisions to be made to a separately unfunded
    plan the cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit
    method

    remeasurements comprising of actuarial gains and losses the effect of the asset ceiling excluding amounts
    included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets excluding amounts
    included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability are recognised immediately in the statement of
    financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through oci in the period in which they

     occur remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods

    past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of

           ÿ the date of the plan amendment or curtailment and
           ÿ the date that the bank recognises related restructuring costs


    actuarial valuation computation was carried out on members excluding directors in the staff gratuity scheme for
    the financial years ended 31 december 2015 and 31 december 2016under the international accounting standard
    19 revised

    the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were
    carried out at 31 december 2016 by bestwole developments limited

    the present values of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost and past service cost were
    measured using the projected unit credit method

    the principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows

valuation method
in accordance with ias 19 the bank has adopted the projected unit credit method using first principles to establish the
values of the accrued liabilities

in calculating the liabilities the method

ÿ     recognizes the company service rendered by each member of staff at review date
ÿ     anticipates that salaries will increase between the review date and the anticipated exit date of member
ÿ     discount the expected benefit payments to the review date

under the projected unit method the liability accrues uniformly whilst the member is in service the liability is divided into
two parts for each serving member namely

ÿ     the accrued past service liability based on service rendered as at valuation date and
ÿ     the future service liability in respect of future service

the defined benefit obligation under this method of valuation is the present value of all accrued benefits as at the
valuation date by reference to all years of service up to that date but computed on projected final total emoluments

the asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions
in future contributions to the plan

the current service cost is the value of benefits acquired by service rendered in the review year it is the projected
contributions for the year using the valuation assumptions these projected benefits are then discounted to the valuation
date at the discounting rate adopted for the valuation

ÿ     the interest cost is the expected increase in liability values in the course of the review year
ÿ     the expected return on plan assets is the expected increase in asset values after allowing for expected increase in
      benefit payments during the year
ÿ     the actuarial gainslosses represent the changes in benefit obligations or fair value of assets arising from changes
      in actuarial valuation assumptions or actual experience deferring from expectation
ÿ     while ignoring any gainslosses the employers net annual cost is the current service cost plus the interest cost minus
      expected return on any planned assets

v contingent liabilities and contingent assets

a contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the bank or the bank
has a present obligation as a result of past events which is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation or the amount cannot be reliably estimated

contingent liabilities normally comprise of legal claims under arbitration or court process in respect of which a liability is not
likely to crystallise

a contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the bank contingent

notes to the financial statements

assets are never recognised rather they are disclosed in the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefit is
probable

w share capital and reserves

     i share issue costs
     incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of an equity instrument are deducted from the initial measurement
     of the equity instruments

     ii dividend on the banks ordinary shares
          dividend on the banks ordinary shares are recognised in equity when approved by the banks shareholders

x earnings per share

    the bank presents basic earnings per share eps for its ordinary shares basic eps is calculated by dividing the profit or
    loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the bank by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding
    during the period diluted eps is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and
    the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares

y segment reporting

     an operating segment is a component of the bank that engages in business activities from which it can earn revenues
     and incur expenses including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the banks other
     components whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the executive management committee to make
     decisions about resources allocated to each segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial
     information is available

z noncurrent assets held for sale
     noncurrent assets and disposal group are classified as held for sale of their carrying amount will be recovered
     principally through a sales transaction rather than through continuing use
         this condition is regarded as met only when the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its
     present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset or disposal group and its
     sale is highly probable management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for
     recognition as a completed sale within one year from date of classification noncurrent assets and disposal group
     classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell

     aa related party transactions
     transactions with related parties are conducted and recorded at arms length and disclosed in accordance with ias 24
     related party disclosures

     ab application of new and revised international financial reporting standards ifrss

     11 new and revised ifrssifrics affecting amounts reported andor disclosures in these financial statements

     in the current year the group has applied a number of amendments to ifrss issued by the international accounting
     standards board iasb that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1st january
     2016

     amendments to ifrs 10 ifrs 12 and las 28 investment entities applying the consolidation exception
     the group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current year the amendments clarify that the
     exemption from preparing consolidated financial statements is available to a parent entity that is a subsidiary of an
     investment entity even if the investment entity measures all its subsidiaries at fair value in accordance with ifrs 10
     the amendments also clarify that the requirement for an investment entity to consolidate a subsidiary providing
     services related to the formers investment activities applies only to subsidiaries that are not investment entities
     themselves
     the application of these amendments has had no impact on the groups consolidated financial statements as the
     group is not an investment entity and does not have any holding company subsidiary associate or joint venture that
     qualifies as an investment entity

                                                                     notes to the financial statements



amendments to ifrs 11 accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations

the group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current year the amendments provide guidance on
how to account for the acquisition of a joint operation that constitutes a business as defined in ifrs 3 business
combinations specifically the amendments state that the relevant principles on accounting for business
combinations in ifrs 3 and other standards should be applied the same requirements should be applied to the
formation of a joint operation if and only if an existing business is contributed to the joint operation by one of the
parties that participate in the joint operation

a joint operator is also required to disclose the relevant information required by ifrs 3 and other standards for
business combinations

the application of these amendments has had no impact on the groups consolidated financial statements as the
group did not have any such transactions in the current year

amendments to ias 1 disclosure initiative

the group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current year the amendments clarify that an entity
need not provide a specific disclosure required by an ifrs if the information resulting from that disclosure is not
material and give guidance on the bases of aggregating and disaggregating information for disclosure purposes
however the amendments reiterate that an entity should consider providing additional disclosures when compliance
with the specific requirements in ifrs is insufficient to enable users of financial statements to understand the impact
of particular transactions events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance

in addition the amendments clarify that an entitys share of the other comprehensive income of associates and joint
ventures accounted for using the equity method should be presented separately from those arising from the group
and should be separated into the share of items that in accordance with other ifrss i will not be reclassified
subsequently to profit or loss and ii will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are
met

as regards the structure of the financial statements the amendments provide examples of systematic ordering or
grouping of the notes

the application of these amendments has not resulted in any impact on the financial performance or financial
position of the group

amendments to ias 16 and ias 38 clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation

the group has applied these amendments for the first time in tne current year the amendments to ias 16 prohibit
entities from using a revenuebased depreciation method for items of property plant and equipment the
amendments to ias 38 introduce a rebuttable presumption that revenue is not an appropriate basis
for amortisation of an intangible asset this presumption can only be rebutted in the following two limited
circumstances

a   when the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue or
b   when it can be demonstrated that revenue and consumption of the economic benefits ofthe intangible asset are
     highly correlated

as the group already uses the straight line method for depreciation and amortisation for its property plant and
equipment and intangible assets respectively the application of these amendments has had no impact on the
groups consolidated financial statements

amendments to ias 16 and ias 41 agriculture bearer plants

the group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current year the amendments define a bearer
plant and require biological assets that meet the definition of a bearer plant to be accounted for as property plant and
equipment in accordance with ias 16 instead of ias 41 the produce growing on bearer plants continues to be
accounted for in accordance with ias 41




                                                                                      89 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements


        the application of these amendments has had no impact on the groups consolidated financial statements as the
        group is not engaged in agricultural activities

        annual improvements to ifrss 20122014 cycle

        the group has applied these amendments for the first time in the current year the annual improvements to ifrss
        2012204 cycle include a number of amendments to various ifrss which are summarised below

        the amendments to ifrs 5 introduce specific guidance in ifrs 5 for when an entity reclassifies an asset or disposal
        group from held for sale to held for distribution to owners or vice versa the amendments clarify that such a change
        should be considered as a continuation of the original plan of disposal and hence requirements set out in ifrs 5
        regarding the change of sale plan do not apply the amendments also clarify the guidance for when heldfor
        distribution accounting is discontinued

        the amendments to ifrs 7 provide additional guidance to clarify whether a servicing contract is continuing
        involvement in a transferred asset for the purpose of the disclosures required in relation to transferred assets

        the amendments to ias 19 clarify that the rate used to discount postemployment benefit obligations should be
        determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds the
        assessment of the depth of a market for high quality corporate bonds should be at the currency level ie the same
        currency as the benefits are to be paid for currencies for which there is no deep market in such high quality corporate
        bonds the market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds denominated in that currency
        should be used instead

in july 2014 the iasb finalised the reform of financial instruments accounting and issued ifrs 9 as revised in 2014 which
contains the requirements for a the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities b
impairment methodology and c general hedge accounting ifrs 9 as revised in 2014 will supersede ias 39 financial
instruments recognition and measurement upon its effective date

phase 1 classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities

with respect to the classification and measurement the number of categories of financial assets under ifrs 9 has been
reduced all recognised financial assets that are currently within the scope of ias 39 will be subsequently measured at
either amortised cost or fair value under ifrs 9 specifically

ÿ a debt instrument that i is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and ii
       has contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding must
       be measured at amortised cost net of any write down for impairment unless the asset is designated at fair value
       through profit or loss fvtpl under the fair value option
ÿ       a debt instrument that i is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual
       cash flows and selling financial assets and ii has contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
       are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding must be measured at fvtoci unless
       the asset is designated at fvtpl under the fair value option

                                                                             notes to the financial statements


ÿ all other debt instruments must be measured at fvtpl
ÿ all equity investments are to be measured in the statement of financial position at fair value with gains and losses
    recognised in profit or loss except that if an equity investment is not held for trading an irrevocable election can be
    made at initial recognition to measure the investment at fvtoci with dividend income recognised in profit or loss

ifrs 9 also contains requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and derecognition
requirements one major change from ias 39 relates to the presentation of changes in the fair value of a financial liability
designated as at fvtpl attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability under ifrs 9 such changes are presented in
other comprehensive income unless the presentation of the effect of the change in the liabilitys credit risk in other
comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss changes in fair value attributable
to a financial liabilitys credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss under ias 39 the entire amount of the
change in the fair value of the financial liability designated as fvtpl is presented in profit or loss

phase 2 impairment methodology

the impairment model under ifrs 9 reflects expected credit losses as opposed to incurred credit losses under ias 39
under the impairment approach in ifrs 9 it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses
are recognised instead an entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses
the amount of expected credit losses should be updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial
recognition

phase 3 hedge accounting

the general hedge accounting requirements of ifrs 9 retain the three types of hedge accounting mechanisms in ias 39
however greater flexibility has been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting specifically
broadening the types of instruments that qualify as hedging instruments and the types of risk components of nonfinancial
items that are eligible for hedge accounting in addition the effectiveness test has been overhauled and replaced with the
principle of an economic relationship retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is no longer required far more
disclosure requirements about an entitys risk management activities have been introduced

the work on macro hedging by the iasb is still at a preliminary stage  a discussion paper was issued in april 2014 to gather
preliminary views and direction from constituents with a comment period which ended on 17 october 2014 the project is
under deliberation at the time of writing

transitional provisions

ifrs 9 as revised in 2014 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018 with earlier application
permitted if an entity elects to apply ifrs 9 early it must apply all of the requirements in ifrs 9 at the same time except for
those relating to

     1    the presentation of fair value gains and losses attributable to changes in the credit risk of financial liabilities
           designated as at fvtpl the requirements for which an entity may early apply without applying the other
           requirements in ifrs 9 and
     2     hedge accounting for which an entity may choose to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of
           ias 39 instead of the requirements of ifrs 9

an entity may early apply the earlier versions of ifrs 9 instead of the 2014 version if the entitys date of initial application of
ifrs 9 is before 1 february 2015 the date of initial application is the beginning of the reporting period when an entity first
applies the requirements of ifrs 9

ifrs 9 contains specific transitional provisions for i classification and measurement of financial assets ii impairment of
financial assets and iii hedge accounting




                                                                                               91 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements



the directors of the company anticipate that the application of ifrs 9 in the future may have a material impact on amounts
reported in respect of the groups financial assets and financial liabilities however it is not practicable to provide a
reasonable estimate of the effect of ifrs 9 until the group undertakes a detailed review

ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers

in may 2014 ifrs 15 was issued which establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers ifrs 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including
ias 18 revenue ias 11 construction contracts and the related interpretations when it becomes effective

the core principle of ifrs 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services specifically the standard introduces a 5step approach to revenue recognition




                                                                                                                 step 5
                                                                                       step 4
           step 1                   step 2                                                                     recognise
                                                              step 3                  allocate the
           identify the              identify the                                                                revenue
                                                              determine                transaction
           contracts               performance                                                                 when or as
                                                              the                      price to the

                                                              transaction              performance
           customer                  the contract                                                                satisfies a
                                                              price                    obligations in
                                                                                                                 performance
                                                                                       the contract
                                                                                                                 obligation



under ifrs 15 an entity recognises revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied ie when control of the
goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer far more prescriptive
guidance has been added in ifrs 15 to deal with specific scenarios furthermore extensive disclosures are required by ifrs
15

the directors of the company do not anticipate that the application of ifrs 15 will have a material impact on the groups
consolidated financial statements

ifrs 16 leases

ifrs 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting treatments for
both lessors and lessees ifrs 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including ias 17 leases and the related
interpretations when it becomes effective ifrs 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an
identified asset is controlled by a customer distinctions of operating leases off balance sheet and finance leases on
balance sheet are removed for lessee accounting and is replaced by a model where a righttouse asset and a
corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by lessees ie all on balance sheet except for shortterm leases
and leases of low value assets

the rightofuse asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost subject to certain exceptions less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability the lease liability
is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date subsequently the lease
liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments as well as the impact of lease modifications amongst others
furthermore the classification of cash flows will also be affected as operating lease payments under ias 17 are presented
as operating cash flows whereas under the ifrs 16 model the lease payments will be split into a principal and an interest
portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively

in contrast to lessee accounting ifrs 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in ias 17 and
continues to require a lessor to classify a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease

furthermore extensive disclosures are required by ifrs 16

as at 31 december 2016 the group has noncancellable operating lease commitments of 0932 miliion ias 17 does not
require the recognition of any rightofuse asset or liability for future payments for these leases instead certain
information is disclosed as operating lease commitments in note 31 a preliminary assessment indicates that these

                                                                            notes to the financial statements


arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under ifrs 16 and hence the group will recognise a rightofuse asset and a
corresponding liability in respect of all these leases unless they qualify for low value or shortterm leases upon the
application of ifrs 16 the new requirement to recognlse a rightofuse asset and a related lease liability is expected to have
a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the groups consolidated financial statements and the directors are
currently assessing its potential impact it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until the
directors complete the review

in contrast for finance leases where the group is a lessee as the group has already recognised an asset and a related
finance lease liability for the lease arrangement and in cases where the group is a lessor for both operating and finance
leases the directors of the company do not anticipate that the application of ifrs 16 will have a significant impact on the
amounts recognised in the groups consolidated financial statements

amendments to ifrs 2 classification and measurement of sharebased payment transactions

the amendments clarify the following

      1 in estimating the fair value of a cashsettled sharebased payment the accounting for the effects of vesting and
         nonvesting conditions should follow the same approach as for equitysettled sharebased payments

      2 where tax law or regulation requires an entity to withhold a specified number of equity instruments equal to the
         monetary value of the employees tax obligation to meet the employees tax liability which is then remitted to the
         tax authority ie the sharebased payment arrangement has a net settlement feature such an arrangement
         should be classified as equitysettled in its entirety provided that the sharebased payment would have been
         classified as equitysettled had it not included the net settlement feature

      3 a modification of a sharebased payment that changes the transaction from cashsettled to equitysettled should
         be accounted for as follows

           i   the original liability is derecognised
           ii  the equitysettled sharebased payment is recognised at the modification date fair value of the equity
                instrument granted to the extent that services have been rendered up to the modification date and
           iii any difference between the carrying amount of the liability at the modification date and the amount
                recognised in equity should be recognised in profit or loss immediately

the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018 with earlier application
permitted specific transition provisions apply the directors of the company do not anticipate that the application of the
amendments in the future will have a significant impact on the groups consolidated financial statements as the group
does not have any cashsettled sharebased payment arrangements or any withholding tax arrangements with tax
authorities in relation to sharebased payments

amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28 sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint
venture

the amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28 deal with situations where there is a sale or contribution of assets between an
investor and its associate or joint venture specifically the amendments state that gains or losses resulting from the loss of
control of a subsidiary that does not contain a business in a transaction with an associate or a joint venture that is
accounted for using the equity method are recognised in the parents profit or loss only to the extent of the unrelated
investors interests in that associate or joint venture similarly gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of
investments retained in any former subsidiary that has become an associate or a joint venture that is accounted for using
the equity method to fair value are recognised in the former parents profit or loss only to the extent of the unrelated
investors interests in the new associate or joint venture

the effective date of the amendments has yet to be set by the iasb however earlier application of the amendments is
permitted the directors of the company anticipate that the application of these amendments may have an impact on the
groups consolidated financial statements in future periods should such transactions arise

amendments to ias 7 disclosure initiative

the amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in
liabilities arising from financing activities the amendments apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1
january 2017 with earlier application permitted




                                                                                              93 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements



the directors of the company do not anticipate that the application of these amendments will have a material impact on the
groups consolidated financial statements

amendments to ias 12 recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses

the amendments clarify the following

     1 decreases below cost in the carrying amount of a fixedrate debt instrument measured at fair value for which the
        tax base remains at cost give rise to a deductible temporary difference irrespective of whether the debt
        instruments holder expects to recover the carrying amount of the debt instrument by sale or by use or whether it
        is probable that the issuer will pay all the contractual cash flows
     2 when an entity assesses whether taxable profits will be available against which it can utilise a deductible
        temporary difference and the tax law restricts the utilisation of losses to deduction against income of a specific
        type eg capital losses can only be set off against capital gains an entity assesses a deductible temporary
        difference in combination with other deductible temporary differences of that type but separately from other
        types of deductible temporary differences
     3 the estimate of probable future taxable profit may include the recovery of some of an entitys assets for more than
        their carrying amount if there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the entity will achieve this and
     4 in evaluating whether sufficient future taxable profits are available an entity should compare the deductible
        temporary differences with future taxable profits excluding tax deductions resulting from the reversal of those
        deductible temporary differences

the amendments apply retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1st january 2017 with earlier application
permitted

the directors of the company do not anticipate that the application of these amendments will have a material impact on the
groups consolidated financial statements


4a key sources of estimation uncertainty

     i allowances for credit losses

     assets accounted for at amortised cost are evaluated for impairment on the basis described in accounting policy i
     viii

     the specific counterparty component of the total allowances for impairment applies to claims evaluated individually
     for impairment and is based upon managements best estimate of the present value of the cash flows that are
     expected to be received in estimating these cash flows management makes judgements about a counter partys
     financial situation and the net realisable value of any underlying collateral each impaired asset is assessed on its
     merit and the workout strategy and estimate of cash flows considered recoverable are independently approved by
     the credit risk function

     collectively assessed impairment allowances cover credit losses inherent in portfolios of claims with similar
     economic characteristics when there is objective evidence to suggest that they contain impaired claims but the
     individual impaired items cannot yet be identified in assessing the need for collective loan loss allowances
     management considers factors such as credit quality portfolio size concentrations and economic factors in order to
     estimate the required allowance assumptions are made to define the way interest losses are modeled and to
     determine the required input parameters based on historical experience and current economic conditions the
     accuracy of the allowances depends on how well these estimated future cash flows for specific counterparty
     allowances and the model assumptions and parameters used in determining collective allowances are made

     ii determining fair values

     the determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price
     requires the use of techniques as described in accounting policy i viii for financial instruments that trade
     infrequently and have little price transparency fair value is less objective and requires varying degrees of judgement
     depending on liquidity concentration uncertainty of market factors pricing assumptions and other risks affecting
     the specific instrument

b critical accounting judgements made in applying the groups accounting policies include

     i valuation of financial instruments

     the groups accounting policy on fair value measurements is discussed under note i viii
     the group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs
     used in making the measurements

     level 1 quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical instrument

     level 2 valuation techniques based on observable inputs either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived
     from prices this category includes instruments valued using quoted market prices in active markets for similar
     instruments quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active or
     other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data

     level 3 valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs this category includes all instruments where the
     valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs could have a
     significant effect on the instruments valuation this category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted
     prices for similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect
     differences between the instruments

     the table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value at the end of the reporting period by the level
     in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised

    ii   financial asset and liability classification

    the banks accounting policies provide scope for assets and liabilities to be designated on inception into different
    accounting categories in certain circumstances

    details of the groups classification of financial assets and liabilities are given in note 6

    iii depreciation and carrying value of property and equipment

    the estimation of the useful lives of assets is based on managements judgement any material adjustment to the
    estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of these items

    iv determination of impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets

    management is required to make judgements concerning the cause timing and amount of impairment in the
    identification of impairment indicators management considers the impact of changes in current competitive
    conditions cost of capital availability of funding technological obsolescence discontinuance of services and other
    circumstances that could indicate that impairment exists the bank applies the impairment assessment to its
    separate cash generating units this requires management to make significant judgements and estimates concerning


                                                                                                 95 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements


      the existence of impairment indicators separate cash generating units remaining useful lives of assets projected
      cash flows and net realisable values managements judgement is also required when assessing whether a previously
      recognised impairment loss should be reversed

      v determination of recognised deferred tax balances

       management is required to make judgements concerning the recoverability of unused tax losses judgement is
       required in determining the estimated future profitability from which tax assets are expected to be realised

restructuring policy

loans with renegotiated terms are loans that have been restructured because the bank has made concession by
agreeing to terms and conditions that are more favourable for the customer than the bank has provided initially the
bank implements restructuring policy in order to maximize collection opportunities and minimize the risk of default

the banks credit committee grants approval for restructuring of certain facilities due to the following reasons

i     where the execution of the loan purpose and the repayment is no longer realistic in light of new cashflows
ii    to avoid unintended default arising from adverse business conditions
iii   to align loan repayment with new pattern of achievable cashflows
iv    where there are proven cost over runs that may significantly impair the project repayment capacity
v     where there is temporary down turn in the customers business environment
vi    where the customers going concern status is not in doubt or threatened

       investment purposes investment properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
       losses in accordance with the cost model investment properties are depreciated over a useful life of 50 years with a nil

ii   on 19 december 2013 the central bank of nigeria issued a circular that all deposit money banks should dispose off all
       the investment properties in their books on or before 30 june 2014 the directors are aware of this directive and all
       necessary efforts is being made to ensure compliance

       although the directors are committed to a plan to sell the asset as directed by the central bank of nigeria the active
       programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has not been initiated hence the sale is not expected to qualify
       for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification

       consequently the assets were not classified as held for sale as the stipulated criteria in ifrs 5 regarding this has
       not been met

in the future we will look at risks affecting the whole of an organization and its place in the community we will address both
upside and downside consequences and our view will be enterprisewide integrated and holistic the result will be a more
intelligent balance between potential benefits and harms we will increase the confidence of stakeholders in our
organizations and make them more resilient in a day and age of increased uncertainty this is the real goal of risk
management  felix kloman

introduction

the business activities that wema bank engages in are by their very nature risky the bank profits from the creation of risk
assets and mitigates losses by the effective management of the risks it assumes consequently risk management drives
and encompasses all our activities and decisions

the banks enterprise risk management erm framework is integrated with its governance and compliance framework
effective governance ensures that risks are understood managed and communicated in an appropriate manner
ultimately the purpose of the banks enterprise risk management functions is to identify measure evaluate monitor
report and control all material risks on a timely basis and to assess the adequacy of our capital and liquidity in relation to
our risk profile and marketmacroeconomic conditions

the board either directly or acting through its committees sets the risk appetite of the bank the board sets this risk
appetite taking into cognizance our strategic objectives and the risks that the organization is willing to assume in the pursuit
of these objectives at all points the board is acutely aware of the fact that while risk appetites and tolerance levels are set
individually for various risks there is a strong correlation amongst several risks and often these risks reinforce each other
our policies and processes are aligned with our risk management strategy and established risk appetite

our employees are encouraged to monitor assess report and actively manage risks within their operational spheres
comprehensive risk registers are maintained and an annual review is undertaken of all business units and process through
the risk and control selfassessment exercise rcsa a culture of personal accountability and integrity is encouraged
throughout the organization and employees are encouraged to report observed wrong doings anonymously through
dedicated whistleblowing channels regular training in all aspects of our risk culture helps to reinforce expected behavior

risks are identified and documented through the banks risk map process which sets out the banks risk profile in relation to
key risk categories in its component business units identified risks are regularly assessed through the banks risk appetite
framework stress testing process and in terms of emerging risks using the basel ii pillar 1 framework our credit
operational and market risks are regularly measured and monitored other pillar 2 risks are measured and provided for
through our internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap

risk management framework and governance

the banks activities and processes involve the identification measurement evaluation acceptance and management of
risk or combinations of risks the board advised by the various board and management risk committees requires and
encourages a strong risk governance culture which shapes the banks attitude to risk we believe that risk management
encompasses the insights delivered by information which facilitate appropriate actions our annual risk cycle is designed to
give management relevant and timely information from which trends can be observed and evaluated

the governance structure supporting our risk cycle is designed to deliver the right information at the right time to the right
people the bank adopts a holistic view in the assessment and management of all major risks we remain vigilant regarding
both known and emerging risks and ensure that we are strong enough to withstand any exogenous shocks our board risk
committees play a critical role in providing oversight of risk management and ensuring that our risk appetite risk culture
and risk profile are consistent with and support our strategy to deliver longterm and sustainable growth

the management of risk is evolving and necessitate a regular review of the effectiveness of each enterprise risk
management component it is in the light of this that the banks erm framework is subject to continuous review to ensure
effective and cuttingedge risk management the review is done in the following ways

ÿ through continuous selfevaluation and monitoring by the risk management and compliance functions in conjunction
   with internal audit

ÿ and through independent evaluation by external auditors examiners and consultants

wema bank runs an automated approach to managing communicating and implementing enterprise risk management
policies and procedures across the bank this provides an integrated and dynamic platform for documenting and
analysing risks developing mitigation plans defining controls and managing continuous risk assessments it provides
clear visibility on key risk indicators assessment results and compliance initiatives we believe that understanding and
managing our risks and continuously improving our controls are central to the delivery of our strategic objectives

balancing risk and return

striking a balance between risk and return aims is to minimize the downside while optimizing the upside with a view to
enhancing shareholders values and transmit confidence to our other capital providers and clients as well as ensure the
overall sustainability of our business every business activity requires the bank to put capital at risk in exchange for the
possibility of earning a return in some activities the level of return is quite predictable whereas in others it can vary over a
very wide spectrum ranging from loss to profit

over the years we have continuously improved our erm framework to focus on where we take risks this helps us to

ÿ   understand the nature of the risks we are taking and the range of possible outcomes under various scenarios
ÿ   understand the capital required to assume these risks
ÿ   understand the range of returns that we can earn on the capital allocated to these risks and
ÿ   attempt to optimize the riskadjusted return on investments

our objective of balancing risk return and capital has led us to enhance substantially our risk management methods to be
able to identify threats uncertainties and opportunities and in turn develop mitigation and management strategies to
achieve a desired outcome

enterprisewide scenario and stress testing

we use robust and appropriate scenario stress testing to assess the potential impact on the groups capital adequacy and
strategic plans our stress testing and scenario analysis programme is central to the monitoring of strategic and potential
risks it highlights the vulnerabilities

the bank has exposure to the following risks from financial instruments

credit risk management

overview

credit risk refers to the probability of loss due to a borrowers failure to make payments on any type of debt credit risk
management is the practice of mitigating losses by understanding the adequacy of a banks capital and loan loss reserves at
any given time

the credit risk management of the bank is mainly concerned with generation of profits which are commensurate with the
risks being undertaken to meet the banks target returns on assets and investment

the credit risk management functions of the bank involve credit analysis and credit quality assurance process principally to
identify and mitigate the risks inherent in the system secondly it involves credit administration and loan review to ensure
that the quality of the aggregate risk asset portfolio is not compromised from disbursement to full payback

credit risk management helps to guide lending officers in balancing the quality and quantity of the loan portfolio of the bank
to achieve earnings objectives while also meeting appropriate credit needs maintaining proper credit standards holding
risk to reasonable limits minimizing losses evaluating new business opportunities adjusting to changes in the regulatory
environment and providing adequate liquidity

the banks credit risk management objective is to enable us have high quality and well diversified risk asset portfolio which
will

ÿ generate profits which are commensurate with the risks and meet the banks target return on assets
ÿ enable the bank to identify potential problem risk assets thus keeping nonperforming assets and chargeoffs to the
    barest possible
ÿ adhere as much as practicable to directives concerning exposure to industriessectors identified to be strategic

to achieve these objectives the bank does the following

ÿ   identify target markets
ÿ   determine its risk appetite and appropriate returns
ÿ   structure and develop products that will meet clients requirements but with minimal risk to the bank
ÿ   manage the risk asset portfolio effectively and efficiently

in wema bank credit risk management is guided by the following




138 2016 annual report

                                                                             notes to the financial statements



trust and integrity

individuals and companies place their funds with us trusting our integrity in managing these funds this integrity flows
through everything the bank does any break in the chain of continuous integrity no matter how small and no matter
where will eventually lead to the decline of the bank  if it is not checked the bank will not take any action that may
compromise its integrity

it is easy to forget the importance of integrity in credit functions you are far removed from the depositors who have
entrusted their money to you as the funds you lend come from so many sources you often feel no specific responsibility
as a banker we must make conscious effort to continuously strengthen our integrity the name wema bank is a constant
reminder of this need

two examples of the application of the integrity principle are avoiding conflicts of interest for instance loans to the banks
auditors and complying with government regulations

understanding risk

the banks main activity is to manage risk risk simply defined is the variability of possible outcomes for every
transaction you must learn to identify and optimize returns from all risks undertaken risk in this sense is an opportunity
once fully understood

one method is to think through the transaction step by step at each point ask what could go wrong and how can i

ÿ alert myself to the event
ÿ identify inherent risks and minimize unwanted risksoutcomes
ÿ optimize returns from risks undertaken

it is this principle that guides us to always have at least two separate ways out of a loan

matching risk and return

for every risk the bank takes we must have a matching return for taking that risk all too often we take the interest and fees
we charge as fixed and simply apply our efforts to structuring a credit in many instances the return on the credit is far too
low for the risk of lending for instance a 10 profit margin on a loan is a small compensation for losing the whole loan it
would take the profit of 10 good loans just to break even in this situation our success rate must be over 90 of all loans

however in special cases we might decide to have an exposure to a company at a low return with the expectation of
getting other business accounts which will improve our profitability from the relationship

delinquent loans are costly to manage from experience a bad loan takes more than ten times as much management
effort as a good loan for every bad loan the opportunity cost in lost income from other activities is very high bad loans
are a major drag on a banks efficiency

independent verification

a guiding principle of credit is that all information should be independently verified this may involve an external expert or
a skilled member of staff independently verified information helps to reduce risk considerably

an important aspect of independent verification is the separation of controls for instance the person who prepares a
credit should not be the one who approves it



complying with government regulations

a key principle of credit policy is that the bank will always comply with all government regulations this principle is based
on several factors the bank operates under a license the terms of the license call for compliance with government
regulations by not complying we not only breach our contract with the authorities we also risk losing our license or
incurring penalties




                                                                                               139 2016 annual report

notes to the financial statements

also if we assume that government regulations are in the best interest of the country then we work against this interest
when we break them if we break regulations and this information reaches the market then our reputation will be
diminished the fall in reputation could result in lost business and reduced profit considering all the negative results of
breaking regulations we are much better off complying with them



credit risk policies

the following are the principal credit policies of the bank

target market  client focus policy

establishing a target market and focusing on clients forms the basis of a strong business and credit relationships we do not
intend to meet all the finance needs of all customers we shall thus focus our efforts on target markets specifically chosen
by us after detailed studies

the target markets are the industries a credit team concentrates its marketing efforts on client focus identifies the specific
customers within that target market for whom we wish to be the primary bank lending to these customers will be
dependent on their meeting our risk acceptance criteria rac

building a profitable high quality credit portfolio should be the key aim of every account officer a good account officer is
not one that aims at winning and retaining any client at all costs but the one that learns to say no not just to low quality
credit proposals but also to those credit requests that do not fit into our corporate strategy

credit concentration risk policy

credit concentration risk refers to any single exposure or group of exposures with the potential to result in large losses
which may impair the banks earnings or capital because of significant credit risk events affecting the single obligor or group
of obligors with similar business or risk profile

basel ii recognizes that credit risk concentrations are the single most important cause of major problems in banks globally
credit concentration risk is defined in the basel ii accord as any single exposure or group of exposures with the potential to
produce losses large enough relative to a banks capital total assets or overall risk level to threaten a banks health or
ability to maintain its core operations

responsibilities of business and credit risk management

in wema bank business units and credit risk management have a joint responsibility for the overall accuracy of risk ratings
assigned to obligors and facilities business relationship managers will be responsible for deriving the orr using approved
methods as set out in the banks policy however credit risk management will validate such ratings

credit risk management is responsible for reviewing and ensuring the correctness of the orr assigned to a borrower and
facilities this review includes ensuring the ongoing consistency of the business risk rating process ongoing appropriate
application of the risk rating process and tools review of judgmental and qualitative inputs into the risk rating process
ensuring the timeliness and thoroughness of risk rating reviews and ensuring that the documentation of the risk rating
process is complete and current in wema bank credit risk management has the final authority if there is a question about
a specific rating

credit process

wema banks credit process starts with target market identification and portfolio planning credit requests are initiated by
the strategic business units and the credit requests are subjected to review and approvals by applicable credit approving
authorities further to appropriate approvals loans are disbursed to beneficiaries

monitoring of facilities is undertaken by both the strategic business units and the banks loan review and monitoring
department the process is centralized

credit risk rating policy

a risk rating is a grade given to a loan or a group of loans reflecting its quality risk ratings are usually in numbers for
instance risk ratings range from aaa to d where aaa represents a loan of highest quality and d represents a loan of lowest




140 2016 annual report

quality risk classifications are in form of interpretation such as extremely low risk average risk high risk substandard
or lost in many cases both ways of assessing risks are used together

as the bank manages a large number of loans by giving each one a grade or risks rating a number of processes can be
performed more effectively



risk rating methods and process

the credit rating of the obligors plays a vital role in final credit decisions as well as in the terms offered for successful loan
applications

wema bank employs a robust credit rating system in the determination of the obligor and inherent risks and thus allows
the bank to maintain its asset quality at a desired level

as the bank manages a large number of loans by giving each one a grade or risks rating a number of processes can be
performed more effectively these processes include

1   measuring the riskiness of the total portfolio of loans for instance a weighted average
2   monitoring the trend in the quality of loans for instance from january to december average risk rating fell 2 points
     from b to cc
3   establishing guidelines for risk based pricing eg rating a may be priced as prime while rating c may be priced at
     prime  3
4   providing performance measures for instance recognition could be given to the team with the lowest average risk
     rating
5   providing criteria for taking action on loans for instance all loans of risk rating ccc will be mentioned at mcc to ensure
     they do not deteriorate further

6   providing early warning signals which lead to early detection of problems and opportunity for remedy

once established a risk rating system can have many benefits however to be effective the rating process must be
credible consistent reliable objective and efficient

risk rating metrics

the banks risk rating scale is detailed below

credit approval and lending authorities

the key objective of wema bank lending is to make profits in making a credit decision a relationship manager must have
sufficient information to evaluate a potential borrowers character collateral capital and capacity they must also
understand the external conditions which will affect the borrowers ability to meet their financial obligations to ensure
that decisions to lend are made at levels that reflect the size and complexity of the loans different loan amounts fall under
special approval authorities the proper lending authority must approve all facilities loans and commitments to all clients

the lending authority in the bank shall flow through the management hierarchy with the final authority residing in the
board of directors

the bank maintains internal credit approval limits for various levels of authority in the credit process the current position
as approved by the board and management is as shown in the table below

authority level                                            approval limit

event of default of principal loan and interest the banks policy requires a minimum of 150 of the forced sale value fsv
of all noncash collateral and 110 cover for cash collaterised loans

furthermore in order to ensure credibility and integrity of security valuation the bank has limited acceptable security
valuation to two 2 prominent accredited estate valuers in nigeria

the major types of collateral acceptable for loan and advances include

1   mortgages over residential properties
2   charges over business assets such as premises inventory and accounts receivable
3   charges over financial instruments such as debt securities and equities
4   cash

longerterm finance and lending to corporate entities as well as individuals are generally secured in addition in order to
minimise the credit loss the bank will seek additional collateral from the counterparty as soon as loss indicators are
noticed for the relevant loans and advances

collateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances is determined by the nature of the
instrument debt securities treasury and other eligible bills are generally unsecured with the exception of asset backed
securities and similar instruments which are secured by portfolios of financial instruments

credit definitions

i     impaired loans and investment securities

       impaired loans and securities are loans and securities for which the bank determines that it is probable that it will
       be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan  securities
       agreements these are loans and securities specifically impaired and are graded cc c and d in the banks
       internal credit risk grading system

ii    allowances for impairment

       the bank establishes an allowance for impairment losses that represents its estimate of incurred losses in its loan
       portfolio the main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant
       exposures and a collective loan loss allowance established for groups of homogeneous assets in respect of losses
       that have been incurred but have not been identified on loans subject to individual assessment for impairment

iii   writeoff policy

       the bank writes off a loan  security balance and any related allowances for impairment losses when bank
       management credit committee determines that the loans  securities are uncollectible this determination is
       reached after considering information such as the occurrence of significant changes in the borrower  issuers
       financial position such that the borrower  issuer can no longer pay the obligation or that proceeds from
       collateral will not be sufficient to pay back the entire exposure for smaller balance standardised loans charge off
       decisions are generally based on a product specific past due status

all loans and advances are categorised as either

ÿ collectively impaired
ÿ individually impaired

the impairment allowance includes allowances against financial assets that have been individually impaired and those
subjects to collective impairment

market risk management
overview

this is the risk that movement in market factors such as foreign exchange rates interest rates credit spreads equity prices
and commodity prices will reduce our income and capital or the value of our onoff balance sheet portfolios

exposure to market risk

exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios

ÿ trading portfolios comprise positions arising from market making
  ÿ the modelstools used to measure and control traded market risk interest rate and foreign exchange risk include
       daily valuation of positions limit monitoring sensitivity analysis valueatrisk and stress testing analyses amongst
       others

ÿ nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and
   commercial banking assets and liabilities financial investments designated as availableforsale afs and heldto
   maturity htm
   ÿ the principal objective of market risk management of nontrading portfolios is to optimize net interest income

wema bank is exposed to market risk arising from positions created in its trading and banking books where appropriate
we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios

one of the primary objectives of market risk management as part of our independent risk function is to ensure that our
business units risk exposure is within the approved appetite commensurate with its defined strategy to achieve this
objective market risk management works closely with risk takers the business units and other control and support
groups

decisionmaking and timely escalation to senior management and board market risk management defines and
implements a framework to systematically identify assess monitor and report our market risk vulnerabilities market risk
managers identify market risks through active portfolio analysis and engagement with the business areas

market risk is managed and controlled in wema bank through policies and limits approved by the board brac these
policies and limits ensure that risks faced across business activities and on an aggregate basis are within the stipulated risk
appetite of the bank while taking cognizance of regulatory constraints

the specific limits are proposed by the head market risk management through the chief risk officer cro and approved
by the relevant management committees and ultimately by the board brac

the risk reporting framework involves presentation of reports to the asset and liability committee alco management
risk committee mrc and board risk  audit committee brac the management committees receive periodic market
risk reports and recommendations while relevant reports are presented to the board risk  audit committee brac on a
quarterly basis

exposures to market risks are managed through various metricsmodels such as repricing gap ratio value at risk earning

conduct stress testing to monitor its vulnerability to very extreme but plausible shocks

in line with the cbn circular on basel iiiii capital framework the bank adopts the standardized approach for market risk
regulatory capital requirement also the bank has put in place a detailed plan for the full implementation of basel iiiii
framework with timelines for migration to more advance capital computation methods in the future

the marktomarket technique establishes unrealized profitloss by revaluing open traded positions at prevailing market
prices when no market prices are available for a specific contract period marktomodel is used to derive the relevant
market prices it is the banks policy to revalue all exposures under the traded market risk portfolio on a daily basis as a
general guide marking to market is performed independently of the trading unit

sensitivity analysis

sensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios
including interest rates and foreign exchange rates such as the effect of a one basis point change in yield we use
sensitivity measures to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type sensitivity limits are set for portfolios
products and risk types with the depth of the market being a principal factor in determining the level

value at risk

value at risk var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates
and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk
management and calculated for all trading positions in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a
complete picture of risk where we do not calculate var explicitly we use alternative tools as highlighted in the stress
testing section below

our models are predominantly based on historical and parametric simulations which incorporate the following features

ÿ historical market rates and prices are calculated with reference to foreign exchange rates interest rates and the
    associated volatilities
ÿ potential market movements utilised for var are calculated with reference to data from the past five years and
ÿ var measures are calculated to a 99 confidence level and use a oneday holding period

the nature of the var models means that an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in var without
any changes in the underlying positions

var model limitations

although a valuable guide to risk var should always be viewed in the context of its limitations for example

                                                                             notes to the financial statements

ÿ     use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events may not encompass all potential events particularly
      extreme ones
ÿ     the use of a holding period assumes that all positions can be liquidated or the risks offset during that period which may
      not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of severe illiquidity when the holding period may be insufficient to
      liquidate or hedge all positions fully
ÿ     the use of a 99 confidence level does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence
      and
ÿ     var is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not necessarily
      reflect intraday exposures

risk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and incorporated directly in the var models where possible

stresstesting

stress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our market risk management framework to evaluate the
potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme although plausible events or movements in a set of financial
variables in such scenarios losses can be much greater than those predicted by var modelling scenarios are tailored to
capture the relevant potential events or market movements for risk factors the risk appetite around potential stress
losses for the bank is set and monitored market risk reverse stress tests are undertaken on the premise that there is a fixed
loss the stress testing process identifies which scenarios lead to this loss the rationale behind the reverse stress test is to
understand scenarios that are beyond normal business settings and could have contagion and systemic implications
stressed var and stress testing together with reverse stress testing and the management of gap risk provide
management with insights regarding the tail risk beyond var for which wema banks appetite is limited

backtesting

we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against both actual and hypothetical profit and
loss against the corresponding var numbers hypothetical profit and loss excludes nonmodelled items such as fees
commissions and revenues of intraday transactions we would expect on average to see two or three losses in excess of
var at the 99 confidence level over a oneyear period the actual number of losses in excess of var over this period can
therefore be used to gauge how well the models are performing

structural foreign exchange exposures

structural foreign exchange exposures represent net investments in currencies other than the naira exchange differences
on structural exposures are recognised in other comprehensive income we use the naira as our presentation currency in
our consolidated financial statements our consolidated balance sheet is therefore affected by exchange differences
between the naira and all other currencies underlying our day to day operations our structural foreign exchange
exposures are managed with the primary objective of ensuring where practical that our capital ratios are largely protected
from the effect of changes in exchange rates

interest rate risk in the banking book

a major component of market risk exposures in the bank is the interest rate in the banking book interest rate risk is the
exposure of the banks financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates or yield curves the bank is exposed to
interest rate risk through the interestbearing assets and liabilities in its trading and banking books

measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book

interest rate risk in the banking book is measured and controlled using four metrics

ÿ nontraded var
ÿ repricing gap analysis


152 2016 annual report

                                                                          notes to the financial statements

ÿ net interest income sensitivity and
ÿ economic value of equity

repricing gap analysis

this allows the bank to maintain a positive or negative gap depending upon the forecast of interest rate position the size
of the gap is then adjusted to either hedge net interest income against changing interest rates or to anticipate increase net
interest income in line with market outlook

net interest income sensitivity

a principal part of our management of nontraded interest rate risk is to monitor the sensitivity of expected net interest
income under varying interest rate scenarios simulation modelling where all other economic variables are held
constant projected net interest income sensitivity figures represent the effect of the pro forma movements in projected
yield curves based on a static balance sheet size and structure assumption other than instances where the size of the
balances or repricing is deemed interest rate sensitive noninterest bearing current account migration and fixed rate loan
early prepayment in reality wema bank proactively seeks to change the interest rate risk profile to optimize net
revenues

the management of interest rate risk in the banking book is supported by the sensitivity analysis of the banks financial
assets and liabilities to various standards and nonstandards interest rate scenarios

analysis of the banks sensitivity to an increase or decrease in market interest rates assuming no asymmetrical movement
in yield curves and a static financial position is shown below

notes to the financial statements



liquidity risk management
liquidity risk is the risk arising from our potential inability to meet all payment obligations when they come due or only
being able to meet these obligations at excessive costs the objective of the banks liquidity risk management framework is
to ensure that the group can fulfill its payment obligations at all times and can manage liquidity and funding risks within its
risk appetite the framework considers relevant and significant drivers of liquidity risk whether onbalance sheet or off
balance sheet

liquidity risk management framework

liquidity risk management governance is designed and established to promote oversight of all liquidity risks effective
decisionmaking and timely escalation to senior management and board

the bank has an internal liquidity and funding risk management framework which aims to allow it to withstand very severe
liquidity stresses it is designed to be adaptable to changing business models markets and regulations the management
of liquidity and funding is primarily undertaken by the asset and lability management committee alco in compliance
with the banks policy and international best practices

the board defines the liquidity and funding risk strategy for the bank as well as the risk appetite based on
recommendations made by the chief risk officer cro through the asset and liability management committee alco at
least annually the board approves the banks liquidity policy and contingency funding plan including establishing
liquidity risk tolerance levels which are used by the bank to measure and control liquidity risks as well as our longterm
funding plan

independent control function responsible for reviewing the liquidity risk framework proposing the risk appetite through
the chief risk officer cro and the validation of liquidity risk models which are used to measure and manage the banks
liquidity risk profile treasury works closely in conjunction with market risk and the business facing units to analyze and
understand the underlying liquidity characteristics of the business portfolios these parties are engaged in regular and
frequent dialogue to understand changes in the banks position arising from business activities and market circumstances

liquidity scorecard as part of the annual strategic planning process we project the development of the key liquidity and
funding metrics based on the underlying business plans to ensure that the plan is in compliance with our risk appetite



the bank has developed a liquidity management framework based on a statistical model underpinned by conservative
assumptions with regard to cash inflows and the liquidity of liabilities liquidity positions are measured by calculating the
banks net liquidity gap and by comparing selected ratios with targets as specified in the liquidity risk management manual
in addition liquidity stress tests assuming extreme withdrawal scenarios are performed these stress tests specify where
additional liquidity requirements need to be met by holdings of liquid assets

contingency funding plan

the usual operating budget it is imperative for a bank to maintain an adequate level of liquid assets as a protection against
any possible loss in the event of emergency liquidity situations financial resources may run dry quickly in adverse
scenarios forcing the bank to look elsewhere for funding

a contingency funding plan cfp addresses the institutions strategy for handling a liquidity crisis the cfp should serve as
a blueprint for meeting its funding needs in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost it describes policies and procedures
for managing or making up cash flow shortfalls in stress situations having a contingency funding plan can help an entity to
avoid the need to rely on other entities

mortgage loans have an original contractual maturity of between 20 and 25 years but an average expected maturity of six
years as customers takes advantage of early repayment options

the gross nominal inflows  outflows disclosed in the previous table represent the contractual undiscounted cash flows
relating to nonderivative financial liabilities and assets held for risk management purposes

as part of the management of its liquidity risk arising from financial liabilities the bank holds liquid assets comprising cash
and cash equivalents and debt securities for which there is an active and liquid market so that they can be readily sold to
meet liquidity requirements

      required level through

      ÿ     increasing the banks revenue base while ensuring efficient management of operating expenses
      ÿ     vigorously implementing debt recovery strategies

      our banks regulatory capital as managed by the financial control and treasury units is divided into two tiers

      tier 1 capital which includes share capital share premium other reserves and retained earnings
      tier 2 capital which includes revaluation reserves and other borrowings

      the risk weighted assets are measured by means of a hierarchy of five risk weights classified according to the nature
      of and reflecting an estimate of credit capital market and other risks associated with each asset and counterparty
      taking into consideration any eligible collateral guarantee a similar treatment is accorded to offbalance sheet
      transactions with adjustments in line with the contingent nature of the underlining potential losses

    riskweighted assets


   iii capital allocation
   the allocation of capital between specific operations and activities is to a large extent driven by optimisation of the
   return achieved on the capital allocated the amount of capital allocated to each operation or activity is based
   primarily upon the regulatory capital but in some cases the regulatory requirements do not reflect fully the varying
   degree of risk associated with different activities in such cases the capital requirements may be flexed to reflect
   differing risk profiles subject to the overall level of capital to support a particular operation or activity not falling below
   the minimum required for regulatory purposes

   although maximisation of the return on riskadjusted capital is the principal basis used in determining how capital is
   allocated within the bank to particular operations or activities it is not the sole basis used for decision making
   account also is taken of synergies with other operations and activities the availability of management and other
   resources and the fit of the activity with the banks longer term strategic objectives
