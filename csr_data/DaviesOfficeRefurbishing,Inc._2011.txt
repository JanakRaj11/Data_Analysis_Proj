pr1   life cycle stages in which health and safety impacts of products and

      in 2005 we commissioned the national center for remanufacturing and resource
      recovery nc3r of the rochester institute of technology rit to assess and quantify
      the life cycle environmental benefits of remanufacturing panels used in office furniture
      the full findings are summarized in a report entitled the energy and environmental
      benefits of office furniture remanufacturing which is available upon request the key
      findings are that by recovering and reusing materials from panels destined for disposal
      remanufacturing realizes benefits across the life cycle by avoiding the negative
      environmental impacts associated primarily with the acquisition mining extraction
      processing of raw virgin steel and the manufacturing of steel components from this raw
      steel in fact davies typically reuses over 98 of each panel by weight and uses an
      estimated 111 fewer manufacturing steps to produce a panel than the original
      manufacturer cradletogate environmental benefits include a per unit weight reduction
      in the consumption of virgin raw materials and energy resources emissions of
      greenhouse gases criteria air pollutants and toxic air emissions and solid waste
      generation associated with integrated steel making furthermore not only does
      remanufacturing reduce the number of panels destined for landfill after their first life
      but in turn remanufactured panels can be recovered and remanufactured again
      creating a closed loop material flow for steel thus remanufacturing also provides
      environmental benefits in the gatetograve stages of the product life cycle

      the report focused on panels as these are highest volume 35 product
      remanufactured by davies and thus the findings are indicative of the
      environmental benefits of the overall remanufacturing services we provide

ec9   understanding and describing significant indirect impacts including the
      extent of the impacts

      as with any business there are indirect influences on our market that have an
      effect on us as a company although these effects can be a challenge were
      usually able to minimize their effects due to the nature of our business the
      following are examples of influences and how we are able to minimize their
      effects on us

      impact financial the financial state of the global economy certainly has a
      direct and indirect impact on every business out there today

      extent of impact recession corporate downsizing increased
      unemployment higher taxes and weakened us dollar these challenges
      have resulted in fewer companies willing to part with their revenue in order to
      update their furniture most companies are waiting as long as they can before
      they make those purchases

      how we minimize the effect while this presents us with a big challenge it
      also creates an opportunity due to the nature of our business were able to work
      with companies who need furniture we can provide likenew furniture at a price
      point thats lower than new we also offer financing programs that give them


                       page 13  davies sustainability report 2010

value for their existing furniture that they can apply to remanufactured furniture
this unique position gives us a hand up even in a tough economy

impact competition competition in the market certainly has a direct and
indirect impact on every business out there today

extent of impact our competition isnt just here in the united states its
global and its not just relegated to the commercial furniture industry its
everywhere acquisitions and mergers are resulting in massive conglomerates
that can pool their resources driving down their cost in turn lowering sell prices
the lower the prices go the lower the profit margins its a race to the bottom

how we minimize the effect companies in our industry have begun buying
offshore components and having products manufactured overseas in an attempt
to compete with one another in this environment due to this competition is fierce
but we have a sound strategy to deal with it we would never be able to compete
if we took the same path as other businesses in our industry instead our
product is made or rather remade here in the united states by reusing core
furniture material we are able to give our customers a much higher quality
product than our competitors at a better price its a win  win our extensive
inventory of core material inhouse and an abundance of used furniture
inventories available to us means were able to react extremely quickly to our
customers needs most of our competitors dont have the ability to do that
theyre at the mercy of some manufacturing facility overseas



impact resources the demand for natural resources has risen dramatically in
recent years and this has certainly had a direct and indirect impact on every
business out there today

extent of impact with the growth of other industrialized nations it has created
an additional demand on resources this additional demand has resulted in a
dramatic rise in material costs resources like steel and crude oil have
skyrocketed in recent years forcing companies to add surcharges for products
and transportation costs the demand will continue to affect the global economy
as nations compete with one another for these valuable resources

how we minimize the effect our business model is based on the reuse of
existing products our furniture is created by reusing our customers existing
furniture as our core material this is furniture that would typically be thrown into
a landfill or sit unused in a warehouse by using existing products we also
eliminate the use of virgin raw materials and the energy to process and
manufacture them we use as much of the original product core as possible
refinishing repainting or recovering to a customers specification this process is
good for our business too because we rarely have to compete for those valuable
natural resources we are also constantly searching for ways to become more
energy efficient in what we do and streamline our facility so it has a minimal
impact on our planet
