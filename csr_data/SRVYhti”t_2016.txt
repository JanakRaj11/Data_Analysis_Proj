srv annual report 2015      srv in brief review by the ceo




fantastic year of renewal and growth
ceo reviews usually end with words of gratitude to all stakeholders but this year i want to start off by saying thanks thank you
to our customers for your outstanding projects open collaboration and above all valuable feedback genuine collaboration and
an open dialogue are the only ways to improve and advance business in the right direction thank you to our investors and
financers for your trust and constructive discussions as we work together to advance all our projects  from the small ones to
those that by all measures including our own are megasized thank you to our personnel for the enthusiasm and
professionalism you show in your work and for your ability to challenge and question the way we work  it further improves our
operations i am proud of the fact that you also consider srv to be finlands 11th most inspiring workplace

we do this work together with our stakeholders and we too are occasionally astonished by the size of the group of people who
are impacted by our work both in the development and construction phases not to mention when buildings are finished and they
become a vibrant part of the community that is what this construction is all about  building tomorrows society

all in all there were many things worthy of praise in 2015 the words renewal and growth could also be used to describe the
year because srv recorded many historically significant achievements finlands biggest ever city construction project  and
also srvs biggest ever  construction project redi finally reached full speed in april construction is progressing as planned
and the project has been very well received

another historically significant achievement is our order backlog which nearly doubled new records were set in every quarter
and the value of our order backlog at yearend was close to a staggering eur 16 billion an excellent performance from our
entire team and above all an unprecedented indication of the broad recognition of our professionalism along with the redi
project some of the other biggest construction projects i want to highlight include the expansion of tampere university hospital
the niittykumpu metro centre the tapiola urban development project the new childrens hospital and the renovation of helsinki
city theatre projects in the development and negotiation pipeline and awaiting implementation include kivenlahti metro centre
in espoo kerava city centre bunkkeri and wood city in helsinki jätkäsaari district perkkaa in espoo and hanhikivi1 nuclear
power plant project as well as tampere central deck and arena project

in addition to the order backlog the development in revenue has been positive  although with respect to our strategic
profitability objective we are in the halfway in fact 2016 will have numerous projects and actions aiming to improve profitability
and the cost efficiency of projects the result is unevenly distributed between quarters and mostly weighted to the latter part of
the year this is solely due to the fact that residential development and developercontracted projects are recognised as revenue
on a percentage of completion basis the same trend will continue also this year because the numerous housing startups will be
recognised in the result at the end of 2016 at the earliest

many significant projects were completed during the year and several of them i am pleased to say with excellent customer
feedback a couple of these include the ongoing koivusaari metro station project in helsinki which deservedly so earned site of
the year 2015 award and jorvi hospital emergency care building in espoo which was given the hurraa award by the building
control committee of the city of espoo

while work continued at full throttle on our approximate 80 construction sites numerous new projects were also under
development one of the projects under development at the end of the year was bunkkeri in which we are helping to give a
brandnew lease of life to a warehouse building in the jätkäsaari district of helsinki this new entity comprises a swimming hall
and sports facilities as well as apartments rising above them offering amazing views new projects also include the kivenlahti
metro centre in espoo which we are participating in as a developer and the keilaniemi ring road i project in espoo in which
srv infra is responsible for moving the ring road i into a concrete tunnel and building a green deck over it the launch of the
construction will be a significant step for the entire keilaniemi project

it is likely that big projects will not be limited only to the helsinki metropolitan area in the years to come in tampere we will start
advancing the unique tampere central deck and arena project worth 500 million euros the finnish biggest multipurpose area
will combine restaurants a hotel and residential towers the investor negotiations continue at full speed and the final decision for
the implementation of the unique complex to be built over the existing railroad is likely to be made during summer when we add
to this the numerous other projects under development eg along the western metro line i must say that i am more than
excited about the years ahead

one of the years important events is related to our strategy work which started in autumn 2015 the final result which contains a
new vision three strategic objectives and six strategic development programmes is an excellent mark of our current
managements and the entire organisations ability to cooperate and achieve renewal the majority of our development
programmes are already fully underway and we will be closely monitoring their progress our main focal points during 2016 will
be development of profitability and the customer experience as well as our sustainability and our management principles

the situation in russia faces a lot of uncertainty but we have a firm belief in our strategy for russia the okhta mall shopping
centre under construction in st petersburg will open its doors in august this year and leasing is progressing according to
schedule success is continuing for our other important project the pearl plaza shopping centre opened in august 2013 the
shopping centre attracted over one million more visitors in 2015 than in the previous year and the sales in roubles increased by
25 per cent pearl plaza was also showered with numerous awards in 2015 including the best mediumsized shopping centre
2015 and honourable mention in the 2015 golden brick award one of the most highly esteemed awards in the russian real
estate industry its obvious that we wont actively be seeking new projects in the current climate but focus on the construction of
existing projects and our strengths in shopping centre management

committed shareholders played a significant role last year and will do so again this year late summers share issue was a
resounding success one way in which we thank our shareholders for their commitment is stable dividend policy during the past
years by applying a combination of committed shareholders skilled and motivated personnel and our updated vision and
strategic objectives to our many challenging  yet therefore even more rewarding  construction projects we can expect 2016 to
be a busy interesting and despite the challenging market environment above all successful year

srv annual report 2015      strategy megatrends




megatrends and success factors
people have become accustomed to recognising the fast even very subtle changes that are constantly happening around them
but we are also able to cope with more extensive changes in the background changes that are revolutionising our entire way of
living like changes in the global economy continuous urbanisation and technologys increasing role in our daily lives




the significance of communality ecology and wellbeing are growing as we are living healthier and longer lives with the way of
working and consuming constantly changing new growth is based on services at the same time the ageing population and
rising prosperity are contributing to the increased demand for trade and services buying behaviour and the way people work are
changing we buy more products online and we want them delivered directly to our homes a permanent work site is becoming
increasingly rare work is being done from home at a cafe at a summer cottage or in a new kind of cowork premises in urban
centres there is a clear need for big complexes that combine infrastructure shopping services and housing this is exactly what
srv is implementing with its redi project

general economic development and changes in society are fuelling migration and urbanisation for srv the most significant of
the megatrends is urbanisation it impacts our operations today tomorrow and far into the future the number of people living in
the helsinki metropolitan area is predicted to increase by 1015 per cent during the coming 25 years according to the most
liberal predictions three quarters of the worlds people will live in cities by 2050

the increased prosperity is clearly visible in the structure of consumer spending there is more money available for leisure and
recreation people want and need more services

all of these success factors and megatrends have an influence on the kind of company srv aspires to be in 2020 on what our
operating environment will be like in the future and above all on what our customers shareholders and stakeholders will expect
and require from us




                                                                                                                  srv annual report 2015

srv annual report 2015      strategy strategic development programs




on journey towards strategic objectives
the six strategic development programmes selected for the strategy all play a key role in realising the strategy during the first
years of the strategy however one programme will take precedence over the others  improving profitability and cost efficiency
of projects

1 improve profitability and project efficiency
the profitability and costefficiency improvement programme addresses the root causes of profitability the operational focus in
the coming years will be on operational planning and process development as well as on securing resources also the efficiency
of capital use is one of the main principles in srvs operations

srv is pursuing better profitability by leaning more on its strengths ie on own development projects and developercontracted
projects and by focusing only on growing urban centres geographically this means that operations will focus more strongly on
the helsinki metropolitan area and on a few other big cities in finland but even there with a focus targeting the areas where
traffic people and services converge today and in the future one of srvs most important criteria in land acquisitions of recent
years and in land acquisitions to come is the projects location in a traffic hub

srv is already one of the biggest builders of housing units in the helsinki metropolitan area the companys spearhead projects
are located in helsinkis kalasatama district and in espoos growth centres of the nearly 6200 housing units srv has built
during the past five years more than 4200 are located in the helsinki metropolitan area and it currently has close to 1900
housing units under construction an additional 3500 housing units are in the development pipeline in the upcoming years and
srvs goal is to build as many as 1500020000 new homes over the next 10 years

the higher degree of added value of own development and developercontracted projects brought on by business expertise gives
them a higher profitability margin also project size is seen as having an impact on their profitability that is why the order
backlog is steered towards bigger projects but at the same time also towards more efficient and smaller housing unit sizes

2 follow our leadership principles and processes
srvs management principles are based on a management triangle results  customer  work community good management
of the work community enables a superior customer experience and results success is built on satisfied customers and satisfied
employees in corporate spirits most inspiring finnish workplaces survey published in early 2016 srv ranked 11th place the
excellent result provides a great foundation for the development of management principles

the work done to advance compliance with management principles and processes includes eg the publication of 10
management theses that encourage the entire work community towards a more open resultsdriven and committed work
performance




                                                                                                                   srv annual report 2015

3 sustainability in everything we do
in tomorrows operating environment sustainability will play an even       we drive profitability
bigger role in competitiveness srvs goal is to be known for its
sustainability constructionrelated decisions have a broad impact on       we provide added value for customers
the environment on communities and on the lives of many people           we cooperate
srv takes a longterm approach to project development and works in
a responsible way with its stakeholders to build a sustainable future      we engage in open discussion
todays built environment is home to tomorrows sustainable society
                                                                            we learn from our successes and mistakes
sustainability and the development of it have always been issues            we support renewal and development
important to srv and its significance will be amplified in the future
we see sustainability first and foremost as an opportunity because       we operate responsibly
by operating in a sustainable way we can develop our business over
the longterm while simultaneously responding to stakeholder                we spark enthusiasm
expectations                                                               we ensure the quality of our operations
our goal in 2016 is to define and create a sustainability programme          we commit ourselves to decisions
and operating model that align with our new vision and strategic
objectives at the same time we will develop our reporting to meet the
eu directive on the disclosure of nonfinancial and diversity
information which takes effect in 2017 and the requirements of international norms we have already started the work with an
extensive analysis of the current situation and with a stakeholder survey and by mapping industry practices

4 deliver superior customer experience
a superior customer experience is one of the three points of the triangle together with results and work community without
satisfied customers there is no success customer experience is emphasised in all our operations whether its the customer
buying an apartment or our longterm relationship with eg pension and investment companies or internally as we work as one
team




achieving a superior customer experience requires the contribution of every link in the chain and above all anticipating
customers future needs the customer feedback we have received  the positive and negative  is vitally important for the
continuous development of our operations srvs current and future projects offer an excellent foundation for offering our
customers a new kind of living experience the piloting of lifestyle services is especially visible in the redi project and in our
living lab implemented to develop future housing concepts the redi model apartments realised in the living lab offer a unique
opportunity to develop services in collaboration with our customers

an essential part of creating a superior customer experience is the measuring and development of internal processes we will
develop our measuring tools and feedback channels and well improve communication and dialogue opportunities between our
customers and srv

srv annual report 2015       strategy strategic development programs



5 utilising digitalisation and new technology
digitalisation is visible everywhere  including in the daily operations and strategies of companies at srv digitalisation means
first and foremost leveraging new kinds of technologies in construction processes and daily work as well as in the services and
solutions for customers and stakeholders 3dmodelling has been replaced with 4dmodelling at many of our construction sites
and the adoption of smart space concepts is further improving project management digital tools and channels are a routine part
of daily communications and marketing and they are being further developed to support the creation of a superior customer
experience among other things digitalisation also plays a key role in identifying and developing premisesrelated services  and
especially so in the redi pilot project

6 build for future growth
srv is pursuing future growth in three areas in particular 1 segmentspecific development of housing concepts 2 development
and conceptualisation of a public construction model 3 growing shopping centre operations in russia and finland

for example the population in the helsinki metropolitan area is projected to grow from a current 14 million people to 18 million
by 2040 which will mean more than 30000 new homes the development of housing concepts aims to respond primarily to the
housing needs of ordinary finns in public services construction it is believed the focus will shift increasingly towards lifecycle
construction and alliance models where the public operators role moves from constructor to longterm tenant at the same time
the constructors responsibility will expand from construction to the management of a buildings entire lifecycle furthermore
alliance and various kinds of ppp public private partnership contract models will increase

srv has operated in russia throughout its existence for almost 30 years in the coming years we will pursue growth primarily in
the shopping centre project and shopping centre operations a market that will continue to see significant growth in recent years
srv has successfully built resources for shopping centre operations in st petersburg and moscow and the goal is to leverage
the expertise even further eg in shopping centre operations in development of the existing shopping centres and in planning
and construction of future shopping centre concepts




                                                                                                                    srv annual report 2015

srv annual report 2015       strategy strategic financial objectives




groups strategic financial objectives for 20162020
the strategy and srvs entire operations are guided by the strategic financial objectives updated in february 2016

    during the strategy period faster growth than the industry will be pursued through largescale projects
    the operating profit margin will rise to more than 8 per cent by the end of the strategy period
    return on equity will be at least 15 per cent by the end of the strategy period
    in international operations return on investment will rise to at least 15 per cent by the end of the strategy period
    the equity ratio will remain above 35 per cent
    the goal is to distribute a stable dividend of 3050 per cent of the annual result taking into account the capital needs of
    business operations

the achievement of the objectives is based on weak but steady economic growth in finland and a slight recovery and
stabilisation in russias economy in addition achieving the objectives requires substantial growth in srvs developercontracted
projects

the effectiveness of financing is a critical factor for srvs solvency the goal is to further improve the effectiveness of project
financing in addition to the right forms and sources of financing also the timing of the projects are important the return on
capital will be increased by improving profitability via optimisation of the project portfolio the rate of turnover of capital will be
increased by broadening the financial shoulders an example of this is russia invest a propertyinvestment company that srv
established in 2011 with other financiallysound finnish institutions




                                                                                                                      srv annual report 2015

srv annual report 2015      strategy srv approach




srv approach  the backbone of successful
operations
srvs strategy implementation and competitive edge are based on innovative project development and the efficient execution of
construction projects using the transparent and networked srv approach

srv approach covers the whole value chain of construction and increasingly also property investing beginning with identifying
trends and future needs leading to development and execution  planning financing land acquisition construction and with eg
shopping centre projects also management of property until exit phase

projects with higher added value yield a significantly better return than competitive contracting so srvs strategy is to increase
the share of revenue accounted for by its own development projects in finland the redi project in the helsinki kalasatama
district and in russia the okhta mall in st petersburg are examples of such projects




cornerstones of srv approach

own project development

srvs development projects are based on project development work that sets out to identify future trends impacting srvs
business and gain a deep understanding of customers business needs by genuinely listening to customers and engaging with
key stakeholders srv successfully connects different perspectives the goal is to find the most suitable entity for users and the
most profitable investments for owners

srvs project development unit in finland and russia serves all areas of business and is responsible for matters such as land
acquisition zoning concept design and finding investors and anchor tenants

management of project financing

capital management is an essential element of project value formation in addition to its own financing capacity srv seeks
funding for specific projects from banks investors and partners




                                                                                                                   srv annual report 2015

srv annual report 2015       strategy srv approach



the realestate investment company russia invest is an example of the good cooperation model developed by srv which the
company has used to strengthen the financing of the st petersburg okhta mall project via domestic partners an operating
model developed from corresponding solutions will increase srvs financing capacity in the implementation of major projects as
for example in the redi project

with its partners srv can find the best return on investment by optimising the time of sale

efficient construction

the efficiency of srvs project implementation is founded on a project management model based on customers needs  the
srv approach in which an srv project is implemented in transparent cooperation with the customer

a successful and highquality end result is ensured through systematic project management a management system that
supports implementation and an unbroken flow of information extending throughout the project project management is the
responsibility of srvs professionals utilising in project implementation an extensive and expert partner network

management of the end investor market

in srvs projects real estate investors are in effect buying anticipated cash flows a built and fully leased shopping centre
office building or housing project is an attractive acquisition for investors as the annual rental yield from such projects is already
known

a key aspect of project development is the correct assessment of investors yield requirements in the market in question when
the yield percentage sought by investors is known the company can anticipate the cash flow required to achieve this objective
when designing the project srv therefore only invests in projects that on completion will be attractive to real estate investors

optimisation of rental income

in its owndevelopment projects srv is responsible for finding users for a project before construction begins finding anchor
tenants is the cornerstone of project development its success impacts the projects startup date

construction begins when a sufficient occupancy rate has been achieved the successful leasing of a project under construction
also has a direct impact on the projects attractiveness to investors

the pearl plaza and okhta mall shopping centre projects in st petersburg are examples of srvs strong expertise in developing
shopping centre concepts finding tenants and operating shopping centres these projects highlight srvs knowledge of the
retail sectors needs




                                                                                                                      srv annual report 2015

srv annual report 2015       businesses business operations




srvs business operations
srvs business operations focus on property development and construction in finland russia and estonia the company seeks
longterm profitable growth in business premises and housing construction in finlands developing urban centres close to good
transport links particularly rail traffic routes additionally srv implements profitable shopping centre projects in moscow and st
petersburg russia

srvs business operations is based on three different project types in the first type contracting projects the project is chosen
carefully and the primary focus is on high value added projects in development projects on the other hand the development
phase is executed together with the partners and srv sells the project to investors before the start of the construction phase
srv bears the construction risks in such projects which are recognised as revenue according to the percentage of completion
these higher added value projects are clearly more profitable than competitive contracting and srvs strategy focuses on
increasing the share of such projects the third type developercontracting means projects that are designed and executed by
srv and which have not been sold at the beginning of the construction phase in these projects srv bears the risks for selling
and construction and the projects are recognised as revenue once the site is completed and sold

sustainability in our operations

srv is the industry forerunner in grey economy prevention

srv has the industrys best tools and ways of operating for preventing the grey economy throughout srvs history preventing
financial crime grey economy has been an integral part of the companys basic operations both in the procurement function and
in the monitoring of contractors at construction sites the effectiveness of the prevention efforts is anchored in longterm
collaboration with authorities and the companys solid effort to develop its own processes

construction site orientation and preaudits of our collaboration partners social responsibilities are important tools in preventing
the grey economy additionally we use network register developed to facilitate the electronic management of processes that
are within the scope of the act on the contractors obligations and liability and for reporting to authorities srv started
developing the register in 2008 and it was completely updated in 2014 network register is continuously developed to ensure
the realtime nature of the prevention process with the electronic management system the grey economy prevention process
has become a fully standard practice at srvs construction sites

the development measures implemented have led to very positive results in audits and good feedback from contractors the
zeroerror reports from audits conducted by authorities tax regional state administrative agencies police at our construction
sites and the zeroerror results from the contractors obligation audits for demanding contractors are solid evidence of the level
of fulfilment of our social obligations at construction sites
jari korpisaari safety manager

no compromises in safety

srv is committed to practices supporting the zeroaccident target in its operations in finland the company is also strongly
involved with the confederation of finnish construction industries rts project of zero accidents by 2020

every indicator of safety developed very favourably in 2015 in fact safety was the spearhead theme in production and for
example in finland srv rakennus oys losttime injury frequency ltif rate per one million hours worked dropped from 157 in
the previous year to a record low of 87 in 2015 the construction industry average is 63 there were a total of 118 injuries at
srvs work sites in 2015 two of which were serious injuries the average of the weekly statutory construction site safety
measurement was 955 per cent

the biggest challenges in terms of safety are getting all incidents reported including the nearmisses and getting all partners to
commit to operating in accordance with safety guidelines svr has responded to the challenges by providing onsite training on
the guidelines to 22700 people in finland by adding digital tools for guidelines and monitoring and by arranging an internal
safety contest construction site monitoring is continuous and the statutory construction site inspection is conducted weekly a
purposespecific mobile application is used in the documentation of the inspection

a project to develop the construction site safety orientation is ongoing and safety communications will be amplified in 2016
safety is under constant monitoring by the management all safety deviations are investigated and reported

construction projects in finland are mainly development or project management contracts which srvs own professionals and
the contractor partner network implement efficiently under srvs project management model consequently the company has a
relatively smaller number of employees than its competitors on the other hand srv employs significantly more subcontractors
and goods suppliers specifically because of the project management model through subcontracting and the use of temporary
labour srv indirectly generates payroll taxes and social security costs that are paid to the government so srvs indirect impact
as an employer and taxpayer is significant




sustainability as the premise of environmental activities

the built environment is required to have increasingly better energy and environmental efficiency to solve climate and energy
challenges the premise of srvs environmental activities is the commitment to developing its activities in accordance with
sustainable development and to reporting the impacts of its activities srvs environmental operations are guided by the
environmental policy approved by the corporate executive team the key goal of the policy is optimisation of construction site
material efficiency and waste management development

waste generated from building sites is the most significant direct environmental impact of construction for all finnish
construction sites srv requires the drafting of waste management and environmental plans that align with the companys quality
management system every site must also appoint a projectspecific environmental officer who is responsible for among other
things reporting waste volumes and energy consumption into srv environment srvs environmental reporting system

in 2015 we adopted waste targets for different project types at our finnish operations every new project is given a target on
specific waste volume and a target on the rate of waste sorting which describes how much waste is sorted into a category other
than mixed waste these targets are recorded in our waste reporting system enabling us to better monitor waste accumulations
and the achievement of the targets

during the past years environmental assessment methods like the american leed and the british breeam have become more
common particularly amongst international real estate investors and other srvs customers the basic premise of the
environmental assessment methods is to assess a buildings most significant environmental impacts using simple and reliable
indicators the measured results are given point values and the building is given a rating that indicates the quality of its
environmental attributes the assessment methods offer a clear and unequivocal rating that can be used to compare the
environmental attributes of different buildings common to both environmental assessment methods is that they are used in an
effort to steer the construction project so that the adverse environmental impacts of the building are taken into consideration and
when possible are minimized at all lifecycle phases from the manufacturing of the construction materials and elements to the
use and decommissioning of the building

construction 30 metres below sea level as well as the tight timetable ensured that the project has been a real showcase for us
the challenging nature of the project makes the success of the work and the winning of the award even more satisfying i believe
innovativeness and excellent planning management decided the competition in our favour thanks to the project management
contract model explains production director antti raunemaa

the jury commended the wellled production management of the contractually and structurallydemanding project in which both
implementation planning and control were executed in an exemplary way and timetable challenges were overcome through
innovative solutions for example with an ingenious framework solution

the main theme of the station is the sea and water this is reflected in the advanced architecture such as the roof which
resembles the shape of an overturned boat and the wall and ceiling façade at the platform which is shaped like the baleen of a
whale the station also boasts a 70metrelong escalator the longest in finland

srvs redi the complex under construction in the kalasatama district of helsinki is finlands largest and srvs largest ever
urban construction project redi will consist of six residential towers a hotel tower an office tower and a shopping and lifestyle
centre the highest skyscraper will top out at 132 metres

a major project of special construction
the redi project started in april 2015 with the construction of the shopping centre and parking facility construction of the first
residential tower is planned to begin in 2016

the construction engineering of the project is demanding and the project is unprecedented in finland 4d data modelling is used
to manage the construction and planning srv developed the modelling to support the planning and construction projects and
the collaboration between the different parties in fact redi is the biggest data modelling target in finland all data related to
redi and the surrounding area can be aggregated in the model enabling a more precise timeline and higher quality site plans
this also ensures that metro traffic runs smoothly since blasting work can be timed according to the metro schedule

indicative of the scale of the project is the fact that as many as 1000 people will be working simultaneously at the site and that
10000 people will work at the site over the course of the entire construction period

workers are needed to operate heavy equipment among other things about 900000 cubic meters of earth equivalent to eight
finnish parliament buildings will be removed from the construction pit during the more than yearlong excavation period

as the construction advances redi will bring to finland innovative equipment from around the world a tower crane of 145
meters will be needed for the 132metre high redi residential towers

huslab  a successful project on many fronts
huslab is more than just a laboratory building completed in june 2015 the new facilities bring advancements and efficiencies
to the finnish laboratory operations for srv the builder huslab means new innovations in the construction sector the
culmination of decades of customer collaboration and a career milestone for one specific builder

despite the tight schedule the demands imposed by the specialised facilities and the challenging location huslab was
completed about one month ahead of schedule to provide laboratory services for hus and the healthcare centres in the uusimaa
municipalities srv was responsible for the project management the construction and technical building systems work and the
implementation planning guidance for the work that started in spring 2013

the work at the brandnew huslab never stops the laboratory operates around the clock analysing millions of samples that
are sent annually from the hospital district of helsinki and uusimaa huslabs operations were previously scattered around
helsinki the lab spaces were becoming cramped and they no longer met the full requirements for modifiability and research
efficiency the lab employees were working in eight different facilities it was important to get them under the same roof the
new huslab building has been designed specifically for laboratory work so the laboratory operates smoothly and efficiently the
level of automation can be increased and ergonomic factors can be taken into account better also the premises are flexible and
can be modified in the future for changing needs huslabs managing director piia aarnisalo describes the importance of the
new premises

challenges spark innovations
for srv huslab was an opportunity to prove itself the new facilities were being built adjacent to a building that was in
service and the construction site couldnt disrupt the access of the 21000 people working in the area the excavation work for
example had to take into consideration the sensitivities of the thousands of medical devices in fact the challenges sparked new
innovations we took the sensitivity of the environment into account by using a completely new method for dust removal and
excavation technique in the excavation phase says production director antti raunemaa

the intended use of the building and the laboratories with their clean rooms meant a lot of demanding work on the technical
building systems the cleanliness standards for interior surfaces are at the highest possible level and the technical building and
equipment systems are comparable in part to hospital facilities this meant the utmost attention to detail in all work phases
raunemaa continues

despite the challenges the project was a huge success even with the short implementation schedule the project was
completed ahead of its schedule additionally the project was completed with a zeroerror acceptance which is a truly special
accomplishment notes teppo salmikivi director of properties of the center for properties and facilities at the university of
helsinki

the project was special also for antti raunemaa this is an important milestone in my building career this is the first zeroerror
delivery for me the 18year collaboration with the university of helsinki culminated with this 20th project and we finally achieved
what we have pursued raunemaa says

in many ways the project is also a culmination of srvs role in society we dont build buildings we build premises for people
to live and work in work places schools homes our mission is to improve the quality of life through sustainable solutions for the
built environment huslab is a great example of a project in which we have built a better future for finnish healthcare says
