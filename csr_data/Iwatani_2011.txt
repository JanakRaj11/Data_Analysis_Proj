bulk lp gas for disaster use creating a society resilient to disasters
bulk lp gas for disaster is essentially a large lp gas tank that can supply lp gas both
for daily use and during disasters in a major disaster when it is important to survive
for the first two days bulk lp gas for disaster use can supply energy even if electricity
and city gas are interrupted depending on the conditions for example and if half the
capacity remains a 500 kg model and a one ton model can run a gas power generator
and a gas stove for 24 hours supply rice for 100 people three times per day using an
attached gas rice cooker make hot soup using two burners and run one hotwater
supply equipment for three hours per day as well as providing a shower for three
days and one week respectively                                                                  bulk lp gas for disaster equipped with appliances for a soup kitchen
