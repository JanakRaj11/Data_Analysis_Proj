    proposed by the japanese government in 2009 he also details a specific path to reduction                                                       of applications where these outstanding characteristics can

        challenges and results of shinetsu chemical in fiscal 2010

       shinetsu chemical achieved its midterm environmental goal of reducing 2010
       unit greenhouse gas emissions to 66 of the 1990 level



       shinetsu chemical worked toward the two midterm environmental goals it had announced for 2010 reducing unit greenhouse                                                       as for the zero emissions target landfill waste as a proportion of total industrial waste came to 109 in fiscal 2010 which means
       gas emissions1 to 66 of the 1990 level and realizing zero emissions landfill waste 1 or less of all waste disposal                                                        that we did not achieve the zero emissions target value of 100 but a reduction of 012 from fiscal 2009 was achieved this
           unit greenhouse gas emissions fell to 642 of the 1990 level during fiscal 2010 meaning that the midterm environmental goals                                              result was due to investment in hydrochloric acid recovery cellulose recycling waste treatment facilities and other areas and effective
       for fiscal 2010 were reached                                                                                                                                                   use for cement raw material we will continue with efforts to reduce so as to drop below the 100 barrier in fiscal 2011
           this outcome was achieved through a variety of initiatives including introduction of cogeneration systems and steam turbines                                                 our new midterm environmental goal is to bring shinetsu chemicals 2015 unit greenhouse gas emissions down to 50 of the
       energysaving investment such as absorption refrigeration and other initiatives such as switch of fuels from heavy oil to natural gas                                         1990 level and each of our plants and departments is working steadily toward the goal by strengthening efforts for energy
       the reduction target for unit greenhouse gas emissions applied only to shinetsu chemical but similar efforts elsewhere in the shin                                           conservation and operational efficiency
       etsu group during fiscal 2010 produced a decrease in overall unit greenhouse gas emissions to 652 of the 1990 level
       1 the unit values shown are calculated using production figures converted from standard product units
       2 in the 2010 report greenhouse gas figures for co2 included only emissions from energy but the present report also covers nonenergyderived emissions
          including for past years


        unit greenhouse gas emissions relative to fiscal 1990 levels for the shinetsu group                                                                                           percentage of total waste material sent to landfill shinetsu chemical only
