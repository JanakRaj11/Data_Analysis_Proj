highlights
delivering value through communication and global expansion
nsk is not only operating its business globally but also striving to deepen its cooperative
relationships with customers and suppliers in each local community and to ensure they fully
appreciate nsks technologies and quality control



for suppliers
the quality of nsks products is affected not       percentage of locally procured
only by the quality of raw materials but also       materials and parts
by quality control during the production

procurement and local production nsk must
not only convey specifications but also obtain      70

            efforts to save energy and reduce co2 emissions
            concerns are mounting that the advance of global warming will lead to increasingly serious climate change problems and cause tremendous
            damage including rising sea levels droughts localized torrential rain and the spread of infectious diseases as well as having harmful effects on
            ecosystems at present the world is debating how to achieve substantial reductions in emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gases to help build
            a lowcarbon society companies are expected to make aggressive efforts to develop new and more advanced technologies that will lead to energy
            savings they are also required to help popularize energysaving products and reduce the co2 emissions generated by their business operations

      improving machining precision and reducing waste
      the akagi plant of nsk steering systems co ltd which manufactures products such as electric power
      steering systems has already achieved a recycling rate of 100 now it is making efforts to further
      improve 3r performance including reducing waste by improving equipment and production processes
           the plant has changed the machining processfrom cutting using blades to grindingin order to
      increase the precision of parts during the grinding process a grinding fluid is applied to the parts to wash
      away grinding dust while also cooling the parts the grinding fluid is collected in one location and filtered
      to remove grinding dust before supplying it back to the machine traditionally the grinding dust was
      recycled as sludge but now it is solidified with a newly installed compactor and sent as scrap for use as a

      the grinding fluid squeezed out when compacting the plant has
      reduced its industrial waste by about 70 from the previous year

      only half way there we will keep moving forward with the mindset
