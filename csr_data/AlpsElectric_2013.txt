 a customerin perspective is essential for alps to perfect
 products using these three core values which is why we maintain strong relationships with
 customers and share ideas about product development right from the early stages we deﬁne
 exactly what functions our components ought to possess and develop the necessary
 technology accordingly materializing our three core values in the process

a power inductor that achieves high eﬃciency using liqualloy  a
material researched and developed by group company alps green
devices co ltd liqualloy power inductors contribute to power
eﬃciency of devices in this day and age when power savings by
individual devices are required in order to conserve energy

switch with power generator
developed as a device that generates its own power by converting
energy from turning the switch on and oﬀ alps electric is putting
forward batteryless proposals for electronic devices and this switch
while retaining the light operating feel of existing pushbutton switches
can be combined with a bluetooth or other wireless communication
device for example in a remote control

current sensor
society demands that the equipment and infrastructure we use today is
energy eﬃcient as is illustrated by hybrid vehicles and smart grids
applying knowhow and technology acquired through the development of
magnetic elements to develop new electronic components alps green

 environmental management

 alps as a crew member of spaceship earth considers conservation of the global
 environment an important management responsibility in 1994 we established a
 companywide environmental charter and a mediumterm plan with the objective
 of becoming more proactive and preventive in environmental preservation
 since 1994 our environmental preservation plans have expanded to include a
 global management structure and a corporate turn towards green products
 lowering the impact our business activities have on the environment is a
 necessary step in perfecting the art of electronics

environmental management system

alps recognizes that iso 14001 the international
standard for environmental management systems is
an important criterion in environmental
management all our domestic and overseas
production facilities have acquired 14001
certiﬁcation and every certiﬁed location performs
internal environmental audits at least once a year in
accordance with the iso 14001 standards
                                                        an audit in progress by a thirdparty auditor
mediumterm action plans for environmental
preservation have been formulated ever since
implementation of our inaugural action plan in 1994 each site additionally creates and
implements its own independent plan environmental activity based on the seventh
mediumterm action plan for environmental preservation commenced in ﬁscal 2013




legal compliance

alps electric strives for full compliance with environmentrelated laws and regulations and
achieves this through selfimposed standards that are more stringent than legally required in
each country in ﬁscal 2012 there was one incidence of cafeteria wastewater exceeding the
imposed limit the incident was acted upon in a prompt and appropriate manner

environmental management structure

policies and measures relating to environmental management are ﬁnalized in the
environment conference comprising representatives of business locations in japan and
chaired by the director in charge of the environment finalized policies and measures are
implemented in japan through the environment conference and outside japan by
representatives and environmental management representatives of overseas aﬃliates as
secretariat of the environment conference the csr department falls under the supervision of
the director in charge of the environment and is charged with advancing environmental
management through the formulation of companywide environmental measures gathering
of information and other duties working groups reporting to the environment conference
have also been established to examine speciﬁc issues such as global warming and waste
emissions

 environmental impact

 alps electric has provided material balance reports since ﬁscal 2000 since ﬁscal
 2003 information from oﬀshore facilities has also been included in these reports
 however data on certain issues from overseas has taken longer to obtain due to
 some diﬃculties in the information collection procedure total material input and
 output of oﬀshore facilities have both increased due to recent production
 expansion subsequently contributing more to the material balance of alps electric
 globally

 in light of this we will improve the information collection system of oﬀshore
 performance data and utilize the collected data to continue to reduce total
 environmental impact

 earthfriendly product design

 striking a balance between environmental preservation and economic growth is
 essential for a sustainable society alps electric too develops products bearing in
 mind the desire to establish a sustainable society for example product
 assessments are geared toward reducing restricted chemical content in products
 ensuring eﬃcient use of resources by making products smaller thinner and lighter
 preventing global warming by cutting power consumption and improving the
 eﬃciency of manufacturing processes and helping to conserve biodiversity
 initiatives are also in place to enable a swift response to new chemical substance
 regulations



 global management of chemical substance content in products

 restrictions on chemical substance content in products are becoming increasingly stringent in
 order to help ensure product safety and to promote sustainability in society and it is more
 important than ever before that we meet these social requirements for example we need to
 be able to comply with changes to the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants
 pops and the eu directive on the restriction of certain hazardous substances rohs as
 restricted chemical substances and scopes of application are reviewed

 alps electric promotes design of products that do not contain hazardous chemical substances
 we have also constructed a global management system designed to eliminate hazardous
 substances from all processes from materials and parts procurement to assembly and
 shipping

 for example information on chemical substance content provided by suppliers is managed in
 a database accessible from any alps base in japan or overseas the database is used to
 conﬁrm legal compliance during product design material inspection manufacturing and
 shipping and allows provision of uptodate information to customers

compliance with reach

the euʼs reach regulation which came into eﬀect in
2007 requires companies to register notify and
submit information concerning certain chemicals each
year around two substances are added to the list of
substances of very high concern svhc which are
candidates to be made subject to authorization under
the reach regulation to ensure complete compliance
with the reach regulation alps electric promptly
includes svhcs in internal management standards
and to enable smooth communication of information
to customers we adopt measures conforming to             a sheet used to submit information
formats prescribed by individual industries like the      concerning chemical substances contained
automotive and electronics industries                    in products




promotion of green procurement

we use green procurement to provide our customers
with safer and environmentally friendly products
suppliers with proven management systems supply
alps electric with materials and parts that contain no
hazardous substances we deploy our green
procurement standard to suppliers to follow and
conduct the following two evaluations an
environmental corporate evaluation  our evaluation
of the supplierʼs eﬀorts towards environmental
conservation  and a materials evaluation  for
assuring that substances speciﬁcally prohibited by alps
electric are not present in raw material and parts
                                                          global deployment of our
we have also created the alps green procurement
                                                          green procurement standard
system which allows worldwide access to our

environmental corporate evaluation and materials
evaluation through the internet

earthfriendly logistics

in cooperation with alps logistics a core company of
the alps group we are pursuing earthfriendly
logistics
for example we have reduced waste by discontinuing
use of stretch ﬁlm for preventing load shifting in
shorthaul transportation through the introduction of
reusable containers we have reduced fuel
consumption by improving eﬃciency through
standardization of shipping cartons and reviews of
                                                         using returnable and reusable containers
delivery points to determine optimal transportation
routes we are also advancing a modal shift where
we have begun to use japan railways freight
containers in transportation leading to reduced truck
shipments and a signiﬁcant decrease in co2
emissions furthermore digital tachographs are now
used in trucks enabling followup instruction to
drivers and a set of 10 ecodrive rules were
created and established as operating standards to
lessen the environmental impact of truck                 container used in our modal shift

 preventing global warming

 alps electric reduces its co2 emissions through improvements to facilities like the
 introduction of highly eﬃcient systems and upgrading of energyeﬃcient
 production facilities and by conducting regular energy conservation patrols to
 achieve operational improvements such as improvement of compressor and air
 conditioning system operation and reduction of nonessential lighting we are also
 embracing natural energy sources by introducing solar power generation systems
 and free cooling systems

 under the sixth mediumterm action plan for environmental preservation we
 aimed to reduce co2 emissions by 20 from ﬁscal 1990 levels and reduce energy
 consumption per unit of output by 5 from ﬁscal 2007 levels but we were unable
 to attain those targets in ﬁscal 2012 the ﬁnal year covered by the plan

initiatives at bases

taira plant
taira plant has been installing energysaving facilities that enable eﬀective use of natural
energy sources including a solar power system 82kw and a free cooling system that draws
in air from the outside for cooling during the winter the plant also achieves energy savings
through reviews of system components for example by switching from compressorsupplied
compressed air to more eﬃcient blowersupplied air for air knives as a result of these
eﬀorts the plant has been able to reduce power usage by around 600000kwh per year

at taira plant we operate clean rooms and utilities account for around half
our power consumption ongoing improvements have been made to
minimize this energy use for example by switching oﬀ the temperature
and humidity control system on holidays when the plant is not in operation
all departments at the plant also joined forces to address the matter of
compressed air which requires large amounts of energy thanks to these
eﬀorts the compressor operating rate is now very low but new issues          onahama general
                                                                               aﬀairs section
have been identiﬁed such as an increase in consumption of standby power
                                                                               kenichi ohira

 reducing waste

 since ﬁscal 2001 alps electric has implemented a zeroemissions 1 campaign
 aimed at recycling all waste from oﬃces and production plants this target was
 successfully achieved by the end of ﬁscal 2004 at all divisions in japan

 under the sixth mediumterm action plan for environmental preservation we
 worked to reduce the volume of waste emissions and improve our recycling rate
 in ﬁscal 2012 the ﬁnal year covered by the plan we achieved a recycling rate of
 99 thereby attaining one of our targets however we did not attain our waste
 emissions reduction target as waste increased due to launching of new products
 and other factors


 1 zeroemissions a recyclingoriented social system involving elimination of all kinds of waste by
 eﬀectively recycling them into raw materials and other useful purposes advocated by the united nations
 university in 1994


initiatives at bases

dandong alps electronics co ltd
dandong alps electronics china audits waste
contractors once a year to ensure that waste is
properly processed the audits involve prior screening
of documentation after which treatment facilities are
inspected to conﬁrm that waste is processed in
compliance with chinese law that processing methods
are appropriate and that licenses from government
authorities are valid



to prevent pollution of the environment with waste we outsource waste
processing to specialized contractors but as the person in charge i was
not able to take responsibility without seeing operations in progress at
the contractorʼs facilities i also wanted to check that no secondary
pollution was being caused during the processing of waste

during audits we check original processing license certiﬁcates issued by   manufacturing dept
                                                                            wang haibo

 improving product quality

 before our products land into the hands of the end user they are incorporated into
 the products of assembly manufacturers  our direct customers  where they are
 given important roles in the functions of the end products of those independent
 makers in order to supply the art of electronics and services that satisfy our
 customers and the end user every alps employee is working to improve the
 quality of our products

quality control policy

each ﬁscal year quality management policies are established in line with the fundamental
quality control policy quality management systems are established implemented and
continually improved
in order to facilitate improvements in global quality performance qualityrelated
achievements and issues are not only shared within individual plants but also reported
regularly to the board of directors to be shared companywide

quality management system

international standards for quality management systems are essential for business as they
ascertain that all departments contribute to customer satisfaction through elements of quality
assurance every alps electric production plant including overseas had been certiﬁed iso
9001 compliant by ﬁscal 2005 furthermore plants producing automotiverelated products
have also been certiﬁed isots 16949 compliant our eﬀorts toward further improving our
quality management systems are never ending




eﬀorts to improve quality

originally the principle behind quality inspections was
to conﬁrm conformance of products with speciﬁcation
sheets agreed upon with individual customers
however that conﬁrmation alone did not prevent
defects occurring in processes performed by
customers or during use by end users

for that reason alps electric adopted a new
evaluation method based on quality engineering qe
                                                          basic training in qe for employees
the method involves verifying whether individual
products function correctly and is eﬀective when used
together with techniques for evaluating the consistency of functions in a short period of time
in preventing output of defective products education about qe provided to employees
besides teaching skills fosters a strong commitment to preventing defects alps will continue
these eﬀorts to ensure customers receive products of the highest possible quality

 improving customer satisfaction

 our customers are either assembly manufacturers who deliver ﬁnal products to
 consumers or are the manufacturers of parts that are required for assembling
 these ﬁnal consumer products in order to satisfy our customersʼ demands we
 must anticipate consumer and market needs by preparing in advance products and
 technologies that customers may demand in the future
 our global sales personnel believe we can contribute to customersʼ business
 scenarios by communicating with them directly and therefore enabling us to make
 suggestions regarding products and technologies from a customer perspective by
 realizing this concept we aim to contribute to society through our customersʼ
 products



 communication with customers

 communication with customers is essential for product development today as a way of
 grasping each customerʼs approach to development of the entire ﬁnal product and working
 together to make their vision a reality besides regular contact through sales personnel we
 create opportunities for existing and prospective customers to learn about our products and
 technologies through communication at trade fairs and exhibitions

 alps show 2012
 this biennial private exhibition is held to showcase our
 latest products and technologies in a single venue it
 is a chance to show customers the results of our
 development activities and engage in communication
 to set the stage for development of new products and
 products in new areas

ﬁrms coordinate with one another to monitor and supervise the companyʼs operations
enabling fair and honest management and therefore everimproving corporate value the
board of directors gathers once a month for regular meetings but is agile and can assemble
whenever required to thoroughly deliberate and pass resolutions on all important managerial
matters an independent outside director is appointed as part of checks in place to ensure
that directorsʼ performance of duties complies with the law in order to improve internal
controls we have revised standards on submission of items to the board of directors and
have enhanced screening of items prior to discussion or reporting in meetings of the board of

 compliance

 to achieve fair management alps electric makes a constant eﬀort to ensure
 compliance in other words to act in accordance with the purpose of the law
 social requirements and corporate ethical standards the important idea here is
 that it is not suﬃcient to simply go through the formalities of observing laws and
 rules we must commit to taking appropriate action of our own accord based on
 an accurate understanding about why those laws and rules are necessarytheir
 purpose and signiﬁcance
 given this view the alps group compliance charter was established as a clear
 statement of the fundamental compliance philosophy shared by the entire alps
 group the core companies of each business segment automotive infotainment
 segment alpine electronics inc logistics segment alps logistics co ltd
 globally deploy speciﬁc measures based on the compliance charter within the
 contexts of their respective business domains


initiatives at alps electric co ltd

as the core company of the electronic components segment alps electric established a set of
speciﬁc compliance regulations to build upon the alps group compliance charter
this initiative goes beyond the development and introduction of rules and systems
importance is placed on ensuring that those rules and systems function properly and
eﬀectively by encouraging individual employees who actually engage in the operations to
commit to taking action of their own accord based on a speciﬁc understanding of the
importance of compliance
speciﬁcally we make ongoing eﬀorts to maintain internal controls ensuring that the company
is managed and operations are executed legally and appropriately to monitor the activities of
company departments and related companies through internal audits to ensure early
discovery and correction of unlawful activities misconduct or other compliance infringements
through operation of an internal whistleblowing system ethics hotline and to raise
awareness among employees for example by disseminating compliance information through
training and inhouse communications

 problems including a shortage of teleconferencing
 terminals which are essential for remote
 communication low function and quality of
 teleconferencing systems a shortage of employees

develop a greater sense of unity among the entire
group in response we have enhanced the magazine
to include content from each of the three core
companies of the group  alps electric alpine
electronics and alps logistics and their respective
aﬃliates it is the group employees that plan write
and edit the content keeping with the publicationʼs
tradition as a magazine for employees by employees
