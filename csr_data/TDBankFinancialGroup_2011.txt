  results
   77000 fastgrowing hardwood trees were planted on
    48 hectares on the munseedelaware first nation land
   during their 31 years of growth the trees are expected
    to sequester 20000 tonnes of carbon dioxide after
    which they will be harvested for biofuel production
   the carbon captured over the lifetime of the forest
    along with the replacement of conventional fuel with
    the biofuel produced by the forest will further reduce
    emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

to get below 8000 sheets per person we will continue to make        donated to charities all hardware components are recycled
significant changes to our backoffice processes and enhance         within north america our aim is that by the end of 2011
our paperless record keeping options in 2011 we will be             100 of ewaste will be diverted from landfill
