mbacke dieng
ohs coordinator

during 2012 mbacke successfully completed the
training and assessment requirements to become
an accredited instructor of the internationally rec
ognized taproot root cause analysis methodology
program he is one of only two senegalese instruc
tors incountry of which we are aware through
his successful completion of this program he has
become eligible to attend an international summit
in 2013 to be held in tennessee united states

when asked how he felt about his certification and
the opportunity to participate in an international
forum he said i am very happy to be part of the
safety team here at sabodala and am always happy
to help keep other workers safe my training helps     teranga gold corporation
me do that                                                      14

learning and development
early in 2012 teranga recruited a learning and development manager who now focuses on the various educational
aspects of our sabodala gold operations site this role works as an advisory to the various departments work
groups and contract partners assisting in the development and implementation of beneficial learning opportunities
for their staff there were 23290 training events completed during 2012 a training event is recorded each time
either an employee or contract partner employee completes a training session


training events                                             training hours
total 2012 training events 23290                          total 2012 training hours 52274




there were 52224 hours of training completed during        we have set a goal for 2013 to increase our training
2012 training is recorded by multiplying the amount        events by 4050 and our training hours by
of attendees by the duration of the training session       6075 across our operation though this is a signifi
for example ten employees completing a training            cant increase in our training focus it will be tempered
session of eight hours would result in the recording        by the understanding that as important as training is
of 80 hours of training                                    it should be measured by the demonstration of the
                                                            knowledge and skills learned
