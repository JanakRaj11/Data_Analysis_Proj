  motion  control technologies                                                     around the world
yamane some years ago i wrote about nsks                            asaka precisely you can of course find our bearings
technology in my series of articles entitled the spirit of            and other products in automobiles but they are also
made in japan the age of the metal collar worker                  used in home appliances and japans bullet trainsin
which ran in a weekly magazine ill never forget how                  almost anything that needs smooth motion in addition
impressed i was by my findings even so i think the                   our products are used in the machine tools used to
name nsk may not be familiar to many people out                      make those products as well as in the steel and other
there could you say a few words about what nsk is                     industries that produce materials for manufacturing
doing for society                                                     yamane these are the kinds of places one would
asaka put simply we provide motion  control by                   expect to find bearings but arent there many times
integrating these two fundamentals we are contributing                when people say wow even here theres an nsk
to the safety and wellbeing of society around the                     product
world this is our mission statement                                  asaka yes there are its well known that many
yamane by motion and control what do you mean                        bearings are used in automobiles but dentists drills
asaka when things move they cause friction if you                   for instance contain bearings just a few millimeters in
reduce friction things move more easily and the motion                diameter bearings eliminate rotation runout and make
requires less energy friction is in short a loss the               it possible to maintain highspeed rotation at 450000
essence of our work is the ongoing quest to reduce                     revolutions per minute this helps to provide safe
energy loss to as close to zero as possible through                    comfortable dental treatment
products such as bearings automotive products that                    yamane there are also giant bearings right
employ bearing technology and precision machinery                     asaka some are four to five meters in diameter these
and parts by pursuing motion and control technologies                bearings are used in the parabolic antennas that
we are determined to make a contribution to the global                 receive electric waves from satellites and other celestial
community we express this determination in our                        objects and there are also giant bearings in the tunnel
corporate message motion  control                                 boring machines that were used to dig the channel
yamane when it comes down to it modern society is                    tunnel between britain and france
founded on machines and almost all machines have                      yamane those tunnel boring machines are some of
rotating parts making that motion smooth and precisely                the largest machines ever made i visited the channel
controlling itisnt that nsks role in short hasnt nsk             tunnel after it opened but didnt know that nsks
taken on the role of supporting the whole of society                  technology was used in the tunnels excavation
isnt that a role that will go on forever                             asaka in the environmental field there are many nsk
asaka yes we will always have a contribution to make                products in the gearboxes of wind turbine generators
yamane there arent many corporations that can say                    yamane i understand that the blades of modern wind
they fulfill a role that will never end mr asaka that is            turbines can be over 80 meters in diameter the weight
something the world should know abouteverywhere                       is tremendous and minimizing rotation loss is a big
you look nsk is at work                                              issue if the turbines do not rotate smoothly their

was shortened from 70 meters to 30 meters                      waste in transportation during manufacturing and
yamane by shortening the production line they                 distribution to address this we are taking initiatives
improved efficiency reduced the time required for              such as moving forward with a modal shift that takes
retooling and minimized workinprocess inventories           the environment into account
why did you choose younger employees for that kind              yamane those initiatives affect the issue of global
of assignment                                                  warming but by addressing the issue with measures
asaka i left it to younger employees because i want            like geographic consolidation investments will also
to encourage a groupwide understanding of the                  increase investors will better understand if it is known
importance of bringing new ideas to our work                   that infrastructural investment is aimed at reductions in
yamane valuing the ideas of younger employees                  energy losses throughout society
is a good strategy its one of the sources of nsks            asaka in the past some among us thought that
management strength                                            advertising to the general public was unnecessary
                                                                because we do not sell directly to endusers
     partnerships with customers                                however its important to have more people aware
            and suppliers                                       of the company so we are now putting effort into
                                                                communicating with the public
yamane in the past i think there was a long period in
which the strength of an enterprise was determined by            changing the mode of freight transport from truck and air carriers to rail
                                                                  ships and other modes that generate less co2 emissions
the enterprise itself but what about the businesses that
supply materials to nsk and the businesses to which
nsk provides products are we now in an age when                     for tomorrows global society
this kind of upstream and downstream cooperation                          and the environment
is important
asaka cooperation between product and material                 yamane how is japan as a country going to sustain
manufacturers is growing stronger in the past there           itself in the future i think were coming to a time when
were cases with automakers for instance where                 we will have to think seriously about this japans
nsk provided the bearings and other products as                 manufacturing is sound and technological capability
single units but in light of our customers needs the          is the best way to resolve the problems that are directly
proportion of unitized products has vastly increased           facing humanity
the collaboration that led to these products affords            asaka thats exactly right through our core business
increased precision and in addition the units are            in manufacturing nsk contributes to the wellbeing of
easier for our customers to assemble furthermore              society and the reduction of various energy losses
because so many of the materials we buy are special             yamane i hope you keep up your efforts to earn trust as
steels weve started to collaborate with suppliers to          a champion for the environment
develop metals at the level of their crystalline structure     asaka leave it to us we will continue to advance
yamane just as i thought lately ive really felt such        along the road of precision manufacturing and push
collaboration can become one of the strengths of                forward with our goal of becoming no 1 in total
japanese industry and now i see nsk is already                 quality
working on this                                                yamane thank you for this uplifting talk
asaka weve made partnerships with our customers               asaka you are welcome and thank you as well
and suppliers but the challenge we face now is the
supply chain there is still plenty of room for reducing

    making people and society more
    prosperous through nsk products
    the nsk groups precision machinery and parts business
    has contributed to an afﬂuent society one reason for this is
    the ball screw technology that has helped
    the group attain a leading market share
    worldwide this technology facilitates a
    smooth and precise conversion from

    ball screw construction and
                                                why is it that ball screws make such a signiﬁcant contribution to creating a

    first imagine a typical nut and bolt imagine holding the       by one to prevent this a passage is provided within the nut
    bolt in one hand and screwing the nut back and forth along      itself that allows the balls to continue moving indeﬁnitely by
    the bolt with the other hand the nuts rotational motion is     returning them to the nuts feeder as they reach the end of
    converted into linear motion this is the same principle as      the nut this allows both smooth motion and because there is
    a car jack with a regular nut and bolt though there is a      almost no play in the mechanism precise motion as well
    degree of play and the bolt does not screw on and off so             usually installed in machines the ball screw is typically
    smoothly a factor that makes its motion less precise to        used as part of a table together with a motor by smoothly
    reduce friction and make the motion smoother steel balls        and precisely moving the table back and forth this ball screw
    are inserted in a spiral raceway between the nut and bolt to     technology facilitates fast delivery for efﬁcient production and
    make it a ball screw if these balls were simply sandwiched    a complex series of motions at the precision manufacturing
    between the nut and bolt though they would fall out one        worksite

nsk is supporting industrial development and contributing to a prosperous society
between the 1950s and 1970s japan achieved rapid economic growth
along with scientiﬁc and industrial development to become a world leader
in manufacturing the tv set washing machine and refrigerator that were
once known as the three treasures of the japanese household and later
automobiles as well were coveted by ordinary people gained popularity
and were subsequently massproduced since those days these products have
advanced to become safer easier to use and more environmentally friendly                                                    ball screws

and as a result peoples lives have become easier and more prosperous

     nsks view of largescale share                                       nsks response measures are not intended to block
     purchases                                                             all largescale share purchases they stipulate certain

     nsk intends to fulﬁll its mission in the aforementioned               conducts a purchase for example nsk will require
     ways however if a largescale purchaser initiates a                 the purchaser to comply with procedures stipulated in
     sudden purchase without providing sufﬁcient information               advance regarding whether or not nsk should trigger
     or time shareholders may not be able to make accurate                countermeasures as a general rule the company will
     judgments on the matter furthermore the nsk cannot                  hold a shareholders meeting and ask the shareholders
     rule out the possibility that some of these largescale               to make that judgment however such countermeasures
     share purchasers may have no intention of managing                    can be triggered by a unanimous resolution of the
     the company in a reasonable way and this could                       board of directors including the independent directors
