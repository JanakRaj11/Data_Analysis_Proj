   the nextgeneration orbitrap fusion instrument is
   empowering scientists to perform more comprehensive
   sample analyses faster and with better accuracy at the
   biotech research and innovation centre at the university
   of copenhagen its being used along with our next
   generation sequencing technologies to determine how
   specific cancer mutations target and damage the protein
   signaling networks within human cells relating this
   genomic data to proteins may result in the development
   of new targets for pharmaceutical drugs  and new hope for cancer patients worldwide

   cold storage sustainability without sacrifice
   in 2015 thermo fisher made a pledge to the white house to reduce
   the use of hydrofluorocarbons by transitioning our entire cold storage
   platform to more environmentally friendly natural refrigerants this
   transition  the first of its kind in the lab products industry  will take
   place over a fiveyear period ending in 2020 and will provide a 49
   percent reduction in co2 emissions in that same time period we also
   plan to reduce the energy consumption of these products
   by more than 50 percent

   our new thermo scientific tsx series ultralow temperature freezer
   uses innovative technologies to reduce energy consumption and co2
   emissions by 50 percent compared to conventional freezers the tsx
   uses natural refrigerants waterblown foam is produced in a zero

    pursuing better paths forward
    the practical process improvement ppi business system is our operational discipline it enables
    us to drive profitable growth by continuously improving quality productivity and our customers
    experience

    our ppi business system empowers every employee to solve problems large and small for the
    organization creating a culture of continuous improvement in 2015 we launched the kaizen
    institute  a weeklong program that partners employees from different divisions with
    colleagues at a host site during the training event employees form teams to
    work on real projects aimed at driving improvements across the
    company




                                                                                         170m
    since 2012 our ppi productivity savings have increased




                                                                                150m

        investing time in reducing waste
        in two examples of our ppi business system at work we were able to significantly
        reduce waste while also creating a safer environment for our employees thanks to one
        ppi project we were able to reduce the amount of a hazardous solvent used in the
        production of dna oligos by 14 tons per year

        in another initiative our teams reduced paper waste associated with transportation by
        51 million linear feet by replacing paper packing material with more efficient air pillows
        the change not only reduced overall waste but also ensured the quality of our products
        through the process of delivery
