   employee photo competition
   


   one of the ways in which we celebrated our 150 year anniversary was by
   engaging our employees in a dialogue about risk and in particular how
   risk is seen through the eyes of different generations a dialogue is not just
   about words though it is also about pictures so we invited our employees
   to take part in a photo competition and to submit photos on the main themes
   of our anniversary generations and four of our top topics
   hundreds of photos were submitted and after the 10week competition
   employees voted for the best picture in each category
