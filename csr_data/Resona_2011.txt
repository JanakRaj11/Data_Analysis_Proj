corporate governance
basic approach to corporate governance
in pursuing the constant improvement of its corporate value the resona group considers the reinforcement of corporate
governance to be one of the most important management issues accordingly resona holdings is working diligently to
strengthen the responsible management systems and the surveillance and supervisory functions of the systems
with the injection of public funds into resona bank in june 2003 resona holdings became the first japanese banking
institution to adopt the committees governance model we have separated management oversight and operation functions
shifting certain responsibilities to the executive officers to enable quick decision making while bolstering the board of
directors supervisory function we increased management transparency and objectivity by appointing a majority of
independent directors not only to the nomination committee audit committee and compensation committee but also to
the board of directors in the interest of realizing highly transparent as well as sound and efficient management

governance framework at group banks ensures consistency in the strengthening of groupwide governance as a whole and
the framework of subsidiary banks governance structure that facilitates their autonomous management during fiscal 2010
