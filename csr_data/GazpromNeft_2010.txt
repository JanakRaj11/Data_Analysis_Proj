report the impact of the global economic crisis on some of the companys indicators may be misinterpreted as an adjustment
of corporate priorities the 20072009 overview on the reverse allows to evaluate the consistency in moving toward the
corporate goals such as effective business international reputation staff social security and safe production shown by the
company in different time periods this movement had different speed at different stages of the way subject to macroeconomic

started in 2007 and 2008 making itself a global company gazprom neft will continue purchasing foreign assets in addition
to its purchases of 20082009 tomskneft serbian oil company nis and an italian oil and lubricant producer

the company holds firmly to the vector of improvements and reorganizations in all directions set by the overview management

oil production
gazprom neft production facilities are located in major russian oil and gas areas
kmaa ynaa chukotka autonomous region omsk and tomsk regions in 20072008
gazpromneft noyabrskneftegaz remained gazprom nefts key oil producing unit

the company managed to increase the oil production general indicators by 56 in 2008
llc gazpromneftkhantos remained a leader among jsc gazprom neft business units
in terms of production growth in 2007 and 2008 127 in 2008 however the purchase
of tomskneft added up the largest contribution in production volumes growth at most
enterprises though due to depletion of many fields the production figures kept on
dropping in 2008 aggregate decrease in the oil production of subsidiaries and affiliates
amounted to 6 moreover the world crisis caused a significant cut of the investment
program of field support in 20082009 and affected oil production volumes in most units
as preestimated investments in production as compared to 2008 will fall in 2009 by 25
30 however priority units will accelerate their operations thus gazpromneftkhantos
will increase drilling rates by 8 in 2009

gazprom neft keeps a fundamental safety margin due to the fact that since 2007 the
company has been focusing on provision of oil reserves as a result by the beginning of
2009 the companys proven oil reserves amounted to 45 bn bbl this puts gazprom neft
among the worlds twenty largest oil companies from 2007 to 2008 gas reserves grew
by 1957 up to 2154 bn ft3

     the company considers complicated circumstances as a challenge and an inducement to work more efficiently in 2009 the
     largest amounts about 70 will be invested by the company in exploration and production gazprom fields in the north
     of yamal peninsula which will be developed by gazprom neft together with the gas corporation bear a foremost potential
     oil reserves extracted there amount to about 400 mn tons that is at the peak will enable the company to achieve an annual
     production of 15 to 20 mn tons which makes almost half of the current gazprom neft production in 2009 gazprom neft
     intends to prepare a feasibility study on these fields development

     gazprom neft is studying production opportunities in plenty of the world regions for example advantages of central asia
     include a mentality similar to the russian one experience and similar geological conditions operations are also possible
     on continental shelves of the west and north africa libya algeria where gazprom plans to launch some of its projects
     gazprom neft is a member of the russian consortium for heavy oil fields development in venezuela and became the first
     russian company qualified for operations in cuba gazprom neft will keep on its performance in those regions in line with
     expanding into the middle east iran iraq

     oil processing
     the success of gazprom neft in the oil products processing was achieved due to high level of technologies used in the
     companys units as well as their advantageous geographical location during the last three years the company has
     always been among the first companies in russia in terms of production growth rates due to such assets as jsc slavneft
     yaroslavlnefteorgsintez jsc moscow oil refinery and jsc gazpromneftomsk oil refinery jsc gazpromneftonpz
     is the largest processing unit of the company in 20072008 the omsk refinery showed strong growth as compared to 2006
     having increased oil processing by 129 from 163 to 184 mn tons in 20072009 the refinery remained a leader in terms
     of production volumes of light oil products and aromatic hydrocarbons among russian oil companies

     within the last few years the companys general trend included production of environmentally friendly products enabling
     to enter absolutely new markets so the omsk refinery development plan provides for a changeover for euro 4 standard
     gasoline and diesel fuel production starting from 2012 and after 2015 for euro 5 standard for these purposes in 2008
     the l249 diesel fuel installation was reconstructed in 20082009 two hydrorefining installations are being designed for
     diesel fuel and catalytic cracking gasoline and in january 2008 construction of izomalk2 an isomerization plant began
     the isomerization plant in omsk will be the largest in russia with annual rated input capacity of 800 kt its construction
     is to be completed in 2010 the new complex along with a gasoline hydrorefining unit will enable to increase the volume
     of automobile gasoline products and achieve  euro 4 standard quality

     construction of the isomerization plant is the first stage of the mediumterm investment program of environmentally
     friendly fuels production




        within the last few years the companys trend included production of environmentally
        friendly products
        oil products sales volume in the domestic market grew in 2008 by 172

     efficiency policy
      tactical optimization

     in 20072008 gazprom neft became a leader among topfive russian oil companies in terms of economic efficiency this
     is evidenced by the highest specific net profit of the company the economic recession started in 2008 put the whole industry
     into more severe conditions than ever before due to the crisis in 20082009 all managerial and expert efforts were focused
     on optimization of current and operating expenses the optimization policy will continue and will be further implemented and
     enforced with special anticrisis programs

     jsc gazprom neft management sees several possible scenarios of 20092010 the main scenario is based on usd 50 per
     bbl while the stress scenario assumes an oil price of usd 30 per bbl the package of anticrisis measures elaborated by
     the company for each scenario includes the following firstly revision and optimization of the investment portfolio secondly
     reduction of operating expenses and search for internal reserves and thirdly revision of contracts with contractors

     each sector has its own expenditures structure the policy of increasing of the companys overall effectiveness is intended for
     optimization of major expense items

     for oil producing companies key optimization measures include shutdown of notpaying and unprofitable wells reduction of pipe
     breaks energy saving projects in some cases anticrisis measures turned out to be needless due to efficient performance for
     example due to the fact that gazprom neft chooses precise and reasonable priorities in its construction program the volumes
     of construction of facilities meant for oil production volume support have not virtually been cut these include pipelines power
     lines pumping units roads bushes another important aspect of the crisisanticipatory optimization was the reorganization
     of gazprom nefts scientific and analytical department into the scientific and technical center stc in 2007

     the key goal of stc is to stabilize oil production in 20092010 and increase its capacity starting from 2011 when new assets
     are to be put into operation

     stcs researches are purely practical and utilize scientists potential in the achievement of business objectives and realization
     of the sustainable development concept for example after the center had examined the practice of bed hydraulic fracturing
     designs proppant a material increasing oilwell output costs decreased by 30 before the amount of proppant per well




        each sector has its own expenditures structure the main item of expenses in the corporate
        centre is employees while key production and refining costs lay in the sphere of power
        repairs and logistics the policy of increasing of the companys overall effectiveness
        is intended for optimization of major expense items

     motivation
     and labor remuneration




     gazprom neft applies a comprehensive system of motivation based on competitive wages and performance remuneration

     as far back as in 2006 with the companys growth new motivation methods and hr management policy had to be developed
     in 2007 a united system of quarterly motivation was developed and implemented it includes both achievement of corporate
     goals such as the companys financial results and meeting objectives relating to a specific functional line

     a system of targetoriented management tom is in force for key managers it allows targets cascading from gazprom neft
     general director to heads of departments of subsidiaries and affiliates the tom system enables to plan clearly and achieve
     the companys key performance indicators and realize most important strategic initiatives the program involves every of
     550 key managers of the corporate center subsidiaries and affiliates

     the so called grade system is considered to be the key element in the labor motivation being elaborated and actively
     implemented during 20062009 a grade means a range of positions having approximately equal value for the company
     similar functional competence experience and responsibility requirements a grade is determined by such universal
     criteria as professional skills knowledge of features of the business and the company social competence intellectual
     capacity and level of the work complexity independent decisionmaking scale and nature of influence the evaluation has
     determined job hierarchies which were subsequently grouped by grades there are 23 grades included into the system
     within the scheduled wage revision the amount of bonuses and composition of the package are attached not to the position
     itself but to the grade

     starting from some pilot projects launched in the second half of 2008 at llc gazpromneftkhantos the omsk refinery and
     jsc gazpromneftomsk the grading system was introduced at subsidiaries as well




       the grade system is considered to be the key element in the labor motivation being
       elaborated and actively implemented during 20062009

     social support

     social package
     in 20072009 gazprom neft traditionally utilized social programs as an additional tool of employees attraction and retention
     along with statutory benefits the social package includes voluntary medical insurance accident insurance death allowance
     payment for meals anniversary bonuses financial aid payment for tourist vouchers eventual financial aid marriage child
     birth etc holiday gifts for employees and their families

     in 2007 the average amount of a social payment made rur 147 thousand per employee which shows a 35 increase
     as compared to 2006 the dynamics continued and in 2008 a payment per employee amounted to rur 32 thousand that
     is more than doubled within one year

     cooperation with labor unions
     two thirds of gazprom neft employees are members of labor unions including 85 of employees from kmaa and omsk
     region therefore the 20072009 proved to be the years of close cooperation between the company management and
     the labor union primary labor union units are established at some of the companys enterprises so in early 2009 the
     employees of llc gazpromneftcenter decided to establish a primary labor union unit the professional union of oil
     gas and construction workers of the russian federation

     the company realizes that the goal of the labor union is not limited to the protection of employees interests and influence
     on labor relations but also represents a kind of the public mood indicator the labor union expresses the employees

     systemic tools of the safety policy realization
     the basic tool of the policy realization is the risk management mechanism in the second half 2008 the company developed
     and approved the procedure of detection assessment and minimization of industrial and environmental safety labor
     and civil protection risks which regulates this process

     in 2009 the company intends to launch a fullscale risk assessment of works performed on the companys project in order
     to form an ies lp and cp risk portfolio and elaborate respective minimization measures the risks detected according
     to this methodology will be ranked and pursuant to a risks importance certain correcting measures will be included
     in future budgeting

     in 2008 an integrated ies lp and cp management system was developed and introduced in the company complying with
     key recommendations of the international association of oil and gas producers and requirements of international iso 9000
     14001 ohsas 19001 standards the document allows systemizing all activities in this field setting respective priorities
     ensuring personnel development and forming the basis of enterprise assessment starting from 2009 the system will
     be intensively implemented at all units of the company

     moreover in 2008 the company elaborated and launched the azimuth system representing an ies lp and cp information
      control system for integration of collected industrial safety information automation and standardization of managerial
     reporting improving control of compliance with industrial safety requirements immediately informing about accidents
     and measures taken providing assistance in investigations directing them toward detection of key causes of the accidents

     outlook of the policy
     at the same time the company has got a considerable reserve for improvement of industrial and environmental safety
     gazprom neft is on the way to create its corporate ies lp and cp management system where any managerial decision shall
     consider and give priority to safety reasons therefore in 2009 the focus will be put on involvement of alllevel managers
     in the development of ies lp and cp system

     the companys priority includes the construction of a living system in the second half of 2009 existing targets will be
     complemented with new initiatives such as fire safety standard implementation as of late there have more fires occurred
     at the company as compared with the previous year 12 in 2008 against eight in 2007 due to noncompliance with fire safety
     rules wear of process equipment noncompliance with vehicle operational conditions therefore important measures
     to be taken in the company in 2009 shall include compliance with schedules and plans of current and scheduled equipment
     repairs targeted checks of compliance with fire safety norms and rules conducting fire alarm in offices and administration
     buildings conducting firefighting trainings on industrial facilities




        key result of the systemic approach to the safety policy
        in 2008 there were no work accidents at gazprom nefts enterprises
        two accidents in 2007

     labor protection
     and industrial safety
     reduction of injury rate
     one of the main goals of the policy is to reduce the accident and injury rate in a company with complicated and hazardous
     production processes this problem immediately demonstrates the rate of the corporations seriousness in treating
     of the labor safety

     labor protection costs per employee increase annually in 2007 the figure amounted to rur 6500 and in 2008 achieved
     rur 12200 the funds are applied toward workplace certification improvement of medical service provision of employees
     with ppe

     to avoid wasting of funds and ensure high efficiency of the measures assumed one should be aware of the kinds of incidents
     occurring at the company as well as of direct and systemic reasons of their occurrence jsc gazprom neft is aware that
     a system offering a possibility to hide industrial accidents is absolutely unacceptable in this connection the company
     implements a program for increasing of reporting transparency the companys subsidiaries and affiliates on a permanent
     basis exchange information in respect of accidents and investigation results

     consequently the rate of transparency in respect of accidents ratio between major significant and insignificant accidents
     in 2008 grew by 40 as compared to 2007 and achieved the level of the world leading oil companies the speed of injury
     cases reporting improved as well 97 of the events were reported within 24 hours

     the company management believes that registration of accidents without an adequate investigation and elimination
     of all causes giving rise to them is a waste of resources therefore in 2008 there was a certain standard accidents
     immediate reporting investigation accounting and periodic reporting elaborated managers and specialists were trained
     in comprehensive investigation lessons learned from accidents exchange is performed on a regular basis in 2009
     the company is going to keep on fulfilling regular quality analysis of accident investigations and increase the transparency
     of the statistics by at least 50 as well as reduce at the same time the number of major accidents by 30

     improving employees competences in labor protection industrial
     and environmental safety
     regular analysis of accidents shows that a great part of them is caused by noncompliance with occupational discipline
     and industrial process requirements therefore professional advancement of employees is very important in the sphere
     of injury rate control including clarification of the necessity of compliance with labor protection industrial and environmental
     safety requirements



        the rate of transparency in respect of accidents ratio between major
        significant and insignificant accidents in 2008 grew by 40 as compared
        to 2007 and achieved the level of the world leading oil companies

gazprom neft requires from all managers and employees of the company to be aware
of their responsibility for their own and other persons safety in this connection
any employee is entitled to stop andor refuse to perform an operation putting in danger
hisher life or health or that of other people in order to improve the employees safety
competence various forms of training and coaching are encouraged

in 2008 trainings were launched for the company staff in ies lp and cp specialists
of ies lp and cp department as well as instructors of specialized companies trained
about 1000 people in the major production sections

in 2009 the company plans to apply a more systemic approach by creating a division
of internal instructors with a corporate training program to be presented by them
subsequently

providing employees with uptodate
personal protection equipment ppe
although personal protection equipment is the last barrier between the employee
and the hazard in case of preventive measures failure it allows considerable
minimization of the hazard impact upon hisher life and health therefore the company
attaches great importance to the provision of employees with ppe the respective
program has been launched as far back as in december 2007 in 2008 an analysis of
ppe market was carried out and subsequently the following were elaborated on the
basis of its results and onsite tests

 a corporate standard procedure of employees provision
   with personal protection equipment
 a catalogue of ppe allowed for use at the company
 a technical specification for overalls manufactured in gazprom neft corporate style

while implementing the program the company focuses not only on ppe provision
but also on employees training for correct and efficient usage of ppe explanatory work
about advantages of ppe and innovative ppe

the company takes an active part in the legislation drafting in the field of standardization
of personal protection equipment for oil industry workers jsc gazprom neft has
proposed some amendments to the public standards of freeofcharge ppe provision

a pilot project on providing jsc gazpromneftnoyabrskneftegaz employees with doublet
winter overalls in the corporate style has already been put into effect

new types of employees ppe are systematically being put at disposal these include
purchase of wear made of fabrics not only protecting from hazardous factors exposure
to open flame electric arc and chemical substances but also complying with the re
quirements of oexotex standart 100 textile tested pursuant to oexotex standart 100
criteria guarantees that it does not content any substance hazardous to human health

     investments in the environment
     being one of the worlds biggest oil and gas companies jsc gazprom neft fully realizes its responsibility before the society
     for conservation of favorable environment the company tries to fully meet the requirements of the present environmental
     legislation compensating to the utmost the damages caused to the nature by its activities

     in accordance with active regulations the company takes comprehensive measures in terms of adoption of environmental
     norms and determination of maximum permissible levels of environmental impact requirements in respect of field
     development project documentation expert examination are constantly monitored as well as requirements in respect
     of hydrocarbons processing authorization and compliance with license obligations

     amounts paid by jsc gazprom nefts key units for exceeding the norms of environmental impact are insignificant compared
     to the companys scale in 2008 it amounted to about rur 58 mn about rur 47 mn in 2007

     during the last three years the companys current expenses on environmental measures including technologies of negative
     environmental impact optimization exceed manifold the amount paid by the company for the environment pollution
     in 2008 those costs made rur 10182 mn against rur 5777 mn in 2007 the funds are spent on elaboration of norms
     environmental monitoring industrial environmental control recovery of oil polluted territories equipment upgrading

stocktaking of greenhouse gases
oil industry operations entail great atmospheric loads it is impossible to achieve
immediate crucial results however optimization measures always result in positive
changes

during the last years gross gas emissions by gazprom nefts enterprises remained
approximately on the same level showing insignificant positive downward dynamics
in view of the companys activity magnification the stability of this index shall be deemed
as a success this was supported by reconstruction of industrial facilities replacement
of burner devices optimization of technological parameters reconstruction of tanks
and implementation of a unit for precise and leakproof loading of oil products
the efficiency of measures is growing consistently 2008 demonstrated a downward
trend in hazardous atmospheric emissions in 2007 from 1618 to 1572 kt the company
expects that the positive dynamics will continue in 2009

production of environmentally friendly fuel
the program developed at the omsk refinery provides for a complete changeover to the
production of environmentally friendly fuels by 2012 in 2008 about 9 of automobile fuel
manufactured by the plant complied with euro 3 standard requirements

in 20092010 an installation of annual rated capacity of 800 thousand tons isomerizate
is planned for construction the isomerizate is one of the most valuable high
octane components of todays engine fuel it does not contain any olefinic or aromatic
hydrocarbons therefore the end product fuel becomes more environmentally friendly
the upgrading will enable the onpz to change over to the production of euro 4 and
euro 5 standard diesel fuel

the construction of the isomerization plant is the first step in realization of the medium
term investment program aimed at the production of environmentally friendly fuels
according to gazprom nefts decision plants to be constructed at onpz will form the
basis for the company to enter absolutely new markets and contribute to the environ
mental protection

     power and water consumption
     in 2008 water consumption for internal needs grew by 15 as compared to 2007 due to launching of a drilling waste
     recycling complex at gazpromneftkhantos

     intensification of the companys activities affects the power consumption as well which results in a 55 increase from
     2007 to 2008

     in 2009 water and power consumption will also be considerably affected by the macroeconomic situation which determines
     the companys demands for new projects and activities

     waste treatment
     major part of the companys operational waste consists of drilling waste of iv hazard grade low hazard total share of low
     hazard and virtually nonhazardous waste grade v exceeds 90 in 2008 activities on improving of waste treatment became
     systemic which can be observed in the improved statistics

     jsc gazpromneftonpz processes waste oils generated by the enterprise by way of sending the waste industrial oils
     to a fpu fuelpower unit for reuse as a component of fuel oil

     in 2007 a mobile cleaning unit was implemented at oil products supplying enterprises intended for removal of solid deposits
     from the interior tank surface the cleaning is performed by way of supplying a special chemical mix to the tank walls under
     high pressure after the walls and the bottom are cleaned the resulting emulsion is pumped out and the mobile complex
     separates petrol out of it which can be used further

     in 2008 gazpromneftkhantos put into operation a unique complex of drilling waste recycling by pumping them into the bed
     instead of filling slime bins this unprecedented in russia project was realized in cooperation with mi swaco canada
     the ministry of natural resources of the russian federation distinguished it as the best environmental project of 2008
     in the nomination nature conservation technologies daily capacity of the unit for industrial waste pumping into subsoil
     beds achieves 340 m3 the plant achieved its rated capacity in september 2008


        the target of the program developed at the omsk refinery is to change over
        to the production of environmentally friendly fuels in accordance with
        the requirements of the technical regulations on requirements to car
        and aviation petrol diesel and marine fuel jet engine fuel and residual fuel oil

     due to production growth the volume of onsite waste treatment more than doubled during the year from 290 to 629
     thousand tons

     restoration of oilpolluted territories
     in 2008 the rate of slime bins and oilpolluted land recovery was increased in order to reduce the volume of damaged soil
     the company implemented binless drilling methods on a number of fields in 2009

     increasing associated gas recovery rate
     within continuous increase of environmental responsibility and economic efficiency gazprom neft elaborated and approved
     in 2008 a mediumterm investment program mtip for increase of recovery and efficient utilization of associated petroleum
     gas apg for 20082010

     the share of apg recovery at key production units of the company grew in 2008 by 11 as compared to the previous year
     up to 468 2009 forecast is 612

     total volume of investments within frame of the mediumterm program amounts to rur 176 bn of them

     o  ver rur 12 bn spent on construction of gas collecting networks and gas processing facilities
      about rur 5 bn spent on development of own generation
      about rur 600 mn spent on audit of existing apg resources recovery of lowpressure gas and organization of apg
        metering

     actual financing of mtip in 2008 amounted to 106 of the plan the mediumterm programs subject to their actualization
     in 2009 will allow achieving by 20112012 a 95 rate of apg recovery at jsc gazprom neft oil producing units




        in 2008 gazpromneftkhantos put into operation a unique complex of drilling waste
        recycling by pumping them into the bed instead of filling slime bins the ministry
        of natural resources of the russian federation distinguished it as the best
        environmental project of 2008 in the nomination nature conservation technologies
