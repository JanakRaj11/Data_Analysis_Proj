to get a better understanding of communities across the country we also collaborated with us news  world
report to develop the inaugural healthiest communities rankings this new platform evaluates communities
across 10 categories  from education and population health to infrastructure and economy  to assess which
communities offer their citizens the greatest opportunity to live a productive healthy life our goal in creating
these rankings is not just to recognize communities that are already making significant progress toward building
healthy communities but also to inspire change in the way communities think about and pursue improvements in
public health while no two communities are the same all communities can learn about best practices in their own
backyard and across the country then apply these lessons to improve the health of their residents


when communities are in crisis aetna and its people also take concerted action we responded to 2017s
unprecedented series of natural disasters with financial donations and employee volunteers similarly in response
to the opioid crisis we developed collaborations with hardhit states to fund vital prevention and treatment
programs this is in addition to our ongoing efforts to build healthier communities

world one person at a time

      corporate social responsibility

     as aetna pursues its goal of building healthier communities
      we view social responsibility as a critical driver of success
         and an integral part of how we conduct our business
one example of this integrated approach to corporate responsibility is our social compact with employees which
launched in january 2015 this initiative increased our us minimum base wage to 16 per hour which at the time
of the announcement represented an 11 percent increase on average and benefited about 5700 employees
along with this wage increase we announced an enhanced medical benefits program which went into effect in
2016 to help lower outofpocket health care expenses for some of our us employees


in 2017 we expanded on this social compact by responding to the issue of rising student debt among our
employees our student loan repayment program provides some financial relief for employees who graduated
since december 1 2013 aetna now matches usbased employees student loan payments up to 2000 per year
for a lifetime maximum of up to 10000 for qualifying loans


increasing the financial security of employees helps us attract and retain strong talent


we also believe that a happier healthier and more productive workforce is better able to provide differentiating
value to our plan members and by extension contribute to building healthier communities across the nation

        investing in employee health both physical and financial
        in recent years aetna has strengthened its social compact with employees by raising the minimum
        base hourly wage for its us employees to 16 an hour and launching an enhanced medical
        benefits program to help lower outofpocket health care expenses for some of its us employees
        we believe that these steps directly benefit aetnas members as a result of increased employee
        engagement and reduced turnover

        in 2017 we expanded on these significant workforce investments by launching a new student loan
        repayment program to help recent college graduates reduce their education loan debt and build
        their financial stability through the program aetna will match employees usbased student loan
        payments up to a lifetime maximum of 10000 for qualifying loans

improving the health system by focusing on valuebased care
we are a driving force behind the transition across america to emphasizing value in the delivery of health care
services we partner with providers to build valuebased models of care which can deliver more healthy days for
people while also lowering overall costs  today and tomorrow a focus on value also can help address persistent
cost and quality problems in the health care industry leading to a more sustainable system

with the valuebased health care model doctors and hospitals are paid for helping to keep people healthy  and
for improving the health of those who have chronic conditions they achieve these goals using methods that are
evidencebased and costeffective

taking a more holistic look at peoples health
aetna has been a leader in championing an approach that goes beyond a simple focus on individual health care
challenges to a consideration of the whole person and how he or she interacts with the surrounding environment


with this approach health care professionals from an individuals health plan  doctors nurses caregivers
pharmacists and others  engage with the person in his or her community for example rather than deliver
medical care solely in clinical settings the model might combine home visits from care professionals with telephone
consultations as well as traditional office visits this multidisciplinary holistic approach ensures that members are
connected with the right services in the most convenient and efficient ways



                                       whether that means you are being cared for by a pharmacist primary care doctor
                                       caregiver or some other local resource we need to surround people with teams that
                                       can help keep them healthy happy and at home

advancing health through mindfulness

aetna continually explores new ways to help make our communities healthier such innovation is demonstrated
by our mindfulnessbased wellness programs which have been shown to reduce stress and improve health and
productivity among participants


mindfulness is paying attention or noting whatever is
happening in the moment with a gentle and open mind
when people practice mindfulness at work they are better
able to respond in the moment rather than react instead of
multitasking they commit to doing one task at a time making
them more effective they can also improve the quality of their
interactions communication and relationships which builds
trust


aetna has long been a pioneer in creating mindfulnessbased
wellness programs that can assist in peoples personal and
professional lives in february 2016 aetna hired its chief
mindfulness officer and formed a team to broaden the
impact of this approach in mid2017 aetna opened its first
mindfulness center in its hartford headquarters a facility designed to help aetna associates learn and engage with
mindfulness and aim to change workplace culture


since 2011 more than 13000 aetna employees have participated in a mindfulnessbased wellness program we
have found that employees taking part in the program selfreported a reduction in stress levels by 28 percent and
gained 62 minutes of productivity per week


as of 2017 more than 20 employer customers have embraced aetnas mindfulnessbased wellness programs to
cultivate better health among their workforces

integrated information improves health
aetna brings together previously dispersed and disconnected medical information to help health care professionals
and patients make informed decisions that can deliver better health outcomes

leveraging the potential of these connections we are helping to address health issues while lowering total effective
costs through solutions such as evidencebased applications and clinical decisionsupport tools which detect
potential gaps in care and help to eliminate redundancy and waste in 2017 nearly 48 million care considerations
or clinical alerts were shared with physicians and patients reducing medical errors and improving quality

                                   in the spotlight

           activehealth outreach saves a life
           every day at aetna thousands of employees speak with members about ways they might achieve
           their best health but its not every day that we hear that our efforts saved someones life case
           in point bobby mckeehan a member in alabama who averted a potentially catastrophic medical
           condition thanks to aetnas multifaceted outreach efforts 


          mckeehan drives a school bus for the state of alabama as a member of the public education
          employees health insurance plan peehip hes been part of activehealths team up for health
          wellness plan since 2015 during a routine outreach campaign to peehip members health coach
          logan robinson offered to help mckeehan schedule his first call with a wellness coach  and was
          pleasantly surprised to hear him explain the impact aetnas program already had on his life


           mckeehan said hed received a care consideration letter generated
           by activehealths careengine based on an analysis of key data the
                                                                                          i have six
           letter noted that current or former male smokers are in general at high        grandchildren
           risk for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm and then went on             and i want to
           to recommend that mckeehan who had been a heavy smoker for 40                 see them grow
           years be screened for the condition activehealth also sent this letter       up he said
           to mckeehans primary care doctor who asked him to come in to be
           evaluated

           after an ultrasound showed an enlarged area in his abdomen mckeehan was referred to a vascular
           surgeon who found a 73 cm aortic aneurysm that demanded immediate surgery the surgeon was
           amazed at mckeehans story


           i cant believe you got a letter from your wellness plan telling you to get this checked out the
           surgeon said noting that most often such aneurysms are only discovered after the patient has died
           due to a rupture


           mckeehans surgery and recovery went well and he remains very grateful for the activehealth
           outreach which helped him avoid a potentially catastrophic outcome i have six grandchildren and i
           want to see them grow up he said


             activehealth care considerations are highly personalized communications generated by the
             patented careengine system which compiles member data from a variety of sources such as
             medical and pharmacy claims lab results and memberprovided information the careengine
             analyzes this information against evidencebased medicine to identify potential gaps in care
             quality issues and opportunities to improve health

improving infant safety

aetna collaborates with the march of dimes the leapfrog group and others on infant safety programs that
encourage women doctors and hospitals to wait until at least 39 weeks of pregnancy before pursuing electively
scheduled deliveries deliveries scheduled before 39 weeks remain common in some locations even though
experts agree it should be limited to situations involving medical need



what is aetna doing




       informing our pregnant                    encouraging hospitals to           sharing information with
         members about the                      avoid scheduled deliveries           members about which

             pregnancies                       are not medically necessary         for avoiding early electively
                                                   for mother or baby                  scheduled deliveries

improving holistic care through integrated behavioral health
longterm illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease can be complicated and costly to treat  especially if they
also involve behavioral health factors when behavioral health issues go undetected and untreated they can inter
fere with a persons overall health as well as their ability to follow a treatment plan


         many of the illnesses doctors encounter have an emotional
         or stressrelated component thats why we are committed
             to improving our members total health experience
clinical teams across aetna have been trained to recognize and assess behavioral health issues that often develop
alongside medical conditions such as anxiety and depression our clinicians speak with members using motiva
tional interviewing techniques which help to uncover information that members would not necessarily think was
relevant or important to share


behavioral health condition management

many behavioral health conditions dont fit neatly into single categories and can overlap each other this is one
reason why aetna behavioral health plans introduced a new condition management program in 2016 this
comprehensive program aims to engage our members and their families who are struggling with acute costly and
chronic behavioral health conditions


the behavioral health condition management program offers


         early identification of potential issues through sophisticated analytics
         direct engagement through intensive outreach strategies
         health advocacy for members to coordinate and work through coexisting medical and behavioral
          health conditions
         a unified approach that can help members access the right treatment services and resources

with low vision and blindness took part in usability testing for our aetna navigator website in december 2017



            i highly commend the staff at aetna for taking the time to do this testing because there are many websites
            out there that are not accessible to people who use screen readers many times a screen reader user will
            contact a website author to have specific issues fixed but in this case aetna is asking people to do this to
            help them identify such issues and report back to their web authors to fix the problems

our healthiest communities collaboration with us news  world report builds on the momentum of the
healthiest cities  counties challenge which the aetna foundation launched in 2016 in concert with the american
public health association and national association of counties the challenge is a competition designed to inspire
communities across the us to create localized solutions to their local problems  and thereby improve the health
of their own residents and community


open to small and midsize cities and counties the challenge requires community
leaders at diﬀerent levels to help solve a problem that aﬀects all members of their
community in 2017 50 cities and counties across the us were chosen as ﬁnalists
and they are competing for part of 15 million in prizes for those that show
measurable improvements in health indicators and social determinants of health


the 50 cities in the challenge are making a difference in their communities and in
january 2018 we recognized 10 spotlight award winners that have demonstrated
progress around key social determinants of health

                                   in the spotlight

          our multifaceted approach to a complex challenge
          americas opioid epidemic is a health problem with no single solution addressing it requires multiple
          approaches including promoting appropriate prescribing preventing harm from overdose and
          supporting individuals with opioiduse disorder to initiate and sustain recovery accordingly aetnas
          response to help members with substancerelated disorders involves different areas of expertise
          and different integrated initiatives


          in early 2016 aetnas health  clinical services group launched the companys enterprisewide
          opioid taskforce ewot the task force comprises representatives from various business areas
          such as health  clinical services pharmacy dental and behavioral health and is chaired by aetnas
          chief medical officer harold l paz md ms


          the group has been instrumental in thinking through aetnas comprehensive strategy to combat the
          opioid epidemic and developing fiveyear goals to help prevent misuse abuse and addiction aetna
          is committed to three goals which are the benchmarks against which all of our opioid efforts will be
          measured by 2022 we are committed to




                         increasing the percentage of members with chronic pain treated by nonopioid
                         treatment alternatives by 50 percent eg physical therapy or occupational
                         therapy chiropractic acupuncture psychotherapy biofeedback and nonopioid
                         medications such as antiinflammatories


                         reducing the percentage of inappropriate opioid prescribing for our members by
                         50 percent


                         increasing the percentage of members with opioiduse disorder treated with
                         medicationassisted treatment mat and other evidencebased treatments by
                         50 percent



          in pursuing these goals aetna is executing a comprehensive strategy that involves preventing misuse
          and abuse intervening when we identify atrisk behavior and supporting patients with access to
          evidencebased treatments

partnerships supporting states eﬀorts to fight the opioid crisis
the aetna foundation in early 2018 launched a new opioidresponse funding program that provides 6 million
in total funding to grantees in six states hardhit by the epidemic the grants will provide important resources to
empower local communities to address the unique characteristics of the opioidrelated problems they are facing


the first such grant was given to the north carolina harm reduction coalition which is receiving 1 million for its
rural opioid overdose prevention project the funding will help provide communitylevel risk education in five of
the states rural counties distribute naloxone kits to rural highrisk opioid users and increase adoption of best
practice policies on overdose prevention

prevention reducing the rate of opioid prescribing
advancing painmanagement alternatives

aetna is focused on helping its members avoid unnecessary opioid use and effectively manage opioid use when
needed in doing so were strivingwhere possible and appropriateto increase the use of alternative therapies
for members pain relief such as physical therapy chiropracticosteopathic manipulative treatment massage in
conjunction with physical therapy cognitive behavioral therapy and other effective alternative modalities

for members who are dealing with chronic pain aetna supports a multidisciplinary treatment approach including
both outpatient and inpatient treatment programs that consider physical social and behavioral factors

reducing the flow of prescription opioids

in 2016 to promote prescriber education and prevent potential overprescribing aetna sent letters to the top 1
percent of opioid prescribers within their respective specialties to make them aware of their outlier prescribing
patterns these approximately 1000 opioid superprescribers were also provided the 2016 cdc guidelines for the
use of opioids for the management of chronic pain in 2017 aetna also sent 480 individualized letters to super
prescriber dentists and in collaboration with the american association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons sent 249
letters to superprescriber oral surgeons

aetna now limits initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain to a sevenday supply as well as a limit of 90 milligrams
of morphine equivalency per day which helps to reduce the potential for abuse and risk of addiction we also
require prior authorization for all opioids for acute pain beyond the sevenday initial fill and also require prior
authorization for all opioids used for the treatment of chronic pain

we seek to support our members who are recovering from opioid dependency andor are at risk of an opioid
overdose to that end aetna has removed prior authorization requirements on generic drugs that treat opioid

          in mid2017 thousands of disabled ill and economically disadvantaged americans converged on a
          temporary medical facility in rural western virginia to wait patiently in line for health care services
          that for many were long overdue the vital care was delivered by a renowned nonprofit remote
          area medical ram with significant financial support from aetna


           ram operates mobile medical clinics that deliver free highquality vision dental and medical
           services to people who do not have access to a doctor or cannot afford to visit one in 2017 aetna
           became the first health care company to partner with ram and provide a substantial donation to
           the organization to support their work we also are expanding our relationship with ram in other
           areas of the country so that aetna members in rural areas  particularly those with gaps in care
           and unmet health and social determinants needs  can visit these mobile clinics to receive care


           rams fourday clinic in wise virginia serves between 1500 and 2500 medically underserved
           individuals at a cost of about 100000 in both 2016 and 2017 the aetna foundation provided
           significant grants to support rams health wagon medical services aetnas virginia medicaid unit
           also contributed to ram in 2016 and has operated a tent at the wise county event for three years

study highlights care improvements for arizona plan members
arizonas mercy maricopa integrated care mmic one of many medicaid groups aetna administers nationally has
developed an innovative integrated approach to serving medicaid members with severe mental illnesses this
approach which combines supportive housing supportive employment and
intensive community treatment was recently studied by norc at the university of
chicago to determine how well it improved health outcomes and quality of care
while reducing total cost of care


norcs findings suggest that improvements in quality of care can be achieved by shifting services from more
intensive inpatient and residential stays to outpatient and routine behavioral health care focused on chronic illness
care for example norc found that mmic plan members who took advantage of supportive employment saw a
35 percent decrease in inpatient medical hospitalizations and members who took part in assertive community
treatment saw an 8 percent reduction in er visits


along with these improvements in member care the study revealed significant cost savings see chart

          poverty simulation experience
          medicaid professionals put themselves in the patients shoes

          too often medicaid members live in poverty and are forced to compromise one basic need such as
          health care in order to meet other needs in their lives


          to better understand the tradeoffs facing
          medicaid members who live in poverty aetna
          medicaid professionals recently took part in a
          poverty simulation experience pse the exercise
          consisted of four 15minute weeks where
          employees worked together to navigate a series
          of daily stresses and challenges that people living
          in poverty often face in real life some of these
          challenges included trying to live on a budget
          below the poverty level scraping together money
          for utilities and food dealing with health and
          daycare issues without losing hours at work or
          income or trying to make ends meet by resorting                     note photo from a recent poverty simulation

          to illegal activities such as selling drugs or stealing


          employees who took part in the exercise shared such insights as these

                     it reminded me how important it is to have empathy for individuals who feel
                      powerless and to help ﬁnd more ways to empower them


                     i understand the challenges families face but did not consider the choices families
                      must face food and shelter take priority over their health we must understand those
                      challenges when working with our members

building fixture eﬃciency

less than one percent of the worlds water supply is available for human use1 however access to potable water is
essential to a healthy life this makes water protection and conservation essential to assure access to clean water
for all


strategies for reducing water and energy usage include installing lowflow water closets showerheads urinals and
faucets with sensors


aetna continues its commitment to reduce water usage by installing lowflow fixtures when lavatories are renovated
in both owned and leased properties


in 2006 aetna launched a multiyear construction project to upgrade the water fixtures at the hartford campus
since the program launch the hartford campus has reduced overall water consumption from 9500 gallons per
employee per year to an alltime low of 3581 gallons per employee per year in 2017  a reduction of more than 60
percent

building commissioning

building commissioning ensures all building systems are functioning at peak performance based on the needs and
operations of the facility if systems or materials fail to perform at their peak levels employee comfort may be nega
tively impacted system failures also require more intensive use of water and energy resources retrocommission
ing is regularly performed at existing buildings to restore them to optimal performance


facility commissioning strategies include


               installation and operational checks conducted by a trained maintenance professional
               regular updates of operations and maintenance manuals and training materials
               ongoing systemmonitoring upgrades




                    we are committed to ensuring that our owned
                     properties operate at peak performance
aetna has invested in upgrading hvac systems at several facilities at the hartford campus the installation of a
plate and frame heat exchanger and the operation of airside economizers allow for the free cooling of the building
during the winter months all airhandling systems at the hartford campus utilize an outside air economizer to
cool the entire complex during normal business hours during the winter additionally both of our data centers
in middletown and windsor connecticut utilize free cooling to cool the entire data center at full load during the
winter months


in 2015 aetna completed retrocommissioning for its home office in hartford the retrocommissioning project
helps ensure that all systems operate at peak performance the program continues to save energy at a rate of
3185133 kilowatt hours kwh electricity and 73100 centum cubic feet ccf natural gas per year as compared to
the baseline year of 2012


in 2016 aetna also completed a retrocommissioning project at its data centers in middletown and windsor
connecticut the program centered on the optimization of the computer room air conditioning units cracs and
reduced energy usage by approximately 50 percent this equates to an estimated annual savings of 924300 kwh in
middletown and 636000 kwh in windsor


retrocommissioning at these three facilities has resulted in a total annual savings of 4745433 kwh electricity and
74580 ccf natural gas or a reduction of 2778 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent co2e emissions

optimize energy performance

aetna has a goal to reduce energy consumption by 2 percent per year at select owned and leased sites and has
successfully implemented various energysaving techniques including replacing old wooden windows with energy
efficient ones upgrading lighting to higherefficiency lamps and ballasts and installing energy starrated devices
and automatic shutoff switches currently the rogers building at the harford campus is undergoing a major light
emitting diode led lighting retrofit which is projected to reduce the campus annual electrical consumption by
approximately 6 percent


aetna has also established a green data center program allowing the data centers in middletown and windsor
to operate 20 percent more efficiently the program reduces energy consumption using various information
technology it and building management strategies it strategies include but are not limited to the use of
virtualized servers and highdensity computer environments featuring dosecoupled cooling systems building
management strategies include increasing discharge water temperatures in line with ashrae guidelines from 2010
to 2017 these strategies reduced energy consumption by over 355 million kwh these reductions occurred despite
the fact that business demands for data storage and systems capacity increased significantly

state governments have enacted policies aimed at increasing the percentage of renewable energy in the us they
have offered a variety of tax credits to incentivize the use of renewable energy


aetna recognizes the importance of decreasing our reliance on fossil fuels to reduce total us ghg emissions
aetna understands that ghg emissions decrease the air quality of the communities where our customers live
resulting in a variety of adverse health impacts as a leader in the health care field we are committed to improving
the health of our customers and their communities


between january 2010 and october 2015 aetna installed more than 3000 solar panels the renewable energy
credits recs generated by these arrays are sold to a state entity and to the local utility company which helps to
increase the amount of renewable energy on the electrical grid


the systems were designed to have a total baseline production of 913389 kwh of electricity and in 2017 produced a
total of 828134 kwh of electricity an additional solar array is currently under development in phoenix arizona and
scheduled to go online in 2018 this array is expected to produce approximately 340000 kwh of solar energy per
year

source reduction  waste management

waste reduction is a global issue and a growing concern in 1960 americans generated 27 pounds of municipal
solid waste msw per person per day by 2014 that figure had increased by more than 160 percent to 44 pounds
per person per day resulting in a total production of 258 million tons of msw4


aetna recognizes that as an industry leader we find ways to generate less waste waste reduction strategies exist
for msw as well as hazardous and electronic waste we are committed to the proper handling and management of
these materials to protect public health


by communicating and collaborating with our suppliers we ensure thorough consideration of the choice design
and production of products used in our operations this approach helps to reduce the amount of waste generated


aetna has focused on reducing the total volume of waste while also diverting the waste we do generate away from
landfills at the facilities aetna owns we have implemented initiatives to recycle paper cardboard glass and plastic
bottles and fluorescent bulbs we also participate in a program to recycle confidential shredded paper across all of
our operating facilities


since 2009 the aetnaowned portfolio has recycled 3247 tons of material including paper cardboard metal and co
mingled bottles and cans this is equivalent to a savings of 12111 metric tons of co2e emissions

materiality and reporting
aetnas corporate social responsibility statement encapsulates our commitment to ethically and responsibly
pursuing a collaborative multifaceted approach to developing a healthier population part of this effort is to
promote sustainable practices in our workplaces and in the communities in which we operate

our corporate social responsibility council provides strategic guidance on fulfilling our social responsibility
objectives it also monitors our progress the council is composed of members who have varied expertise
and includes representatives from real estate services diversity compliance community activation and
local marketing procurement government relations consumer business human resources enterprise
communications and the aetna foundation inc

in establishing social responsibility objectives the council employs a risk management approach that takes into
account business and reputational risk financial implications and regulatory factors issues like sustainability and
climate change that may potentially have a significant impact on the company are brought before the council the
council shares information about potential risks and opportunities with executive leadership

aetnas executive vice president of corporate affairs oversees the council as well as aetnas sustainability
practices public policy positions and reporting against corporate social responsibility csr goals

aetnas 2014 csr report was the first to be issued in accordance with global reporting initiative gri g4
guidelines this 20162017 csr report also adheres to these guidelines

we conducted a robust materiality assessment to determine the content of this report this process involved
gathering input from internal and external information sources and soliciting feedback from numerous executives
across the enterprise to further inform our assessment we also considered data that was collected from a recent
review of aetna plan member appeals and service center call data and information that was obtained through our
annual customer forum one of the main purposes of the customer forum is to strengthen partnerships with key
stakeholders while also gaining a greater understanding about how to better serve our members and help them
navigate the future of health care

top issues for stakeholders

we have looked at health from the perspective of the employee the employer the provider and the system the
foundation has examined the issues impacting health within communities weve explored how to best navigate
whats on the horizon in the everchanging health care landscape we believe these issues continue to be top
priorities for both our business and external stakeholders


      the most important issues to both our business and to external stakeholders continue to be

                      improved outcomes                                     customer privacy


                      access to coverage                                    community development


                      plan performancecustomer satisfaction                employee diversity and inclusion


                      pricing transparency and plan literacy                employee development


for most of these issues the impact is primarily outside of our organization affecting our customers and members
the exceptions are those issues related to employee diversity and inclusion and employee development which
affect our employees

stakeholder engagement

our third comprehensive csr report is another important step in our journey of social responsibility by publicly
reporting our social sustainability performance we can start a dialogue with our stakeholders on these issues by
engaging with stakeholders and gaining a better understanding of their concerns we can improve our business
performance and have a greater positive impact on society


for this report we engaged our csr council to inform our csr materiality assessment and reporting strategy we
considered the perspectives of our employees customers communities investors and governments we selected
this group for our initial csr stakeholder engagement which was undertaken as part of the report preparation
process because of their insight into all aspects of aetnas business the csr council validated the sustainability
