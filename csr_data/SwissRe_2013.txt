                                                     3d printing a new emerging risk
                                                     3d printing is a method for additive manufacturing of threedimensional parts by
                                                     using computercontrolled printers objects are created by means of an additive process
                                                     where successive layers of material are laid down in different shapes 3d printing
                                                     is thus distinct from traditional machining techniques which mostly rely on subtractive
                                                     processes such as removing material by cutting or drilling

                                                     as the technology matures 3d printing delivers greater precision at ever lower cost
                                                     as a result its application is spreading across various fields such as the automotive
                                                     industry aerospace construction and medical prosthetics industries apart from
                                                     improving research and development processes by allowing rapid prototyping 3d
                                                     printing also enables new forms of product design by overcoming the structural
                                                     constraints associated with subtractive manufacturing processes

                                                     widespread use of 3d printers could have implications for various lines of the
                                                     reinsurance business such as product liability and recall engineering covers or workers
                                                     compensation policies it may also pose challenges for intellectual property covers
                                                     and could eventually even affect the marine insurance market by reducing the need for
                                                     transportation of products due to increased onsite production

                                                     for now 3d printing still faces certain constraints firstly most currentgeneration
                                                     printers are limited to producing homogeneous objects made from one single material
                                                     secondly printed objects are rarely as durable as traditionally manufactured products
                                                     and thirdly massproduced objects are still substantially cheaper to manufacture
                                                     nonetheless from an emerging risk perspective developments in 3d printing warrant
                                                     a high level of attention and should be monitored closely




                                                     3d printers create objects by means of an additive process laying down successive layers
                                                     of material because of its potential implications for manufacturing practices 3d printing may
                                                     create emerging risks for the reinsurance industry
