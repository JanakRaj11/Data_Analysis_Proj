                 a message from the
               gsc president  ceo and
           chair of the board of directors


the gsc story dates back almost 60 years and throughout that time we have strived to do the right thing  for
our customers for our employees for the communities where we live and work and for canadians as a whole
with our mission as a guiding light we are always thinking about the greater good

naturally that means csr is an integral part of gscs history and a focal point as we look to the future of the
organization but we are still learning this report marks just the second year of tracking our progress against
established targets we have presented the 2016 results along with our 2015 performance for comparison
purposes and are pleased to see that gsc is making strong progress in achieving the vast majority of these
targets this is also a valuable exercise in highlighting further opportunities for enhancement and additional
focus in 2017

beyond the metrics 2016 marked significant developments at gsc with a particular emphasis on providing
canadians with access to health solutions from launching surehealth  our new directtoconsumer distribution
channel offering individual insurance plans  to connecting plan members with health coaching from dietitians
as well as the ongoing strides made to reach underinsured marginalized canadians through our frontline
care program

a final note about 2016 the board of directors of the green shield canada foundation approved the transfer
of the foundation assets to gsc the assets will solely be used for social innovation gscs signature oral health
program with the mandate to increase access to dental care for the uninsured and underinsured is a major
new undertaking the next step in this exciting journey is to bring forward a business case and framework of
how we move forward over the next 15 years to make access to oral health care a reality for all canadians we
look forward to providing an update in next years report

as always we invite a twoway conversation on csr while reviewing the 2016 report please do not hesitate
to add your voice to the conversation by contacting gsc directly at csrfeedbackgreenshieldca

raising the bar our csr targets
here are gscs csr targets please refer to our dedicated sections for each pillar to see how we stacked up
against these targets in 2016 reflected in the green circles




                                                                                                              11

     our
     customers              putting their needs first



       gsc is known in the health and dental industry as a customercentric
     organization offering leadingedge technology and innovative strategies
       to manage benefit plan costs were committed to delivering a great
       customer experience in our everyday interactions with plan members
        sponsors and advisors ensuring they stay our number one priority


 when it comes to serving our customers and meeting our csr targets
 innovation and flexibility are critical we understand that continually
 expanding our suite of programs is a key ingredient in building successful
 longterm relationships

 in 2016 we delivered on that commitment bringing new ideas to the market
 with access to health care always at the forefront of our thinking


 surehealth  directtoconsumer
 distribution channel
 gsc is serious about expanding access to products and services to consumers
 on their own terms  and the launch of gscs surehealth directtoconsumer
 distribution channel in 2016 is the perfect example surehealth offers a wide
 selection of health and dental benefits coverage options for individuals to buy
 directly from gsc

 with the cost of health and dental services that are not covered under
 provincial health care programs continuing to rise it has never been more
 important for canadians to have their own coverage we believe that
 surehealth addresses this need

 added to that there is a newer growing segment of selfsufficient consumers
 who are more comfortable doing their shopping online the surehealth site
 wwwsurehealthca provides the access that fits this demographic

 website refresh  enhancing access to gsc
 accessibility was also a driving force in our website refresh projects in 2016
 knowing that our corporate website greenshieldca is a central touch point
 for plan sponsors and advisors we relaunched the site with a progressive
 look and feel and a responsive web design to cater to computers phones
 and tablets plan sponsors and advisors have their own targeted section
 on the site while there is also a direct link to our surehealth site for those
 shopping for individual coverage the refresh project extended to our
 student site too where a new look was rolled out

change4life  dietitian health coaching
late last year marked the launch of our dietitian health coaching offering which sets up plan members
with access to dietitians at local grocery stores participating dietitians will encourage healthier food and
nutrition choices with the goal of preventingbetter managing chronic health conditions eg diabetes
high cholesterol and hypertension through achieving and maintaining a healthy weight

this is just gscs latest development in the health coaching space augmenting our pharmacist health
coaching and smoking cessation program services our commitment to health coaching stems from
analyses of the canadian health care system which consistently demonstrates the difficulty and in many
cases lack of success in preventing and managing chronic diseases like hypertension and high cholesterol

the program consists of four sessions with a registered dietitian at a participating grocery store location
an initial assessment a practical handson session and two followup sessions we will share an update
on the programs impact in next years report


continuously improving our customer service
gsc gathered feedback from a wide range of interactions last year across our client base advisor
relationships and industry events all of these insights helped to shape new stateoftheart features
and processes launched in 2016 that have increased our efficiency and effectiveness in providing best
in class customer service

we introduced an enhanced web registration process for our plan member online services application that
included the ability to for plan members to sign up for electronic transfer of their claims payments directly
to their bank account money in their hands faster

we launched new cobrowse technology in our customer contact centre that provides us with the
ability to view a plan members screen when they are navigating through the plan member online services
application this reduces back and forth clarifications as we see what they see

95 of all paper claims are now scanned and adjudicated electronically this means the claims can
be adjudicated electronically ensuring that

    claims processing times are reduced

    claims inquiries can be addressed on the spot as the customer service representatives can access
    the claim electronically

    claims and receipts are never misplaced or lost




when our customers talk we listen
customer satisfaction and client retention are always front of mind at gsc in 2016 we continue to
remain ahead of the industry average for client retention and we always gain considerable insights
from our discussions with our client base

in 2016 we hosted two client councils for plan sponsors to meet with their peers and gsc leaders
to share our upcoming strategies and discuss industry trends

these sessions are highly valuable in ensuring that we understand our clients evolving needs 
and can be proactive in anticipating future needs

we continue to focus on our interactions with advisors too with that in mind we commissioned a third
party led plan advisory satisfaction survey in 2016 which gave us a clearer picture of plan advisors
experiences and sparked important dialogue gsc was proud to earn an 86 satisfaction score
                                                                                                                13

     our
     employees               they are critical to our success



     our fundamental belief is that people are the key to achieving our mission
     and meeting our business goals as a result gscers what we call ourselves
      see their ideas and efforts as central to the companys success and are
          applying their skills and dedication to make great things happen


       we practice the good health we preach
       the health of our employees remains a top priority gsc is known in
       the market for its innovative health management offering  and when
       it comes to looking after our own employees we practice what we
       preach we eat sleep and breathe health and dental benefits that
       means leading by example

       we put our employees to the test along with an exclusive group of our
       clients in our vip get active challenge which ran from september
       12 to october 21 2016 we ran this friendly competition through our
       change4life health management portal which provides employees
       and plan members with access to a range of tools to guide them
       towards their long term health goals for example

       based on your responses to the hra

       read educational materials and answer quiz questions

       to reach your fitness goals

       employee participation in the competition was rewarded with
       a hotcold therapy gel pack


       the next wave of ideas are coming
       in november over 50 gscers got together at the caboto club
       in windsor for gscs first ever thinkathon

       employees pitched a wide range of exciting ideas many of them
       centered on making gsc more efficient boosting employee morale
       and health and even enhancing security measures

    marginalized canadians through innovative solutions the series aimed to highlight the key drivers of big
    picture change in the canadian health care system from mobile health units to popup clinics the series
    showcased the notforprofit organizations who are changing the way that all canadians look at health care

    employee volunteerism  by giving back everyone wins
    volunteering is about choosing to give your time energy and skills to something that matters to you
    as a notforprofit organization gsc intentionally works to ensure that gscers are aware of opportunities
    for community involvement where they live and work one of the ways that this is accomplished is through
    a committee of employees from a variety of areas in the company intended to promote community
    investment through employee volunteerism

    the goal of the assisting community through support acts committee is to aid in the development
    communication and championing of employee volunteering activities undertaken by gsc

    gsc has established programs that recognize and contribute towards

    matching time  employees valuable investment of time for volunteering outside their regular
    work hours

    matching dollars  employees financial support of registered charities

    in 2016 50 of gscers participated in the above programs positively impacting 95 organizations
                                                                                                                  17

          gscers are conscious of the ways we affect the environment
       and we work together to minimize our collective footprint we look
       for new ways to make a difference whether through small changes
            at our workplace or largerscale operational initiatives
