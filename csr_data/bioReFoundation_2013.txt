    editorial
    i believe it is beyond doubt that all of us wish to live in a world in which all human beings are
    capable of leading independent and good lives in social happiness a world with an economy
    that develops positively without consuming more resources than the planet produces spon
    taneously the question is what is our planet going to look like by 2050 by then the
    worlds population will have reached the ninebillion threshold consumption in china india
    brazil and eastern europe will dramatically increase demand for raw materials will be very high
    and the battle for resources fierce farming surfaces will have become smaller rationalisation
    of labour will have increased further and there will be fewer and fewer people to perform
    ever more work surely business as usual is no option if we want to get closer to realizing our
    dreams sustainability has the potential of becoming a growth engine for the economy without
    us continuing to exploit the planet new technologies lifestyle changes new management of
    resources expansion of renewable resources recycling schemes and sustainable farming will
    be important drivers in the process

    thus organic farming is very significant today and will be in the future it makes important
    contributions to mankind the environment and economic development unfortunately our
    business in india has shown that coexistence of gmos and organic farming is not possible
    in agriculture which is something that gmofriendly circles keep denying in 2013 it was
    impossible for us to harvest pure organic cotton in india the share of gmo cotton in india
    is no less than around 95 today there are hardly any gmofree seeds available from fresh
    stocks this is a tremendous challenge that has caused new requirements along the entire
    process of management we have been forced to restructure our leadership organisation in
    india appointing new people and defining new processes responsibilities and priorities the
    highest degree of priority must now be given to shortterm supply of seeds as well as research
    of new seeds of our own another main priority is to push for more ownership by farmer as
    they are the foundation of organic farming and the social community fortunately we are
    also doing business in tanzania where we are expecting a large crop owing to good weather
    conditions our social projects in the fields of health education and training water extraction
    and improvement of livelihoods are doing very well in both india and tanzania the difficulties
    mentioned above are only making us stronger and more alert in our continued efforts to create
    a future worth living in for the generations following us on this unique planet i would like to
    cordially thank everyone supporting us on this fascinating journey

    organic
    participation
    of farmers
    farmer training on ecological farming methods are key to improving farming results training
    on sustainable farming practices are conducted in india and tanzania reaching all farmers invol
    ved with biore organic cotton projects focusing on participatory technology development 
    experimental learning methodology the farmer trainings are integrating community participa
    tion at its core be it on farmer field schools or at biore training centers in india or tanzania
    registered farmers with biore are organised in producer representative body prb the farmer
    representation system has proven to be a successful initiative there are frequent meetings of
    producer representatives where they share their views with management farmers are elected
    from the prb and form part of the board of the biore organizations


    sustainable farming
    practices for future
    generations
    at biore in india extensive research activities are being carried out under the guidance of the
    research institute of organic agriculture fibl switzerland since 2007 a longterm sys
    tems comparison trial and onfarm validation of its findings since 2009 have been conducted
    the objectives are to i gather information about the agronomic and economic performance of
    different agricultural production systems under organic and conventional management in sub
    tropical regions besides investigating other aspects such as soil fertility development and pest
    and diseases dynamics and ii to develop locally adapted technologies for specific constraints in
    local organic production systems the first publication from the trial is expected to be published
    in 2013 this study assessed agronomic and economic data from four crop rotations compri
    sing cottonsoybeanwheat under biodynamic organic and conventional management between
    2007 and 2010 including one conventional system with and one without transgenic bt cotton
    results showed slightly lower yields in organic compared to conventional systems but similar
    gross margins in all systems due to lower production costs of organic systems these results sug
    gest that organic farming is a promising alternative to conventional farming in cottonbased far
    ming systems in central india




    cotton seed
    research
    new components in research are introduced such as the large cotton cultivar evaluation
    project in collaboration with fibl and the university of agricultural sciences dharward
    the importance of this cotton seed research is high because genetically modified gm
    cotton hybrids are dominating the indian market last year more than 50 varieties were
    evaluated in the cotton cultivar evaluation project with the aim to select the best nongm
    cultivars suitable for organic farmers conditions which are still in line with quality standards
    of the industry finding the best cultivars which can be multiplied by farmers themselves is
    an important factor to sustainability in early 2013 biore and fibl organized a workshop
    on breeding and supply of nongm cotton seed at the biore training center the objective
    of the workshop was to exchange on present breeding and propagation activities and to dis
    cuss future perspectives numerous leading cotton scientists and breeders as well as other
    related organizations participated in the workshop

    group of farmers manages the organic sericulture project on selfsustained basis creating and
    diversifying income to farmer families and producing cocoons and silk in collaboration with the
    state silk federation of central india 20 farmers and the project team of biore association visi
    ted their farm to get exposed to farmers who are involved in mulberry cultivation and cocoon rea
    ring since many years the biore organic sericulture project will expand to 25 farmers in 2013



    income generating activities
    for women groups
    in tanzania three women groups follow livelihood activities two women groups bulyashi 16
    ladies and mwamishali 12 ladies are trained to sew different garments such as school uni

    for women they also stitch and repair cotton bags for biore like this the women earn some
    income for themselves and their families a third group was initiated last year minyanda 9
    ladies and stitching machines were handed over a workshop was constructed in minyanda
    village for the ladies to gather stitch sell products and also as a platform for the community
    meetings

    water projects
    last year the community in meatu tanzania formed water user groups and was involved in
    construction of 13 water wells reaching total of 60 wells since the start of the water pro
    ject these wells supply safe drinking water to 19200 people also the construction of tanks
    for rain water harvesting at primary schools and dispensaries are a practical and safe way to
    provide drinking water to people especially during dry periods where usually water sources
    are long distances from schools 3523 school children and many patients at dispensaries
    benefited from 10 new tanks constructed in the last year in total there are 20 tanks now the
    community and school committee support the construction with labour and local material
