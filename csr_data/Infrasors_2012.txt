  challenging trading environment and circumstances our affinity to evolve and manage our risks has been key to the success of the group
  in prior challenging years our versatility has enabled us to increase our market share in trying and testing times despite the domestic
  and global economic conditions


  as part of the replacement of the delf sand mine the main alluvial silica supplier in gauteng we continue with the planning of the delf
  cullinan silica mine infrasors received its bulk exploration right from the dmr and electricity allocation from eskom authorisation for a
  basic water use was received from the department of water affairs the drilling programme was completed and resulted in proven silica
  reserves in excess of 15 years the environmental approval application has been submitted and we eagerly await its finalisation prior to
  commencement of the plant construction at the delf cullinan mine


  we anticipate that the receipt of the new order conversion mining right for the lyttelton centurion mine will be accompanied by the
  plans to review its production capacity the approval of the extension of the mining footprint occurred concurrently with the redesign of
  the pit shell these events will result in the mineral reserves lom being extended to in excess of 50 years




                                                                                                                                                                      sustainabilty review
  subsequent to the end of the financial year we have become increasingly positive and have an increasingly robust and positive outlook
  on our delf silica coastal operation it is continually increasing its customer base in kwazulunatal the anticipated synergies and
  production efficiencies have borne fruit


  the marble hall operation continues to provide steady output which is expected to remain constant for the year ahead

  cash generated from operating activities increased from r339 million in 2011 to r360 million as a result of the higher sales from              markets in addition we continue to explore the roles our mines can play in clean air and water treatment initiatives
  operations during the year the cash outflow from investing activities reduced to r385 million 2011 r442 million due to a lesser capital    with the introduction of the alluvial silica mine at delf cullinan coupled with its continued initiative to enter the silica quartz market
  expenditure incurred during the year the acquisition of spec sands mining and beneficiation operation in kwazulunatal also contributed        the group is positioning itself to play a bigger role within the southern african silica market

  and applications for the mining environmental approval and full integrated water use licenses are in various stages of approval
  prospecting has been completed and the life of mine was confirmed to be 15 years mine layouts and project budgeting have been
  completed and project funding has been secured


  the construction of the mine fixed plant and infrastructure is expected to commence upon receipt of environmental approval pursuant
  there to the development of the first phase will commence with the final phases being developed once all of the final regulatory
  approvals have been obtained

  pienaarspoort silica quartz mine
  a bulk sample was extracted in january 2011 for processing at the delf sand mine the sample was crushed sized and washed to meet the
  expected profiles and sent off for chemical and composition evaluation


  evaluation of the bulk sample was completed during the year under review however further testing was being performed to understand
  the effect of using magnetic separation in the beneficiation process in addition a legal gap analysis was conducted on the remaining
  outstanding regulatory approvals during the period




  pienaarspoort property development
  the group has progressed on the proposal to establish a township and sell off the land which has been classified as investment property
  for capital profits


  infrasors through its wholly owned subsidiary delf sand proprietary limited is the owner of portion 55 of the farm pienaarspoort 339 jr

  measuring 501 hectares


  delf historically mined alluvial silica on the property and has explored and established the mining area for the proposed pienaarspoort
  silica quartz crushing operation in the north eastern portion of the property alluvial silica mining operations on the southern eastern
  portion of the property have been concluded


  consequently the land is no longer used for mining activities and is to be developed into a township establishment


  town and regional planners hunter theron inc have been commissioned to developed a township framework plan


  the infrasors board on reviewing the results of the development framework plan have elected to continue with the required steps
  to establish a township the project is currently in its 3rd phase of completion which requires the formal township establishment
  application submission to the relevant municipal authorities
  the application to incorporate the property as part of its urban development framework was submitted to the tshwane metropolitan
  municipality




                                                                                                                                                                      annexures
  once approved the final township establishment application will be submitted to the tshwane metropolitan municipality for
  consideration the information contained in the above studies phase 1 2 and additional will form the basis for infrasors holdings

  ifrs 3 2008 included a consequential amendment to ias 39 that brought contingent consideration balances within the scope of that                acquisition
  standard this means that instead of changes in the amount of contingent consideration being accounted for as an adjustment to the cost of
  the original business combination they are now accounted for in accordance with ias 39 and recognised in the statement of comprehensive          investments in subsidiaries are initially recognised at cost the cost of an investment in a subsidiary is the aggregate of the fair value at
  income the amendment clarifies that the change in scope of ias 39 is applied to business combinations on a prospective basis meaning that       the date of exchange of assets acquired liabilities incurred or assumed equity instruments issued and the direct costs attributable to
  where a business combination took place before the date of adoption of ifrs 3 2008 changes in contingent consideration are accounted for       the acquisition of the subsidiary

  the amendment clarifies that the option to measure noncontrolling interest nci at either fair value or the proportionate share of the         associates
  acquisition date fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets that are recognised by the acquirer applies only to instruments that       associates are those entities in which the group has significant influence but not control over the financial and operating policies
  give the nci a present ownership interest and entitle the holder to a proportionate share of net assets in the event of liquidation all other    significant influence is presumed to exist when the group holds between 20 and 50 of the voting power of another entity associates
  components of nci are measured at their acquisition date fair value unless another measurement is required by ifrs                              are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost which includes directly attributable costs the groups

  after initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses for the purpose of impairment testing
  goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the groups cashgenerating units that are          investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently
  expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units          withdrawn from use and no further economic benefit is expected from its disposal the difference between the net disposal proceeds and

  where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of the goodwill associated with
  the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation       transfers are made to and from investment property only when there is a change in use for a transfer from investment property
  goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash        to owner occupied property the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of change in use if the owner
