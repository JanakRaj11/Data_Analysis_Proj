executive summary

as an airline we depend on natural resources fuel water and metals are essential for flight
tourism  an essential element of our business  relies on having beautiful preserved destinations
for our customers to visit
we recognize that the airline industry has an important role to play in addressing global climate
change its estimated that commercial aviation contributes two to three percent of global
greenhouse gas emissions thats why jetblue is pushing the envelope in aviation sustainability
through groundbreaking initiatives such as a commitment to purchasing renewable jet fuel more
efficient planes and engineering design and operational changes to reduce emissions we prioritize
climate change opportunities through financial impact assessment the greatest opportunities lie in
the area where financial savings and ghg emissions savings overlap

sustainability is key to our longterm business planning at jetblue we view sustainability through
the lens of fuel efficiency risk preparedness and customer experience more efficient
and environmentally responsible processes and technologies means we can use less fuel  which
saves money strengthens the bottom line and reduces our impact on the environment 
protecting the natural places our customers want to visit
as part of our commitment to transparency this year we are expanding the reporting of jetblues
sustainability performance by incorporating the sasbi guidelines for the aviation industry these
additional disclosures focus on four sustainability issues and ten metrics that are deemed to be
material for our industry disclosure is not a static concept markets are dynamic and disclosure
must keep pace integrating sasb disclosures into our sustainability reporting is proof positive that
jetblue intends to stay on the leading edge of sustainability performance and reporting

topic 1 environmental footprint of fuel use

management approach

jetblue uses an integrated approach in assessing and managing its sustainability performance
where material esg risks and opportunities are analyzed through their potential impact on the
environment society and the financial performance of the company
in recognizing the many potential risks driven by climate change we work alongside industry
organizations such as iatai a4aii and icaoiii to establish a comprehensive and collaborative
approach to mitigating these risks in 2016 jetblue supported icaos historic corsiaiv agreement
joined the roundtable on sustainable biomaterials and signed one of the most significant
renewable jet fuel purchasing agreements in the world
we follow a robust methodology in determining our sustainability goals where the magnitude
timeframe and likelihood of sustainability risks and opportunities are analyzed to determine their
potential impacts

tr020101 gross global scope 1 emissions

jetblues total scope 1 ghg emissions in 2016 were 7484799 mt co2e detailed information about
our emissions in 2016 is presented in the table below

                                                                                amount metric tonnes

associated with our scope 1 emissions

change in emissions

in 2016 jetblues gross scope 1 emissions increased 581089 metric tonnes or 841 compared
to the previous year due to an increase in passenger volume as our business grew our revenue
passenger miles increased 93 from 417 billion to 456 billion from 2015 to 2016 leading to this
associated increase in jetblues absolute scope 1 ghg emissions a change in physical
operating conditions also contributed as congested airspace in the northeast united states


i iata international air transport association
ii a4aairlines for america
iii icao international civil aviation organization
iv corsiacarbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation

because of an editing error the sasb report issued on april 10th 2017 incorrectly stated the emissions percent as 108


                                                                                                                              3

occasionally requires airplanes to taxi longer at airports increasing jet fuel consumption while our
gross ghg emissions slightly increased we have achieved significant reductions in our ghg
intensity amount of ghg emissions per revenue passenger mile decreasing by 062 from the
previous year and 49 since our baseline reporting year of 2009

calculation methodology for emission disclosures

jetblue uses the climate registry general reporting protocol to collect activity data and
calculate scope 1 emissions we have used the global warming potentials calculations from the
ipcci fifth assessment report ar5  100 year to convert our ch4 and n2o emissions into co2e
in order to calculate the co2 ch4 and no2 emissions from jet kerosene and dieselgas oil we use
2014 climate registry emissions factors jetblue uses the financial control approach defined by
the ghg protocol and referenced by the cdp guidance ninetyeight percent of our scope 1
emissions come from gallons of jet fuel combustion which is tracked very accurately we also
maintain detailed records of ground fuel use so we are highly confident in our scope 1 reported
emissions therefore the range of uncertainty in our calculations is less than or equal to 2 our
intensity target changed in 2016 from reporting years due to a change in our operations in 2015 we
discontinued commercial cargo operations which affected our annual revenue ton miles rtm
due to this change rtm is no longer a relevant measure for our intensity target to determine
change in emissions year to year instead we are now using revenue passenger miles as the
denominator in our intensity target to measure emission levels against productivity

tr020102 description of longtermand shorttermstrategy or plan to
            manage scope 1 emissions emissions reduction targets and an
            analysis of performance against those targets


longterm targets and strategy to manage emissions

jetblue follows two international agreements to set its longterm emission goals the first is the
set of three industrywide goals established by iata from which jetblue has adopted the following
ghg reduction targets 1 a 15 average annual improvement in fuel efficiency from 2009 to 2020
2 carbonneutral growth from 2020 and 3 a 50 absolute reduction in carbon emissions by 2050
our emission targets cover 100 percent of the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from sources on
which jetblue has financial control this includes all of our flights and ground operations at new
york jfk international airport terminal 5 t5
the second is the 2016 icao corsia agreement which set a new global marketbased measure to
control co2 emissions associated with international aviation jetblue is currently following the


i
    ipccintergovernmental policy on climate change




                                                                                                      4

iata targets while preparing to meet the requirements of icao to be well equipped for long term
market growth in international markets
jetblues emissions targets are intensity based with revenue passenger miles the metric
denominator of our calculations the start year of the reduction activity as well as the base year is
2009 with a target year of 2020 since 2009 jetblue has reduced its intensity target ghg emissions
by 49
as evidence of our integration of climate change into our business strategy and dedication to
meeting our co2 reduction target jetblue has set three goals

        save over 500000 gallons of fuel burn per year through enhanced technology additional
         emissions savings will be possible if the faa complements our inaircraft investment with
         air traffic control infrastructure improvements procedural changes and controller training
         in the caribbean region
        integrate biofuel into all flight operations
        transition our whollyowned ground service equipment to electric ground service equipment
         where feasible for our airport operations

in order to achieve these goals jetblue has launched the following longterm projects

renewable jet fuel
in september 2016 jetblues commitment to renewable jet fuel as part of our climate change
strategy was realized through a purchase agreement with sg preston a bioenergy company this
agreement to purchase 33 million gallons of blended jet fuel per year for at least 10 years marks
one of the largest renewable jet fuel purchase agreements in aviation history and the largest long
term binding commitment by any airline globally for hefa hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids
based renewable fuel the renewable fuel will account for approximately 20 percent of our annual
fuel consumption at new yorks john f kennedy international airport with first delivery expected
by 2019
compared to traditional petroleumbased jeta fuel renewable options significantly reduce
emissions including pollutants related to air quality as well as net greenhouse gases renewable
jet fuel is a key aspect of jetblues emissions reduction strategy that will allow us to meet our goal
for longterm fuel use and emission reduction in addition the use of renewable alternative fuels
reduces our compliance costs in jurisdictions where emissions are highly regulated as well as the
future cost of complying with corsia and diversifies our fuel portfolio which decreases the risk of
oil price volatility




                                                                                                         5

nextgen
we are working with the faai in efforts towards implementing the next generation air
transportation system or nextgen by 2020 nextgen technology is expected to allow flying of
more direct routes optimizing flight speeds and improving descent patterns to reduce fuel use
with a planned investment of 60 million to equip all our planes with critical nextgen technology
jetblue initiated this process in 2012 equipping 35 of our aircraft with this technology our entire
fleet will be equipped by 2019 while the faa has mandated for the inclusion of automatic
dependent surveillancebroadcast adsb on all planes by 2020 jetblue is taking added steps to
incorporate three additional features to further enhance efficiency and safety
in 2015 we saved more than 150000 gallons of fuel and 1451 metric tonnes of co2e through the
use of nextgen technology in 2016 we continued usage of nextgen to reduce delays and lower co2
emissions from our gulf of mexico operations additional savings were achieved when the faa took
east coast radar out of service for maintenance and jetblue was able to continue flying its
normal routing to select caribbean markets due to nextgen technology typically such outages
result in a need to revert to nonradar procedures longer taxi times increased separation and in
some cases airborne reroutes nextgen reduced average flights by 38 nautical miles and six
minutes per flight in this scenario

airbus plane purchases
twelve new a321s were delivered in 2016 with 15 expected in 2017 we placed orders for airbus
new engine option neo planes to be delivered in 2018 all new neo aircraft from airbus come
equipped with sharklets providing built in efficiency for future purchases combined with newly
designed engines and cabin changes to improve fuel economy by 15

behavioral change
in 2013 jetblue introduced a resource efficiency program called just one more just one less
the program is aimed at increasing efficiency during engine wash decreasing potable water use
reducing water carried and shifting to a paperless cabin ipads for pilots inflight crewmembers
as part of this program crewmembers reported that the majority of flights were landing with their
water tanks mostly filled with the added weight of carrying the unused water leading to
unnecessary fuel consumption following a successful trial jetblue rolled out the policy to fill
potable water tanks to threequarters across our fleet of airbus 320s rather than fill completely
saving roughly 2700 metric tonnes of co2e emissions and 900000 in fuel costs annually

ecoearnings
leisure travel to latin america and the caribbean is a key pillar of jetblues business model with
destinations in the region making up onethird of our route network to better understand the link
between financial capital and natural capital in those regions we initiated a study with the ocean
foundation the study called ecoearnings is designed to predict jetblues revenue at risk due to
anthropogenic ecosystem degradation with the ultimate goal of motivating a collaborative effort of
key stakeholders to engage in protection of the marine environment thereby protecting revenue
the studys early results suggest a positive correlation between the environmental health of
travelled destinations and jetblues revenues from these routes in addition to environmental
benefits the ecoearnings initiative is also expected to have a longterm and progressive positive
impact on our revenue stream

irregular operation events irops integrity
jetblue recognizes the risk of increased frequency of extreme weather events brought on by
climate change to address the significant operational difficulties iropsi pose jetblue has created
a multitier plan to address weather events and mitigate the effects of storms when they do hit the
plan has detailed responses for various levels of operational impact outlining the associated
communication plan and each departments role in helping to prepare for the storm and then
restore the operation after it passes

shortterm strategy to manage emissions

while jetblue sees our many sustainability investments and initiatives as longterm initiatives due
to the longevity of their impact we recognize a difference between the timeline of large capital
infrastructure initiatives versus those projects that provide evident shorterterm results such as
reducing waste sent to landfills it is in combining shortterm progress through recycling
retrofitting and operational changes with largescale infrastructure investments of nextgen and
renewable jet fuel that we reduce emissions mitigate esg risks and create opportunities for
jetblue to grow and lead

sharklets
in 2015 jetblue began retrofitting our airbus 320 fleet with sharklets  curved wing extensions
which have the potential to increase fuel efficiency up to 4 on longhaul flights currently 49
airbus aircraft out of our fleet of 167 and all 60 of our embraer planes have sharklets installed

transportation fleet improvements
jetblue sees an opportunity to transition ancillary assets to more efficient energy sources and
systems including a transition from conventional diesel and gasoline ground support equipment
gse to plugin electric by transitioning from diesel fuel to electric vehicles jetblue estimates

                                                                                                       7

an annual reduction of 270 metric tons of co2 equivalent ghg emissions as well as significant
reductions from other emissions to help reduce air pollution though dependent on usage one
vehicle saves an average of 10 metric tons or 22000 pounds of co2e annually the use of electric
vehicles on the ground also has significant financial benefits by lowering risks that might emerge
due to oil price volatility and ensure compliance with regulations in locations where emissions are
highly regulated such as california
in 2016 jetblue completed our first trial of electric gse which included 12 units over seven months
at jfk our biggest airport following its success we purchased 20 new electric vehicles for the
california airports we serve increasing the proportion of our electric fleets at oakland and long
beach airports from 34 to 65 we plan to announce additional expansion in 2017 over a 13 year
period  the useful life of electric charging stations  we estimate a reduction of over 25000 tons of
carbon monoxide 684 tons of volatile organic compounds and 1057 tons of nitric oxide electric
ground support equipment also saves fuel and maintenance costs at jfk we anticipate over
1000000 in fuel savings over the next five years in long beach we anticipate savings of
approximately 40000 in energy costs annually by transitioning to electric ground support

carbon offset projects
jetblue offset 144000 metric tonnes of co2e in 2016 offsets support the amazon tropical
rainforest protection and community enhancement reddi  project which prevents millions of
tonnes of co2e from entering the atmosphere produces oxygen and improves local air and water
quality by filtering pollutants while restoring biodiversity jetblue also planted 18500 trees in
californias angeles national forest in 2016 as part of our offsetting program we encourage our
customers to follow suit with a postticket purchase link to offset the emissions of their flight since
2008 jetblue has offset over 17 billion pounds of co2e

waste recovery
recycling has positive progressive shortterm impacts on the environment both through diverting
waste from landfills and reducing associated emissions we recycle track and measure plastic
bottle and aluminum can waste on all domestic flights and in all domestic airports as part of our
recycling initiatives we recycle all bottles and cans on each flight and maintain a waste tracking
system at all us airports we serve the tracking system helps us record inflight recycling
compliance  including sorting  and monitor whether crewmembers on the ground bring
recycling bags to the correct containers in 2016 our recycling adoption rate for domestic flights
was 82 percent across all us jetblue flights we estimate that we have recycled nearly 60 million
bottles and cans since 2013 preventing 3850 metrics tonnes of co2 equivalent ghg emissions
being released into the atmosphere




i reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation




                                                                                                          8

we compost waste produced at two of our jfk terminal 5 t5 food court stores in 2016 we
composted an average 100000 pounds of food scraps from dunkin donuts and jamba juice mostly
made up of coffee grounds and fruit peels diverting this waste from landfills saved 38 tonnes of
scope 3 co2e emissions

association with emissions disclosurereporting or reduction programs
jetblue works with icao iata and a4a to reduce dependence on fossilbased fuels we are actively
pursuing sustainable jet fuel to limit the risk associated with future regulation of fossil fuels we
prioritize climate change opportunities through financial impact assessment the greatest
opportunities lie in the area where financial savings and ghg emissions savings overlap the
naturally compatible business case for fuel efficiency makes new fuelefficient options and nextgen
flying techniques a priority

in 2015 jetblue joined the american business act on climate pledge a white house initiative that
involves more than 150 companies demonstrating an ongoing commitment to climate action and
voicing support for the conference of parties 21 cop21 paris climate negotiations in 2016 jetblue
became the first us airline to join the roundtable on sustainable biomaterials
rsb helping us prepare for increased emission reductions through renewable fuels and
providing us the opportunity to contribute to a coalition of organizations working to make renewable
fuels more viable recognizing that jet fuel is the biggest component of emissions we announced a
renewable jet fuel purchase agreement that over 10 years which is to be incorporated in regular
operations in 2019

topic 2 labor relations

management approach

we aim to foster a direct relationship between crewmembers and leadership with the belief that
doing so is in the best interests of our crewmembers our customers and our shareholders
for this reason we have six crewmemberled values committees elected by their peers to
influence company policies work with leadership identify and advocate for resolutions to challenges
and help maintain our company culture values committees serve as a vehicle for crewmembers to
have direct input in matters pertaining to their work experience through values committees our
crewmembers make important contributions to their workgroup as well as complex companywide
projects such as the aircraft restyling project our leadership team communicates on a regular
basis with all crewmembers in order to support our direct relationship and to keep everyone
informed about news strategy updates and challenges affecting the airline industry communication
channels include email messages weekday news updates crewmember engagement surveys a
quarterly crewmember magazine and active leadership participation in new hire orientations
leadership is also heavily involved in periodic open forum meetings across our network called
pocket sessions which are often recorded and posted on our intranet

tr020105 percentage of active workforce covered under collective
bargaining agreements broken down by us and foreign employees

at the current moment none of our crewmembers are represented under collective bargaining
agreements in 2014 jetblue pilots elected to be represented by alpai we are currently working
with our pilots and alpa to reach our first collective bargaining agreement once finalized 167 of
our crewmembers all pilots will be represented by alpa
jetblues workforce is broadly diversified among several job classifications with airport operations
crewmembers the largest group at 32 nearly all 97 of jetblues workforce is based in the us

approach to labor relations

topic 3 competitive behavior

management approach

known as new yorks hometown airline jetblue has grown since it was founded in 1998 to serve
101 destinations across the americas with 20000 crewmembers delivering awardwinning
customer service every day from its first flights at an underutilized new york jfk in 2000 jetblue
has succeeded through nearly two decades of industry change without a merger bankruptcy or
furloughs
since its first flight jetblue has brought much needed competition to markets that were
underserved overpriced or both jetblues track record of entering these markets with a lower
fare and superior product offering often results in lower fares and increased traffic  stimulating
demand and benefitting customers and communities
the us airline industry has experienced an unprecedented number of mergers and airline
bankruptcies over the past 20 years and today four airlines control more than 80 percent of the
industry a fifth controls 7 percent jetblue while the largest domestic airline in new york boston
fort lauderdale and a major impetus for low fare competition in these major markets has only five
percent
in addition to us industry consolidation the rise of international joint ventures and immunized
alliances has had a detrimental effect on competition just as weve seen airfares rise in domestic
markets without the presence of jetblue or other low fare carriers fares in the north atlantic and
pacific markets are also up with immunized joint ventures controlling more than fourfifths of the
market smaller airlines interested in these international markets are faced with barriers to entry
including limited access to airport gates and slots controlled by the three major global alliances
in the increasingly consolidated airline industry where fewer and larger players dominate the
landscape we recognize the need to advocate for maintaining our nations open skies agreements
and for important protections such as ensuring airport access and term limits on immunity from
antitrust laws that will allow small but vital competitors like jetblue to continue offering low fares
and protect the interests of consumers we have a dedicated government affairs team that
advocates for such conditions noting the positive impacts of competition in creating more
sustainable growth increased innovation and better customer service


political contributions

to protect the interests of our customers and business we build relationships with government
officials throughout our network and advocate for relevant positive public policies we are
members of the trade associations airlines for america the international air transport association
and the latin america and caribbean air transport association these act to protect the interests
of the industry and their members including by lobbying on local state federal and international
policy issues

                                                                                                      13

our policy for political contributions states that in rare cases we can also make financial
contributions to candidates for office in 2016 we made no such contributions if they wish to
crewmembers can make financial contributions to support political candidates campaigns and
committees that will be beneficial for our business through the jetblue airways corporation
crewmember good government fund jetblue pac read full details of 2016 contributions in
jetblue pacs federal election commission filings



tr020107 amount of legal and regulatory fines and settlements associated
               with anticompetative practises

our approach to competition is reflected in the fact that in 2016 jetblue paid no legal fees or
regulatory fines or settlements associated with anticompetitive practices




                                                                                                   14

topic 4 accidents and safety management

management approach

at jetblue safety is always our top priority as it should be for every airline while air travel is one of
the safest modes of transport airlines are held to high safety standards with consumers expecting
completely safe and accidentfree operations moreover aviation accidents may result in significant
environmental and social impacts requiring payments for remediation and compensation of
victims and impacting investors safety incidents or violations of safety regulations can have a
lasting impact on reputation and can lead to lower demand from passengers accidents even if they
occur rarely can lead to significant and longterm impacts on reputation and revenue growth we
are acutely aware of these risks with mitigation a top priority
                                                    is likely to have incidents or an accident which
if an organization accepts too much safety risk it16
has direct costs as well as indirect costs that impact the brand however an organization can be
too risk adverse to the point that it fails to seek revenue or assumes too many costs related to
protection jetblues safety management system utilizes advanced safety processes and data
analytics to make informed riskbased decisions this allows jetblue to strike the balance between
production versus protection to operate a safe and profitable airline
jetblues unique culture prizes innovation and drives safety management in two ways first
through technology we utilize an enterprise database tool from rolls royce called visium aqd to
collect track and manage our safety processes and data in addition we employ a comprehensive
suite of analytical tools on our safety data such as business intelligence software like spotfire and
hypercube all backed by highlytrained analysts expert in statistical methods querying and
programming second our emphasis on the human element of safety management means we take
into account the latest human factors and system safety approaches to create the most reliable
systems and services whats more jetblue strongly promotes its 1 value of safety individual
crewmembers are expected and encouraged to report hazards issues concerns occurrences and
incidents confidentially and propose solutions without facing any reprisal
accountability for safety starts at the top of the organization ceo robin hayes has ownership and
ultimate responsibility for safety at jetblue but crewleaders at all levels of the organization are
responsible for developing implementing and maintaining safetyoperational processes and
practices within their area of responsibility including

      1 risk assessment and hazard identification
      2 managing safety risks and ensuring risk is reduced as reasonable and practical
      3 assuring the effectiveness of safety risk controls
      4 promoting safety awareness
      5 complying with all applicable regulatory requirements




                                                                                                           15

     6 advising the senior leaders or the safety department of any need for improvement
     7 striving to continually improve safety

2016 safety highlights

during 2016 jetblue initiated four new safetyrelated practices
     1 level entry boarding for customers with disabilities in international destinations from
          crewmember reports in addition to findings under an acaai audit it was determined that
          carrying customers with disabilities down air stairs was a safety concern reports were
          brought to the airports risk working group and to the security review board where funding
          was approved to address this concern while this is not a regulatory requirement it will
          improve the customer experience and support our proactive safety program
     2 installation of coffee brew shields across the fleet to protect the inflight crew from possible
          injury from exploding coffee packets brew shields were installed on all coffee machines
     3 prohibition of hoverboards on all flights when it became known that hoverboards had the
          potential to catch on fire jetblue became the first us airline to ban hoverboards the rest of
          the industry followed shortly afterwards
     4 change management process in 2016 jetblue adopted a new policy that whenever an
          operational department requests a change in process a change management form detailing
          how this change will affect other departments must be filled out and reviewed the affected
          departments are then able to work in coordination with the safety department to identify
          whether there is a safety risk involved in the proposed change this policy change was
          enacted as a result of the 2015 decision to remove the cargo department from our business
          operations the implications of this decision meant that controls for internal corporate
          shipping were eliminated as well which posed a safety risk which hadnt been factored into
          the initial decision making process




tr020108 description of implementation and outcomes of safety management
            system

in early 2015 the faa passed a rule mandating that all us commercial airlines have a safety
management system sms in place by march 2018 jetblue was proud to be the first commercial
carrier accepted into the faas voluntary program for developing the sms plan we began
implementation in 2015 three years ahead of the faa deadline with the launch of our new safety
policy the sms system helps our processes become more predictive and proactive rather than
simply reactive in promoting an environment of tracking and following risks we are

                                                                                                       16

able to better address those concernspreventing safety incidents reacting to safety occurrences
and predicting possible safety issues across the board

safety policy

jetblues safety policy is the foundation of our safety management system the policy promotes
crewmember awareness about jetblues safety objectives as well as methods and organizational
structures that make it possible to achieve the objectives the philosophy that underpins the policy
is one that investigates the causes of mistakes encourages crewmember reporting and identifies
ways to enhance jetblues safety performance

safety structure

we maintain a structure for overseeing and responding to safety measures through our safety
review board and risk working groups the safety review board is comprised of jetblue leaders
responsible for companywide safety decisions including our ceo evps svps and vps of relevant
departments along with advisors the review board oversees six key operational risk working
groups

         flight risk working group
         airport risk working group
         soc risk working group
         tech risk working group
         inflight risk working group
         customer support risk working group

each risk working group meets on a regular basis to 1 review risks as identified and assessed by
safety training and operational programs 2 accept andor require mitigation of risks or escalate
to the srb 3 direct and review the progress of correctivepreventative actions to eliminate
causes or potential causes of identified nonconformances 4 conduct regular reviews of the
outputs of sms and 5 perform regular reviews of the performance and effectiveness of sms and
operational process to identify any needs

safety training

jetblue provides crewmembers and crewleaders with the knowledge and tools to make safety
the number one priority our safety department and jetblue university introduced an injury
prevention training program called safe movement to educate crewmembers on proper lifting
techniques the program contributed to a 5 percent reduction in airport injuries to crewmembers
in 2015




                                                                                                   17

safety management

safety risk management srm is a formal process for systemically identifying risks within the
context of the delivery of jetblues products and services and taking action to reduce those risks
srm includes steps to understand systems and processes identify hazards estimate the
probability of outcomes and make decisions regarding the best allocation of resources jetblues
approach to srm is based on the concept of risk informed decisionmaking
this means that srm processes and tools are intended to inform or support the decision maker in
making decisions involving safety risk there are inherent limitations to risk management
processes and tools and decision makers should be mindful of these limitations risk management
processes and tools do not replace the need for sound human judgment and the exercise of
humility when making decisions about an unknown future jetblue will at all times strive to reduce
risk to as low as reasonably practicable reducing risk to as low as reasonably practical means
that any further risk reduction is either impractical or grossly outweighed by the cost
primary objectives of risk management are to


        determine the appropriate organizational level for risk related decisionmaking
        compare operational risks for best resource allocation
        communicate operational risk within the organization

safety assurance

jetblue has developed and maintains processes and systems to monitor its safety performance
including monitoring of operational processes and the operational environment
the programs outlined below detail the numerous tools made available for crewmembers to be
proactive in determining and mitigating potential safety risks
        flight operational quality assurance foqa  foqa monitors trends and screens for
       significant events possibly requiring further analysis
       safety hotlinesafety response coordinator  the safety department maintains a safety
       hotline staffed by a qualified safety response coordinator src 24 hours a day 7 days a
       week the hotline is available to all jetblue crewmembers to report any
       safetyoperational issues or concerns andor receive assistance from the safety department
       internal audits by operational departments  jetblues safety evaluation and audit program
       seap monitors safety performance including evaluations of the sms and operational
       processes and systems

       investigations  jetblue has developed and maintains processes and systems to monitor its
       safety performance including investigations of incidents and accidents as well as
       investigations of reports regarding potential noncompliance with regulatory standards or
       other safety risk controls

safety promotion

jetblue crewmembers across departments and roles will be required to possess the
competencies and training appropriate with their role in jetblues safety management system
jetblue maintains 5 tiers of training that crewmembers will be assigned to in these
departments
jetblues safety policy is found on our intranet and in every jetblue manual in addition our
safety policy and performance is communicated to crewmembers through
       new hire orientation new jetblue crewmembers receive a presentation from the safety
       department and are briefed on the safety action report  our confidential safety reporting
       system as well as our safety policy
       safety snapshot a periodic report that provides crewmembers with an overview of year to

recommended practices isarps design validation and design demonstration sms safety
assurance system sas related data collection tools dcts and to continuously improve the
performance of jetblues safety management system sms
jetblue does not measure our sms implementation to the icao implementation scale while this
scale was used during the faas sms pilot project we are now working within the faa framework
jetblue is currently in the design validation phase of sms implementation to part 5 with the faa
and will be moving to the design demonstration phase this year we plan to be completed with
faa validation and receive faa approval of our sms by q4 2017 our last operational safety audit
iosa was conducted in feb 2017 a large portion of the preparation was around documenting and
showing implementing of our newly created sms to match the



                                                                                                     19

new iosa requirements around sms we had thirteen findings from the audit and by march 2017
we had already provided the corrective action plan for closing those findings to the audit
organization we expect to be renewed on the iosa registry by the end of may 2017 our next iosa
audit will be scheduled in mid2018

jetblue safety by the numbers in 2016

safety action report  reporting safety hazards risks and concerns is the responsibility of all
crewmembers our safety action report sar is our confidential safety reporting system for all
crewmembers in 2016 613 safety action reports were filed compared to 479 in 2015 indicating
that crewmembers are engaging more in the reporting program which is a key tool in our ability to
proactively address concerns for example a report was received from a crewmember regarding a
technical issue with a320 oxygen mask clips the report was investigated and technical operations
commissioned a fleet campaign to identify and correct oxygen masks on our a320s and a321s

number of safety risks and hazardous situations identified as a result of sms

the goal of the aviation safety action program asap is to enhance aviation safety through the
prevention of accidents and incidents its purpose is to encourage voluntary reporting of safety
issues and events that come to the attention of pilots technical operations staff and dispatchers
