        actuators an operating system sensors and network           and grow and as a contribution to the robot industry of
        communications capability the actuators and operating         the future
        devices which have been miniaturized fit neatly inside
        the robot itself eliminating the need for the big external
        control boxes used to operate conventional robots the
        programs that govern the robots movements are stored
        inside as well enabling the robot to move independently
        from among the comprehensive array of robot systems
        available modules specifically addressing the intended
        uses can be selected and combined this provides a sim
        pler and more efficient way to build the right robot for the
        task at hand

           thk and jaxa

         thk has collaborated with the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa on joint research aimed at developing a
         robotic hand this effort arose out of a proposal thk submitted to jaxas aerospace open laboratory program which
         organizes promising spacerelated projects through collaboration among government academia and private indus
         try jaxa wanted to study the creation of a nimble yet powerful robotic hand for use in outer space as an alternative to
         having crew members perform work outside the spacecraft thk having already developed technology enabling the
         use of robotic hands for disaster relief and remote medical care was confident that it could build on these achieve
         ments and readily accepted the challenge
            through the aerospace open laboratory program a compact highthrust linearmotion actuator was developed to
         enable the fingers of the robotic hand to flex and extend according to jaxas specifications the robotic hand had to
         be no larger than the type of glove worn by astronauts when working outside the spacecraft and had to provide the
         same grip strength by combining the motor with a miniature ball screw thk was able to devise a compact yet suf
         ficiently powerful actuator that met the required conditions then just as the joint research on the actuatorequipped
         robotic hand was beginning to bear fruit thk received a request to build a robotic hand for jaxas rexj project an
         experimental effort to use helper robots for extravehicular activity at kibo the japanese module that forms part of
         the international space station
            the rexj project involved sending a prototype helper robot into space to dock with kibo and experimenting with
         the actual use of the robot to support crew members working in outer space when the robotic hand was built it
         was subjected to heat vibration and vacuum to approximate the conditions in which it would be used and adjust
         ments were made to adapt it to the simulated outer space environment in july 2012 the prototype helper robot was
         launched into space aboard the kotonori 3 unmanned cargo spacecraft all the scheduled experiments were success
         fully carried out over the next seven and a half months concluding in march 2013
            thk is working to further refine the linearmotion actuator technology that
         emerged from its collaboration with jaxa with the aim of contributing to the de
         velopment of robotic hands that perform useful functions in outer space and here
         on earth as well

                                          ing on the design of a robotic glove that would make it possible to operate the robotic
                                          hand in a natural intuitive way when the operator put on the glove and moved his or
                                          her fingers the robotic hand moved its fingers exactly the same way the representa

                                          guy i remember working like crazy so he wouldnt show me up the glove along with
                                          the robotic hand that thk developed is now stored at jaxas laboratory facility its

         seed solutions it requires skills different from those involved in development work there are still a lot of things i dont
         understand and i make a lot of mistakes but i carry on and keep my head down i feel that more and more people
         are pulling for me both within and outside thk and that makes it all worthwhile

  thks seismic isolation technology recommended by all the architects

                                      myotoku had a seismically isolated building constructed at our office complex in
                                      iwate prefecture for three reasons first to provide a temporary place of refuge
                                      for employees in the event of a major earthquake like the great east japan earth
                                      quake second to protect our server computers which are essential for business
                                      continuity third to have a place where we can immediately hold emergency
                                      meetings even after a largescale disaster to ensure that the business keeps
                                      functioning in addition to seismic isolation the building was equipped with solar

                                      and a threeday food supply for the employees should they need to take refuge
                                      in the facility the servers had been housed at our headquarters in tokyo but
earthquakes can strike anywhere in japan we wanted them protected by the most effective means available so we
built the seismically isolated building in iwate and stored them there
   the idea of using thks seismic isolation technology came from the architects who submitted designs for the build
ingall of them recommended using thk of the three architectural firms we dealt with two incorporated thk devic
es into their designs from the outset the third originally favored rubber dampers
made by another company but eventually revised its design and switched to thk
because given the total weight of the building thks system was more suitable
as a manufacturer of vacuum pump systems and related products myotoku was
familiar with an essential component of thk seismic isolation devices the lm
guide which is used in some of our production machinery its easy to see how
the system works and we now feel were prepared for another earthquake                 equipped with seismic isolation solar panels rain

                                         this is the first time weve used seismic isolation devices we have a lot of faith
                                      in thk products though so we had no doubts about the quality the installation
                                      work had to be coordinated with the moving of threedimensional measuring

            the thk sales representatives and technicians we met all conveyed real enthusiasm for their seismic isolation
         products they stayed on site throughout the installation work despite the

         cultural property posed a very difficult dilemma but after much testing and
         a great deal of debate we determined that incorporating seismic isolation
         and damping would not compromise the temples status as a cultural asset

                                      buildings and we use thk products to be able to sell our goods we have to
                                      understand how they work lately weve been involved with a new exhibition
                                      facility housing ceramics and other items of traditional craftwork which are being
                                      preserved as cultural assets weve used thk seismic isolation devices to keep
                                      these valuable works safe from the effects of a major earthquake
                                         there are many different ceramic pieces displayed inside the facility some

president sansei technos co ltd   lightweight and some quite heavy a big tremor wouldnt just knock over light
                                      weight items it would send them flying so ordinary seismic isolation devices
                                      wouldnt suffice i dont think thk had previously made a device designed to
hold a lightweight load like ceramic ware but they persevered through trial and error eventually it became clear that
placing each piece on its own isolation table was the wrong approach they decided to use multiple linked tables
instead and this enabled them to perfect a seismic isolation system providing equal protection to pieces of widely
varying weight
   after the great east japan earthquake in 2011 i was saddened to hear from people who trade in and collect art and
craftwork that a lot of pieces were no longer being displayed having been packed
up in crates out of concern that another major earthquake might occur its a great
pity when works of art and fine craftsmanship created for people to see and en
joy are stowed away out of sight for protection our exhibition facility offers proof
of the effectiveness of seismic isolation devices i hope people will come and see
how well they work so more people will understand that with these devices its
safe to put these beautiful pieces on display again                                    exhibition facility equipped with seismic isolation

                                   affected i realized a lot more volunteers were needed so in june 2012 i took volunteer leave
                                   for five days and joined a oneweek project devoted to clearing vegetation and transporting
                                   supplies in the tona area of the city we cleared weeds along the japan railways senseki

     i didnt think theyd still need volunteer assistance two and a

     help out with the activities going on around them and realize
