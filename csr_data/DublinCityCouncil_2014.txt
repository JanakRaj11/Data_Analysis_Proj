sustainability report 2013  towards a sustainable city region

report approach
dublin city council acknowledges that sustainability challenges and opportunities are often complex and overlapping they cannot
be addressed in isolation and instead require a comprehensive systemsbased approach as such our sustainability efforts must
address integrated social economic and environmental objectives to coordinate this diversity of effort and the complexity of
the subject matter we have relied on several internationally recognized tools and methodologies and have employed standard
reporting structures across eight sustainability themes

standard for sustainability reporting

the global reporting initiative gri an international standard for sustainability reporting
has influenced the contents of this report over 4000 organisations from 60 countries are
now using the gri framework for creating balanced accurate clear and reliable reports the
index found at the end of this report directs readers to where gri standard disclosures are
referenced as our sustainability planning evolves we will endeavour to include an increasing
number of these disclosures

to integrate sustainable practices into dublin city councils work the internationally
recognized framework has been developed over 25 years and places an emphasis on impact

the value of data

the sustainability indicators offer an empirical window into the current state of the regions sustainability efforts and a measurable
means to track future progress and success the diverse environmental economic and social indicators presented in this report
bring together data drawn from a host of international national regional and local sources the sustainability indicators are
designed to

        1 baseline the current position of the dublin region

        2 benchmark against international best practices and set performance targets and

        3 communicate performance to policymakers and citizens in an open and transparent manner



the collection analysis and dissemination of these indicators run parallel to dublin city councils mission to enable transparency
and datadriven innovation across the region by linking data and metrics with planning and actions we hope to demonstrate the
value of opendata and its practical applications this year the sustainability indicators have for the first time been incorporated

having established a broad vision of the future the first step towards reaching this vision is to develop a clear picture of dublins
sustainability positionits baseline the sustainability report relies on a number of sources for baseline and benchmarking data
three of these sources are outlined below

dublin city sustainable energy action plan

                                              in 2005 dublins energy agency codema on behalf of dublin city council began
                                              developing the dublin city sustainable energy action plan seap the most recent
                                              version was published in 2010 and is currently being updated the plan contains a
                                              vision of dublin becoming an energysmart and efficient city and evaluates how to
                                              reduce energy consumption in areas such as planning transport residential and
                                              commercial buildings while incorporating the use of renewable energy as a signatory
                                              to the covenant of mayors dublin city has joined over 2000 cities and towns in a
                                              commitment to the principles of best practice in energy policy while going beyond
                                              the eu targets of a 20 reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 in the specific case

                                              embodiment of good practice and has set a more ambitious target of 33 reduction
                                              over the timescale of the action plan the results of the updated report will provide
                                              an update on the baseline from which we can measure progress and ensure that our

infrastructure  land use indicators
policies and actions within land use and spatial planning are key to the sustainable development of the dublin region and central
to creating a high quality public domain while important to measure there are only a few recognised indicators that effectively
capture this theme this is an area that requires further development

vacancy rates this indicator examines the number of vacant houses flats and holiday homes as a percentage of the total
housing stock in dublin in total the vacancy rate in the dublin region has reduced from 97 to 83 over a 5 year period 2006
2011 the vacancy rate in dublin is significantly lower than the state figure which stood at 145 in 2011 south dublin has the
lowest levels of vacancy at 54 compared to 102 in dublin city nationally the highest levels of vacancy were recorded in
leitrim at 305

percentage of inhabitants within 300 metres of basic services this indicator was not developed further as the
required data on proximity to local services in terms of distance is not readily available for the dublin region currently maps
published by the allisland research observatory provide the best resource on accessibility the accessibility mapping facility
enables users to view estimated travel times by car to education facilities airports and railway stations healthcare services
emergency services and large grocery outlets the comprehensive dataset behind this mapping tool was not available to the
research team at the time of publication of this report

tidy town awards in the past halfcentury hundreds of towns and villages throughout ireland have participated in the
national tidytowns competition originally launched by bord fáilte as an initiative to encourage the fledgling tourism industry
the competition quickly became a rallying cause for communities throughout the country determined to maintain and improve
their local environment while there is useful data available from the tidy town awards it proved challenging to summarise in a
consistent manner the feasibility of this indictor will be further investigated see the tidy towns 2013 report for more information

in the interests of both farming and biodiversity the legislation regarding the removal of hedgerows is currently under review
hedges in place since or before 2009 have protection by being deemed landscape features for the purposes of good agricultural
and environment condition required for farm payments under the single farm payment scheme agrienvironment schemes
generally require protection and maintenance of hedgerows in the past 2 years there has been considerable removal of scrub due
to land eligibility rules in the single farm payment scheme according to the national forestry inventory hedgerows and scrub
comprise 39 and 13 of the total land area respectively actions for biodiversity 2011  2016 irelands national biodiversity

2004 and 2011 including reports guidelines and spatial biodiversity mapping to characterise the green infrastructure associated
with the designated strategic greenway network sgn in dublin city further analysis is required to measure the loss and gain of
hedgerows across the dublin region
