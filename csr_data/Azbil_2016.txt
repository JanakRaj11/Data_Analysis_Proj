     unique products and solutions that meet the needs of the times

       microflow meters
       over the years the azbil group has created numerous innovative sensors using microelectromechanical
       systems mems technology and products fitted with mems have become indispensable in a variety
       of industrial fields we have recently devised a unique sensor structure based on the application of
       thermal measurement technology and are currently working on commercializing it in a new type of
       flowmeter capable of highprecision measurement of microflows of liquid which have been difficult
       to measure until now we hope to be able to use this flowmeter in applications for the semiconduc
       tor electrical and electronic markets among others
       very small flows of 100 mlminute or less

       we have already put in place research and development frame             ness and collaborative innovation
     works in japan the us and europe that enable us to work closely          as far as the reorganization of our domestic production system is
     with customers to propose solutions so we will now move on                concerned we will consolidate our shonan and isehara factories in

     research base in japan more specifically we will consolidate the         addedvalue products worldwide in conjunction with our factories
     azbil groups research and development resources at the fujisawa           in china and thailand we will also rearrange our domestic and
     technology center fujisawa city kanagawa prefecture and put             overseas production lines into the optimal configuration
     in place advanced development and testing environments thereby              the total investment associated with consolidation of our

     environment that will prevail after the tokyo 2020 olympics and            also begun to launch new products developed with a view to their
     paralympics take place it is clear that building our revenue base in      deployment in global markets such as ba systems for overseas
     overseas marketswhich still offer plenty of regional and qualita         markets
     tive scope for business expansionwill be the engine of growth               thus we are seeing some progress in upgrading our physical
     for the azbil group going forward                                         resources so the next key area of focus will be enhancing our in
       in terms of regional expansion we have already established              tangible resources specifically we will need to develop personnel
     overseas subsidiaries everywhere from china and other parts of             capable of increasing points of contact with local customers and
     asia north america and europe to the middle east and latin               secure staff with the talent to manage our overseas subsidiaries
     america actively developing sales and service bases there with           accordingly we are devoting considerable effort to developing

approach to csr
the azbil group has a broad perspective on the responsibilities that a                                    csr initiatives
company should fulfill toward stakeholders and society accordingly
we take a twofold approach across the entire group                                                                                            basic csr
   firstly there is what we call basic csr which involves fulfilling                                                fulfilling our fundamental obligations to society

the azbil groups fundamental obligations as a member of society                                            creating an environment conducive to compliance
this includes ensuring thorough compliance to laws and regulations                                              for more detailed information see compliance on page 50

   the azbil group believes that there are no shortcuts to win                                              the groups own environmental initiatives
ning the trust of society so we aim to engage in fair and honest                                                for more detailed information seeenvironmental initiativeson pages 6063

management combined with efforts to further strengthen our                                                  business management that values people
corporate governance                                                                                             f or more detailed information see responsibility to employees and
                                                                                                                   partners on pages 6667

15 derivatives
the azbil group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with trade receivables and payables denomi
nated in foreign currencies the azbil group also enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage its interest rate exposures on certain liabilities
  it is the azbil groups policy to use derivatives only for the purpose of reducing market risks associated with assets and liabilities not to hold or issue
derivatives for speculative or trading purposes
  since all of the azbil groups foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts are related to qualified hedges of underlying business
exposures market gain or loss risk in the derivative instruments is effectively offset by opposite movements in the value of the hedged assets or liabilities
  because the counterparties to these derivatives are limited to major international financial institutions the azbil group does not anticipate any losses
arising from credit risk
  derivative transactions entered into by the azbil group have been made in accordance with internal policies which regulate the authorization and
credit limit amounts
