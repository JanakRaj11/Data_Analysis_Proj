risks are interest rate risk and ccr credit risk to manage these financial risks veikkaus has a risk management
policy in place approved by the board of directors exchange rate risk and liquidity risk are not significant due to
the nature of veikkaus operations

interest rate risk

credit risk
in its investing activities veikkaus complies with the guidelines approved by the board of directors according to
these guidelines investments are made by securing the capital without exchange rate risks and for a maximum of
five years investment in shares is not permitted under the investment principles

credit risk

16 liabilities from employee benefits
pension liabilities
the defined benefit pension schemes include additional pensions that enable some of veikkaus employees to
retire at an earlier age without losing part of their pension certain pension schemes were granted to employees
who joined veikkaus before 1985 and somewhat different schemes to employees who joined before 1994the
commitment given to the insured is recorded under liabilities in the balance sheet while the insurance companys
proportion of this commitment is presented under assets pensions and paidup policies are pension index
adjusted the costs incurred are borne entirely by veikkaus because the insurance company has estimated its
compensation at zero in the insurance arrangement the assets are calculated using the same discount rate as the
liabilities consequently any change in the discount rate will not result in material risk similarly an increase in life
expectancy will not result in any material risk because the insurance company bears the majority of the impact of
increase life expectancy meanwhile veikkaus is fully liable for the increase in pensions for example an increase of
05 in the pension index would raise the liability by 67 while a decrease of 05 would lower the liability by
60
