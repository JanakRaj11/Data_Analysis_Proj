creating value with outwardlooking
attitudes and responsible growth
2011 was a year full of challenges both for the global and the greek economy innovation outwardlooking
attitudes and investments are key to the countrys development and the motor oil group is fully
aligned with these elements both in business philosophy and in practice

our principles and the respect for our country and our people are nonnegotiable we care for our
people invest for health and safety and continuously improve our environmental performance we
contribute to the society in a sustainable and consistent manner and help our fellowcitizens lead a
better life

in this difficult economic climate motor oil has proved its great strength by setting new alltime fuel
sales and production records 2011 was a year of maturing of the investments and acquisitions made in the
previous years it was the first year we saw a fullyears yield coming from the new crude distillation unit
in the area of investments as well as from shells activities in greece in the area of acquisitions despite
the pressure in the fuels market our increase of domestic market share through the retail networks of
coral and avin oil is indicative of our successful strategy

we have put special emphasis on our employees training while at the same time we constantly provide
a modern business environment thus responding to various technological and labor challenges moreover
we have further enhanced health and safety through targeted investments continuous training programs
and by adopting good practices among others overall we have invested 158 million euros in projects and
programs relating to workplace safety

we have adopted new techniques and completed investments aiming at markedly reducing our
environmental footprint motor oil has developed an integrated environmental management system
which aims at the companys constant improvement in terms of energy efficiency and emission control
and as a result at the reduction of its environmental and energyrelated footprint

we have invested in social responsibility projects by financially supporting cultural organizations and
unions sports events social care bodies educational organizations as well as the work of municipalities in
the vicinity of the refinery

the sustainability report 2011 you are holding in your hands is the tenth consecutive edition and is
indicative of motor oil groups firm commitment to implement best practices based on the principles
of the corporate social responsibility and corporate governance as well as the principles of sustainable
development motor oil group practices responsible entrepreneurship aiming at the constant support
of our overall contribution to society at large

this year is also of a special symbolic value to the group as it has been 40 years since motor oil
begun its operations during all these years we have shown business consistency based on the vision
and the strategy we designed with pride and optimism for the future we will vigorously continue with
investments and with social contribution projects ensuring a sustainable growth and development for the
benefit our all our stakeholders

                                                                              motor oil group management

an important tool in this endeavour is the measurement regular evaluation of results and the systematic assessment
of the environmental impacts at all stages of the production process this assessment is based on a set of criteria
including legislative requirements and stakeholder views which lead to the classification of impacts according to their
significance and their characterisation as significant or nonsignificant this classification procedure is also carried out
whenever there are any changes to the refinerys configuration reevaluating the classification and characterisation of
the impacts



this procedure for classifying the environmental impacts           criteria for evaluation of

desalination units the desalination facilities have been supplemented by the addition of two units of the reverse
osmosis technology which is the optimum desalination technique both in terms of economic efficiency and
environmental impact as a result of which the refinerys requirements are fully covered and the need to import fresh
