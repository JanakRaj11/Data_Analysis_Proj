                                            that would enable the gas supply to be restarted remotely this
                                            system went into operation in july 2014 marking a major step
                                            forward in the provision of a safe reliable supply of gas which
                                            is a vital part of our daily lives

                                            and automation for many years brewing fine sake requires
                                            meticulous management based on local knowhow including
                                            knowledge of how to respond to changes in the weather and
                                            basic ingredients this means that there are times when the
                                            brewers cannot leave the brewery spending sleepless nights
                                            there watching over the koji mold that enables the sake to
                                            ferment at other times it becomes impossible to access the
                                            brewery because of the heavy snow that falls in the region
                                            accordingly we put together a remote monitoring mechanism
                                            based around azbils harmonized automation system creating
                                            a system that allows the sake brewers to continue monitoring
                                            and controlling the brewery when they are away from it

the economy has received a boost from abenomics and the announcement that
tokyo will host the olympic and paralympic games please tell us how this has
affected the business and what steps you are taking in response
in response to this demand we are strengthening the job fulfillment system in our ba business so that we can steadily
build up a track record that will become the cornerstone of our life cycle business development based on azbils integrated
framework

by redevelopment centered in the tokyo metropolitan area
and the development of facilities and infrastructure toward
the tokyo 2020 olympic and paralympic games as one
might expect this demand includes the new buildings

existing buildings not to mention demand for advanced
energyefficient systems we believe that the need for safe
comfortable and energyefficient solutions will grow at
competition venues and surrounding commercial and ac
commodation facilities

technology research and product development




      azbil advances its business development by strengthening
      the planning and development of products and services in business
      sectors with growth potential
      we plan and develop technologies and products in five strategic technology areas that will play a key role in
      shaping the future of humancentered automation and also strengthen our rd system and product
      development capabilities around the world to increase product appeal and provide a solid foundation for
      business development



      research and development policy
      with the aim of providing our customers with swift access to nextgeneration products developed on the basis of our phi
      losophy of humancentered automation we have adopted an effective and efficient system of closer coordination between
      our marketing and rd departments we are focusing on five strategic technology areas that we believe will enable us to
      offer wideranging value in the medium and long term we are also enhancing our product development in three business
      sectors with good growth potential for further global expansion of our operations we have established overseas bases for
      development and our three main bases in japan the united states and europe are developing technology and products
      jointly with global partners in which we have an investment stake in addition we are working on the overseas deployment
      of production technology already established at our domestic plants as well as increased compliance with international
      standards
        for details on our three main rd bases see the diagram on the bottom of page 40


        five strategic technology areas

      taking into account the medium to longterm needs of our customers and of society as well as technological trends we
      have identified the following five strategic technology areas for focused technology research and product development
      applying our philosophy of humancentered automation to create value through products that deliver safety and peace of
      mind quality productivity and comfort and conservation of the environment and of energy

         azbils business results have grown thanks to efforts by
         the management to put in place an environment in which
         they can fully exercise their abilities appointing talented
         directors and auditors from both within azbil corporation
         and outside it and engaging in lively and constructive
         discussion in good faith at meetings of the board of
         directors i have a high opinion of the governance frame
         work that has been established in this way and believe
         that it compares favorably with the governance systems
         of other leading companies both in japan and overseas
            as described in the mediumterm plan the domestic
         market is maturing accordingly in order for the azbil
         group to achieve sustainable growth and improve cor
         porate value going forward it is necessary to steadily tap
         into overseas demand particularly in emerging econo
         mies which although entailing some risk are expected
         to see substantial growth also to ensure that members
                                                                                           katsuhiko tanabe
         of the management team can continue to exercise their

         abilities in the same way there is undoubtedly a greater
         need than ever to enhance its aggressive governance
         framework which is predicated on healthy risktaking i
         am certain that its corporate culture will enable it to suc
         cessfully address these kinds of challenges

      15 derivatives
      the azbil group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with trade receivables and payables
      denominated in foreign currencies the azbil group also enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage its interest rate exposures on certain
      liabilities
         it is the azbil groups policy to use derivatives only for the purpose of reducing market risks associated with assets and liabilities not to hold or
      issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes




82   azbil report 2015

  since all of the azbil groups foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts are related to qualified hedges of underlying
business exposures market gain or loss risk in the derivative instruments is effectively offset by opposite movements in the value of the hedged
assets or liabilities
  because the counterparties to these derivatives are limited to major international financial institutions the azbil group does not anticipate any
losses arising from credit risk
  derivative transactions entered into by the azbil group have been made in accordance with internal policies which regulate the authorization
and credit limit amounts
