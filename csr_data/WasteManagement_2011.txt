   have been through some tough economic times over the past               continue to convert trucks to these clean fuels each year in a
   couple years in 2010 recycling markets bounced back and the          joint venture with linde north america we have built the
   amount of recyclables we managed increased with 10 million             worlds largest plant to convert landfill gas to ultralowcarbon
   tons of materials currently recycled we are now more than              lng the greenhouse gas emissions associated with this fuel
   halfway to our goal of managing more than 20 million tons each          are 20 to 25 percent lower than those of diesel and particulate

we measured our footprint for the first time in 2009 and reported

waste management facilities these facilities will create clean
biogas and nutrientrich compost through anaerobic digestion          nonferrous metals
ie biogas to power we also entered into a joint development
agreement with genomatica to create proprietary specially
designed organisms and manufacturing processes to create
highvalue chemical products from waste

i am proud of the men and women of waste management
who have taken our sustainability goals to heart and i have no
doubt that we will achieve them by 2020 to the benefit of our
communities our governments our customers our employees

     2009 is the base year for waste managements carbon footprint so data from previous years are not available changes to the footprint will be reported in our next sustainability report
      please see our 2010 report for the complete footprint and data notes

      note that this number includes only energy sold not generated and used to power the facility itself
   we are not presuming to characterize how emerging regulatory programs will allocate credit for these avoided emissions so we do not claim these greenhouse gas reduction benefits as our own
4 

   nor attempt to deduct these reductions from our carbon footprint also note that the national recycling coalition model on which our resource savings are calculated was updated in march 2009
   and is employed in this 2011 sustainability report update
