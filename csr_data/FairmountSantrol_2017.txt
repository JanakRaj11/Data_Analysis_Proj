feedback from our board of directors family members customers suppliers partners investors community members and
regulators we gain insights which enable us to make strategic decisions based on what matters most

in 2014 we conducted a robust materiality assessment to identify our most relevant environmental social and economic impacts
risks and opportunities across our value chain we worked with stakeholders to understand their perspective incorporating their
input with our knowledge of global and industry trends to prioritize our sd topics the results of this work serve as a roadmap for
our sustainable development initiatives ensuring we are investing our resources where we can have the most positive impact each
year the sd advisory committee and the board of directors challenge our sd teams to reach higher setting sd goals that stretch us
to new accomplishments we plan to refresh our materiality assessment every three years as priorities for our business our markets

strengths and discuss design and deploy our vision for the future these ai summits powerfully accelerate our organizational

supervisors attend annual safety training sessions and receive oneonone training to incorporate safety measures into their
facilities in addition at each facility our regional safety coordinators provide support for our health and safety initiatives production
facilities hold monthly training sessions to address core safety requirements outlined in the annual health and safety agenda

we also require all family members who spend time in the ﬁeld to complete annual safety refresher training including our ofﬁce
staff our safety team customizes safety modules to each location ensuring the information provided is engaging and applicable to
further reinforce the importance of safety we begin all meetings regardless of their nature with a safety message for example
each meeting of our board of directors senior executive management team ﬁnance hr sd and production employees begins
with a safety message to remind all family members of the value and importance of safety




to further encourage the adoption of our safety training material into practice we administer a proactive incentive system that
rewards our family members for their individual facility and companywide safe work practices when our teams meet safety
targets we pay bonuses to continue encouraging family members to demonstrate safe work behaviors and to reinforce that safety
is our number one priority




according to the national safety council most injuries occur outside of working hours our bringing safety home program
encourages family members to keep their homes safe and positively inﬂuence family and friends by sharing simple reminders about
safety for daily living as part of this program family members receive a quarterly safety magazine and have access to personal
protective equipment for children smoke detectors and ﬁrst aid training sessions for their families additionally we publish a family
health and safety calendar that promotes safe practices at home such as the use of ﬁre extinguishers and safe practices during
outdoor activities such as swimming or gardening

occupational risks this includes sitespeciﬁc training for all visitors to fmsa sites and additional education for contractors working

as fairmount santrol strengthens our foundation for future growth we hold ourselves accountable for staying true to the highest
ethical standards we made several enhancements in 2016 to our corporate compliance program for example we reﬁned our
corporate authorization policy included in our governance standards the policy establishes the appropriate internal control
procedures and acceptable best practices for obtaining review and approval of transactions agreements and commitments that
bind the company and decisions that expose the company to risk the primary objectives of this policy are to provide the
appropriate level of responsibility and accountability and establish review levels and dollar amounts that make sense given the
companys current organizational structure and business processes

we also developed and launched an ethics and compliance communications campaign with the support of our board of directors
and executive management team this initiative aligns with industry best practices for corporate ethics and compliance programs
the campaign includes twominute ethical moment videos with key ethicsrelated messages for example think before you click
ponder your posts avoiding conﬂicts of interest conﬁdential information loose lips and speak up raising concerns at work

in 2017 we will continue to drive awareness by integrating ethics and compliance messaging into meeting agendas and additional
educational opportunities for family members without email access

our dedication to safety extends to all who create handle distribute and use our products we take steps to ensure our family
members are safe and healthy in the workplace our customers know how to responsibly handle and use our products and our
product formulations are safe




fairmount santrol is vigilant in protecting our family members from potential crystalline silica dust exposure our silicosis
prevention and occupational health programs include the following practices that keep our team safe

  we continually look for ways to minimize potential respirable silica dust across our products lifecycle

  we provide training to every family member who may be exposed to respirable silica dust

  we monitor sites to ensure use of personal protective equipment and safe product handling practices

  our facilities utilize stateoftheart technology and engineering methods to manage the potential for respirable silica dust
  exposure

  we periodically test 100 percent of family members who could be exposed to silica dust


due to these efforts the average potential exposure to respirable crystalline silica dust for our family members is below the
threshold deemed protective by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh




fairmount santrol requires all new employees to complete a screening process to establish a baseline for respirable silica dust
exposure every two years we evaluate the wellbeing of 100 percent of family members who could be exposed to silica dust with
health testing pulmonary evaluations and xrays to gather data we ask a representative sample of workers to wear sampling
systems that collect respirable dusts these illustrate what the individual could be breathing

while regulation only requires a sample from one percent of our population we submit samples from 10 percent we publish test
results through the national industrial sand association nisa and have had no reported cases of silicosis for more than 20 years
furthermore we work to raise the industrys health and safety standards through our leadership position with nisa




our customers share our high standards for safety to ensure compliance with the occupational safety and mine safety health
administrations osha and msha we continually update and provide safety data sheets sdss for all of our products we also
work with an external consultant to review and strengthen the information we provide these sds sheets help our customers
develop safety guidelines and proper handling procedures

we train our sales and marketing teams on the latest safety information which they share with our customers as needed further we
make safetyrelated resources about our products available to the public we regularly seek feedback and respond to customer

inquiries to ensure the health and wellbeing of their workforces




we are dedicated to formulating solutions that enable safer product handling and use we craft products that follow epa msha
and osha regulations and take pride in being compliant with iso 9001 14001 and 18001

our research and development rd department completes a due diligence process and impact assessment before we use any
chemical in our products or processes product managers work closely with our safety and rd teams to develop safety data
sheets sdss for handling usage and disposal from there we route all product information through our environmental
production quality and sales teams as needed to provide responses for all customer inquiries

fairmount santrols commitment to product health and safety also strengthens relationships with customers by exceeding or
meeting their needs both our proppant solutions and industrial and recreational ir customers rely on us to develop
environmentally preferable chemistries and products to improve industry performance while the proprietary nature of our products
prevents us from fully disclosing our product formulations we work closely with customers to educate them about our products and
their safe use

fairmount santrol goes beyond compliance for practices that impact our family members and stakeholders safety staying true to
this commitment in 2016 we set an ambitious goal to achieve levels of less than 50 percent of the occupational health and safety
administrations ohsa new limits for potential silica dust exposure




ohsa regulates permissible levels of respirable silica dust exposure in workplaces these rules apply to all stakeholders across our
value chain and vary by industry beginning in 2018 osha will reduce the silica dust exposure limit by 50 percent for sand used in
foundry applications in june 2021 a 50 percent reduction will also apply to respirable silica pel for all our proppant products
fairmount santrol has developed a new silica dust suppressant product currently a developmental proppant that during its ﬁrst oil
ﬁeld trial passed the new osha regulations we have planned additional ﬁeld trials at various oil basins in 2017

due to the safety focus of our family members and customers fairmount santrol is proud to have met these compliance standards
ahead of the deadline weve also gone furtherby aiming to maintain facility exposure levels below 50 percent of the new limits
our safety department and best practices sd team developed a comprehensive strategy in 2016 that includes conducting
benchmarks and incorporating best practices across facilities they will continue implementing the plan in 2017

once again fairmount santrol reported zero cases of silicosis in 2016 a goal we have upheld for more than 20 years




fairmount santrol works to continually improve product safety while remaining costcompetitive we made progress in 2016 to
improve the dust mitigation performance of our products our ongoing goal is to actively identify partners that can help generate
dust mitigation solutions for both our raw and resincoated sand

this year we also completed a comprehensive study verifying there are no leachable chemical components leachates of concern in
our phenolic novolac resincoated products we plan to publish a white paper in 2017 to educate customers and other stakeholders
about our product safety performance

our aim is to maintain an open line of communication with our communities we customize our management approach to ﬁt each
communitys unique needs our plant managers have responsibility for community engagement responding to inquiries
opportunities and concerns and determining solutions communication occurs via open houses public meetings community
reports and newsletters telephone calls local media and community events for instance when townships or clubs host monthly
meetings we periodically send a representative to serve as a source of information about our values standards and practices we
proudly welcome community members to open houses and site tours where we share our story and allow others to see how we
operate

fairmount santrol does not operate in areas of indigenous peoplesgroups protected by national or international legislation as
having a set of speciﬁc rights based on their historical ties to an area additionally our sustainable supplier code of conduct
encourages our suppliers to share our commitment to protecting human rights




fairmount santrol monitors and addresses all federal state and local regulations that apply to our operations we distinguish
ourselves as a responsible operator by going beyond compliance for many regulations especially those regarding environmental
management and the health and safety of our communities

we uphold required standards for groundwater and air quality monitoring and control at all of our facilities during blasting our
family members and contractors use seismographs to collect data on air and ground vibrations they produce blast reports which
show we are consistently below state and local regulation standards

in addition we manage noise within our operations and respond to public concerns through modiﬁcations that eliminate reduce or
refocus noise at many of our facilities we select equipment with a lower noise rating we also install noise barriers to limit how far
noise can travel beyond our property boundaries

fairmount santrol has been recognized for successfully managing impacts and going beyond compliance for example the
wisconsin department of natural resources has designated our wisconsin mining sites as green tier certiﬁed green tier is a
program which recognizes companies that voluntarily exceed legal requirements related to health safety and the environment
resulting in continuous improvement in the states environment economy and quality of life fairmount santrol is the ﬁrst mining
company to receive green tier status




we seek contractors that value sustainable development and work with them to mitigate community impacts contractors must sign
an agreement that requires safety environmental and community practices both on and off fairmount santrol property if
contractors return for more than a year they must resign the agreement we also expect all onsite contractors to comply with our
zero waste initiatives by recycling composting and using wastetoenergy receptacles

in addition we require all contracted truck drivers to sign a code of conduct which our dispatch company reviews annually the
code states that drivers must have personal protective gear use fall protection obey speed limits and avoid the use of engine
brakes among other practices we evaluate local trafﬁc patterns and aim to reduce trafﬁc associated with our operations during
peak hours such as school or work rush hours to lessen this impact in some communities we have built additional turning lanes in
and out of facilities to enable safer merging

fairmount santrol understands that healthy communities need clean air to thrive we protect air quality by establishing control
mechanisms in our operations and reducing and offsetting our greenhouse gas emissions




fairmount santrol manages potential fugitive silica sand dust emissions through several control mechanisms some facilities with
exterior sand stockpiles use water or special agents to address fugitive emissions we use an automated technology at our
menomonie wisconsin facility that monitors wind speed and activates sprinklers when needed additionally a few of our locations
use ﬁlter belts to eliminate the need for stock piles transporting sand directly to our dryers

further water scrubbers and dust collectors reduce point source particulate emissions water trucks water sprays and vacuum
sweepers manage any potential fugitive particulate emissions following our engineering standards we periodically empty the dust
collectors into our plant return water this enables us to pump the particles directly to our waste disposal location for processing
reducing the risk of fugitive emissions during transport

our engineering and operations departments collaborate to evaluate control technologies for regulated air pollutants for example
some of our sand coating operations generate volatile organic compounds vocs and we use high temperature oxidation to
address nearly all of our voc emissions

during the permitting process for new plants or expansion of existing facilities we assess our potential to emit regulated air
pollutants we design and implement the best equipment for emissions control once in operation we monitor equipment and
submit data for permit compliance and applicable regulations




fairmount santrol is committed to protecting climate health by monitoring and managing our greenhouse gas emissions our
facility managers and engineering department collect sitespeciﬁc scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions data along with our quest
for ecoefﬁciency sd team they identify and implement energy efﬁciency projects that reduce our ghg emissions additionally
each year we plant enough trees to offset our scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions from the previous year we assume an 80
percent survivability rate across 50 years and plant more trees than required to ensure full sequestration of our emissions our family
members plant approximately 10 percent of the trees through our volunteer events while fairmount santrol ﬁnances the planting of
the remaining trees via third parties

staying true to our commitment to protect air quality fairmount santrol implemented several technology upgrades across our
facilities in 2016 to reduce emissions and manage air quality when we purchased our voca texas facility we saw opportunities to
improve dust control mechanisms we continued to make these improvements in 2016 for example we added an actuator system
for our loadout dust controls which conserves energy by turning dust controls on only during loadout which is approximately 10
percent of the day we also made upgrades to our dust collectors and ducting system

at both our voca texas and wedron illinois facilities we installed dust collector valves that enable direct disposal of particles to
designated waste locations this eliminates the potential health risks posed by worker transport of dust our best practice sd team
also implemented a weekly inspection process to assess operating equipment control booths for dust contamination

fairmount santrol continually evaluates opportunities to improve air quality in 2016 we assessed dust control technologies at our
black lab location in serena illinois our family members implemented several lowcost improvements such as installing dust
shrouds and switching to a waterbased ﬂoor sweeping compound they also identiﬁed additional design improvements that we
plan to implement in the future




to sequester 100 percent of our q4 2014q3 2015 scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions fairmount santrol funded the planting of 102145
trees each year we plant enough trees to account for survivability rates our family members planted more than 10000 trees in

loads as resourcefully as possible to terminals near our customers by managing and improving our logistics efﬁciency we minimize
our costs and climate impacts from fuel consumption and emissions




we have the industrys most fully integrated logistics network our 41 active proppant distribution terminals enable us to directly
deliver sand to all north american major oil and gas producing basins threequarters of these terminals are exclusive to fairmount
santrol this competitive position improves our efﬁciency and ability to meet customer demands




year over year we expand our unit train capabilities unit trains ship nonstop from origin to destination bypassing railroad switch
yards and gaining priority on the rails they save fuel time and cost of delivering product to our customers whenever possible
fairmount santrol prioritizes this transportation method over single railcar and truck shipments we maximize the use of unit trains
better than anyone else in our industry with more than 70 percent of our shipments via unit trains




railcars have a weight limit when we load railcars to the maximum possible capacity we reduce the number of railcars and
shipments needed to transport our product this reduces both transportation costs and carbon emissions our sustainable mobility
sd team identiﬁes methods to load railcars to maximum capacity improving year over year




our thirdgeneration optimization model simulates planning scenarios and provides a comparison analysis of supply plans this tool
aids in both shortterm tactical planning and longterm strategic planning allowing us to build a transportation vision over the next
ﬁve years




on a weekly basis we monitor our logistics performance using key performance indicators kpis these allow us to make targeted
adjustments to delivery plans and available reserves across our operations additionally we actively manage our transportation
logistics in the following ways

  build strong relationships and communication with all of our transportation partners

  have fulltime expeditors available 24 hours seven days a week

  hold daily conference calls with logistics partners

  use efﬁcient transportation of materials via conveyors between facilities when applicable

  use optimization software to manage daily shipments




in addition to managing our own emissions fairmount santrol supports our suppliers in mitigating impacts from product
transportation several of our primary transportation suppliers participate in the us environmental protection agency smartway
program smartway is a publicprivate initiative to help companies in the freight transportation sector to monitor and reduce
emissions and environmental risks selecting these transportation partners naturally aligns with our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas

fairmount santrol understands the importance of conserving clean water today and into the future we are committed to
transparency and open dialogue with community members to alleviate waterrelated concerns managing our water use and
discharge enables us to reduce expenses while protecting our communities and building positive stakeholder relationships




we are dedicated to meeting water standards established by state and local regulatory agencies these include regular water
testing and results reporting storm water pollution prevention plans and compliance with permit requirements we align our water
management plans with the goals outlined in our environmental policy for reducing the use of natural resources our clean water
sd team leads this effort by supporting most of our facilities with the creation and execution of their water management plans




fairmount santrol uses water in our operations for extracting washing processing and cooling we track daily well use at each
facility with a continued goal to decrease consumption and increase the use of recycled water through wastewater treatment in
fact we estimate that we recycle more than 90 percent of the water used in our operations

for example we developed onsite basins and pumping systems that allow us to reuse sand processing water at several sites the
basins also capture precipitation that we incorporate back into water recycling efforts we supplement any recycled water lost
during operations with natural surface and groundwater resources

all the deposits that fairmount santrol mines contain natural silts and clays which we wash from our sand to make pure ﬁnished
products the resulting water can be cloudymeasured in turbidity we clarify this water for reuse through a settling process that
separates out the solids and decreases its level of turbidity

furthermore we can use the remaining silts and clays for mine reclamation purposes




fairmount santrol retains water on our properties for recycling needs at times we must discharge this water into local surface and
groundwater resources when doing so we conduct internal and thirdparty testing to ensure our practices comply with regulatory
limits we also obtain all appropriate permits for water discharge that maintains ecosystem health




              
we use curlex blocks at our largest production facility as a best practice for the management of storm water runoff the blocks

fairmount santrol is staying true to our responsibility to continually monitor our water consumption and impacts on local water
quality this year we realized the beneﬁts of a new water clariﬁcation tank at our wedron south facility our illinois minnesota
missouri texas and wisconsin mines now have water clarifying tanks improving the speed of water recycling and reuse

our clean water team reviewed the water management plans at 22 facilities in 2016 they made improvements to our strategies
and identiﬁed best practices to share across our locations for example we installed a variable speed drive on the water pump at
our chardon ohio location leading to both water reduction and energy cost savings

fairmount santrol also encourages our family members to be conscious of water consumption habits in 2016 the clean water sd
team facilitated or sponsored 33 presentations at our sites on water conservation practices at work and home these sessions
empower family members to make daily contributions to our water goals



  water efﬁciency improvements in texas

  our voca texas facility implemented several water improvement projects in 2016
  replacing the packing on a pump reduced water loss signiﬁcantly approximately 50
  to 100 gallons per minute following the best practices of other facilities our voca
  family members evaluated evaporation rates for tracking purposes and
  implemented improved processes




in 2017 the clean water sd team plans to evaluate fresh water access at all fairmount santrol facilities and install technologies that
help reduce bottled water use

fairmount santrol set a bold goal to inspire and enable all facilities to reach zero waste to landﬁll a growing number of our facilities
have reached that goal made possible through the efforts of our recover recycle reuse 3r sd team facility managers and sd
coordinators




fairmount santrol is committed to decreasing waste throughout our production processes our primary byproduct streams include
offspec sand metal wood cardboard and paper to minimize packaging waste we order bulk supplies and reuse and recycle
packaging materials we send offspec sand from most of our manufacturing plants to either cement production facilities or to
landﬁlls to be used for daily cover

our ﬁrst goal is to reduce recycle compost and reuse our industrial byproducts we equip many of our facilities and ofﬁce spaces
with recycling bins to capture and convert as much waste as possible in addition we partner with wastetoenergy companies to
manage noncompostable and nonrecyclable waste these services convert waste destined for landﬁll into fuel for steam
generated electricity

fairmount santrol ships over 90 percent of our products via trucks trains or barges that require no packaging we transport the
remaining product using bulk packaging which we recycle and reuse and ask our customers to do the same




fairmount santrols commitment to waste reduction extends to our family members and communities we ask all locations to hold
zero waste activities that promote waste reduction recycling and compostingboth in our facilities and local communities our
family members hold webinars engage with our customers and work with local businesses to share best practices for waste
management

responsible resource management is a reinforcement of our do good do well motto it positively affects our bottom line by
reducing landﬁll expensesshowing once again how sustainable development drives business value

staying true to our vision of zero landﬁll waste fairmount santrol set a goal in 2015 to bring 100 percent of our legacy facilities
those active in 2009 when we began tracking wasteto zero waste to landﬁll as of december 2016 27 of our 31 operating facilities
met this target most notably our largest facility in wedron illinois operated with zero waste for all of 2016 this was achieved
through the hard work of our recover recycle reuse 3r sd team sd coordinators and family members




in 2016 fairmount santrol achieved a 996 percent reduction in waste to landﬁll from our 2009 baseline this included the diversion
of more than 4100 tons of off spec sand through arrangements with a company that provides byproducts as inputs for cement
manufacturing



  zero waste to landﬁll in voca texas

  given the rural location of our voca texas facility it does not have the same
  recycling options as our other facilities we were left to transport high volumes of
  waste to disposal locations in 2016 we installed a compactor to compress waste
  into bales we ship these bales in bulk to our wastetoenergy partner in oklahoma
  to generate fuel not only did this enable our facility to become zero waste to
  landﬁll it also reduced truck trafﬁc fuel consumption and our transportation costs

for fairmount santrol and our stakeholders to thrive it is important that we preserve ecosystem health we are committed to
protecting land quality and conducting our mining practices with respect and care for local species




fairmount santrol must obtain permits to operate our mines during the approval process we work with state and local regulatory
agencies to develop land management and reclamation plans these include site maps managing overburden removal and mineral
deposits reclamation procedures onsite audits and ﬁnancial assurance for the completion of site reclamation

fairmount santrol is unique with respect to industrial sand mining and processing companies approximatley 45 percent of the acres
of our mining sites that are active or in development are at facilities that are earmarked for underground mining as opposed to
surface mining underground mining only requires small areas of surface disturbance to install and maintain access points and
ventilation shafts to the mine in fact less than 12 of 1 percent of fairmount santrols underground mines have surface disturbance
associated with our activities furthermore we plan to operate underground at over 75 percent of acreage designated for future
development this preserves wildlife habitat and biodiversity

to protect agricultural and forested land affected by our surface mining operations fairmount santrol develops and implements
reclamation plans we collaborate with stakeholders to restore land wildlife habit and viable pastures at these locations this
includes planting native species and removing invasive ones in some cases we have reclaimed areas previously dominated by row
crops to mixed shrubbery trees and grasslands at other sites we have restored land for agricultural purposes such as row crops
and pastures

some of our reclamation efforts produce graded areas that allow seasonal precipitation to pool supporting plants and wildlife
accustomed to standing water andor wet soil conditions at locations where there is insufﬁcient overburden to backﬁll mined areas
our reclamation plans allow for quarries to partially ﬁll with water which we stock with ﬁsh to support local wildlife




wildlife in our local communities include bats bees birds butterﬂies ﬁsh and native plants fairmount santrol actively works to
protect habitat areas through education partnerships and funding we partner with organizations such as the wildlife habitat
council saving birds thru habitat and the wisconsin bat program to protect species diversity near our facilities through the
wildlife habitat council we educate the community on topics such as the importance of pollinators particularly bees to our
ecosystem our family members work with school groups to plant pollinator gardens and construct bee habitats in the communities
where we operate

our two wisconsin underground mines support the second and third largest populations of hibernating cave bats in wisconsin we
support and work with researchers from the united states fish and wildlife service and the wisconsin department of natural
resources dnr to monitor bat activity research bat life cycles and study white nose syndrome wns in and around portions of our
underground mines wns is a fungal disease which has decimated large populations of bats in the eastern half of the united states

we proudly support efforts to protect bat populations and have protocols in place to mitigate the chance for our operations to
inadvertently spread wns in 2011 we received an award from wisconsin dnr commemorating our efforts to assist the dnrs bat
research we were recognized with the wildlife habitat councils bat conservation action award in 2012




fairmount santrol consistently goes beyond compliance for land management standards by participating in national and state
environmental certiﬁcation programs one such program the wisconsin department of natural resources green tier program
recognizes fairmount santrols robust environmental management system our history of a good environmental record and a
willingness to exceed regulatory requirements we are proud to be the ﬁrst mining company in wisconsin to receive the green tier
certiﬁcation all three of our wisconsin mining facilities have attained this recognition

mining is an energyintensive businesselectricity and natural gas account for nearly 30 percent of the cost to produce a ton of
sand therefore fairmount santrol makes it a priority to manage energy consumption as we seek to do good do well




drying sand and heating sand for resin coating are our two most energyintensive procedures we optimize energy usage
throughout these processes by reusing heat idling machinery and optimizing control strategies on dryers to increase thermal
efﬁciencies

we consume energy throughout other steps of mining and processing sand as well as in our ofﬁce locations fairmount santrol
shares responsibilities for managing energy use among our teams our plant managers track energy use at each of our facilities and
our quest for ecoefﬁciency sd team and engineering group conduct periodic audits to identify future projects companywide our
engineers install energy reduction technologies through facility design these include temperature controls led lighting and
motion sensors for interior lighting




our business beneﬁts when family members incorporate sustainable habits into their daily routines fairmount santrol encourages
our team to conserve energy at work and at home we have a companywide policy that limits unnecessary travel and asks family
members to choose teleconferencing when possible




fairmount santrol has two solar energy installations one in chardon ohio and the other in menomonie wisconsin over the years
these investments have contributed to our sd pays our menomonie array has saved more than 450000 lbs of co2 and 25800
across its lifetime and our chardon array has saved more than 138000 lbs of co2 and 10900

we increased our focus on energy efﬁciency in 2016 some of this occurred naturally with efforts to cut costs in the down market we
moved most of our production to our strategically located lowcost stateofthe art facility in wedron illinois in 2016 wedron was
awarded over 1 million in rebates from ameren power for our purchase of energyefﬁcient motor controls we also implemented
processes to recover sellable sand that had been previously mined at the site this process eliminated the need to consume
stripping and blasting related energy for the recovery of previously mined sands this resulted in a substantial energy and ﬁnancial
savings

many of our 2016 improvements were lowcost projects that required small investments but collectively impacted our energy
performance for example we upgraded equipment at our wedron illinois facility that resulted in hundreds of thousands of sd
pays in the next ﬁve years additional projects include

  automating the dust control sprinklers at our menomonie wisconsin facility

  upgrading the propane system and burners at our voca texas facility

  consolidating the compressor pumps at our wedron illinois location



  education for energy efﬁciency

  our quest for ecoefﬁciency qee sd team supports our family members in
  adopting energysaving habits when our family members practice efﬁciency in their
  daily lives they are more likely to support our energy reduction initiatives in 2016
  the qee team implemented an energy efﬁciency education program to increase
  family member engagement across our facilities the program taught strategies
  such as turning off lights powering down electronic equipment and automating
  thermostat controls these techniques and others can be used at work and home to
  save energy

the communities where we live and work by investing their time talent and treasure




our community investment policy divides our support into four areas of focus the environment health and wellness education and
discretionary funding we use discretionary monies to address speciﬁc needs identiﬁed and supported by our fairmount santrol
family members for example we have a gift matching program that enables family members to request donations for nonproﬁts
of their choice we invest in communities through cash grants inkind donations and corporate volunteer efforts our goal is to
donate 15 percent or more of our annual pretaxpreequity earnings to organizations under the united states internal revenue
services 501c regulations each plant contributes to serving community needs by choosing activities or local organizations to
support

examples of local initiatives our facilities sponsor include

  aiding local schools in a variety of ways including updating their facilities and providing supplies and new technology

  community cleanup days and adoptahighway

  ecosystem improvements such as river cleanups native plant gardens local wildlife habitat protection tree planting and more

  improving parks playgrounds and other public spaces

  supporting emergency services such as local ﬁre departments through ﬁnancial donations and volunteer time

  supporting organizations that help people in need within our communities


fairmount santrols contributions signiﬁcantly impact local communities by improving the health wellness and quality of life for
residents advancing sustainability education among students and local businesses and enabling wildlife to ﬂourish




our corporate community investment committee and site community investment committees at each facility oversee the
meaningful appropriation of funds for donations our community investment policy provides guidelines for contribution requests
matching gifts allocation of investments focus areas product donations eligibility and volunteerism




fairmount santrol provides our family members 40 hours of annual paid volunteer time to give back to their communities also 25
percent of personal volunteer time up to 10 hours is applied towards our corporate goal reﬂecting our emphasis on bringing
sustainable development home family members who complete personal volunteer time can earn a donation from fairmount
santrol to the charity of their choice

on an annual basis our social responsibility sd team engages family members at our facilities with the goal of increasing
volunteer hours our sd coordinators and facility managers collaborate with local communities to identify and organize volunteer
opportunities

product and process technology play a key role in making fairmount santrol a partner of choice for our customers our rd teams
sd teams and family members create innovative industryleading customer solutions we focus our innovation efforts on
developing differentiated products that offer a strong value proposition aligned with our commitment to sd we differentiate
ourselves by reducing water energy and potential pollutants to conserve resources and enable safer product handling




in the oil and gas industry our products are referred to as proppants because they prop fractures open during hydrocarbon
production to allow oil and gas to ﬂow proppant transport or the means to place proppant efﬁciently inside these fractures has
long been an issue for oil and gas companieswhich is why we brought a solution to the market
               
our propel ssp proppant transport technology takes proppant higher and farther into fractures to produce
more oil and gas while using less water fewer additives and providing other operational advantages to our
customers the technology has gained momentum with our customers as they continue to see success from
its use currently we are advancing this proppant technology to deliver the same ﬁeldproven performance
in brackish recycled and produced water instead of fresh water




we offer advanced resincoated proppants which are environmentally safe and provide value for both short and longterm
investment horizons by preventing proppant ﬂowback a common occurrence when fracturing certain formation types operators
can reduce well maintenance increase hydrocarbon production and protect their capital investment

over the longterm operators will enhance hydrocarbon recovery and cut down on well operating expenses
because resincoated proppants provide proppant ﬂowback resistance improved crush resistance and
superior conductivity these beneﬁts all contribute to maximizing the net present value of wells we
continue to pursue greener chemistries for our resincoated proppants for raw sand products we are
focused on maintaining safe air quality levels and enabling ease of handling during the production and end
user phases




our industrial and recreation customers include companies who support foundries glass water ﬁltration building products and
sports and recreation for this segment we innovate to reduce emissions and waste streams both at fairmount santrol and
customer facilities we do this by enhancing our product lines with process efﬁciencies and improved raw material sourcing

consistent with this mission we have developed a more robust resincoated foundry sand with an improved environmental footprint
as compared to traditional resin coated sands we also continue to innovate sandbased products for landscapers contractors and
homeowners to make patio and paver construction projects easier safer and more maintenance free

product and process innovation is critical to meeting everevolving market needs as well as retaining market
leadership in 2012 our business innovation sd team created our stage gate process for managing product
and process enhancement projects family members submit ideas to our online platform which we then
evaluate for potential return on investment for our customers stakeholders and business if selected ideas
move through seven steps that test and validate for potential impact

fairmount santrol provides human and ﬁnancial capital that bring innovative products and processes through to a successful launch
further in 2013 our proppants solutions business implemented a fullblown stage gate process for effectively leading innovation in
the ﬁelds of advanced proppants transport technologies and downhole diverting agents

our moc guidelines outline our disciplined and controlled approach for process changes in product manufacturing and managing
safety health and environmental risks throughout the innovation process




in addition to our dedicated rd teams we are proud of family members increased participation in innovation through our sd
teams our sd teams empower family members to identify ideas that will meet our customers needs drive cost reduction and
efﬁciencies reduce our carbon footprint and differentiate ourselves in the marketplace

the oil and gas market has historically experienced cycles in demand and supply over the last 30 years we have seen and managed
through roughly ﬁve downturns prior to 2015 and 2016 the most recent down cycle was in 2008 and 2009 when oil prices dropped
by approximately 70 percent peak to trough oil prices recovered then dropped again by nearly 65 percent in 2015

monitoring commodity pricing and demand enables us to adjust our strategy when markets ﬂuctuate we manage through down
cycles with strategies that include

  implementing cost reduction initiatives

  driving efﬁciencies throughout the business

managers in implementing quality practices throughout all levels of our business

all plant managers sign and acknowledge our quality policy displayed beside our environmental and safety policies at every facility
furthermore our quality and operations teams have separate reporting relationships to prevent conﬂicts of interest




fairmount santrol conducts quality testing for all our products several times throughout the production processtaking initial
samples from blasting during processing and before loading material for transportation we follow the standards and methods of
iso and astm certiﬁcations as well as the american petroleum institute american foundry society american water works
association and the us department of agriculture we comply with national foundry society nfs best practices at all locations
furthermore we are active in efforts by the american petroleum institute industry committee to deﬁne industrywide test standards
for proppant quality

testing occurs either onsite at each plant at our innovation center ic in ottawa illinois or at our technology center fstc in
sugar land texas each ﬁnal shipment contains a certiﬁcate of analysis coa and a safety data sheet sds that veriﬁes quality and
informs how to safely handle the product

additionally 100 percent of our production facilities undergo regular quality audits our certiﬁed internal auditors conduct
assessments on a regular basis we maintain quality standards that meet requirements set by the american systems registrar the
certifying body for iso 9000 standards

                                            improve sand cleanliness and reduce turbiditythe cloudiness caused by suspended
                                            sand particles this project tracked turbidity levels from the plant to the ﬁeld to
                                            assess whether sand turbidity changes during transportation in 2015 we conducted
                                            a sixweek study to gauge turbidity levels and reached less than 100 ftu of turbidity
                                            well below the industry standard of 250 this year we continued our partnership
                                            through a collaborative study of conductivity based on turbidity we plan to examine
                                            turbidity from raw sand in coming years
